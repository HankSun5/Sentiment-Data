48438238,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=790135,1752793206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/48438238.jpeg,Pundit Warns XRP Investors To Not Make This Grave Mistake This Cycle,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-investors-grave-mistake/,"A powerful message has emerged from a recent episode of the Good Evening Crypto YouTube show that urged XRP holders to rethink their exit strategy ahead of what may be one of the most pivotal crypto cycles yet. Host Abdullah Nassif ‚ÄúAbs‚Äù issued a strong caution against selling XRP by pointing to a combination of regulatory progress and tokenization of real-world assets as signs that the current cycle may just be getting started for the XRP price. The One Rule XRP Holders Must Remember Abs amplified a sentiment shared by a speaker who stressed that XRP holders should not sell, especially not during the coming price spikes. ‚ÄúHold a minimum of 10,000 units in a cold storage,‚Äù the speaker said. ‚ÄúSelling is the worst possible thing you can do to an XRP. If you sell your XRP when the price bumps, you‚Äôre going to cause a problem.‚Äù Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: ‚ÄòXRP Train Has Left The Station ‚Äì Analyst This advice is based on the outlook that XRP is set to benefit from the coming wave of real-world asset tokenization. Abs argued that trillions of dollars are on the verge of flowing into blockchain ecosystems through tokenized assets, with the XRP Ledger expected to capture a significant portion of that activity. ‚ÄúFrom just a few billion today, tokenization is forecasted to grow to $19 trillion by 2030,‚Äù he said. That growth, coupled with XRP‚Äôs central role in facilitating this future, means current holders are sitting on what could become generational wealth if they resist the urge to exit too soon. Throughout the episode, the host and his co-host, ‚ÄúJohnny Crypto,‚Äù outlined a series of catalysts they believe will push the XRP price into a new era. Among them is the ‚ÄúBig Beautiful Bill,‚Äù a $1.6 trillion economic stimulus package that could flood markets with liquidity. According to Abs, this money will drive regular investors into risk-on assets like XRP. He also touched on legal developments, noting the SEC may be nearing a decision to drop its appeal in the ongoing Ripple case. Another positive catalyst is the possible approval of 19 different XRP ETFs that are set to launch around October 18. According to him, when XRP starts registering daily closings above $3.25, the price chart is going to move in ways never seen before. As such, there‚Äôs also the possibility of XRP reaching the double-digit threshold above $10 in 2025. Still, XRP investors should not make the mistake of selling. The Case For Holding Long-Term Interestingly, co-host Johnny Crypto also noted that the most positive catalyst of all is if Fed Chair Jed Powell gets booted and a new Fed Chair comes in that lowers interest rates. ‚ÄúThat means all bets are on for risk-on assets, and crypto will probably be the number one beneficiary,‚Äù he said. Related Reading: XRP Wave 3 Could Repeat 600% Surge From Nov 2025, Target Set For $15 Johnny Crypto also added a personal layer to the discussion by sharing a painful lesson from his past. In 1997, he sold a large amount of Amazon stock he owned far too early, a decision that cost him $52 million in missed gains. This time, he said, the strategy is different. Although he might sell about 30% of his holdings, selling the entire stash is not an option. He mentioned that he‚Äôs considering placing his XRP in a trust or even borrowing against it to maintain long-term exposure. Johnny also issued a broader warning, noting that banks may attempt to take control of crypto assets like XRP from retail holders in the near future. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not that far away,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúProbably in the next one year, we‚Äôll hear about banks costing crypto.‚Äù At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.26.

The company‚Äôs hybrid model‚Äîbitcoin mining, energy sales, and AI-ready modular data pods‚Äîoffers multiple revenue streams, not just future promises. DGXX stock valuation is stretched, with negative margins and high volatility due to retail-heavy ownership, making this a high-risk, high-reward momentum play. Despite big red flags like ongoing losses and crypto dependency, DGXX could explode if it delivers; I‚Äôd treat it like a speculative call option. Introduction The July 17th move in Digi Power X Inc. ( DGXX ) wasn‚Äôt just another microcap spike on vague promises. This time, the company placed an actual purchase order with Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) for Nvidia (NVDA) B200 (Blackwell) systems, which will power their new AI platform called NeoCloud. The stock exploded over 30% in premarket and held on to a solid 7.5% gain by market close. And I think that reaction makes sense, because it‚Äôs not a future promise; it‚Äôs an actual, active move in the right direction. About Digi Power X DGXX is easy to dismiss because it sounds like a buzzword smoothie. It‚Äôs a small-cap stock with crypto exposure, modular pods, energy, and AI. But take a second look, and it starts to get more interesting. They are mining bitcoin, but it‚Äôs not as straightforward as you might think. They‚Äôre setting up Tier 3-level, AI-ready data infrastructure. Portable modular pods (ARMS 200s) that can be deployed without needing to build a hyperscale facility from scratch. That‚Äôs the idea behind their NeoCloud platform. And even before all this AI talk, DGXX was already running a business. They‚Äôve got about 100MW of active capacity spread across three locations, with plans to scale up to 200MW or more. They‚Äôre mining bitcoin, hosting third-party miners, reselling energy, stacking solar credits in New York, and considering battery storage in Buffalo (maybe they are doing more, but this is what I have found). They even have some cash flow from it. Revenue (Seeking Alpha) Super Micro Deal The first time you could hear about Super Micro and Digi Power X relations was back in May, something about their subsidiary working on a GPU rack deployment. At the time, the stock jumped 15% premarket on the news, but it wasn‚Äôt as important because this time it was a definitive order. Nvidia B200s are being installed into their modular pods, and we will most likely see the rollout already in the fourth quarter. This is what changes things. For the first time, it feels like this company is determined to work hard and achieve its goals. The main goal, as you will see in the quote below, is to bring in Tier 3 AI compute. Besides, it‚Äôs a good sign they ordered the best to make it work‚ÄîBlackwell B200s. With Supermicro‚Äôs advanced B200 systems, we are now taking the steps to transition from infrastructure buildout to revenue generation. Our goal is to deliver Tier 3 AI-ready capacity equipped with the world‚Äôs most powerful GPUs for the generative AI era. Crypto and Energy Most of the money comes from crypto and energy. In May, DGXX brought in around $4.3 million from bitcoin mining and energy sales. They mined 35 BTC that month. By the end of June, the total crypto and cash balance jumped 45% in a month to $13.5 million. Q2 energy revenue hit $2.3 million, and they‚Äôre stacking extra value from side projects like a solar site in New York and potential battery integration. These are things most people aren‚Äôt looking at when they glance at the stock, but it‚Äôs good because it means they‚Äôre not depending entirely on one future launch. They‚Äôve already got multiple revenue streams, which, hopefully, will only grow over time. Valuation Look, I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat this; the valuation is way ahead of the fundamentals. P/B close to 5x, P/S around 3x, no earnings, negative margins‚Äîif you‚Äôre looking for a safe entry, this isn‚Äôt it. But sometimes valuation doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story, especially with early-stage companies chasing multiple fast-growing markets. Valuation (Seeking Alpha) The Super Micro deal makes it more interesting because there is an actual deployment scheduled. And there‚Äôs already revenue from bitcoin and from energy. Besides the valuation, I noticed that ownership is mostly in the hands of individual investors (about 67% + almost 14% by individuals/insiders). That kind of ownership structure creates a very specific type of market behavior, like we saw today. Volatility on any sentiment and headline, and not necessarily on fundamentals. Ownership (Seeking Alpha) If you‚Äôve followed enough smallcaps before, you know how this works. When a company with a retail-heavy float announces something big (very much like a deal with Super Micro) or anything with Nvidia‚Äôs name in it, the stock doesn‚Äôt just go up 2‚Äì3%; it can fly 30%. Hello, DGXX, today on the premarket. But it works both ways. That same setup makes the stock fragile. If the company delays a product launch, misses a target, or if the investors get nervous for whatever reason, you‚Äôll see DGXX fall just as fast as it climbed, if not faster. There‚Äôs no cushion of long-term institutional holders who‚Äôd be expected to keep holding. It‚Äôs a news-driven, momentum stock, and that kind of ownership base is like jet fuel when things go right and a wrecking ball when they don‚Äôt. That said, I also looked at their balance sheet , and while it‚Äôs far from perfect, they‚Äôre not buried under debt. There‚Äôs some cash to support near-term operations, and they‚Äôre clearly trying to keep the dilution risk low for now. All of this makes DGXX the kind of stock you have to watch like a hawk, not something you set and forget. But if they deliver a few more solid updates, the upside could be explosive. You just have to know what you're getting into. Capital Structure (Seeking Alpha) Biggest Red Flags They‚Äôre still losing a lot of money, and gross margins are low. Almost every profitability metric is in the red. That‚Äôs not unusual for early-stage data infrastructure or mining companies, but it‚Äôs still a problem. If revenue doesn‚Äôt scale up quickly, they‚Äôll need to raise more cash. And that would almost certainly mean dilution. Profitability (Seeking Alpha) Also, the bitcoin (BTC-USD) side of the business, which is one of the main revenue drivers, depends heavily on BTC prices. If crypto has a rough few quarters, its cash will disappear very fast. Conclusion DGXX is messy. But it‚Äôs the kind of messy that might become something really interesting. The AI dream is on the way, which, I must say, is great. The company has already gone further than most microcap stocks in this space. The crypto and energy business is carrying the company while that happens. And for a company this small, it looks like a solid setup. Now pay attention; it‚Äôs solid, but that does not guarantee the success of any kind. If it makes this whole hybrid AI-crypto-energy thing work, this stock won‚Äôt stay at these levels for long, and as I already said, it has the potential to fly sky-high. So, at this point, the decision is all yours, but if I were investing in it, I would treat it as a call option. Either it surges and makes you rich, or forget about all the money you have put in. Most likely, you won‚Äôt get it back.",SMCI|SMCI:CA|NVDA|NVDA:CA|BTC-USD|DGXX|DGX:CA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|MINING|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-17 23:00:37

As the opening bell rang, investors observed a subtle yet significant divergence across major indices, signaling a day of careful navigation. For those deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these traditional market movements is more crucial than ever, as they often provide a broader context for investor sentiment and capital flows. Understanding Today‚Äôs Market Performance The term ‚Äòmixed opening‚Äô might sound vague, but it precisely describes a scenario where different segments of the market are moving in opposite directions. This isn‚Äôt just a random fluctuation; it often reflects underlying economic currents, sector-specific news, or shifts in investor confidence. Today, the slight variations across the benchmark indices paint a nuanced picture of the current investment landscape. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the initial Market Performance : S&P 500: -0.02% ‚Äì This broad market index, representing 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies, saw a marginal dip. A slight decline here suggests a cautious mood across a wide range of industries, indicating that investors might be taking a wait-and-see approach. NASDAQ: +0.1% ‚Äì In contrast, the technology-heavy NASDAQ Index registered a modest gain. This uptick often points to continued confidence in growth-oriented sectors, particularly tech and innovation, which have been resilient even amidst broader economic uncertainties. Dow: -0.11% ‚Äì The Dow Jones Industrial Average, comprising 30 significant U.S. companies, experienced the largest percentage drop among the three. As a barometer for traditional industrial and financial giants, its decline could suggest concerns about conventional economic sectors or a rotation of capital away from ‚Äòold economy‚Äô stocks. This subtle divergence highlights the varying investor appetite for different asset classes and sectors. While some are pulling back from established industrial names, others are finding opportunities in the tech realm. What‚Äôs Driving This Nuanced Market Performance? A mixed opening is rarely a random event. Several factors could be at play, influencing how different indices respond. These include: Economic Data Releases: Upcoming or recently released economic indicators, such as inflation reports, employment figures, or manufacturing data, can significantly sway market sentiment. Positive data might boost growth stocks, while concerns about inflation could weigh on others. Corporate Earnings: The earnings season often brings volatility. Strong performance from a few major tech companies could buoy the NASDAQ, while weaker outlooks from industrial giants might drag down the Dow. Federal Reserve Policy Expectations: Investors are constantly parsing signals from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates and monetary policy. Any hint of a hawkish or dovish stance can impact borrowing costs and corporate profitability, influencing sector performance. Geopolitical Developments: Global events, from trade tensions to international conflicts, can introduce uncertainty, causing investors to seek safety or reallocate funds based on perceived risks. Sector Rotation: Sometimes, a mixed market indicates a ‚Äòsector rotation,‚Äô where investors move capital from one industry to another based on changing economic forecasts or perceived value. For instance, a move from consumer staples to technology, or vice-versa. The current environment suggests a careful balancing act, with investors weighing the potential for continued economic growth against persistent inflationary pressures and geopolitical risks. The slight gain in the NASDAQ Index , for example, might reflect optimism about AI and technological advancements, while the Dow Jones ‚Äòs dip could signal caution regarding traditional industrial output. How Does This Affect the Broader Investment Landscape? For the average investor, and especially those active in the cryptocurrency markets, understanding these traditional market movements is paramount. While crypto often marches to its own drum, it is not entirely decoupled from the broader financial ecosystem. A cautious or negative sentiment in the traditional US Stock Market can sometimes spill over into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, as investors might de-risk across their entire portfolio. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors In a mixed market, a well-thought-out strategy becomes even more important. Here are some actionable insights: Diversification is Key: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of traditional stocks, bonds, and even a measured allocation to cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate risks during periods of uncertainty. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on economic news, corporate earnings reports, and central bank announcements. These can provide early indicators of market shifts. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term fluctuations are normal. For long-term investors, today‚Äôs minor movements in the S&P 500 or Dow Jones are often just noise. Focus on your long-term financial goals rather than reacting to daily swings. Re-evaluate Risk Tolerance: A mixed market is a good time to reassess your personal risk tolerance. Are you comfortable with the current level of volatility in your portfolio? Adjust as necessary. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: For those investing regularly, dollar-cost averaging can be an effective strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market highs or lows, which can help average out your purchase price over time. The Interplay: Traditional Markets and Crypto While the NASDAQ Index , S&P 500 , and Dow Jones represent the backbone of traditional finance, their performance often sets the stage for broader investor confidence. When traditional markets show resilience, or even subtle gains in growth sectors like tech (as seen with the NASDAQ today), it can foster a more risk-on environment, potentially benefiting cryptocurrencies. Conversely, significant downturns or sustained uncertainty in traditional markets can lead to capital flight from more speculative assets. For crypto enthusiasts, observing the subtle shifts in the US Stock Market provides valuable context. It helps in understanding macro-economic headwinds or tailwinds that might indirectly influence the digital asset space. The correlation isn‚Äôt always direct, but the underlying investor psychology and capital availability are undeniably linked. Looking Ahead: What to Watch For The mixed opening today serves as a reminder that markets are dynamic and constantly adjusting. Investors should closely monitor several key areas in the coming days and weeks: Inflation Data: Any new inflation readings will be critical, as they directly influence central bank policy decisions. Employment Figures: Strong or weak job reports can indicate the health of the economy and consumer spending. Corporate Guidance: Pay attention to forward-looking statements from major companies, as they offer insights into future business conditions. Global Events: Geopolitical stability or instability can quickly shift market sentiment across all asset classes. Conclusion: Navigating the Nuances Today‚Äôs mixed opening in the US Stock Market is a testament to the complex forces at play in the global economy. While the S&P 500 and Dow Jones showed slight declines, the NASDAQ Index managed a modest gain, highlighting a divergence in investor sentiment across different sectors. This nuanced Market Performance underscores the importance of a well-informed and diversified investment strategy. For both traditional and crypto investors, understanding these subtle shifts provides crucial insights into the broader financial landscape, enabling more strategic decision-making in an ever-evolving market.

Imagine a publicly traded company, a titan like Enlightify Inc., making a direct, substantial commitment to a specific crypto asset. This isn‚Äôt just a hypothetical scenario; it‚Äôs the groundbreaking reality announced by the Cyber Foundation (CYBER), revealing Enlightify‚Äôs strategic decision to acquire up to $20 million worth of CYBER tokens over the next year. This bold move isn‚Äôt just news; it‚Äôs a powerful statement about the evolving landscape of digital finance. Unpacking the Significance of the CYBER Token Before delving deeper into the investment, it‚Äôs essential to understand what makes the CYBER token a compelling asset. CYBER is the native token of Cyber, a decentralized social graph protocol that aims to empower users with true ownership of their digital identities and content. In an increasingly digital world, where platforms often control user data, Cyber offers a decentralized alternative, giving power back to the individual. This focus on user-centricity and data ownership resonates deeply with the core principles of Web3. The protocol facilitates the creation of a universal identity layer, allowing users to move their social connections and content across different decentralized applications seamlessly. This utility positions CYBER not just as a speculative asset, but as a foundational component for a more open and equitable internet. Enlightify‚Äôs interest likely stems from this long-term vision and the practical application of the Cyber protocol in the burgeoning decentralized ecosystem. The Landmark Enlightify Investment: What It Means Enlightify Inc. (NYSE: ENFY), a publicly traded entity, has announced its intention to acquire up to $20 million worth of CYBER tokens over the next 12 months. This is a monumental development for several reasons: First-of-its-Kind Commitment: This marks the first time a publicly traded company has explicitly committed a significant portion of its treasury funds directly to CYBER. It sets a precedent for how traditional corporations might engage with specialized crypto assets. Strategic Alignment: The investment follows Enlightify‚Äôs strategic realignment of its subsidiary, Antaeus Tech, to focus specifically on blockchain initiatives. This isn‚Äôt a speculative gamble but a calculated move aligning with their broader technological vision. Long-Term Confidence: The 12-month acquisition window indicates a long-term perspective rather than a short-term trade. It suggests Enlightify sees sustained value and growth potential in the Cyber ecosystem. This Enlightify investment is not merely a financial transaction; it‚Äôs a vote of confidence from the traditional financial world in the utility and future of decentralized protocols. Rising Tide: The Era of Institutional Crypto Adoption For years, cryptocurrency was largely seen as a retail-driven phenomenon, often viewed with skepticism by large financial institutions. However, that narrative has been steadily changing. We are now witnessing a clear and accelerating trend of institutional crypto adoption . This shift is driven by several factors: Maturing Market Infrastructure: The development of regulated custody solutions, derivatives markets, and clearer regulatory frameworks has made crypto more accessible and less risky for institutions. Inflationary Hedges and Diversification: In an era of economic uncertainty, institutions are exploring alternative assets that can offer diversification and potential hedges against traditional market volatility. Technological Innovation: Beyond just Bitcoin, institutions are recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain technology across various sectors, from finance to supply chain management and digital identity. Enlightify‚Äôs move with CYBER is a powerful testament to this growing institutional comfort and strategic engagement with digital assets, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum to more specialized tokens. Why Specialized Blockchain Networks Are Gaining Traction While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain cornerstones of the crypto market, a new wave of interest is focusing on specialized blockchain networks . These networks are designed for specific purposes, offering optimized performance, scalability, and unique functionalities tailored to particular use cases. Cyber, as a decentralized social graph protocol, is a prime example of such a specialized network. Its focus on digital identity and social connections addresses a specific need in the Web3 landscape. Institutions like Enlightify are increasingly looking beyond general-purpose blockchains to invest in protocols that solve real-world problems and have clear application layers. This strategic focus allows them to tap into niche but rapidly growing markets, potentially yielding higher returns and aligning with their core business objectives. Corporate Strategy: Leveraging Crypto Treasury Funds The decision by Enlightify to allocate up to $20 million of its crypto treasury funds to CYBER tokens signifies a major evolution in corporate finance. Traditionally, corporate treasuries are managed conservatively, primarily holding cash, short-term bonds, or other highly liquid assets. However, a growing number of forward-thinking companies are beginning to explore digital assets as part of their treasury management strategy. This can serve multiple purposes: Strategic Investment: Investing in assets that align with the company‚Äôs long-term technological vision or industry focus. Inflation Hedge: Protecting corporate capital from the eroding effects of inflation. Balance Sheet Optimization: Potentially enhancing returns on idle cash reserves. Signaling Innovation: Demonstrating a commitment to cutting-edge technology and future trends. Enlightify‚Äôs move could inspire other publicly traded companies to consider similar allocations, further legitimizing crypto assets within mainstream corporate finance. Benefits and Implications This significant investment carries a multitude of benefits and implications for all stakeholders: For CYBER: Enhanced liquidity, increased market visibility, validation of its underlying technology, and potential for further development and adoption. The capital infusion can fuel innovation within the Cyber ecosystem. For Enlightify: A strategic position in the burgeoning Web3 social identity space, potential for significant returns on investment, and a strengthened reputation as a forward-thinking technology company. For the Crypto Market: Further validation of institutional interest beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, paving the way for more diverse corporate investments in altcoins and specialized protocols. It signals a maturation of the market. For Users: Increased development and adoption of decentralized social graph protocols, potentially leading to better, more private, and user-owned digital experiences. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the news is overwhelmingly positive, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that the crypto market, including specialized tokens like CYBER, remains volatile. Factors such as broader market sentiment, regulatory developments, and project-specific execution risks can influence token performance. Enlightify‚Äôs 12-month acquisition strategy mitigates some of this risk by dollar-cost averaging, but the inherent volatility of digital assets remains a consideration for any institutional or retail investor. Actionable Insights for Investors and Enthusiasts What does Enlightify‚Äôs bold move mean for you? Research is Key: This highlights the importance of researching projects with strong fundamentals and clear utility, not just following hype. CYBER‚Äôs focus on decentralized identity is a compelling use case. Long-Term Vision: Institutional players often have a longer investment horizon. This encourages a similar approach for retail investors looking at projects with significant long-term potential. Diversification: While large-cap cryptos are important, this event underscores the potential in specialized blockchain networks addressing specific industry needs. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on further institutional announcements and how traditional companies integrate blockchain into their core strategies. This development is a strong indicator that the lines between traditional finance and the decentralized world are blurring, creating new opportunities for growth and innovation. Conclusion Enlightify Inc.‚Äôs commitment of $20 million to acquire CYBER tokens is more than just an investment; it‚Äôs a powerful symbol of the accelerating institutional adoption of digital assets and specialized blockchain networks. This landmark move underscores the growing confidence in decentralized technologies and their potential to reshape various industries. As more publicly traded companies follow Enlightify‚Äôs lead, we can expect to see an even greater integration of crypto into mainstream finance, paving the way for a more decentralized and interconnected future.

They will also include introductory guides designed for first-time crypto investors. Shinhan Bank: Crypto Services Debut While the new functions will not yet allow Shinhan customers to buy or sell crypto directly via the SOL app, the move is a significant bullish step for the financial behemoth. Shinhan Financial Group share prices over the past three months. (Source: Naver Finance) No other domestic bank has yet launched a similar service, although some are thought to be working on crypto-related projects. Currently, only five domestic crypto exchanges have obtained the necessary permits to offer KRW-crypto pairings. Banks are not yet allowed to offer crypto exchange services. However, some (including Shinhan) have previously explored the possibility of launching crypto custody services. The new SOL crypto resources include a real-time crypto price monitoring tool, introductory guides and quizzes for beginner investors, and a professional crypto-related reporting and news service. SOL Bank is Shinhan‚Äôs smart banking, financial services, and investment platform. Shinhan launched the app in 2018 when it discontinued several of its standalone apps and announced SOL would be its new unified platform. Inside a branch of Shinhan Bank in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Choi Gwang-mo [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Stepping up Customer Protection Is Key ‚Äì Shinhan The bank said that its new resources would help boost financial consumer protection and help customers better understand how cryptoassets work. Shinhan added that it wants to help customers make information-based investments. It said it hopes to provide easy-to-understand materials for customers who are not familiar with the crypto scene, while also ‚Äúprotecting consumers.‚Äù But the bank has already indicated that it is prepared to go a step further in the near future, by integrating some functions with its crypto exchange partner Korbit. These will eventually allow customers to buy and sell coins on Korbit via the SOL app. Traders will also be able to check their crypto wallet balances from the SOL platform. Stablecoin Progress The media outlet added that Shinhan Bank launched a dedicated digital asset taskforce at the beginning of this year. The taskforce has been charged with developing and launching a range of asset-related businesses. Thus far, it has begun conduction stablecoin-based overseas remittance pilots. It has also been working on a token-powered, cross-border payment settlement project. And Shinhan has also joined the South Korean stablecoin craze , by registering a won-pegged stablecoin trademark application for the KRWSH brand. In May, meanwhile, Korbit announced that it had begun promoting corporate transaction services in conjunction with Shinhan Bank. While South Korean corporations are still not allowed to use their balance sheets to buy crypto, that is set to change later this year. The Financial Services Commission has unveiled a roadmap that will eventually allow bigger South Korean companies to invest in Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens.

48439639,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74696,1752795045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Forecasts Shiba Inu (SHIB) 130% Surge,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-forecasts-shiba-inu-shib-130-surge/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest meme-based cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is showing signs of renewed strength following a prolonged period of underperformance. During its recent price recovery, a prominent analyst, known as GehavianGoals, has outlined a bullish outlook for the asset, projecting a potential rally of over 130% from its current value. Market Performance and Recent Recovery Since reaching a high of $0.0000334 in December 2024, Shiba Inu has declined significantly, dropping as low as $0.00001004 by June 2025, a correction of approximately 69%. This decline occurred even as Bitcoin recorded multiple all-time highs, underscoring a divergence in momentum between the two assets during the same timeframe. However, SHIB has recently begun reversing its downward trend. The token has appreciated by 14.51% over the past week and gained an additional 1.67% in the last 24 hours, suggesting that investor sentiment is beginning to shift. Despite these gains, SHIB remains 31% below its price at the start of the year. Technical Outlook and Support Levels In his recent analysis, GehavianGoals noted that Shiba Inu is showing signs of maintaining its upward trajectory. He identified key support levels where the asset has repeatedly rebounded, describing these areas as strong demand zones. SHIB has tested this zone several times throughout 2024 and 2025, with each test resulting in price rejections and a move higher. The most recent retests of the $0.000011 support zone occurred on February 3, March 11, April 7, and June 22. These consistent rejections of lower price levels reinforce the area‚Äôs importance as a base for potential rallies. Historically, Shiba Inu has surged significantly from this level, most notably in early 2024 when it climbed to a high of $0.00004567 before facing resistance and pulling back. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Entry Points and Price Targets The analyst shared specific buy zones to consider, with the first identified at $0.00001092, a level that SHIB has already surpassed. Another entry point is projected around $0.0000188, which is approximately 31% above the current price level. GehavianGoals has set a target of $0.00003352, representing a 130% increase from current market prices. If calculated from his initial entry at $0.00001092, the potential upside rises to 206%. While he did not offer a specific timeframe for reaching this target, he emphasized that he is prepared to hold his position for up to two years if necessary. The analyst‚Äôs bullish stance aligns with broader market sentiment within the SHIB community. Several observers believe that Shiba Inu could revisit higher price ranges if it overcomes resistance levels tied to high-volume trading clusters. A recent study also supported the view that SHIB could reclaim the $0.000035 price region under favourable technical conditions. Despite past volatility, analysts and investors are increasingly optimistic about Shiba Inu‚Äôs medium to long-term prospects , and recent technical signals suggest momentum may be returning to the asset.

If so, then the latest announcement from Binance Alpha should definitely grab your attention! This innovative platform, a key component within the broader Binance ecosystem, has just added Caldera (ERA) to its exclusive roster of early-stage crypto projects. This move isn‚Äôt just another listing; it signals a significant step in making cutting-edge blockchain innovation more accessible to a wider audience, directly through the powerful Binance Wallet. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does It Matter? Binance Alpha serves as a curated launchpad for promising, nascent cryptocurrency projects. Think of it as a specialized incubator within the massive Binance universe, designed to spotlight tokens that are still in their foundational stages but show immense potential. The platform‚Äôs selection process is rigorous, focusing heavily on two critical factors: robust community engagement and alignment with emerging market trends. This strategic approach ensures that only projects with genuine traction and relevance are showcased, offering users a unique opportunity to get involved early. For projects, being featured on Binance Alpha means unparalleled exposure and access to Binance‚Äôs vast user base. For users, it provides a vetted gateway to discover and participate in groundbreaking innovations before they hit mainstream exchanges. It‚Äôs a win-win, fostering growth for new ventures while offering exciting investment avenues for the community. Unpacking Caldera ERA : The New Kid on the Block The latest addition to the Binance Alpha family is Caldera ERA . While specific details about Caldera (ERA)‚Äôs underlying technology and use cases are still emerging, its listing on such a selective platform speaks volumes about its perceived value and potential impact. Typically, projects selected by Binance Alpha are at the forefront of innovation, addressing critical needs within the blockchain space, whether it‚Äôs enhancing scalability, improving decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure, or pioneering new applications in areas like gaming or NFTs. The inclusion of Caldera (ERA) suggests that it has demonstrated strong fundamentals, a dedicated community, and a clear vision for its role in the evolving crypto landscape. As with all early-stage projects, due diligence is paramount, but the Binance Alpha stamp of approval offers a level of confidence that can be hard to find elsewhere in the often-volatile world of new token launches. The Power of Early-Stage Crypto : Opportunities and Risks Investing in early-stage crypto projects can be incredibly exciting, offering the potential for exponential returns that are rarely seen in traditional markets. Imagine getting in on Bitcoin or Ethereum when they were just starting out! Binance Alpha aims to replicate this opportunity by identifying projects with similar transformative potential. However, it‚Äôs crucial to approach these opportunities with a clear understanding of the inherent risks. High Growth Potential: Early-stage projects can experience rapid appreciation if their technology gains adoption or their community expands significantly. Lower Entry Barriers: Often, initial investments can be relatively small, allowing more participants to get involved. Direct Impact: Users can often contribute to the project‚Äôs development or governance, feeling more connected to its success. On the flip side, early-stage ventures are inherently more volatile and carry higher risks. Project failure, technological setbacks, market manipulation, or regulatory changes can all lead to substantial losses. Therefore, a balanced approach that includes thorough research and risk management is always advisable. How Binance Wallet Facilitates Seamless Trading? One of the most significant advantages of Binance Alpha‚Äôs integration is its direct link with the Binance Wallet and the broader Binance Exchange. This seamless integration simplifies the entire process of acquiring and managing these early-stage tokens. For many new projects, accessing their tokens can involve navigating complex decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or obscure trading pairs. Binance Alpha removes these barriers, making it as straightforward as possible for users to participate. The Binance Wallet offers a secure and user-friendly interface for managing your digital assets. Its integration with Alpha means you can discover, trade, and hold new tokens like Caldera (ERA) within an environment you‚Äôre already familiar with and trust. This reduces the technical hurdles for new users and enhances the overall user experience, making participation in promising projects more accessible than ever before. Navigating On-Chain Trading : What You Need to Know The announcement specifically highlights that Binance Alpha facilitates on-chain trading . This is a crucial distinction from traditional centralized exchange trading. On-chain trading means that transactions are executed directly on the blockchain network, recorded transparently and immutably. This method offers several benefits: Transparency: All transactions are verifiable on the public ledger, increasing trust and accountability. Decentralization: While facilitated by Binance, the underlying trades are processed on the blockchain, reducing reliance on a single intermediary for execution. Direct Ownership: When you engage in on-chain trading, you typically have direct control over your assets in your wallet, rather than them being held by the exchange. By integrating on-chain trading directly into the Binance Wallet and Exchange, Binance Alpha is bridging the gap between centralized convenience and decentralized principles. This hybrid approach offers users the best of both worlds: the ease of use and liquidity of a major exchange, combined with the transparency and self-custody aspects of blockchain technology. It empowers users to engage with new projects like Caldera (ERA) in a way that aligns with the core ethos of Web3. The Synergistic Impact and Future Outlook The addition of Caldera (ERA) to Binance Alpha, with its deep integration into the Binance Wallet and emphasis on on-chain trading, creates a powerful synergy. It reinforces Binance‚Äôs commitment to fostering innovation and supporting the next generation of blockchain projects. For crypto enthusiasts, this means a new avenue for discovery and participation in what could become significant players in the market. This development underscores a broader trend in the crypto space: the increasing demand for streamlined access to promising new projects. As the ecosystem matures, platforms like Binance Alpha will play a pivotal role in democratizing access to early-stage investment opportunities, making the journey from nascent idea to widespread adoption smoother for innovative teams. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Crypto Discovery The listing of Caldera (ERA) on Binance Alpha is more than just a news item; it‚Äôs a testament to the ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights Binance‚Äôs dedication to curating high-potential early-stage crypto projects and making them accessible through the robust Binance Wallet, leveraging the power of on-chain trading. For anyone looking to stay ahead of the curve in the fast-paced world of digital assets, keeping a close eye on Binance Alpha‚Äôs listings, and understanding the implications of on-chain trading, will be crucial.

Elizabeth Warren has called for more scrutiny of the booming private-credit market. On Thursday, she sent letters to S&P Global Ratings, Moody‚Äôs Ratings, and Fitch Ratings, asking for information about how they score the riskiness of private-credit products. In her letter to the ratings agencies, Warren said that overly optimistic credit ratings contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. She asked the companies for details on how they manage potential conflicts of interest and whether their methodology for assessing private-credit products differs from how they assess other products. Warren reaches out to the Treasury Secretary The Trump administration will likely give the industry more fuel by making it easier for regular people to invest in it. For example, an executive order may help make private assets more accessible to 401(k) retirement plans. Warren also wrote a different letter on Thursday asking Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to look into the size of the private credit market and how it could affect the financial stability of the US economy. Sen. Warren is pressing for clarity on the private credit market. Asking Treasury Sec. Bessent to assess its size and stability risks, while also requesting S&P, Moody‚Äôs, and Fitch explain how they rate private-credit product risk. pic.twitter.com/8VM3AXERaF ‚Äî StockStorm (@StockStormX) July 17, 2025 She said a government assessment from last year talked about the possible vulnerabilities in the private-credit market, such as its lack of transparency and developing ties to banks and other institutions. JPMorgan says private-credit is risky The private-credit market is growing quickly, which is hurting banks‚Äô more regulated lending businesses. The amount of money obtained to lend to private-equity-backed enterprises. It makes up the largest market component, and has gone up more than 100 times since 2006, reaching about $700 billion in 2024. JPMorgan and some of its competitors have lost revenue as their new, unregulated competitors have grown. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has said that the private-credit market is similar to the mortgage market before the 2008 financial crisis. ‚ÄúParts of direct lending are good,‚Äù Dimon said at the event. ‚ÄúBut not everyone does a great job, and that‚Äôs what causes problems with financial products.‚Äù So far, Dimon has dedicated $50 billion in the investment bank‚Äôs capital towards providing debt financing for clients doing acquisitions and other deals, effectively starting a private credit operation inside JPMorgan. In addition, some investors have voiced concerns about how private-credit products are rated, observing that the firms that package loans to back securities like collateralized debt obligations can choose their rating provider. However, according to Paul Atkins, SEC chairman, Private funds have grown dramatically in the last decade to $30.8 trillion from $11.6 trillion. ‚ÄúAllowing this option could increase investment opportunities for retail investors seeking to diversify their investment allocation in line with their investment time horizon and risk tolerance,‚Äù he said at the conference in Washington. A new strategy of extending credit originated independently The Big Guys in the private credit industry, like Apollo, Ares, and KKR, are using a very unique strategy. They give out credit that they create themselves. It is frequently backed by high-earning assets like rail carriages and data centers, which keep debtors locked in for many years. In exchange for tying up that money for nearly a decade, the borrowers are willing to pay a lot more in interest than if they had to get the money from a network bank. This is because of the long, expensive syndication process that required securing ratings from S&P and Fitch, facing tough covenants, and oftentimes enduring long waits for the funding. Also, those loans, based on their credit quality, are the equivalent of investment grade bonds, because of the ‚Äúilliquidity premium,‚Äù they merit higher rates.

One such groundbreaking announcement comes from BTC Digital (NASDAQ: BTCT), a name previously synonymous with Bitcoin. The company has now declared a monumental Ethereum shift , signaling a profound strategic reorientation that will see it move away from its Bitcoin-centric operations to fully embrace the vibrant and versatile Ethereum ecosystem. The Strategic Rationale: Why This Revolutionary Ethereum Shift? BTC Digital ‚Äòs decision to undergo a complete Ethereum shift is far more than a simple asset reallocation; it‚Äôs a fundamental re-alignment of its core business strategy. For years, Bitcoin has been celebrated as ‚Äòdigital gold,‚Äô a premier store of value and a foundational cryptocurrency. However, the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, the rapidly expanding landscape of real-world assets (RWA) on-chain, and the lucrative potential of staking demand a more versatile, programmable blockchain. Ethereum, with its robust smart contract capabilities, extensive developer community, and the recent transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), offers precisely that. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and a store of value, Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications (dApps). This distinction is crucial for a company like BTC Digital, which seeks to engage actively in complex financial protocols and asset tokenization rather than just holding a digital commodity. Ethereum‚Äôs programmability allows for the creation of intricate financial instruments, automated agreements, and new forms of digital ownership, making it the ideal foundation for their ambitious new ventures. Furthermore, Ethereum‚Äôs PoS consensus mechanism, implemented with ‚ÄòThe Merge,‚Äô has paved the way for attractive staking yields, offering a new, sustainable revenue stream that was not inherently available with Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof-of-Work (PoW) model without significant energy consumption for mining. This economic incentive, combined with Ethereum‚Äôs network effects and ongoing scalability improvements (like Layer 2 solutions), makes it a compelling choice for forward-thinking crypto enterprises. BTC Digital‚Äôs Ambitious Vision: From BTC to ETH Dominance This bold move by BTC Digital involves a complete conversion of its existing Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum. As reported by Stock Titan, the company aims to significantly grow its ETH reserves, targeting tens of millions of dollars by year-end. This substantial financial commitment, backed by $6 million in recent funding, underscores the seriousness and scale of their strategic reorientation. It‚Äôs a clear statement of confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term potential and its central role in the future of decentralized finance. The transition signifies a shift from a capital-intensive mining operation, which often faces volatile energy costs and hardware depreciation, to an asset management and yield-generation model. By holding and deploying significant amounts of ETH, BTC Digital positions itself to participate directly in the network‚Äôs security and economic activity, rather than merely validating transactions through mining rigs. This pivot also implies a more diversified approach to revenue generation, moving beyond block rewards to encompass staking yields, DeFi protocol fees, and potential earnings from RWA initiatives. To better illustrate this profound transformation, consider the following comparison: Aspect Previous Strategy (Bitcoin-centric) New Strategy (Ethereum-driven) Primary Asset Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Core Activity Mining Operations Staking, DeFi, RWA Initiatives Ecosystem Focus Store of Value, Transaction Processing Programmable Money, Smart Contracts, Decentralized Applications Revenue Streams Block Rewards, Transaction Fees (from mining) Staking Yields, DeFi Protocol Fees, RWA Tokenization & Yields Operational Overhead High (energy, hardware, maintenance) Lower (primarily digital asset management) Harnessing Passive Income: The Power of ETH Staking A cornerstone of BTC Digital ‚Äòs new strategy is a deep dive into ETH staking . With Ethereum‚Äôs successful transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), staking has become a crucial mechanism for securing the network while simultaneously offering participants a passive income stream. By staking their substantial ETH holdings, BTC Digital aims to generate consistent yields, thereby diversifying its revenue streams beyond traditional mining operations. Staking involves locking up ETH to support the network‚Äôs operations, including validating transactions and proposing new blocks. In return, stakers receive rewards in ETH. This mechanism not only contributes to the security and decentralization of the Ethereum blockchain but also provides an attractive yield for institutional holders. For BTC Digital, this means: Consistent Yield Generation: Unlike the unpredictable nature of mining rewards, staking offers a more predictable, ongoing return on their ETH holdings. Participation in Network Security: By staking, BTC Digital directly contributes to the robustness and integrity of the Ethereum network, aligning its financial interests with the health of the ecosystem. Capital Efficiency: Staking allows the company to earn revenue on its assets without needing to sell them, preserving their underlying value and potential for appreciation. Flexibility: While direct solo staking requires 32 ETH per validator and technical expertise, options like liquid staking protocols (e.g., Lido, Rocket Pool) or centralized exchange staking services offer more flexibility and liquidity, which BTC Digital could leverage for managing their large ETH reserves. The move into ETH staking signifies a mature approach to crypto asset management, focusing on sustainable, yield-bearing strategies that leverage the fundamental economics of the underlying blockchain. Exploring the Frontier: BTC Digital‚Äôs Foray into DeFi Crypto Beyond staking, BTC Digital is poised to become a significant player in the broader DeFi crypto ecosystem. Decentralized Finance represents a paradigm shift in financial services, offering permissionless access to a wide array of tools from lending and borrowing to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and yield farming. It‚Äôs an open, transparent, and globally accessible financial system built on blockchain technology, primarily Ethereum. The company‚Äôs focus on DeFi initiatives will likely involve strategically deploying their ETH into various protocols to maximize returns and contribute to the liquidity of the decentralized economy. This could include: Lending and Borrowing Protocols: Providing ETH as collateral to earn interest or borrowing against their assets to maintain liquidity for other operations (e.g., Aave, Compound). Liquidity Provision on DEXs: Supplying ETH and other tokens to decentralized exchanges (e.g., Uniswap, Curve) to earn trading fees, thereby facilitating decentralized trading. Yield Farming: Participating in complex strategies that involve moving assets between different DeFi protocols to maximize returns, often through the accumulation of governance tokens. Engaging with DeFi, however, comes with its own set of risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities, impermanent loss in liquidity pools, and significant market volatility. BTC Digital will need robust risk management frameworks and a deep understanding of the protocols they interact with to navigate this innovative yet complex landscape successfully. Bridging Worlds: Unlocking Value with Real-World Assets (RWA) on Ethereum Perhaps the most forward-looking and potentially transformative aspect of BTC Digital ‚Äòs new direction is its foray into real-world assets (RWA). RWA tokenization involves bringing tangible and intangible assets from the traditional financial world onto the blockchain, transforming them into digital tokens that can be traded, lent, or used as collateral in DeFi protocols. This represents a monumental step in bridging the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Imagine the possibilities: Tokenized Real Estate: Fractional ownership of properties, making real estate investment more accessible and liquid. Commodities: Digital representations of gold, silver, or agricultural products. Financial Instruments: Tokenized bonds, equities, or even carbon credits, allowing for their seamless integration into blockchain-based financial systems. Intellectual Property: Tokenizing patents, copyrights, or music royalties for new forms of ownership and distribution. By focusing on RWA, BTC Digital is positioning itself at the forefront of a movement that could unlock vast new markets and investment opportunities. This initiative requires navigating complex legal and regulatory frameworks to ensure the enforceability and legitimacy of the tokenized assets. Success in this area could significantly expand the utility and reach of the Ethereum ecosystem, attracting traditional investors and capital into the decentralized space. Challenges and Considerations for This Bold Move While BTC Digital ‚Äòs strategic pivot presents immense opportunities, it also comes with its share of challenges. The crypto market remains highly volatile, and Ethereum, despite its robust ecosystem, is not immune to price fluctuations. A significant downturn in ETH‚Äôs value could impact the company‚Äôs reserves and the profitability of its staking and DeFi activities. Regulatory clarity around DeFi and RWA is still evolving globally. Different jurisdictions have varying stances on digital assets, and new regulations could emerge that impact how companies like BTC Digital operate. Compliance and legal adherence will be critical to their long-term success. Furthermore, engaging with DeFi protocols carries inherent technical risks, such as smart contract bugs, hacks, and flash loan attacks. While the Ethereum network itself is highly secure, individual dApps and protocols can have vulnerabilities. BTC Digital will need to implement stringent security measures and conduct thorough due diligence on any platforms they integrate with. Finally, the execution of such a large-scale strategic shift, including the conversion of tens of millions of dollars from BTC to ETH, requires careful planning and flawless execution to minimize market impact and ensure asset security. Broader Implications for the Crypto Industry BTC Digital ‚Äòs bold Ethereum shift is more than just a company‚Äôs change of heart; it could set a powerful precedent for the broader cryptocurrency industry. This move signals a growing recognition among institutional players of Ethereum‚Äôs unparalleled utility as a platform for innovation, beyond just a digital currency. It validates the increasing importance of programmable blockchains for advanced financial applications and could encourage other Bitcoin-centric companies or traditional financial institutions to explore similar multi-asset or Ethereum-focused strategies. As more capital and talent flow into the Ethereum ecosystem, it reinforces its position as the leading smart contract platform, accelerating the maturation and mainstream adoption of decentralized finance and tokenized real-world assets . This strategic pivot highlights the evolving landscape of digital asset investment, moving beyond simple asset accumulation to active participation in decentralized economies and the creation of new financial paradigms. Conclusion BTC Digital ‚Äòs comprehensive Ethereum shift marks a significant moment in the institutional adoption of blockchain technology. By fully embracing ETH staking , diving into the innovative world of DeFi crypto , and pioneering in real-world assets , the company is not just changing its portfolio; it‚Äôs redefining its very identity and role within the digital economy. This bold move could serve as a blueprint for other crypto-native companies looking to evolve beyond single-asset strategies and tap into the multifaceted potential of programmable blockchains. The journey ahead will undoubtedly have its complexities, but BTC Digital‚Äôs vision positions it as a key player in shaping the future of decentralized finance and beyond.

Prepare for a major one: BSTR Holdings has just completed a monumental merger agreement with Cantor Equity Partners I (CEPO), a move poised to reshape the institutional crypto investment space. This isn‚Äôt just another corporate handshake; it‚Äôs the birth of a formidable new player, set to become one of the largest public holders of Bitcoin globally. What Does the BSTR Merger Mean for the Crypto World? The finalization of the merger agreement between BSTR Holdings and Cantor Equity Partners I (CEPO) marks a pivotal moment for both entities and the broader digital asset ecosystem. This strategic alliance isn‚Äôt merely a corporate restructuring; it‚Äôs a bold declaration of intent from traditional finance to deeply engage with the cryptocurrency market. The newly combined company, set to trade under the ticker ‚ÄúBSTR,‚Äù is designed to leverage the strengths of both parties: BSTR‚Äôs vision for Bitcoin-native financial products and Cantor Equity Partners‚Äô extensive experience in capital markets and institutional reach. For years, the crypto space has yearned for greater institutional adoption. This merger serves as a powerful testament to that growing trend. It signifies that major players in traditional finance are not just observing but actively participating in shaping the future of digital assets. The combined entity aims to bridge the gap between conventional investment vehicles and the innovative potential of Bitcoin, paving the way for more sophisticated financial products and broader market access. How Will BSTR‚Äôs Bitcoin Treasury Impact the Market? One of the most striking aspects of this merger is the immediate establishment of BSTR as a significant holder of Bitcoin. With a formidable 30,021 Bitcoin (BTC) in its treasury, BSTR is poised to become the fourth-largest public Bitcoin treasury globally. This is a staggering amount that places it in an elite league alongside established names like MicroStrategy. But what does this mean for the market? Increased Institutional Demand: A large, publicly traded company holding such a substantial amount of BTC signals strong institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a strategic asset. This could encourage other corporations and institutional investors to follow suit, potentially driving further demand. Market Stability: Large, stable holders like BSTR can contribute to market stability by reducing the available supply in circulation, which might lessen volatility compared to speculative trading. Benchmarking: BSTR‚Äôs performance and strategic decisions regarding its Bitcoin treasury will likely be closely watched by analysts and investors, potentially setting new benchmarks for corporate Bitcoin adoption strategies. This substantial Bitcoin treasury is not just a static holding; it forms the very foundation upon which BSTR plans to build its future endeavors, particularly its ambitious plans for crypto investment products. The Strategic Alliance: Why Cantor Equity Partners is a Game Changer The involvement of Cantor Equity Partners I (CEPO) is a critical component of this merger‚Äôs significance. Cantor Fitzgerald, its parent company, is a venerable name in financial services, with a history spanning nearly a century. Their expertise in investment banking, prime brokerage, and capital markets brings a level of legitimacy and operational sophistication that is invaluable for a crypto-focused entity. This alliance offers several key advantages: Credibility and Trust: Cantor‚Äôs established reputation can help instill greater confidence among institutional investors who might still be hesitant about the nascent crypto market. Access to Capital: Their network and experience are crucial for facilitating the massive PIPE financing BSTR is undertaking, ensuring the capital needed for growth and further Bitcoin acquisition. Regulatory Navigation: Traditional finance firms often possess a deeper understanding of complex regulatory landscapes, which is vital for navigating the evolving rules governing digital assets. Product Development Expertise: Cantor‚Äôs experience in developing and distributing a wide range of financial products will be instrumental in BSTR‚Äôs creation of BTC-native capital market offerings. This partnership exemplifies a growing trend where traditional financial giants are not just observing the crypto space but actively integrating it into their core strategies, acknowledging Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring presence and potential. Unlocking Growth: The Power of $1.5 Billion in PIPE Financing Beyond its initial Bitcoin holdings, BSTR‚Äôs strategy includes raising up to $1.5 billion in Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) financing. This substantial capital injection is designed to serve two primary purposes, both critical to BSTR‚Äôs long-term vision: Acquiring More BTC: A significant portion of the PIPE financing will be allocated towards acquiring additional Bitcoin. This commitment underscores BSTR‚Äôs belief in Bitcoin as a core asset and its strategy to continually expand its treasury. Such ongoing accumulation could have a sustained positive impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs market dynamics by absorbing supply. Building BTC-Native Capital-Market Products: This is perhaps the most forward-looking aspect of BSTR‚Äôs plan. The financing will fuel the development of innovative financial products built directly on or around Bitcoin. This moves beyond simply holding Bitcoin to actively creating a sophisticated ecosystem for its utilization in capital markets. PIPE financing is a common method for public companies to raise capital quickly from institutional investors. Its scale here demonstrates significant investor confidence in BSTR‚Äôs business model and its potential to become a leader in the institutional crypto space. This financial backing provides BSTR with immense flexibility and firepower to execute its ambitious growth plans. Beyond Holdings: BSTR‚Äôs Vision for Crypto Investment Products The promise of building ‚ÄúBTC-native capital-market products‚Äù is where BSTR truly aims to innovate and distinguish itself. This phrase suggests a move beyond simple spot trading or custodial services, delving into more complex financial instruments that leverage Bitcoin‚Äôs unique properties. While specific products are yet to be detailed, we can speculate on potential offerings that could revolutionize crypto investment: Bitcoin-Backed Lending and Borrowing: Creating platforms where institutions can lend out their BTC for yield or borrow against their holdings, increasing capital efficiency. Structured Products: Developing complex financial instruments that offer tailored risk-reward profiles based on Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements, potentially attracting a wider range of institutional investors. Derivatives and Hedging Tools: Offering sophisticated futures, options, or other derivatives that allow institutions to hedge their Bitcoin exposure or speculate on its price in a regulated environment. Yield-Generating Strategies: Exploring ways to generate returns on Bitcoin holdings beyond simple appreciation, such as through staking (if applicable to future BTC upgrades) or other DeFi-like mechanisms adapted for institutional use. These types of products could significantly deepen the institutional liquidity and sophistication of the Bitcoin market. By creating these tools, BSTR aims to make Bitcoin a more versatile and accessible asset for large-scale investors, moving it further into the mainstream of global finance. The Road Ahead for BSTR The merger of BSTR Holdings and Cantor Equity Partners I is more than just a headline; it‚Äôs a blueprint for the future of institutional crypto investment. With a massive Bitcoin treasury, substantial PIPE financing, and the strategic backing of a traditional finance giant, BSTR is uniquely positioned to become a dominant force. While challenges such as market volatility and evolving regulations persist, the commitment to building BTC-native capital market products signals a long-term vision for integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance. This development is a clear indicator that the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world are blurring rapidly. As BSTR begins trading under its new ticker, the financial world will be watching closely to see how this ambitious venture unfolds and what new opportunities it unlocks for investors and the broader digital asset landscape.

According to Squire, investors selling their XRP holdings today may be prematurely exiting a position with significant future upside, similar to those who sold Apple stock just before its transformation into a global tech giant. Squire‚Äôs remarks come at a time of growing optimism around XRP. The token has recently rebounded strongly, climbing back above the critical $3 resistance level twice in the past week. XRP is also up 49% in the last month, indicating a possible shift in market momentum. While some traders may see this as an opportunity to secure short-term profits, others are advocating for a longer-term investment approach. Historical Context: Apple‚Äôs Growth After the iPhone To support his comparison, Squire refers to Apple‚Äôs performance after its landmark product launch. The iPhone was officially introduced in January 2007, marking a pivotal point for the company. Before this, Apple‚Äôs stock had moved slowly over the years, trading between $0.06 and $1 from 1981 through the late 1990s, and reaching around $3 by 2007. Selling $XRP now is like selling Apple before the iPhone. ‚Äî John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) July 16, 2025 However, in the years following the iPhone‚Äôs debut, Apple‚Äôs stock saw exponential growth. By December 2024, it had reached a peak of $260. At its current value of approximately $210, the stock has appreciated by over 6,800% from its pre-iPhone level of $3. When compared to the 2024 peak, the increase is even more dramatic, amounting to roughly 8,566%. Could XRP Experience a Similar Upsurge? Squire and other XRP supporters suggest the token may now be in a similar position to Apple in the early 2000s. If XRP were to replicate Apple‚Äôs growth pattern from the $3 level, it could hypothetically rise to prices exceeding $200. While such projections are speculative, they reflect the high expectations held by a significant portion of the community. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Several developments are fueling this sentiment. These include growing speculation around the approval of multiple spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as discussions about XRP‚Äôs potential role in national digital asset strategies. Some analysts have also suggested that companies may adopt XRP as a treasury reserve, akin to how certain firms have adopted Bitcoin. Adding to the bullish narrative, the resolution of Ripple‚Äôs legal battle with the SEC has eliminated a major source of uncertainty. With regulatory clarity improving and utility-focused adoption on the rise, proponents believe XRP‚Äôs long-term value proposition is becoming more compelling. Although critics caution against overly optimistic forecasts, especially regarding extreme price targets, the overall shift in market tone suggests that many are now reassessing the long-term potential of XRP.

A recent report from K33 sheds crucial light on these shifting dynamics, revealing a significant surge in Bitcoin treasuries held by public companies and a remarkable expansion in the overall stablecoin supply . This isn‚Äôt just a fleeting trend; it signals a profound evolution in how institutions and individuals perceive and utilize digital assets. Why Are Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries Exploding? According to the K33 report, public companies made a colossal move in H1 2025, adding nearly 245,000 BTC to their balance sheets. This isn‚Äôt merely an increase in volume; the number of firms embracing Bitcoin as a treasury asset nearly doubled, soaring from 70 to 134 across 27 countries. The United States, predictably, leads this charge, demonstrating a growing conviction among corporate giants in the long-term value proposition of the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency. But why are companies making such a bold shift? Several factors are at play: Inflation Hedge: In an era of persistent inflationary concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital gold, offering a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Balance Sheet Diversification: Forward-thinking companies are looking beyond traditional assets to diversify their treasury holdings, recognizing Bitcoin‚Äôs uncorrelated nature to conventional markets. Institutional Adoption: As more large institutions, payment processors, and investment funds embrace Bitcoin, the perceived risk decreases, making it more palatable for corporate treasuries. Future-Proofing: Holding Bitcoin can be seen as a strategic move to align with the future of finance, positioning companies at the forefront of digital innovation. This surge in Bitcoin treasuries underscores a maturing market where institutional confidence is not just a buzzword, but a tangible reality shaping corporate financial strategies globally. The Stablecoin Supply Surge: A Pillar of Crypto Stability? While Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional embrace captures headlines, the quiet but relentless growth of the stablecoin supply is equally significant. The K33 report highlights an impressive $38 billion increase in stablecoin supply during H1 2025. These digital assets, pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, play a pivotal role in the broader crypto ecosystem. Stablecoins serve multiple critical functions: Trading Pairs: They are the primary trading pairs for most cryptocurrencies, facilitating seamless and efficient transactions across exchanges without the need to convert back to fiat. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Stablecoins are the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, enabling lending, borrowing, and yield farming activities with reduced volatility risk. Remittances and Payments: Their stability and speed make them attractive for cross-border payments and remittances, offering a cheaper and faster alternative to traditional banking rails. Safe Haven: During periods of market volatility, traders often convert their volatile crypto assets into stablecoins, using them as a temporary safe haven. The consistent expansion of the stablecoin supply signals robust activity within the crypto economy, reflecting increased liquidity and utility across various applications. It suggests a growing comfort level with digital dollars as a medium of exchange and value storage. Altcoin Performance: A Clear Sign of Crypto Market Dominance In stark contrast to the bullish narratives surrounding Bitcoin and stablecoins, the K33 report reveals a challenging period for most altcoins. Out of the top 50 alternative cryptocurrencies, a mere nine managed to post gains in H1 2025. This divergence paints a clear picture of the prevailing crypto market dominance by Bitcoin and the increasing preference for stable, liquid assets. This performance disparity highlights a ‚Äòflight to quality‚Äô phenomenon. When market sentiment becomes cautious, or when major catalysts like institutional adoption are in play, capital tends to consolidate into Bitcoin, perceived as the most secure and established digital asset. Many altcoins, often lacking the same level of liquidity, institutional backing, or proven use cases, struggle to attract investment in such an environment. For investors, this trend underscores the importance of understanding market cycles and the varying risk profiles within the crypto space. While altcoins can offer explosive growth potential, they also carry significantly higher risk, especially when Bitcoin asserts its dominance. What Lies Ahead? The H2 Bitcoin Outlook Despite the mixed performance across the board, the K33 report offers an optimistic perspective on the Bitcoin outlook for the second half of 2025. Historically, H2 has often proven stronger for Bitcoin, and several potential catalysts could fuel further growth: Spot ETF Approvals: Continued progress and potential approvals of new Bitcoin spot ETFs in various jurisdictions could unlock massive institutional capital, providing a fresh wave of demand. Regulatory Clarity: As governments worldwide work towards establishing clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, this increased certainty can attract more traditional investors and corporations. Post-Halving Dynamics: While the halving occurred in 2024, its full impact on supply shock and price discovery often plays out in the subsequent year, influencing the H2 Bitcoin outlook . Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic shifts, interest rate policies, and geopolitical events can continue to drive demand for decentralized, scarce assets like Bitcoin. The report suggests that the groundwork laid in H1 2025, particularly with the surge in Bitcoin treasuries , sets a strong foundation for what could be a compelling second half of the year for the flagship cryptocurrency. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Evolving Crypto Landscape The K33 report provides valuable insights for anyone involved in the crypto market. Here are some actionable takeaways: Focus on Fundamentals: The institutional adoption of Bitcoin and the utility of stablecoins highlight the importance of fundamental strength and real-world use cases. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin and stablecoins dominate, a diversified portfolio can still include carefully selected altcoins with strong technology and active communities, but with a clear understanding of their higher risk profile. Stay Informed on Regulation: Regulatory developments will continue to be a major market driver. Keeping abreast of these changes is crucial for anticipating market shifts. Consider Long-Term Holdings: The increasing corporate adoption of Bitcoin suggests a long-term bullish sentiment that individual investors might consider mirroring for a portion of their portfolio. Conclusion: A Maturing Market Led by Bitcoin and Stability The first half of 2025 has unequivocally demonstrated Bitcoin‚Äôs strengthening position as a legitimate treasury asset for public companies and the indispensable role of stablecoins in facilitating the broader crypto economy. While altcoin performance lagged, this period has solidified Bitcoin‚Äôs crypto market dominance , hinting at a more mature and discerning market. With a promising H2 Bitcoin outlook driven by potential ETF approvals and regulatory clarity, the stage is set for continued evolution and potential growth in the digital asset space. The trends of H1 2025 serve as a powerful reminder of where institutional and individual capital is flowing, shaping the future of finance one digital asset at a time.

Uniswap Eyes $9.20 & Aptos Finds Support,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-expands-rapidly-with-major-sports-team-partnerships-uniswap-eyes-9-20-aptos-finds-support/,"Recent activity across the crypto market is drawing attention as Uniswap (UNI) and Aptos (APT) hold steady amid buyer interest. Uniswap (UNI) price prediction indicates a potential upward push, with the $9.20 mark now in focus after the coin maintained strong support near $8.00. At the same time, Aptos (APT) price today is stabilizing above the $5.00 mark, setting $4.96 as a reliable support zone following active trading sessions. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is heading in a direction that goes beyond chart movements. By forming high-profile partnerships with sports teams like the Seattle Seawolves and Orcas, the project is embedding itself in everyday use cases. This step aims to take blockchain technology into real-world spaces, especially among North American fans, by integrating on-chain ticketing, digital rewards, and NFT functionalities. With more than $341 million already raised and over 24 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is being talked about as one of the best cryptos to buy. Coins in batch 29 are now offered at $0.0016 until August 11, showing how their visibility and real-world use are fueling demand. Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction Focuses on $9.20 Breakout Uniswap (UNI) continues to build momentum following recent upward movement. Market watchers expect the Uniswap (UNI) price prediction to approach the $10 mark, assuming the bullish pressure holds. Current data reflects firm support just above $8.00, while analysts are watching $9.20 closely as a near-term resistance. Previous trading action showed UNI moving from around $7.00 to just above $9.00 before facing a minor pullback. These moves, paired with patterns of higher highs and higher lows on the hourly chart, suggest ongoing buyer interest. Uniswap (UNI) price prediction also factors in a rise in futures open interest, indicating that more traders are willing to bet on future price moves. Still, if prices begin to dip while open interest remains elevated, the market could face forced liquidations. As such, watching these levels closely could provide insight into whether UNI continues this upward trend or faces a stall. Aptos (APT) Price Today Steadies Above Key $4.96 Level Aptos (APT) price today recorded a 4.5% rise over the last 24 hours, buoyed by a volume spike that peaked around 01:00 UTC with trades reaching 1.64 million units, about 29% above the norm. During that hour, prices climbed quickly from $4.97 to $5.06, helping set $4.96 as a new foundation. The coin‚Äôs bullish behavior continued with a surge to a peak of $5.20 by early morning hours. At the time of analysis, Aptos (APT) was hovering near $5.13, reflecting a 3.2% increase and aligning with the broader crypto market‚Äôs 3.6% uptrend. Buyers appear to have held ground near the $5.09 mark, and activity in the $4.91 to $5.20 range showed around 6% volatility, an indicator of a relatively stable short-term structure. BlockDAG Drives Adoption Through Major Sports Team Partnerships BlockDAG has rolled out partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves from Major League Rugby and the Orcas cricket team, aiming to deliver blockchain features in areas where fans can directly benefit. These deals plan to introduce tools like NFT collectibles, digital ticketing, and fan rewards on-chain, bridging blockchain with real-world fan engagement. Unlike general sponsorships, this approach offers fans perks that can be used in practice, helping grow awareness and interaction. With North America being a key market, BlockDAG intends to move beyond just technical hype by demonstrating how blockchain can become part of everyday experiences. These developments are also growing the project‚Äôs active user base and boosting its network utility, potentially improving system robustness and engagement. The presale has already raised over $341 million, with more than 24 billion BDAG coins sold across 29 batches. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. Currently, the price for batch 29 coins is fixed at $0.0016, available until August 11 as part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release campaign. Since the official launch price is set at $0.05, this limited-time entry point hints at a potential ROI of up to 3,025%. For those evaluating the best crypto to buy , BlockDAG‚Äôs clear focus on real adoption and expanding use cases sets it apart. Final Call! While Uniswap (UNI) price prediction remains on track for a possible climb toward $9.20, backed by $8.00 support and active futures positioning, Aptos (APT) price today maintains a strong base above $5.00, with $4.96 firmly holding as a foundation amid high-volume trades. But beyond these price shifts, BlockDAG brings a different approach by locking in real-world relevance through its sports partnerships. Features like ticketing and rewards backed by blockchain offer more than speculative value. With $341 million raised and BDAG coins priced at $0.0016 until August 11, BlockDAG is proving its plan with measurable progress.

Then you‚Äôll want to pay attention to the latest significant move by Numerai, the innovative AI-driven hedge fund. Numerai NMR has just announced a major initiative: a $1 million token buy-back from the public market. This isn‚Äôt just a simple transaction; it‚Äôs a strategic maneuver that speaks volumes about the project‚Äôs confidence and its future trajectory within the dynamic crypto space. What Exactly is the Numerai NMR Token Buy-Back and Why Does it Matter? At its core, a token buy-back is when a company or project repurchases its own tokens from the open market. In this instance, Numerai is committing to buy back $1 million worth of its native NMR token . This action has several potential implications for the token‚Äôs value and the ecosystem at large. Think of it like a traditional stock buyback, but in the decentralized world. Why would Numerai initiate an NMR token buy-back? The reasons behind such a move are often multi-faceted and strategic. Here are some key benefits and motivations: Reducing Circulating Supply: By removing tokens from circulation, the total supply decreases. If demand remains constant or increases, this scarcity can lead to an increase in the token‚Äôs price per unit. Signaling Confidence: A buy-back is a strong signal from the project‚Äôs leadership that they believe their token is undervalued. It demonstrates a commitment to the token‚Äôs long-term value and the health of the ecosystem. This can instill greater trust among existing holders and attract new investors. Returning Value to Holders: While not a direct dividend, a buy-back effectively returns value to token holders by potentially increasing the price of their existing holdings. Supporting Liquidity: In some cases, buy-backs can be used to manage liquidity on exchanges, ensuring a healthy trading environment for the token. Ecosystem Health: For a platform like Numerai, which relies on its token for staking and incentives, a stronger token value can lead to greater participation and a more robust network. The $1 million NMR token buy-back is a substantial amount, especially in the context of Numerai‚Äôs current market capitalization, indicating a significant commitment from the fund. Numerai: The Pioneer AI Hedge Fund Changing the Game To truly appreciate the significance of this buy-back, it‚Äôs essential to understand what Numerai is and how it operates. Numerai isn‚Äôt your typical crypto project; it‚Äôs an American AI hedge fund that uniquely blends data science, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrency. Its core innovation lies in crowdsourcing financial predictions. How does Numerai work? Numerai provides encrypted financial data to a global community of data scientists. These scientists then build machine learning models to predict stock market movements. Crucially, they stake NMR tokens on the accuracy of their predictions. If their models are correct, they earn more NMR; if they‚Äôre wrong, their staked NMR is burned. This mechanism, known as ‚Äòstaking and burning,‚Äô aligns incentives and ensures that only the best models contribute to the hedge fund‚Äôs strategy. Data Anonymity: Data is encrypted, ensuring privacy and preventing data scientists from seeing the underlying assets, which helps prevent insider trading. Collective Intelligence: The fund aggregates predictions from thousands of models, creating a ‚Äòmeta-model‚Äô that is more robust and accurate than any single model. NMR as the Core: The NMR token is integral to this system, serving as the collateral for staking, the reward for accurate predictions, and the penalty for incorrect ones. It powers the entire decentralized data science competition. This innovative approach positions Numerai at the forefront of financial technology, demonstrating a practical, real-world application of blockchain and AI beyond speculative trading. The buy-back reinforces their belief in the value proposition of their unique AI hedge fund model. How This Crypto Buyback Signals Broader Confidence in the Market While the NMR token buy-back directly benefits Numerai and its token holders, its implications extend beyond the project itself. It serves as a positive signal for the broader cryptocurrency market news landscape, especially concerning institutional participation and the maturation of the crypto space. What does it mean for the wider crypto market? Institutional Validation: When an established entity like an AI-driven hedge fund actively invests in its own token through a buy-back, it lends credibility to the underlying asset class. It suggests that even sophisticated financial players see long-term value in digital assets. Precedent for Other Projects: A successful and well-communicated buy-back by Numerai could inspire other legitimate projects to consider similar strategies, particularly those with strong fundamentals and clear utility for their tokens. This could lead to a healthier market overall. Shifting Narrative: Actions like these help shift the narrative around cryptocurrencies from purely speculative ventures to assets with intrinsic value and strategic financial backing. It highlights the utility and economic models underpinning certain tokens. Market Sentiment Boost: In a market often driven by sentiment, news of a significant crypto buyback from a reputable project can foster a more positive outlook, potentially attracting new capital and reducing volatility. This move by Numerai contributes to the ongoing institutionalization of the crypto market, showcasing how traditional financial strategies are being adapted and applied within the digital asset ecosystem. Navigating the Crypto Buyback Landscape: What‚Äôs Next for NMR Holders? For current and prospective Numerai NMR holders, this buy-back announcement presents a moment for reflection and strategic consideration. While buy-backs are generally positive, it‚Äôs important to understand the potential future implications. Actionable Insights for Investors: Monitor Execution: Keep an eye on how the buy-back is executed. Is it a one-time event, or will it be phased? Transparency in the process is key. Long-Term Vision: Consider Numerai‚Äôs long-term roadmap. Does the buy-back align with continued development, user growth, and expansion of their data science competitions? Market Dynamics: While a buy-back can provide upward pressure, the overall cryptocurrency market news and broader economic conditions will still influence NMR‚Äôs price action. Diversification and risk management remain crucial. Community Engagement: Stay informed through Numerai‚Äôs official channels and community discussions to understand ongoing sentiment and future plans. This crypto buyback could be a significant catalyst for NMR, potentially leading to increased investor interest and a stronger foundation for the token‚Äôs value. It underscores Numerai‚Äôs commitment to its community and its unique position in the convergence of AI and finance. A Bold Step Towards a Smarter Future Numerai‚Äôs announcement of a $1 million NMR token buy-back is more than just a financial transaction; it‚Äôs a powerful statement. It signals profound confidence from an innovative AI hedge fund in its own token and its unique decentralized data science model. This strategic move aims to enhance token value, reward its community, and reinforce Numerai‚Äôs position as a leader in the evolving digital asset landscape. As the cryptocurrency market news continues to unfold, actions like these highlight the growing maturity and strategic depth within the space, offering a compelling glimpse into the future of finance where AI and blockchain converge to create unprecedented opportunities.

Binance, the world‚Äôs leading blockchain ecosystem, has just announced a significant expansion of support for Caldera (ERA) , a move set to revolutionize how users interact with this promising digital asset. This isn‚Äôt just another listing; it‚Äôs a comprehensive integration across multiple core services, designed to empower users with more flexibility and opportunities than ever before. What Does This Binance ERA Expansion Mean for You? Binance‚Äôs commitment to enhancing user experience and broadening its asset offerings continues with this strategic integration of Caldera (ERA). Starting July 17 at 15:30 UTC, ERA will be accessible through several key Binance products, making it easier for both new and experienced users to engage with the token. This expansion signifies increased liquidity, visibility, and utility for Caldera, potentially paving the way for wider adoption. Let‚Äôs break down the exciting new avenues for ERA: Binance Simple Earn: ERA Flexible Products Buy Crypto: Direct purchase options for ERA Convert: Seamless ERA swaps Margin: Opportunities for leveraged trading Futures: Advanced trading strategies for ERA Unlock Passive Income with Binance Earn for Caldera Crypto One of the most anticipated additions is the availability of ERA Flexible Products on Binance Simple Earn. For those looking to grow their holdings passively, this is a game-changer. Binance Simple Earn allows users to deposit their cryptocurrencies and earn interest over time. Flexible Products mean you can subscribe and redeem your ERA holdings at any time, offering unparalleled liquidity while still generating rewards. Imagine earning a steady yield on your Caldera Crypto without locking it up for extended periods. This feature is perfect for long-term holders who want their assets to work for them. How to Get Started with ERA Flexible Products: Log in to your Binance account. Navigate to the ‚ÄòEarn‚Äô section. Search for ‚ÄòERA‚Äô under Simple Earn Flexible Products. Subscribe your desired amount of ERA and start earning interest. Seamless Access: Buying and Converting Your Caldera Crypto Binance is making it incredibly simple to acquire Caldera (ERA). With its inclusion in the ‚ÄòBuy Crypto‚Äô section, users will soon be able to purchase ERA directly using various fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies, depending on regional availability. This lowers the barrier to entry for newcomers and simplifies the process for existing users looking to expand their ERA portfolio. Furthermore, the ‚ÄòConvert‚Äô feature will allow for instant, low-fee swaps between ERA and other supported cryptocurrencies. This means you can quickly and efficiently convert your existing crypto assets into ERA or vice versa, taking advantage of market movements without the complexities of traditional trading interfaces. Embrace Advanced Strategies with Crypto Futures and Margin Trading For the more seasoned traders, the inclusion of ERA in Binance‚Äôs Margin and Futures offerings opens up a world of advanced trading strategies. Margin trading allows users to borrow funds to amplify their trading positions, potentially leading to higher returns (though also higher risks). It‚Äôs a tool for those confident in their market analysis and risk management. The introduction of Crypto Futures for ERA is particularly significant. Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on the future price of ERA without actually owning the underlying asset. This enables both long (betting on price increase) and short (betting on price decrease) positions, providing powerful tools for hedging portfolios or profiting from market volatility. This strategic expansion into derivatives markets signals strong confidence in Caldera‚Äôs potential and caters to a broader spectrum of trading styles. Key Considerations for Margin and Futures Trading: Leverage: Magnifies both gains and losses. Risk Management: Essential to prevent significant losses. Market Volatility: Be prepared for rapid price swings. Education: Understand the mechanisms before engaging. The Broader Impact: A Strategic Digital Asset Expansion This comprehensive integration by Binance is more than just adding a new token; it‚Äôs a strategic Digital Asset Expansion that benefits the entire Caldera ecosystem. Increased accessibility through Binance‚Äôs massive user base can lead to enhanced liquidity, reduced price volatility, and greater overall market awareness for ERA. For Binance users, it means a wider array of choices for earning, trading, and managing their digital assets, all within the trusted and secure environment of the world‚Äôs largest exchange. The move underscores Binance‚Äôs continuous efforts to diversify its offerings and respond to the growing demand for various digital assets. By providing multiple avenues for interaction with ERA, Binance is not only supporting the Caldera project but also empowering its users with more tools to navigate the dynamic crypto landscape. Concluding Thoughts: What‚Äôs Next for Caldera and Binance Users? Binance‚Äôs expanded support for Caldera (ERA) is a clear indicator of the platform‚Äôs dedication to providing a robust and versatile crypto experience. Whether you‚Äôre interested in earning passive income, making quick conversions, or engaging in advanced trading strategies, the new ERA offerings cater to a wide range of needs. This momentous integration solidifies Caldera‚Äôs position within the broader crypto market and provides Binance users with exciting new opportunities to diversify and grow their digital portfolios.

Speaking at a press briefing on Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Canada ‚Äúa pretty difficult partner‚Äù in ongoing negotiations. Leavitt said the trade team remained engaged in conversations with Canada, but described the northern neighbor as difficult to deal with . Her remarks include new tariffs on Canadian goods set to take effect in just over a month. Canada and the US have had one of the most reliable trade relationships for decades, but recent events indicate this could change. According to the US Trade Representative, bilateral trade between the two countries amounted to over $762 billion last year. Canada sends more than 75% of its exports to the United States. And the Trump administration is indicating that the relationship will be tested. Trump hits Canada with new tariffs Earlier this month, President Donald Trump announced a 35% tariff on their northern neighbors, which surprised business leaders and government officials on both sides of the border. The new tariff is part of a sweep of a broader trade policy that has seen the Trump administration slap new levies on dozens of countries. Trump has already levied a 30% tariff on goods from Mexico and from all 27 of the European Union countries earlier this month. They follow a 50% tariff slapped on Brazilian copper products and penalties on more than 20 other countries. White House officials say the tariffs are essential to safeguard US workers and industries from what they describe as unfair trade practices. Leavitt added that the tariffs aimed to put American jobs and companies first, emphasizing that the administration was not afraid to take a stand defending its position. Trump has begun notifying key trading partners, including Canada, of impending tariff hikes set to take effect on August 1. Canada is among roughly two dozen countries, including the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, that have received formal letters outlining the new tariff rates they will face. Europe looks for talks as Canada stands ground Canada may fight against the Trump administration‚Äôs trade calculus, but others seek compromise. Leavitt praised the European Union for its willingness to find common ground, saying the bloc was actively looking at reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers‚Äîmeasures that, she noted, the US had long argued were harmful to American workers and companies. Ursula von der Leyen , the president of the European Commission, has so far managed to refrain from immediate retaliation. She has yet to announce any countermeasures, a step many view as an indication of a willingness to negotiate. Canada, however, has taken a less ambiguous position. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not commented publicly on Leavitt‚Äôs remarks so far, but trade officials in Ottawa have described the new US tariffs as ‚Äúunjustified‚Äù and ‚Äúeconomically damaging‚Äù. Leavitt said the US position was clear, stating that all the letters sent to other countries represented the deals on offer. She added that if other nations wanted legitimate conversations on anything further, the administration and the president‚Äôs trade team were ready‚Äîbut emphasized that the US was not backing down. The trade relationship between the United States and Canada is at a turning point. With an August 1 deadline quickly approaching, companies on both sides are bracing for what could be a seismic shift. The new tariffs will likely impact auto parts, agricultural products, lumber, and aluminum. Economists say that trade disruptions could cause consumer prices to rise, job losses, and slower growth, particularly in border areas where supply chains are highly integrated. Analysts from both countries noted that the US and Canada have very closely connected economies, warning that a trade war could cause real harm, especially when inflation and global instability are already putting pressure on markets.

(Update ‚Äì On Wednesday, the GOP-led US House navigated crucial procedural checkpoints for crypto reform, just a day after President Donald Trump stepped in to keep the effort alive‚Äîclearing the path for America‚Äôs inaugural federal digital-asset statute. Those approvals came on the heels of more than nine hours of behind‚Äëclosed‚Äëdoors negotiations, as party leaders courted skeptics uneasy about the bill‚Äôs design.) US President Donald Trump said he expects these bills to land on his desk after Senate votes. Representative Andy Harris noted that the House Freedom Caucus plans to meet soon to add CBDC language into the CLARITY draft. Large parts of the market are watching closely.

48442347,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=179255,1752798634,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48442347.jpeg,Smarter Web Company‚Äôs Ambitious ¬£15M Share Placing Ignites Growth Potential,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/smarter-web-company-placing/,"BitcoinWorld Smarter Web Company‚Äôs Ambitious ¬£15M Share Placing Ignites Growth Potential In a significant move poised to reshape its future, The Smarter Web Company (SWC), a prominent UK-based web development firm, has announced an ambitious accelerated bookbuild to raise a minimum of ¬£15 million. This strategic capital injection is set to propel the company into its next phase of expansion, signaling robust confidence from institutional investors in the burgeoning digital landscape. For anyone tracking the pulse of tech innovation and strategic financing, this development offers a compelling case study. Understanding the Strategic Share Placing UK Initiative What exactly does it mean for a company like SWC to launch a ¬£15 million share placing, and why is this method chosen? A share placing, particularly an accelerated bookbuild, is a rapid process designed to raise capital by issuing new shares directly to a select group of investors, typically large institutional entities. Unlike a public offering, this method allows companies to secure significant funds quickly and efficiently, often at a discount to the prevailing market price. Speed and Efficiency: Accelerated bookbuilds bypass lengthy regulatory processes associated with public offerings. Targeted Investors: Shares are placed with a pre-identified pool of institutional investors, ensuring a high probability of success. Capital for Growth: The funds raised are typically earmarked for strategic initiatives such as expansion, product development, or acquisitions. For The Smarter Web Company, this ¬£15 million represents a powerful vote of confidence from the financial markets, highlighting their strong position within the competitive Share Placing UK market and the broader digital economy. Decoding the Accelerated Bookbuild : A Closer Look The announcement, initially made on X (formerly Twitter), specified that new ordinary shares would be priced at ¬£2.95 each. This pricing, along with the involvement of Tennyson Securities and Peterhouse Capital Limited, sheds light on the mechanics of this high-stakes financial maneuver. What is an Accelerated Bookbuild? An accelerated bookbuild involves investment banks (in this case, Tennyson Securities and Peterhouse Capital Limited) acting as bookrunners. They quickly gauge demand from institutional investors for a block of shares, often over a period of 24-48 hours. This swift process minimizes market risk and allows the company to capitalize on favorable market conditions. Key Players in the Transaction: Entity Role Significance The Smarter Web Company (SWC) Issuer Seeking capital for growth and expansion. Tennyson Securities Joint Bookrunner Facilitates the placing by identifying and securing institutional investors. Peterhouse Capital Limited Joint Bookrunner Collaborates in managing the bookbuild process and investor outreach. Institutional Investors Subscribers Provide the capital in exchange for new ordinary shares. The ¬£2.95 per share price indicates a specific valuation point that has been agreed upon, reflecting the company‚Äôs current market standing and future potential as perceived by sophisticated investors participating in this Accelerated Bookbuild . The Promise of Web Development Investment : Why SWC is Attractive The decision by institutional investors to commit significant capital to The Smarter Web Company underscores the robust opportunities present within the Web Development Investment sector. In an increasingly digitized world, the demand for sophisticated, user-centric web solutions continues to soar. Why is Web Development a Hot Investment Area? Digital Transformation: Businesses across all sectors are investing heavily in online presence and digital services. E-commerce Boom: The continuous growth of online retail necessitates robust and scalable web platforms. Emerging Technologies: Integration of AI, blockchain, and IoT into web applications creates new avenues for innovation. Global Reach: Web development services can cater to a global client base, offering significant scalability. SWC‚Äôs ability to attract ¬£15 million suggests a strong track record and a compelling vision for future growth, positioning it as a leader in the UK‚Äôs dynamic web development scene. This capital infusion will likely be channeled into expanding their service offerings, enhancing technological capabilities, and potentially acquiring complementary businesses, further solidifying their market position and making them a prime target for future Web Development Investment . The Role of Institutional Investors : Fueling Growth The fact that this share placing is directed towards Institutional Investors is crucial. These are not individual retail investors but large organizations such as pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds. Their involvement brings not only capital but also a stamp of credibility and long-term strategic alignment. What Do Institutional Investors Look For? Strong Management Team: Confidence in leadership to execute growth strategies. Clear Growth Strategy: A well-defined plan for how the capital will be used to generate returns. Market Opportunity: A large and growing market for the company‚Äôs products or services. Financial Performance: A history of solid financial results or strong projections. Governance and Transparency: Adherence to high standards of corporate governance.

If you‚Äôve been active on the Ethereum network lately, you‚Äôve likely noticed a significant spike in what‚Äôs known as Ethereum gas fees . This surge wasn‚Äôt just a random fluctuation; it was directly tied to a major event that sent ripples through the crypto market : the highly anticipated ERA airdrop. What Just Happened to Ethereum Gas Fees? The digital air was thick with anticipation as the ERA airdrop began opening its claims. For many in the crypto community, airdrops are exciting opportunities to receive free tokens, but they often come with a hidden cost: network congestion. Pseudonymous analyst @ai_9684xtpa took to X (formerly Twitter) to report the immediate aftermath. As claims for the ERA airdrop commenced, Ethereum gas fees skyrocketed to an astonishing 36.7 Gwei. To put that into perspective, this isn‚Äôt just a minor bump; it represents a significant increase in the cost of executing transactions on the blockchain. The report further highlighted the sheer volume of activity, with a staggering 30.73 ETH, equivalent to approximately $105,000, burned in just one hour. This rapid burn rate is a clear indicator of intense network demand and the direct consequence of a sudden influx of users rushing to claim their airdropped tokens. Understanding Gas: Why Do We Pay for It on the Ethereum Network? Before diving deeper into the ERA airdrop‚Äôs impact, let‚Äôs quickly demystify gas fees. Think of gas as the fuel for the Ethereum network . Every operation on Ethereum, from sending tokens to interacting with a decentralized application (dApp) or claiming an airdrop, requires computational effort. This effort isn‚Äôt free; it consumes ‚Äògas‚Äô. What is Gas? It‚Äôs a unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations on the Ethereum blockchain. Why Do We Pay? Gas fees compensate miners (or validators, post-Merge) for securing the network and processing transactions. It also acts as a spam prevention mechanism, deterring malicious actors from overloading the network with trivial transactions. How is it Measured? Gas is typically measured in Gwei (Gigawei), which is a small denomination of Ether (1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH). How is the Fee Calculated? Your total transaction fee is determined by multiplying the ‚Äògas limit‚Äô (the maximum amount of gas you‚Äôre willing to spend) by the ‚Äògas price‚Äô (how much Gwei you‚Äôre willing to pay per unit of gas). With EIP-1559, this includes a ‚Äòbase fee‚Äô (burned) and a ‚Äòpriority fee‚Äô (paid to validators). When demand for network space is high, like during a popular airdrop, users bid higher gas prices to ensure their transactions are processed quickly, leading to an overall increase in Ethereum gas fees . The ERA Airdrop Phenomenon: A Catalyst for High Gas Fees Airdrops are a common marketing strategy in the crypto space, designed to distribute new tokens to a wide audience, often to incentivize adoption or reward early supporters. The ERA airdrop , in particular, generated significant buzz, leading to a massive rush of users attempting to claim their tokens simultaneously. This created a bottleneck on the Ethereum network , akin to a digital traffic jam. When thousands of users try to execute transactions at the same time, the demand for block space skyrockets. This intense competition drives up the gas price, as users are willing to pay more to have their transactions included in the next block. The result? Sky-high transaction costs for everyone, not just those claiming the airdrop. What is the Impact of High Gas Fees on the Crypto Market? The ripple effects of high gas fees extend far beyond just individual transaction costs. They have a profound impact on the broader crypto market and its participants: Deterring Small Transactions: For users wanting to move small amounts of ETH or interact with low-value dApps, high gas fees can make these activities economically unfeasible. A $5 transaction costing $20 in gas is simply not practical. Impacting DeFi and NFTs: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplaces, which heavily rely on the Ethereum network, become less accessible and more expensive to use. This can stifle innovation and adoption in these sectors. Driving Users to Layer 2s and Alternative Blockchains: Faced with exorbitant fees, users and developers are increasingly migrating to Layer 2 scaling solutions (like Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync) or entirely different blockchains (like Solana, Avalanche, Polygon) that offer lower transaction costs. While this can be seen as a challenge for Ethereum‚Äôs dominance, it also highlights the network‚Äôs need for scalability. Centralization Concerns: If only those with deep pockets can afford to transact, it raises concerns about the decentralization ethos of the blockchain, potentially limiting participation to a select few. Navigating High Transaction Costs: Actionable Insights for Users So, what can you do when high gas fees strike? While you can‚Äôt control the market, you can adopt strategies to mitigate the impact of rising transaction costs : Monitor Gas Prices: Websites like Etherscan Gas Tracker or GasNow provide real-time updates on current gas prices. Timing your transactions during off-peak hours (e.g., late night UTC, weekends) can significantly reduce costs. Utilize Layer 2 Solutions: For many applications, especially DeFi and NFTs, using Layer 2 scaling solutions built on top of Ethereum can offer dramatically lower fees and faster transaction times. Familiarize yourself with bridges to move assets to these networks. Batch Transactions: If you have multiple transactions to make, consider if they can be combined or batched. Some wallets and protocols offer features to do this, saving on individual gas fees. Adjust Gas Limits (Carefully): While not recommended for beginners, advanced users can sometimes set custom gas limits. However, setting it too low can result in a failed transaction, costing you the gas fee anyway. Consider Alternatives for Small Transactions: For very small transfers or interactions, explore if an alternative blockchain or a centralized exchange might be a more cost-effective option, depending on your needs. The Future of the Ethereum Network and Gas Fees The challenges posed by high gas fees are not new to the Ethereum network . Developers have been actively working on long-term solutions to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs . The implementation of EIP-1559 (which introduced the base fee and burning mechanism) was a significant step, aiming to make gas fees more predictable. However, the ultimate solution lies in Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing roadmap towards greater scalability. The Merge and Beyond: While The Merge transitioned Ethereum to Proof-of-Stake, it primarily focused on energy efficiency and security. The next major phase, often referred to as ‚ÄòThe Surge‚Äô (with Sharding), aims to drastically increase transaction throughput. Rollups (Layer 2s): These technologies are already playing a crucial role, bundling many transactions off-chain into a single transaction on the mainnet, significantly reducing gas usage. They are seen as Ethereum‚Äôs primary scaling solution in the short to medium term. Proto-Danksharding and Danksharding: Future upgrades like these will further enhance the capacity for rollups by providing more data space on the mainnet, making Layer 2 transactions even cheaper. While events like the ERA airdrop highlight the current limitations, they also underscore the urgent need for these scalability solutions to be fully implemented, ensuring Ethereum remains the leading smart contract platform for the global crypto market . A Glimpse into Ethereum‚Äôs Dynamic Landscape The recent surge in Ethereum gas fees , triggered by the ERA airdrop , serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and sometimes volatile nature of the crypto market . It underscores the fundamental economic principles of supply and demand at play on the Ethereum network . While high gas fees can be frustrating for users, they also highlight the immense demand for Ethereum‚Äôs decentralized infrastructure. As the network continues its journey towards greater scalability and efficiency, events like these provide valuable lessons and reinforce the importance of ongoing development and user adaptation. Staying informed and adopting smart strategies will be key to navigating the exciting, yet challenging, world of decentralized finance.

On Thursday, Powell formally responded to a letter from Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), who accused Powell of wasteful spending and mismanagement of the project. Vought had issued Powell a deadline of seven days to answer a series of questions about the renovation, which had exceeded its original budget. The letter was highly unusual and personal, underscoring increasing tensions between the Federal Reserve and allies of President Donald J. Trump. But instead of piling on in kind, Powell‚Äôs response was measured. He also pointed Vought to a new section of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs website, which offers an expanded description of the project, its budgets, schedules, and design choices. ‚ÄúThe Board believes it is of the utmost importance to provide transparency for our decisions and to be accountable to the public,‚Äù Powell wrote. He did not respond to Vought‚Äôs political jabs, including accusing Powell of ‚Äúgrossly mismanaging the Fed‚Äù or having misled Congress in testimony last month. Fed denies ‚Äòluxury upgrades‚Äô claims Among the more sensational claims in Vought‚Äôs complaint was the accusation that the renovation had decked out the building with such luxury amenities as private elevators, exclusive dining rooms, and a rooftop garden. Powell strongly denied these claims . A Federal Reserve official stated that the renovation plans do not include private elevators or VIP lunchrooms. The official also clarified that the roof space would not be used as a garden or for outdoor entertainment, but would house essential mechanical equipment. Powell said the renovation responds to aging infrastructure and bona fide safety issues. Some buildings from the early 20th century need seismic reinforcements, modern electrical and plumbing systems, and augmented cybersecurity defenses. He added that the renovation is intended to conform to federal environmental standards and enhance accessibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Powell‚Äôs necessary and fiscally prudent spending would guarantee that the headquarters will remain safe, functional, and operational for many years. He also said that the Federal Reserve is not usually beholden to the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) ‚Äì the entity that reviews major public developments in D.C. However, Powell said the Fed willingly worked with the NCPC to ensure the renovation complied with high design and planning standards. Trump allies question Powell‚Äôs leadership Even with Powell‚Äôs modulated response, the blowback from Trump allies will likely escalate. Vought said Thursday that he plans to visit the office in person to review the project. The building is several blocks from the White House. That same day, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) said she planned to urge the US Department of Justice to investigate whether Powell had provided false or misleading information to a congressional committee regarding the scope and status of the renovation project. The criticism is part of a larger bid to undercut Powell‚Äôs leadership. Trump, who nominated Powell only to lash out at him later, has often hammered the Fed Chair for monetary policy. Trump has criticized Powell for the US central bank‚Äôs refusal to cut rates despite inflation having remained tame. In his letter , Vought stated that the President had grown increasingly concerned that Powell was unwilling to support his public statements with concrete actions . He also accused Powell of moving forward with an expensive renovation project rather than focusing on the nation‚Äôs economic challenges. On the other hand, Powell made it plain that the renovation is not a luxury but a long-deferred investment in infrastructure that underpins the Fed‚Äôs core operations, including monetary policy, financial oversight, and payment systems. Powell‚Äôs reply, however, won‚Äôt settle the controversy. It could signal the start of a broader effort to pressure him and steer the Fed in a different direction in the coming months.

Imagine nearly a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, a staggering 7,880 BTC, suddenly shifting from one of the most recognized exchanges, Coinbase, into an anonymous digital abyss. This isn‚Äôt just a routine transaction; it‚Äôs a headline-grabbing event that raises numerous questions and keeps market watchers on edge. What does such a massive BTC movement signify for the broader crypto landscape? Decoding the Unprecedented Bitcoin Transfer The news broke courtesy of Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking service renowned for monitoring large cryptocurrency transactions. Their report highlighted the movement of 7,880 BTC from a known Coinbase wallet to an entirely new, previously unseen address. At the time of the transaction, this colossal sum was valued at approximately $934 million. To put that into perspective, it‚Äôs enough to buy a small fleet of private jets or fund significant development projects. Such a substantial Bitcoin transfer immediately signals the involvement of a major player, commonly referred to as a ‚Äòcrypto whale‚Äô. These are entities or individuals holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, and their movements often precede or influence market trends. The sheer size of this particular transfer makes it a focal point for analysis, as it could have profound implications for market liquidity, sentiment, and even future price action. Who is the Mysterious Crypto Whale Behind This Move? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, the immediate question on everyone‚Äôs mind is: who is behind it? While the blockchain transaction itself is transparent and publicly verifiable, the identity of the wallet owner remains shrouded in anonymity. This is the inherent design of many cryptocurrencies ‚Äì transactions are public, but identities are private unless voluntarily disclosed or linked through external means. So, who could this crypto whale be? Several theories are circulating: Institutional Investor: A large institution, such as a hedge fund, an asset management firm, or even a corporation adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, might be accumulating a significant position. Moving funds off an exchange to cold storage is a common practice for long-term holding. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The transfer could be part of a large OTC trade, where a buyer and seller execute a transaction directly, often facilitated by a broker, to avoid impacting exchange order books with such a large volume. The funds are then moved to the buyer‚Äôs private wallet. Exchange Rebalancing: Less likely for a move to an ‚Äòunknown new wallet‚Äô, but sometimes exchanges move funds between their own cold and hot wallets for security or operational reasons. However, the ‚Äòunknown new wallet‚Äô aspect points away from this being an internal Coinbase move. High-Net-Worth Individual: A very wealthy individual could be consolidating their holdings or preparing for a major private transaction. Preparation for Custody Solution: The funds might be moving to a specialized crypto custody provider, which offers enhanced security features for institutional-grade holdings. The fact that the funds moved from Coinbase , a regulated and prominent exchange, suggests a degree of legitimacy and potentially a US-based or compliant entity, although this is not definitive proof. Why Coinbase and BTC Movement Matter So Much The choice of Coinbase as the origin point for such a massive BTC movement is significant. Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges globally, particularly in the Western world. When large sums of Bitcoin leave an exchange, it typically has a few potential interpretations: Reduced Selling Pressure: If Bitcoin is moved off an exchange into a private wallet, it‚Äôs often interpreted as a sign that the holder intends to HODL (hold on for dear life) rather than sell in the immediate future. This can reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially leading to upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Long-Term Accumulation: Large withdrawals often indicate accumulation by long-term investors or institutions who prefer to self-custody their assets rather than leaving them on an exchange, which carries counterparty risk. Preparation for Private Sale: As mentioned, it could be a precursor to an OTC deal, where the buyer receives the BTC directly into their private wallet. Conversely, large inflows of Bitcoin to exchanges often signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing selling pressure. Therefore, this particular outflow is generally seen as a bullish or neutral signal, indicating long-term conviction rather than immediate liquidation. Understanding the Blockchain Transaction: Transparency and Anonymity The beauty and complexity of a blockchain transaction lie in its paradoxical nature: it‚Äôs both incredibly transparent and profoundly anonymous. Every single Bitcoin transaction, including this monumental 7,880 BTC transfer, is recorded on the public Bitcoin blockchain. This means anyone can view the transaction details: the sending address, the receiving address, the amount, and the timestamp. However, these addresses are strings of alphanumeric characters, not names or identities. Unless an address is publicly associated with an entity (like a known exchange wallet or a publicly declared fund), the owner remains anonymous. This is why services like Whale Alert are so crucial; they track known entity wallets (like exchanges) and flag large movements, even if the destination remains ‚Äòunknown‚Äô. For analysts, tracking these large blockchain transaction movements provides invaluable insights into market dynamics. They use sophisticated tools and heuristics to try and identify patterns, cluster addresses belonging to the same entity, and infer the intentions behind these massive shifts in capital. This particular transaction is a prime example of how on-chain data can spark market discussions and fuel speculation, even without knowing the identity of the transactor. What‚Äôs Next for This Unknown Wallet? The biggest mystery now revolves around the newly created, unknown wallet that received the 7,880 BTC. Will these funds remain dormant, signaling long-term cold storage? Will they be moved again to another address, perhaps a known institutional custodian? Or will we see portions of this massive sum being distributed to various other wallets, potentially indicating an upcoming distribution or a series of smaller private deals? Market observers will be closely monitoring this address for any subsequent activity. A prolonged period of inactivity would suggest a strong HODL conviction, while further movements could signal different strategies. The future actions of this mysterious crypto whale could certainly influence short-term market sentiment, although Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term trajectory is driven by broader macroeconomic factors and adoption trends. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Whale‚Äôs World The 7,880 BTC transfer from Coinbase to an unknown wallet is more than just a large sum of money changing hands; it‚Äôs a fascinating peek into the opaque world of crypto whales and their market-moving actions. It underscores the immense value now flowing through the decentralized rails of Bitcoin and highlights the constant interplay between transparency (on-chain data) and anonymity (wallet ownership). While the identity of this particular crypto whale remains a secret, the event serves as a powerful reminder of the significant capital flows within the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the potential impact of such large-scale Bitcoin transfer events. As the market continues to evolve, tracking these monumental BTC movement s and understanding the underlying mechanics of a blockchain transaction will remain crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet exciting world of digital assets.

Nasdaq, a titan in the financial exchange industry, has submitted a groundbreaking proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to add staking capabilities to the iShares Ethereum Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). This isn‚Äôt just another filing; it‚Äôs a bold move that signals a growing convergence between traditional finance and the innovative realm of blockchain, particularly impacting the future of Ethereum ETF products. What is the Nasdaq Proposal and Why Does it Matter for the Ethereum ETF Landscape? At its core, the Nasdaq proposal seeks to enable the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, managed by BlackRock, to engage in crypto staking activities. Currently, many proposed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs focus solely on holding the underlying asset. However, this new filing introduces a layer of yield generation, allowing the ETF to earn rewards by participating in the Ethereum network‚Äôs proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This is a monumental shift because it could potentially offer investors not just exposure to Ethereum‚Äôs price movements, but also an additional income stream, mirroring how traditional financial instruments like bonds or dividend stocks provide returns. The proposal outlines how the Trust would utilize one or more trusted staking providers, such as Coinbase Custody, to facilitate the staking process. The rewards generated from staking would then accrue to the Trust, potentially enhancing its overall performance. This innovative approach aims to make the ETF more attractive by leveraging the native yield capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain, a feature previously accessible primarily to direct holders of Ether (ETH). Demystifying Crypto Staking: How Does it Work for iShares Ethereum Trust? For those new to the concept, crypto staking is a fundamental process in proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum. Instead of relying on energy-intensive mining (as Bitcoin does), Ethereum validators lock up a certain amount of their Ether as collateral to help secure the network and validate transactions. In return for this service, they receive rewards in the form of newly minted Ether and transaction fees. Here‚Äôs a simplified breakdown of how staking works and its relevance to the iShares Ethereum Trust proposal: Proof-of-Stake (PoS): Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to PoS with the ‚ÄòMerge‚Äô in September 2022. This change made staking possible. Validators: Individuals or entities who ‚Äòstake‚Äô their ETH to participate in block validation. A full validator requires 32 ETH. Staking Rewards: Validators earn ETH rewards for successfully proposing and attesting to blocks. These rewards incentivize network security and participation. Slashing: A penalty mechanism where a portion of a validator‚Äôs staked ETH is forfeited if they act maliciously or fail to perform their duties correctly. This risk is a key consideration for institutional staking. The Nasdaq proposal addresses these intricacies by suggesting the use of reputable third-party staking providers. These providers handle the technical complexities, manage validator operations, and mitigate risks like slashing, making it feasible for a regulated financial product like an ETF to engage in staking. Why is Nasdaq Pushing for Staking? Unlocking New Investor Opportunities The inclusion of staking in an Ethereum ETF is a game-changer for several reasons. It addresses a key limitation of previous crypto ETF proposals, which often left out the inherent yield generation capability of PoS assets. For investors, particularly institutions, this means: Enhanced Returns: Staking rewards can provide an additional layer of return beyond just price appreciation. This makes the ETF potentially more competitive and appealing compared to simply holding Ether directly or through other non-staking vehicles. Simplified Access: Investing in an ETF through traditional brokerage accounts is far simpler than setting up and managing a personal staking operation. This lowers the barrier to entry for a broader range of investors, including those who are not comfortable with self-custody or the technicalities of staking. The ETF handles all the complexities, from selecting staking providers to managing rewards and risks. Institutional-Grade Security: By leveraging established custodians and staking providers, the ETF can offer a level of security and compliance that individual investors might find challenging to replicate. This institutional wrapper is crucial for attracting large asset managers, pension funds, and wealth advisors. Diversification of Investment Strategies: For portfolio managers, an Ethereum ETF with staking could serve as a unique asset class that offers both growth potential and yield, fitting into various investment mandates. It provides a regulated pathway to gain exposure to the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem without direct participation. The Regulatory Hurdle: Will the SEC Approval Come? The path to SEC Approval for any crypto-related product, especially one involving staking, is notoriously challenging. The SEC has historically been cautious, citing concerns around investor protection, market manipulation, and the classification of cryptocurrencies. Here are some key considerations for the SEC: Security Classification: A primary concern for the SEC is whether staked ETH or the staking service itself constitutes a security. If deemed a security, it would fall under a different regulatory framework. Investor Protection: The SEC will scrutinize how the ETF plans to protect investors from risks associated with staking, such as slashing, smart contract vulnerabilities, and the solvency of staking providers. Market Manipulation: Concerns about potential manipulation in the underlying Ether market remain, though the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has set a precedent for commodity-based crypto assets. Liquidity and Redemption: The SEC will examine how the ETF manages the lock-up periods associated with staked ETH and ensures timely redemptions for investors. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs provides a glimmer of hope, demonstrating a potential shift in the SEC‚Äôs stance on commodity-based crypto assets. However, staking introduces new complexities that the SEC will undoubtedly examine thoroughly. The Nasdaq Proposal is meticulously drafted to address these concerns, outlining robust operational procedures and risk management frameworks. Potential Impact and the Road Ahead for iShares Ethereum Trust If the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF with staking capabilities receives SEC approval, the implications could be profound: Accelerated Institutional Adoption: It would pave the way for a broader range of institutions to gain exposure to Ethereum, not just as a speculative asset, but as a yield-generating investment. This could unlock significant capital inflows into the Ethereum ecosystem. Setting a Precedent: Approval could set a crucial precedent for other crypto assets that utilize proof-of-stake mechanisms, potentially leading to a new wave of innovative ETF products in the future. Increased Market Maturity: The entry of regulated products like this signifies a maturation of the crypto market, integrating it further into the traditional financial system. This can lead to increased liquidity, stability, and credibility for digital assets. Competition and Innovation: Other asset managers would likely follow suit, leading to increased competition and further innovation in crypto-native financial products. The timeline for SEC approval is uncertain, often taking months or even longer. The commission will review public comments, engage in dialogue with Nasdaq and BlackRock, and ultimately make a decision based on its mandate to protect investors and ensure fair and orderly markets. The industry watches with bated breath, as this decision could truly be a pivotal moment for the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Navigating the Challenges: What are the Risks for Staked Ethereum ETFs? While the benefits are compelling, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks inherent in a staked Ethereum ETF : Risk Category Description Mitigation Strategies (as proposed by ETFs) Slashing Risk Validators can lose a portion of their staked ETH if they fail to perform duties or act maliciously. Using reputable, audited staking providers with strong track records and insurance policies. Diversifying staking providers. Liquidity Risk Staked ETH is locked up and cannot be immediately withdrawn. This could impact the ETF‚Äôs ability to meet redemptions. Maintaining a portion of ETH un-staked for liquidity. Utilizing liquid staking derivatives if regulatory approved. Smart Contract Risk Vulnerabilities in the smart contracts governing staking could lead to loss of funds. Relying on extensively audited and battle-tested smart contracts; working with providers who have robust security practices. Regulatory Uncertainty Evolving regulations could impact the legality or operational aspects of staking activities. Close collaboration with legal counsel and regulators; adapting to new guidelines. Centralization Risk Reliance on a few large staking providers could introduce centralization concerns for the Ethereum network. ETF managers could diversify across multiple staking providers to mitigate this risk. These risks are not trivial, and the success of the Nasdaq Proposal hinges on the SEC‚Äôs satisfaction with the proposed mitigation strategies. BlackRock and Nasdaq have a vested interest in presenting a robust, secure, and compliant product that can withstand regulatory scrutiny. A Glimpse into the Future: Institutional Adoption and Crypto Staking The move by Nasdaq and BlackRock is indicative of a broader trend: the increasing institutionalization of digital assets. What started with Bitcoin gaining acceptance as ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô is now expanding to Ethereum, recognized for its programmable blockchain capabilities and its role as the backbone of DeFi and NFTs. The inclusion of staking is a natural progression, as institutions seek to maximize returns from their digital asset holdings. This development is not just about a single ETF; it‚Äôs about validating a new financial paradigm. It signals that traditional finance is not just observing but actively seeking ways to integrate the native functionalities of blockchain technology into regulated investment products. The success of this Nasdaq Proposal could unlock a torrent of innovation, leading to more sophisticated crypto investment vehicles that truly leverage the unique attributes of digital assets. In conclusion, Nasdaq‚Äôs filing to add staking to the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF represents a truly transformative step for the digital asset industry. It underscores the growing maturity of the Ethereum ecosystem and the increasing appetite from institutional players to engage with cryptocurrencies in more sophisticated ways. While the path to SEC Approval is fraught with regulatory complexities, the sheer potential for enhanced investor returns and simplified access makes this proposal a landmark event. Its outcome will not only shape the future of Ethereum ETF products but also significantly influence the trajectory of institutional adoption within the broader crypto market. This pivotal move by Nasdaq could indeed unlock unprecedented opportunities for investors and further cement Ethereum‚Äôs role as a cornerstone of the digital economy.

At its current price of $0.03 MUTM is flying fast during presale stage. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 75% has been sold out as investors pile in. The token is at its lowest possible price of $0.03. A 16.7% jump will follow as phase 6 sets in. Over $12.5 million has been raised to date, and over 13500 investors have entered the presale. As Cardano navigates regulatory and technical headwinds, Mutuum‚Äôs lending-first protocol is making noise across crypto circles for its unique blend of real-world asset integration, non-custodial architecture, and capital-efficient design. Cardano‚Äôs Mid‚Äë2025 Balance: Resilient Momentum Amid Evolving Metrics Cardano (ADA) recently rallied approximately 30% from mid‚ÄëJune lows, climbing above its 200‚Äëday EMA and testing resistance near $0.75‚Äì$0.77, key indicators of renewed technical momentum. Institutional activity has notably ramped up, with around $73 million in inflows so far this year and Grayscale allocating nearly 18.5% of its smart contract fund to ADA. Meanwhile, the on‚Äëchain ecosystem remains steady. Roughly 60% of circulating ADA is staked, supporting network decentralization, and Catalyst funding rounds continue to drive community innovation. However, active daily addresses remain relatively modest, suggesting room for broader user adoption. With critical resistance holding, medium‚Äëterm price forecasts hover toward $0.90‚Äì$1.00, though macro sentiment and user growth may cap upside. In this context, emerging DeFi names like Mutuum Finance are quietly gaining attention on the horizon. Investor Interest Drives Mutuum Finance Presale Beyond $12.5M Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the most promising DeFi tokens in 2025. With over $12.5 million raised and over 13500 investors already in, the presale is gaining real traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next stage will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already set official launch price of $0.06, early investors are already on a 100% profit. MUTM could skyrocket 9900% to $3 before 2025 ends. Reshaping Finance Through Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol where users own complete control of assets throughout decentralized lending. The project follows a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending in an attempt to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system utilizes smart contracts to establish automatic lending with no human interference and rather, the smart contracts respond to the market by giving dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and gives direct access between the borrowers and the lenders. The model is highly preferred by users for volatile assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance Strengthens Security with $50K Bounty & Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hosting a $100,000 giveaway . 10 people will each receive $10,000 MUTM tokens. The project has also launched a new leaderboard where top 50 token holders will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their ranks. To improve security, Mutuum Finance has initiated a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Every vulnerability will be rewarded, with the bounty focusing on four key levels: critical, major, minor, and level four will be low. Mutuum Finance is rapidly gaining ground as one of the top DeFi coins of 2025, raising over $12.5 million from more than 13,500 investors as its presale accelerates. At a price of $0.03 and with Stage 5 nearly complete, the project is drawing serious attention for its real-world lending utility, capital-efficient design, and advanced smart contract models. As Cardano continues its steady rise, Mutuum is positioning itself to potentially outpace ADA in growth by year-end. A built-in $100,000 giveaway, a $50,000 CertiK security bounty, and a rising leaderboard reward system are helping fuel community momentum. Buy Mutuum Finance today.

A significant shift in the landscape of US crypto policy is on the horizon. Eleanor Terrett, the insightful host of the Crypto in America podcast, recently broke news via X that the White House is making final preparations for the passage of a truly groundbreaking piece of legislation today: the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 Act, more commonly known as the Genius Act . This isn‚Äôt just another bill; it‚Äôs a pivotal moment, underscored by the scheduling of a high-profile signing ceremony for industry leaders and lawmakers tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. (EST). What does this mean for your digital assets and the broader crypto market? Let‚Äôs dive in. Understanding the Genius Act and its Impact on Stablecoin Regulation The very name, Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, tells you a lot. The Genius Act aims to provide a clear, comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins within the United States. For years, the crypto industry has operated under a patchwork of existing laws, often ill-suited for the unique nature of digital assets . This lack of clarity has been a significant barrier to mainstream adoption and institutional investment. By passing this act, the U.S. government is signaling a strong intent to bring structure and certainty to a crucial segment of the crypto economy. What are Stablecoins? At their core, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, typically by being pegged to a ‚Äòstable‚Äô asset like the U.S. dollar, gold, or even other cryptocurrencies. They act as a vital bridge between the volatile world of traditional cryptocurrencies and the stability of fiat currencies. Why Regulate Them? Stablecoins facilitate trillions of dollars in transactions annually, powering everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) to international remittances. Without proper oversight, concerns about consumer protection, financial stability, and illicit finance risks loom large. Why is the White House Crypto Focus Crucial Now? The White House‚Äôs active involvement in pushing for the Genius Act highlights a growing recognition of cryptocurrencies‚Äô importance, particularly stablecoins, in the global financial system. After years of debate and various legislative proposals, this concerted effort suggests a bipartisan consensus on the need for action. The U.S. aims to cement its position as a leader in financial innovation, rather than lagging behind other jurisdictions that have already begun to implement clearer rules for digital assets . This push comes at a time when global competition in the digital finance space is intensifying. Countries and economic blocs worldwide are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and comprehensive crypto regulations. For the U.S., a robust framework for stablecoins could: Foster Innovation: Provide legal certainty for developers and businesses to build new applications and services on top of regulated stablecoins. Protect Consumers: Establish clear requirements for reserves, audits, and redemption mechanisms, safeguarding users‚Äô funds. Enhance Financial Stability: Integrate stablecoins into the broader financial system in a controlled manner, mitigating systemic risks. Combat Illicit Activities: Create tools and frameworks to prevent stablecoins from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing. Navigating the Future of US Crypto Policy : What‚Äôs Next? The passage and signing of the Genius Act are just the beginning. While the ceremony marks a significant milestone, the real work of implementation will follow. Regulatory bodies like the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and potentially others, will be tasked with drafting detailed rules and guidelines based on the Act‚Äôs provisions. This process will involve extensive public comment periods and collaboration with the industry. Key questions that will emerge during this phase include: How will existing stablecoins adapt to the new regulatory requirements? What will be the specific capital and reserve requirements for issuers? How will the Act differentiate between various types of stablecoins (e.g., fiat-backed, crypto-backed, algorithmic)? What impact will this have on decentralized stablecoins, if any? The clarity provided by the Genius Act is expected to attract more traditional financial institutions into the crypto space, viewing regulated stablecoins as a safer and more predictable entry point into digital assets . This could unlock significant capital and talent, further accelerating the growth and integration of crypto into the mainstream economy. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community For anyone involved in the crypto space, from individual investors to large enterprises, the passage of the Genius Act necessitates attention and adaptation. Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from regulatory bodies and industry experts as the implementation details emerge. Assess Your Holdings: Understand how the new regulations might affect the stablecoins you hold or use, especially concerning their backing and issuer compliance. Prepare for Compliance: If you are a business dealing with stablecoins, begin preparing for potential new reporting, licensing, or operational requirements. Engage and Advocate: Participate in public comment periods or support industry associations that advocate for balanced and innovation-friendly regulations. A New Era for Digital Assets in America? The impending passage of the Genius Act marks a watershed moment for stablecoin regulation and the broader crypto landscape in the United States. It signifies a clear commitment from the highest levels of government to bring structure, legitimacy, and innovation to digital assets . While challenges in implementation will undoubtedly arise, the path towards a more regulated, secure, and integrated crypto economy in America appears clearer than ever. This move could very well set a precedent for global regulatory efforts, shaping the future of finance for years to come.

Daniel Yan Sounds Alarm On SBET,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-boom-or-bust-daniel-sounds-alarm-sbet/,"Daniel Yan, the founder and CIO of Kryptanium Capital, a managing partner at Matrixport Ventures, and previously an executive at Bitmain and Merrill Lynch, writes today via X: ‚ÄúEveryone is comparing SBET to MSTR and thus concludes super-bullishly for both ETH and SBET. Together with the ETF massive flow, the logic seems impeccable‚Ä¶ I think SBET differs massively from MSTR on two fronts‚Ä¶ All the above point to a maximization of short-term interest.‚Äù The comparison of SharpLink Gaming (SBET) to MicroStrategy (MSTR) has become a fixture of crypto-equity chatter as Ether rallies to 16-month highs on the back of record US spot-ETF inflows. But in a post published this morning, venture investor Daniel Yan argues that the two ‚Äúproxy‚Äù trades share less DNA than the market assumes. SBET Isn‚Äôt MicroStrategy‚ÄîWhat It Means For Ethereum Price SharpLink‚Äôs metamorphosis from an i-gaming software vendor into the world‚Äôs largest corporate Ether holder has been dizzyingly fast. Since the firm announced its treasury pivot on 2 June, it has amassed 280,706 ETH (‚âà $925 million) and staked nearly all of it, earning 415 ETH in rewards. To fund the spree, SharpLink sold 24.6 million shares for $413 million via an at-the-market (ATM) facility between 7 and 11 July. The company still has $257 million of authorised capital it has yet to commit to the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Shoot Above $4,000 This Week, Predicts Analyst Management insists dilution is offset by growing ‚ÄúETH Concentration‚Äù (ETH √∑ 1,000 assumed diluted shares), which has risen from 2.00 to 2.46 ETH in just five weeks. Nevertheless, Yan warns that the very mechanism powering SharpLink‚Äôs accumulation‚Äîconstant equity issuance‚Äîis also a pressure point: ‚ÄúThis method creates a massive dilution effect on the ETH-per-share metric, which makes SBET price more vulnerable to negative shocks.‚Äù MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy is held together by cheap, long-dated leverage. Since mid-2020 the firm has floated $8.2 billion of convertible notes‚Äîall funnelled into BTC‚Äîand only secondarily tapped its own ATM shelf. Because converts embed an equity option, they dilute only if MSTR‚Äôs share price leaps, effectively synchronising new issuance with bullish sentiment. Yan calls this a ‚Äúflywheel‚Äù that SBET lacks. Indeed, five of MicroStrategy‚Äôs six convert issues are already deep in the money as MSTR flirts with all-time highs, turning the debt into quasi-equity on highly favourable terms. By contrast, SharpLink relies almost exclusively on equity sales; every fresh tranche increases the denominator immediately, regardless of where SBET trades. Yan also highlights governance asymmetry: SharpLink was recapitalised by ‚Äúone of the largest consortium of ETH holders,‚Äù whose own SBET shares unlock in roughly five months. He frames the arrangement as a ‚Äúmulti-party prisoner‚Äôs dilemma,‚Äù implying insiders may be incentivised to monetise quickly rather than steward a decades-long treasury strategy. No comparable unlocking event hangs over MicroStrategy, whose executive chairman Michael Saylor owns the bulk of the voting stock and has repeatedly pledged never to sell. Related Reading: SharpLink Gaming Buys Another $19.5M In Ethereum: Institutional Accumulation Yan‚Äôs comments land just as Ether ETFs smash records. US spot funds absorbed $726.6 million in net inflows on Wednesday, their best day since launch, lifting cumulative holdings above 5 million ETH. Bulls argue that such flows will continue to buoy both Ether and any equity that warehouses it. Even Yan concedes ‚Äúthere is merit in this for the short term.‚Äù But his analysis underscores that the path-dependency of SharpLink‚Äôs model‚Äîequity issuance first, crypto purchases later‚Äîcarries different risks from MicroStrategy‚Äôs debt-driven lever. The key divergence is simple: MicroStrategy‚Äôs converts dilute only if the bet is already winning; SharpLink‚Äôs ATM dilutes so the bet can be placed. Yan is not forecasting an imminent crash‚Äîhe explicitly disavows any short position in Ether‚Äîbut he urges investors caught up in ‚Äúthe euphoric period‚Äù to scrutinise capital-structure mechanics. If SharpLink‚Äôs insiders do treat the company as a short-term vehicle and ETF momentum cools, the ATM-powered ‚Äúflywheel‚Äù could spin the opposite way: more shares, lower ETH-per-share, weaker SBET. Conversely, if Ether keeps climbing and the firm times its issuance astutely, shareholders could still enjoy MicroStrategy-style convexity. The difference, as Yan makes clear, is that SharpLink‚Äôs leverage is worn on the cap table, not tucked inside a convertible note. At press time, ETH traded at $3,412.

Recent reports indicate a significant bipartisan push, with a notable number of Democratic lawmakers signaling their intent to support key legislative initiatives aimed at providing much-needed clarity for the digital asset space. This development could mark a turning point, moving the U.S. closer to a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Why is This Democratic Support for Crypto Regulation a Game Changer? The cryptocurrency industry has long clamored for clear rules of engagement in the United States. The current regulatory patchwork has led to uncertainty, stifling innovation, and, at times, pushing businesses offshore. The news, reported by Eleanor Terrett, host of the Crypto in America podcast, via X, suggests a breakthrough in this gridlock. According to an unnamed House Democrat source, approximately 35 Democratic lawmakers are expected to cast their votes in favor of the Digital Asset Market Structure Act , commonly known as the CLARITY Act . This level of cross-party support is crucial for any meaningful legislation to pass in a divided Congress. This anticipated vote, scheduled for a plenary session at 4 p.m. (EST), highlights a growing recognition among lawmakers of the importance and inevitability of integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. It underscores a shift from skepticism to a more pragmatic approach towards managing this rapidly evolving sector. Understanding the Digital Asset Market Structure Act (CLARITY Act) The CLARITY Act , officially titled the Digital Asset Market Structure Act, is a comprehensive piece of legislation designed to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. Its primary goal is to provide certainty for market participants, protect consumers, and foster innovation within the crypto ecosystem. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its core objectives: Defining Jurisdictions: One of the biggest challenges in crypto has been determining whether a digital asset falls under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a security or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a commodity. The CLARITY Act aims to provide clear definitions and delineate the roles of these regulatory bodies. Consumer Protection: The bill seeks to implement robust consumer protection measures, ensuring that investors are safeguarded against fraud, manipulation, and other illicit activities within the digital asset markets. Market Integrity: By establishing clear rules for exchanges, brokers, and other intermediaries, the act intends to enhance market integrity and reduce systemic risks. Innovation: A well-defined regulatory environment can encourage innovation by providing businesses with the confidence to build and operate within the U.S. without fear of arbitrary enforcement actions. The support from Democrats for this bill signals a bipartisan desire to bring order to what has often been described as the ‚ÄòWild West‚Äô of finance. It‚Äôs a move that could significantly bolster the U.S.‚Äôs position as a leader in financial technology. The Push for a Stablecoin Bill : What is the GENIUS Act ? Beyond the broader digital asset framework, there‚Äôs also significant movement on stablecoin regulation. The same source cited by Eleanor Terrett indicated that an even larger contingent of Democratic lawmakers ‚Äì between 70 and 80 ‚Äì are expected to vote in favor of the stablecoin bill , known as the GENIUS Act . Stablecoins, digital assets pegged to the value of traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, have become a cornerstone of the crypto economy, facilitating trades and offering a bridge between fiat and digital currencies. The importance of regulating stablecoins cannot be overstated. Their stability is crucial for the broader crypto market, and their potential use in mainstream payments and remittances necessitates a robust regulatory framework. The GENIUS Act is expected to address key aspects such as: Issuance Requirements: Establishing clear rules for who can issue stablecoins and what reserves they must hold to back their value. Redemption Rights: Ensuring that stablecoin holders have clear and reliable mechanisms to redeem their tokens for the underlying fiat currency. Oversight: Designating which regulatory bodies will oversee stablecoin issuers and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. The strong bipartisan support for the GENIUS Act suggests a consensus on the need to manage the risks associated with stablecoins while harnessing their potential benefits for the financial system. What are the Implications of Enhanced Crypto Regulation US ? The potential passage of the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act carries profound implications for the entire crypto ecosystem, both domestically and globally. Here are some key areas that could see significant impact: Area of Impact Potential Benefits Potential Challenges Investor Confidence Increased trust, attracting traditional investors. Initial market volatility as new rules are absorbed. Industry Innovation Clear guidelines foster responsible development and growth. Compliance costs for smaller startups. U.S. Competitiveness Positions U.S. as a leader in digital asset innovation. Risk of over-regulation stifling growth if not balanced. Market Stability Reduced risk of major market disruptions, especially from stablecoins. Adapting to new operational standards. The push for these bills reflects a growing consensus that the U.S. needs to establish itself as a leader in the digital asset space, rather than lagging behind other jurisdictions that have already implemented clearer frameworks. The Path Forward for the CLARITY Act and US Digital Assets While the reported Democratic support is a significant step, the legislative process is complex and often unpredictable. The CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act still need to navigate potential amendments, debates, and votes in both the House and the Senate before reaching the President‚Äôs desk. However, the indication of bipartisan momentum is a strong positive signal for the crypto industry. This development suggests that lawmakers are increasingly recognizing the economic potential of digital assets, alongside the imperative to manage their associated risks. It‚Äôs a testament to the persistent advocacy from the crypto community and a growing understanding among policymakers of the technology‚Äôs transformative power. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights Stay Informed: Follow legislative developments closely. The passage of these bills could significantly alter how you interact with digital assets. Understand the Bills: Familiarize yourself with the key provisions of the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act to anticipate their impact on your investments or business. Engage with Policymakers: If you‚Äôre passionate about crypto, consider reaching out to your representatives to voice your support for thoughtful regulation. The anticipated votes represent more than just legislative action; they symbolize a maturing conversation around digital assets in Washington. It‚Äôs a move towards a future where innovation and regulation can coexist, providing a stable foundation for the next generation of financial technology. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto in America? The impending votes on the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act, backed by a significant number of Democratic lawmakers, mark a potentially transformative moment for crypto regulation US . This bipartisan momentum signals a collective desire to move beyond uncertainty and establish a robust, clear framework for digital assets and stablecoins. If successful, these legislative efforts could unlock unprecedented innovation, enhance investor protection, and solidify the United States‚Äô position as a global leader in the digital economy. The path ahead remains challenging, but the current signals suggest a promising trajectory towards a more regulated and mature crypto market in America.

According to sources familiar with the matter, both experts will join Meta‚Äôs Superintelligence Labs team. Lee has already started his new role, while Gunter is set to begin in the coming days. The tech giant‚Äôs action demonstrates a growing trend in the tech ecosystem involving stiff competition for AI talent. Additionally, it has been very proactive in its staff recruitment. Meta increases its workforce with AI experts from Apple Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has demonstrated a strong commitment to artificial intelligence, motivated by its surging global demand. His dedication is evident in the company‚Äôs heavy investments in AI, the recruitment of top AI talent , and a substantial boost in spending on data centers. With this, the company aims to cement its position as the leader in AI, beating up its rivals such as OpenAI and Google. Following the tech firm‚Äôs hiring move, the company recruited Ruoming Pang, former head of Apple‚Äôs Foundation Models team, early in the month. The tech company offered him a significant salary package of $200 million to win Pang, effective for several years. Coincidentally, Pang teamed up with Gunter and Lee at Apple, who have also left the company for Zuckerberg‚Äôs company. In addition, the two were the longest-serving members in Pang‚Äôs team. Lee was his first worker at Apple. On the other hand, Gunter was a reputable engineer in the firm. After departing from Apple, Gunter accepted a job offer from another AI company but stepped down from that role following Meta‚Äôs offer. Meta‚Äôs recent hires demonstrate an ongoing disorder in the Apple Foundation Models (AFM) team. The team is responsible for creating an effective technology useful in generative AI. The AFM team is also facing uncertainties due to the company‚Äôs AI executives‚Äô decision to initiate external models into their operations as a solution to improve its Siri voice assistant, among other Apple Intelligence features. AI Senior Vice President John Giannandrea is among the AI executives at Apple. Under the research leader Daphne Luong, the team is weighing some strategic changes with Mike Rockwell and Craig Federighi, software leaders currently overseeing Siri. Neither Meta‚Äôs spokesperson nor Apple replied to a request for comment. Meta offers Apple‚Äôs employees significant salary packages Apple is developing parallel versions of its voice assistant using in-house AI models and third-party technologies to deliver long-promised enhancements to Siri , such as leveraging personal data to fulfill user queries. However, before its launch next spring, the company must decide which software backbone will power the revamped assistant. Meta has seized on Apple‚Äôs internal indecision by aggressively recruiting its AI talent with highly lucrative job offers. In many instances, Meta offers several times higher salaries than Apple‚Äôs compensation for engineers in its Apple Foundation Models group. In response, Apple has begun issuing raises to select members of the roughly 100-person team to retain the talent. Yet, those counteroffers pale compared to what Meta compared to the table. One high-profile defector, Gunter, is among several AI specialists receiving multiyear compensation packages exceeding $100 million. Mark Zuckerberg underscored Meta‚Äôs ambitions earlier this week, posting on Threads that the company plans to ‚Äúinvest hundreds of billions of dollars into computers to build superintelligence‚Äù‚Äîa nod to AI that surpasses human capabilities. At Meta‚Äôs Menlo Park headquarters, some of its top AI recruits have been strategically seated near Zuckerberg to enable close collaboration on the company‚Äôs most critical AI initiatives.

This pivotal moment, reported by Infinity Hedge via Telegram, marks a substantial stride towards clarity and regulation in the burgeoning digital asset space. What does this mean for the future of digital finance? What is the US Stablecoin Bill? At its core, the US Stablecoin Bill aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a critical component of the digital asset ecosystem. These cryptocurrencies are designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific fiat currency, like the U.S. dollar, or a basket of assets. The Genius Act seeks to provide much-needed clarity for issuers, users, and regulators alike, moving away from the current patchwork of state and federal interpretations. Defining Stablecoins: The bill aims to create a clear legal definition for stablecoins, differentiating them from other cryptocurrencies. Issuance Requirements: It proposes standards for stablecoin issuers, potentially requiring them to hold reserves in safe, liquid assets to back the stablecoins in circulation. Consumer Protection: A key focus is on safeguarding consumers by ensuring transparency and stability within the stablecoin market. Why is Crypto Regulation Crucial Now? The rapid growth of the crypto market, coupled with past incidents of instability and fraud, has underscored the urgent need for robust crypto regulation . Without clear guidelines, innovation can be stifled, and consumer protection remains a significant concern. This bill represents an effort to balance fostering innovation with safeguarding financial stability and preventing illicit activities. For years, the industry has called for a clear rulebook, and this legislation is a direct response to that demand. Benefits of Clear Crypto Regulation: Increased Investor Confidence: A regulated environment can attract more traditional investors and institutions, viewing crypto as a safer asset class. Market Stability: Rules around reserves and issuance can help prevent ‚Äòruns‚Äô on stablecoins, similar to bank runs. Innovation with Guardrails: While regulation can be perceived as restrictive, clear rules can actually provide a stable foundation for legitimate businesses to innovate and grow. Impact on Digital Asset Legislation and the Market The passage of this bill is a landmark event for digital asset legislation . It signals a growing recognition within the U.S. government of the permanence and potential of cryptocurrencies. For the market, this could mean increased institutional adoption, greater liquidity, and a more predictable environment for businesses operating with stablecoins. It could also set a precedent for how other digital assets might be regulated in the future. Potential Market Implications: Aspect Before Genius Act After Genius Act (Potential) Regulatory Clarity Fragmented, uncertain Defined, predictable framework Investor Trust Variable, subject to perception Increased due to oversight Institutional Adoption Cautious, limited Potentially accelerated The Genius Act: A Closer Look at its Provisions What exactly does the Genius Act entail? While full details are still emerging, early reports suggest it addresses key areas to ensure the stability and integrity of stablecoins. It is designed to prevent scenarios where stablecoins might de-peg from their intended value, protecting both individual users and the broader financial system. Issuance Standards: Mandating that stablecoin issuers hold reserves in safe, liquid assets, akin to traditional financial institutions. This could include U.S. Treasury bills, cash, or highly liquid government securities. Redemption Rights: Ensuring that stablecoin holders have a clear, enforceable right to redeem their stablecoins for fiat currency at par (1:1). This is fundamental to maintaining trust. Supervisory Oversight: Granting specific regulatory bodies, potentially the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), or state banking regulators, clear oversight powers over stablecoin issuers and activities. Interoperability: Potentially promoting standards that allow different stablecoins to work together seamlessly, fostering a more efficient and integrated digital economy. What‚Äôs Next for US House Crypto Efforts? With the US House Crypto efforts yielding this significant bill, what comes next? The bill now moves to the Senate, where it will face further scrutiny and potential amendments. The legislative journey is far from over, but this House passage sets a strong precedent and indicates a bipartisan willingness to engage with digital asset policy. There may be debates over specific provisions, but the momentum for federal stablecoin regulation is clear. Challenges Ahead: Senate Approval: The Senate has its own priorities and perspectives on crypto regulation, and the bill may undergo significant changes. Inter-Agency Coordination: Ensuring that different regulatory bodies (e.g., SEC, CFTC, Treasury) are aligned on their approach to digital assets. Global Context: The U.S. approach will also be watched closely by other nations developing their own crypto frameworks, potentially influencing global standards. The passage of the Genius Act in the U.S. House of Representatives marks a watershed moment for stablecoins and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. It represents a significant step towards bringing regulatory clarity to a rapidly evolving industry, potentially unlocking new avenues for innovation and adoption while safeguarding consumers. While the path ahead remains dynamic, this legislative breakthrough signals a maturing dialogue around digital assets in the halls of power, paving the way for a more integrated and secure digital financial future.

The core inflation figure excludes fresh food, which fluctuates more due to weather and supply conditions. The most recent figures, published on Friday by Japan‚Äôs Internal Affairs Ministry, were generally in line with the forecasts of economists polled by Reuters. The headline inflation rate covers all categories and was down to 3.3% in June from 3.5% in May. Nonetheless, it is the 39th straight month that inflation has exceeded the Bank of Japan‚Äôs (BOJ) 2% goal. A broader measure, the so-called ‚Äúcore-core‚Äù rate of inflation, which excludes not only fresh food but also energy prices, rose to 3.4% from 3.3% the previous month. It‚Äôs regarded as the benchmark for underlying inflation trends and is closely monitored by the BOJ. While inflation has slowed, prices are still high compared with previous years, and the public continues to bear an increasing cost of living. Rice prices begin to stabilize A key driver of recent Japanese inflation has been rice, a staple in virtually every household. In May, rice prices had surged more than 101.7% year-on-year, the steepest jump in over 50 years. But that rate slowed a bit in June. The 100.2% year-on-year jump in the price of rice was the first indication of a let-up in months. The relaxation came after the government released rice stockpiles earlier this year to cool prices. The intervention helped shore up supply and dampen speculation in the market. However, prices are still high, and officials warn that the ripples of that bad harvest in 2023 are still being felt. The 2023 harvest season was affected by abnormal weather, including typhoons and record heat that cut output in the main rice regions. Although the current trend is promising, according to experts, a return to stable rice prices will depend on the 2025 harvest, which is still unknown. Trump‚Äôs tariffs threaten Japan‚Äôs economic recovery The confidence data comes from Japan‚Äôs economy, which is increasingly clouded by external economic uncertainties . A big one is US trade policy. US President Donald Trump says he is not ready to strike a trade deal with Japan. That has stoked fears of additional tariffs that would damage Japanese exports, particularly of cars, the largest product that Japan ships to the United States. A 25% tariff on a broad swath of Japanese goods will go into effect on August 1, while a 25% levy on cars will remain in place. The introduction of these tariffs would come at a particularly challenging time for the Japanese economy. Japan has announced its GDP fell 0.2% in the first three months of 2025 compared to the previous quarter. It was the first contraction in a year, driven primarily by a steep export fall. The financial pressure is shaping up to be a significant issue ahead of next summer‚Äôs upper house elections, in which voters remain angered by the creeping prices but stagnant wages. The persisting inflation growth has some market participants speculating about the need for interest rate increases by the Bank of Japan. After all, the headline inflation rate has been above the 2% target for over three years. But the central bank remains wary. Bank of America analysts have said the BOJ will unlikely raise rates before January 2026. They say BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda targets inflation expectations, which remain below 2%. These expectations ‚Äî what businesses and households expect as future inflation ‚Äî are an important signal of whether inflation is genuinely embedded in the economy.

This development marks a pivotal moment for the crypto market, signaling a serious move towards establishing concrete regulatory guidelines for digital assets in the United States. For years, the industry has grappled with uncertainty, operating in a patchwork of regulations or, often, a regulatory vacuum. This legislation aims to change that, potentially reshaping how cryptocurrencies are traded, held, and developed. What Exactly is the Clarity Act? Unpacking the Core of US Crypto Law According to reports, including one from Unfolded on Telegram, the Clarity Act is designed to bring much-needed structure to the burgeoning crypto market. But what does that truly mean? While the specifics of the bill‚Äôs final text will define its full impact, its core objective is to provide a clear framework for digital assets, defining their legal status and establishing guidelines for market participants. This could involve: Defining Digital Asset Categories: Clarifying whether a specific cryptocurrency or token is a security, a commodity, or a new asset class entirely. This distinction is crucial as it determines which regulatory body (e.g., SEC or CFTC) has jurisdiction. Market Structure Guidelines: Establishing rules for crypto exchanges, custodians, and other service providers, potentially addressing issues like consumer protection, market manipulation, and operational resilience. Investor Protection: Implementing measures to safeguard investors from fraud and mismanagement, fostering greater trust in the digital asset ecosystem. The absence of clear US crypto law has long been a point of contention, leading to legal battles, compliance headaches, and a chilling effect on innovation. This act, therefore, represents a significant legislative attempt to address these long-standing issues. Why is Crypto Market Regulation So Important Right Now? The call for robust crypto market regulation has grown louder with the increasing mainstream adoption of digital assets. While the decentralized nature of crypto is a core tenet, it also presents unique challenges for oversight. Here‚Äôs why regulation is becoming indispensable: Investor Confidence: A regulated environment provides a sense of security for both retail and institutional investors. Clear rules can help prevent scams and provide recourse in case of malpractices, encouraging broader participation. Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions often shy away from markets lacking clear regulatory frameworks due to compliance risks. Defined regulations can pave the way for more traditional finance players to enter the crypto space, bringing significant capital and liquidity. Combating Illicit Activities: Regulation can help in monitoring and preventing the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities, enhancing the legitimacy of the overall market. Market Stability: Clear rules around market conduct, liquidity, and capital requirements can contribute to a more stable and predictable market environment, reducing volatility caused by speculative bubbles or systemic risks. The passage of the Clarity Act by the House underscores a growing consensus that the benefits of a regulated crypto market outweigh the risks of inaction. How Will the Clarity Act Shape Digital Asset Legislation? The Clarity Act is not an isolated event; it‚Äôs part of a larger, evolving narrative around digital asset legislation in the U.S. For years, various bills and proposals have been put forth, often with differing approaches to classifying and regulating cryptocurrencies. This act could serve as a foundational piece, influencing future legislative efforts and potentially harmonizing the fragmented regulatory landscape. Historically, the debate has often centered on whether digital assets fall under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as securities or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as commodities. The Clarity Act aims to provide a more definitive answer, which could reduce regulatory arbitrage and provide clarity for projects seeking to launch or operate in the U.S. This clarity is crucial for innovators, as it allows them to design their projects with a clear understanding of the legal requirements from the outset. Furthermore, this legislation could set a precedent for how other countries approach crypto regulation, potentially influencing global standards and fostering greater interoperability in the international digital asset ecosystem. What Does This Mean for the Future of Cryptocurrency Policy in the US? The passing of the Clarity Act by the House is a significant milestone, but it‚Äôs just one step in the complex legislative process. For it to become law, it must also pass the Senate and be signed by the President. This journey can be fraught with challenges, including potential amendments, differing opinions in the Senate, and the possibility of a presidential veto. However, the House‚Äôs action sends a strong signal regarding the direction of cryptocurrency policy in the U.S. It indicates a growing recognition among lawmakers of the need to move beyond enforcement actions and towards a comprehensive regulatory framework. This proactive approach, if successful, could: Foster Innovation: By providing clear rules, the U.S. could become a more attractive hub for blockchain and crypto innovation, as companies will have a better understanding of the legal landscape. Enhance Competitiveness: A well-defined regulatory environment can help the U.S. maintain its leadership in financial innovation globally, preventing companies from moving offshore due to regulatory uncertainty. Strengthen National Security: Clear rules can also help in integrating digital assets into existing financial crime prevention frameworks, enhancing national security efforts. The debate surrounding cryptocurrency policy is far from over, but the Clarity Act represents a tangible step towards a more structured and predictable future for digital assets in the U.S. Actionable Insights: Navigating the New Regulatory Landscape For individuals and entities involved in the crypto space, the passing of the Clarity Act by the House necessitates attention and preparation. While the final law is yet to be enacted, understanding its potential implications is key: For Crypto Businesses and Startups: Begin assessing how your operations might align with potential new classifications of digital assets. Proactive engagement with legal counsel specializing in crypto law will be crucial to ensure future compliance. This could involve re-evaluating token structures, exchange listings, and marketing practices. For Investors: Stay informed about the legislative process and how potential regulations might affect the assets you hold. Increased regulation could bring more stability and legitimacy to certain assets, while others might face stricter compliance burdens. Diversification and thorough due diligence remain paramount. For Developers and Innovators: While regulations might seem restrictive, they can also provide a stable foundation for building. Clear rules can unlock new avenues for institutional partnerships and mainstream adoption, allowing for more robust and compliant decentralized applications (dApps). The landscape is shifting, and adaptability will be key. This is an opportune time to engage with industry associations and policy discussions to ensure your voice is heard as these crucial regulations take shape. Conclusion: A New Chapter for the Crypto Market The U.S. House‚Äôs passage of the Clarity Act marks a significant turning point for the crypto market. It signifies a decisive move towards bringing order and predictability to an industry that has long operated in the shadows of regulatory ambiguity. While the journey to becoming law is still ahead, this legislation underscores a growing governmental recognition of digital assets‚Äô importance and the urgent need for a clear, comprehensive cryptocurrency policy . This act has the potential to unlock new levels of institutional investment, enhance investor protection, and solidify the U.S.‚Äôs position as a leader in financial innovation. The future of crypto in the U.S. is poised for a new chapter, one that promises greater clarity, stability, and growth. Staying informed and adaptable will be crucial as this landmark legislation continues its path through the halls of power.

Even if your primary focus is on digital assets, understanding the broader economic landscape, particularly the U.S. Stock Market , is absolutely vital. Today‚Äôs news brings a wave of optimism from Wall Street, with all three major U.S. stock market indices closing higher. This positive movement isn‚Äôt just a win for traditional investors; it carries significant implications for the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Let‚Äôs dive into what these gains mean and how they might ripple through the crypto space. U.S. Stock Market Surges: A Closer Look at Key Market Indices The latest closing bell brought smiles to investors as the major U.S. Stock Market indices registered impressive gains. This broad-based rally signals a strong appetite for risk and potentially a brighter outlook on the economy. Here‚Äôs a quick snapshot of how the key Market Indices performed: Index Performance S&P 500 +0.59% Nasdaq Composite +0.74% Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.52% These figures represent a collective sigh of relief and renewed enthusiasm among investors. The S&P 500, often seen as the broadest measure of U.S. stock market health, showed solid growth. The Dow Jones, home to 30 large, publicly-traded companies, also contributed positively, indicating strength in established industries. But it was the Nasdaq Performance that particularly caught the eye, leading the pack with its robust gains. Why Are These Market Indices Rising Now? Understanding the catalysts behind these gains is crucial. Several factors typically contribute to a positive day on Wall Street, and today was no exception. Often, such upticks are driven by a combination of: Positive Economic Data: Favorable inflation reports, strong employment figures, or better-than-expected GDP growth can signal a healthy economy, boosting corporate earnings prospects. Strong Corporate Earnings: When major companies report profits that exceed analyst expectations, it instills confidence in their future performance and the broader market. Optimistic Central Bank Outlook: Hints from the Federal Reserve about potential interest rate cuts or a less aggressive tightening policy can make borrowing cheaper and stimulate economic activity. Geopolitical Stability: A reduction in global tensions or uncertainty can lead investors to take on more risk, moving capital into equities. While the exact combination of factors can vary daily, the general sentiment indicates that investors are finding reasons to be optimistic about the economic trajectory, which directly influences the performance of these major Market Indices . How Does This Boost Investor Confidence? When the stock market performs well, it naturally cultivates a stronger sense of Investor Confidence . This isn‚Äôt just about financial gains; it‚Äôs about the psychological impact on market participants. Here‚Äôs why rising markets are so powerful: Positive Feedback Loop: Gains encourage more investment, which can lead to further gains, creating a virtuous cycle. Wealth Effect: As portfolios grow, individuals often feel wealthier and more inclined to spend, which can stimulate the economy. Reduced Fear: A rising market can alleviate fears of recession or economic downturns, making investors more willing to take on riskier assets. This heightened Investor Confidence isn‚Äôt confined to traditional equities. It can create a ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô environment where capital flows into various asset classes, including those perceived as higher risk, such as cryptocurrencies. Nasdaq Performance: A Bellwether for Tech and Growth The Nasdaq Performance , in particular, often serves as a crucial indicator for growth-oriented assets. Comprising a large number of technology and innovative companies, the Nasdaq Composite‚Äôs strong showing suggests that investors are increasingly comfortable with risk and are willing to bet on future growth potential. For crypto enthusiasts, the Nasdaq‚Äôs movements are especially relevant: Correlation with Tech Stocks: Many cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, have historically shown some correlation with tech stocks, as both are often seen as ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô assets. Innovation Driver: A strong Nasdaq implies a healthy environment for innovation and technological advancement, themes that resonate deeply within the crypto space. Institutional Interest: Tech companies and the institutions that invest in them are increasingly exploring blockchain and digital assets. A confident tech sector might signal more institutional capital flowing into crypto. Observing the Nasdaq Performance can therefore offer valuable clues about the broader appetite for speculative and growth-oriented investments, which directly impacts the digital asset landscape. The Crucial Crypto Market Impact: What Does This Mean for Your Digital Assets? Now for the million-dollar question: what is the direct Crypto Market Impact of this positive traditional market performance? While the relationship isn‚Äôt always straightforward, there are several ways the rising U.S. Stock Market could influence your crypto portfolio: Potential Positive Correlations: Risk-On Sentiment: When traditional markets are booming, investors often feel more comfortable taking on risk. This ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô sentiment can lead to capital flowing from safer assets into higher-volatility assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Liquidity Inflow: Increased wealth in the stock market can mean more disposable income for investors, some of which might be allocated to crypto. Macroeconomic Optimism: A positive economic outlook that boosts stocks also tends to benefit all growth assets, including digital currencies. Considerations and Nuances: Decoupling Potential: While correlations exist, the crypto market also has its own unique drivers, such as regulatory news, technological advancements (e.g., Ethereum upgrades, new dApps), and specific adoption trends. There are times when crypto can decouple from traditional markets. Flight to Safety: Conversely, in times of extreme traditional market downturns, some investors might view Bitcoin as a ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô or safe haven, leading to an inverse correlation. However, this has been less consistent in recent years. Regulatory Environment: The evolving regulatory landscape for crypto, particularly in the U.S., plays a significant role independent of stock market performance. In essence, a rising tide lifts all boats, and a strong U.S. Stock Market often creates a more favorable environment for speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. It signals a broader comfort with risk and an optimistic economic outlook, which are generally bullish indicators for digital assets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the positive signals from the traditional markets, what should crypto investors consider? Monitor Macro Trends: Don‚Äôt just focus on crypto charts. Keep an eye on inflation data, interest rate decisions, and major economic reports. These can significantly influence both traditional and crypto markets. Diversify Wisely: While a rising tide can lift all boats, not all digital assets will perform equally. Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio and balancing it with other asset classes if appropriate for your risk tolerance. Stay Informed on Nasdaq Performance: As a bellwether for tech and growth, the Nasdaq‚Äôs movements can often provide early signals for broader risk appetite that could spill into crypto. Long-Term Vision: Remember that both stock and crypto markets are subject to volatility. Focus on long-term investment strategies rather than short-term fluctuations. Concluding Thoughts: Riding the Wave of Renewed Confidence The strong close of the U.S. Stock Market indices‚ÄîS&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow‚Äîmarks a significant moment of renewed Investor Confidence . This positive momentum, particularly highlighted by the robust Nasdaq Performance , sends a powerful signal across the financial landscape. While the Crypto Market Impact is multifaceted and not always directly proportional, a healthy traditional market environment generally fosters a ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô sentiment that can benefit digital assets. As investors, staying attuned to these broader market movements is key to navigating the interconnected world of finance and making informed decisions in your crypto journey. The current climate suggests a fertile ground for growth, but vigilance remains paramount.

In a truly remarkable turn of events, Bitcoin price has not just broken a new barrier but has absolutely soared, crossing the monumental $120,000 mark . This isn‚Äôt just another incremental gain; it‚Äôs a significant milestone that has captured the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts worldwide. According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, and confirmed by trading data on the Binance USDT market where BTC is currently trading at $120,000 , this ascent signals a powerful shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. What exactly is fueling this incredible climb, and what does it mean for the future of the cryptocurrency market ? The Unprecedented Rise: What Propelled Bitcoin Price Beyond $120,000? For weeks, anticipation has been building, and now, the Bitcoin price has delivered a stunning performance. This wasn‚Äôt a sudden spike out of nowhere; it‚Äôs the culmination of several converging factors that have created a perfect storm for growth. Understanding these catalysts is key to grasping the magnitude of this achievement. Institutional Adoption and ETF Inflows: The approval and subsequent launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the floodgates for institutional capital. These vehicles provide a regulated and accessible way for large funds and traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, significantly increasing demand. Halving Narrative: With the Bitcoin halving event on the horizon, the inherent scarcity mechanism of Bitcoin is becoming more pronounced. Historically, halvings have preceded significant bull runs, as the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation is cut in half, reducing supply against potentially rising demand. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions, often drive investors towards alternative assets. Bitcoin, increasingly seen as a ‚Äòdigital gold,‚Äô benefits from this flight to safety and a hedge against traditional financial instability. Growing Retail Interest: Beyond institutions, a resurgence in retail investor interest is evident. Social media trends, mainstream media coverage, and the ‚Äòfear of missing out‚Äô (FOMO) phenomenon are bringing new participants into the market, adding to the buying pressure. Technological Advancements: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability solutions and broader utility, also contribute to its long-term appeal and perceived value. Understanding the Mechanics of This Monumental BTC Rally A BTC rally of this scale is not merely about price; it‚Äôs about the underlying market mechanics and the psychological shifts that accompany such rapid growth. The move past $120,000 reflects robust buying pressure and a strong belief among participants in Bitcoin‚Äôs continued appreciation. Market dynamics at play include: Supply-Demand Imbalance: The available supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has been steadily decreasing, indicating that holders are opting to HODL (hold on for dear life) rather than sell. Coupled with increased demand from ETFs and retail investors, this creates a classic supply-demand imbalance pushing prices higher. Liquidity and Market Depth: The market has demonstrated impressive depth, absorbing large buy orders without significant price resistance, suggesting strong underlying liquidity and confidence. Positive Feedback Loop: As prices rise, more positive news emerges, attracting even more investors, which in turn fuels further price increases. This creates a powerful positive feedback loop. Let‚Äôs consider some key factors driving the current BTC rally : Factor Description Impact on Price Spot Bitcoin ETFs Regulated investment vehicles allowing traditional investors easy access to BTC. Significant capital inflow, increased legitimacy. Bitcoin Halving Event reducing the supply of new Bitcoin by half every four years. Creates scarcity, historically bullish. Global Macro Trends Inflation, interest rates, geopolitical stability. Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Network Development Ongoing improvements to Bitcoin‚Äôs infrastructure and utility. Enhances long-term value proposition. Wider Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market Bitcoin‚Äôs performance rarely stays isolated. This significant Bitcoin surge has ripple effects across the entire cryptocurrency market . When Bitcoin rallies, it often pulls the rest of the market with it, albeit with varying degrees of intensity. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ‚Äòaltcoin season‚Äô if Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance stabilizes or slightly recedes after its initial surge, allowing capital to flow into other digital assets. Is This the Dawn of a New Crypto Bull Cycle? Many analysts believe that Bitcoin breaking through key resistance levels and establishing new all-time highs could signal the beginning of a sustained bull market. This isn‚Äôt just about price; it‚Äôs about renewed confidence, increased development activity, and a broader acceptance of digital assets in the global financial landscape. Regulatory bodies are also paying closer attention, which, while sometimes leading to challenges, also indicates a growing recognition of crypto‚Äôs permanence. Navigating the Bitcoin Surge: Opportunities and Risks While the excitement around the Bitcoin surge is palpable, it‚Äôs crucial for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. Every significant price movement presents both opportunities for gains and inherent risks that must be managed. Opportunities: Potential for Further Gains: If the current momentum continues and underlying fundamentals remain strong, there could be further upside for Bitcoin. Portfolio Diversification: For traditional investors, Bitcoin can offer a non-correlated asset class that can help diversify a portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk. Innovation and Ecosystem Growth: A rising Bitcoin price often fuels innovation within the broader crypto ecosystem, leading to new projects, applications, and technological advancements. Risks: Volatility: Bitcoin is notorious for its price swings. While the trend is currently upward, sharp corrections can occur rapidly, leading to significant paper losses for those not prepared. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. New laws or restrictions in major economies could impact market sentiment and price. Market Corrections: No asset moves up in a straight line forever. A correction after such a significant surge is a natural part of market cycles. What Should Investors Do Amidst This Bitcoin Surge? For both seasoned and new investors, a few actionable insights can help navigate these exciting times: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on hype. Understand Bitcoin‚Äôs technology, use cases, and market dynamics. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders or have a clear exit strategy to protect your capital. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest crypto news , market analysis, and regulatory developments. Knowledge is power in this fast-moving space. Beyond the Headlines: What Does This Crypto News Really Mean? The latest crypto news of Bitcoin hitting $120,000 is more than just a number; it‚Äôs a testament to the digital asset‚Äôs growing maturity and its undeniable presence in the global financial conversation. This milestone reflects a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value and a viable investment asset, moving beyond its early days as a niche technology. Looking ahead, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains robust. As global economies continue to digitize and demand for decentralized, permissionless financial systems grows, Bitcoin‚Äôs foundational role is likely to strengthen. The journey to $120,000 has been exhilarating, and it sets the stage for what could be an even more transformative period for digital assets. In conclusion, Bitcoin‚Äôs ascent past $120,000 is a landmark achievement, driven by a confluence of institutional adoption, scarcity narratives, and shifting macroeconomic tides. While the excitement is warranted, investors should remain vigilant, understanding both the immense opportunities and the inherent risks. This milestone solidifies Bitcoin‚Äôs position at the forefront of financial innovation and signals a potentially thrilling new chapter for the entire cryptocurrency market.

Renowned crypto analyst and trader, Ali Martinez, recently shared insights on X, highlighting the formation of a ‚Äògolden cross‚Äô on one of XRP‚Äôs most crucial on-chain metrics: the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator. This development has captivated investors, especially given historical precedents that suggest an extraordinary surge could be on the horizon for the digital asset. Understanding the MVRV Indicator and the Golden Cross Phenomenon To truly grasp the significance of this development, it‚Äôs essential to understand the tools at play. The MVRV indicator is a powerful on-chain metric that provides deep insights into the profitability status of investors. It achieves this by comparing the current market capitalization of an asset with its ‚Äòrealized capitalization,‚Äô which essentially represents the average price at which all coins in circulation were last moved. In simpler terms, it shows whether the market as a whole is in profit or loss. Market Value (MV): This is the current market capitalization of the asset, calculated by multiplying the current price by the total circulating supply. Realized Value (RV): This represents the aggregate cost basis of all coins in circulation. It‚Äôs the sum of the prices at which each coin last moved on the blockchain. MVRV Ratio: The ratio of Market Value to Realized Value. A ratio above 1 suggests that the market is, on average, in profit, while a ratio below 1 indicates an average loss. Now, what about the ‚Äògolden cross‚Äô? In technical analysis, a golden cross is a chart pattern that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, typically signaling a definitive uptrend. While often applied to price charts, its appearance on an on-chain indicator like MVRV is particularly potent, as it reflects underlying investor behavior and profitability trends rather than just speculative price movements. For XRP , this specific MVRV golden cross suggests a fundamental shift in investor sentiment and profitability from a bearish to a bullish outlook. Ali Martinez‚Äôs Insights: The Historical Precedent for XRP Price Action The analyst Ali Martinez‚Äôs observation is not just about the current formation; it‚Äôs about the historical context that gives this signal its weight. Martinez pointed out that when this exact MVRV golden cross pattern appeared in the past for XRP, the results were nothing short of spectacular. Historically, such formations have preceded significant upward movements, with one notable instance seeing the XRP price surge by an astounding 630%. This historical performance naturally fuels optimism and raises questions about whether history is set to repeat itself. The MVRV indicator‚Äôs ability to gauge the overall profitability of the XRP holder base makes it a strong predictor of potential market moves. When the MVRV ratio starts to trend upwards, especially with a golden cross formation, it implies that more investors are moving into profit, reducing the likelihood of widespread selling and increasing the potential for further price appreciation as confidence builds. What Does This Bullish Signal Mean for XRP Holders? For current and prospective XRP holders, the emergence of this bullish signal is a cause for considerable excitement. It suggests that the underlying fundamentals, as reflected by on-chain investor behavior, are aligning for a positive price trajectory. At the time of this report, XRP was trading at $3.43, having already seen an impressive 11.76% increase, according to CoinMarketCap. This immediate positive reaction to the news underscores the market‚Äôs responsiveness to such strong technical indicators. A golden cross on the MVRV indicator implies that the aggregate cost basis of XRP holders is now significantly below the current market price, meaning a vast majority are in profit. This creates a psychological environment where holders are less likely to panic sell and more likely to hold for further gains, or even accumulate more, contributing to upward price pressure. This strong profitability signal often precedes periods of significant growth, acting as a self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Crypto Analysis While the bullish signal is undeniably exciting, it‚Äôs crucial for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. No indicator guarantees future performance, and the crypto market remains volatile. However, the MVRV golden cross provides a strong analytical foundation for considering potential moves. Monitor Volume: A sustained increase in trading volume alongside the price surge would further validate the strength of this bullish signal. Watch for Resistance Levels: Identify key resistance levels from previous price highs. Breaking these levels with conviction would confirm the uptrend. Diversification: Even with strong signals, it‚Äôs always prudent to maintain a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on broader market sentiment and any news regarding Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal battles, which can significantly impact XRP‚Äôs trajectory. This deep dive into on-chain metrics, specifically the MVRV indicator, offers a powerful lens through which to perform effective crypto analysis . It moves beyond simple price charts to reveal the underlying health and sentiment of the investor base. Is a 630% Surge for XRP Realistic? The prospect of a 630% surge for XRP is, understandably, the most tantalizing aspect of Ali Martinez‚Äôs analysis. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the historical correlation provides a compelling narrative. Such a surge would propel XRP into unprecedented price territories, potentially reaching over $20 from its current levels. Achieving this would require sustained buying pressure, positive market sentiment, and perhaps favorable regulatory developments. It‚Äôs important to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a myriad of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. However, the MVRV golden cross provides a strong technical and on-chain foundation for such an optimistic outlook, suggesting that the underlying investor base is positioned for significant profitability. This is a moment where technical analysis, combined with on-chain data, offers a rare glimpse into potentially explosive growth. Conclusion: A Golden Opportunity for XRP? The appearance of a golden cross on XRP‚Äôs MVRV indicator, as highlighted by Ali Martinez, represents a truly significant development for the digital asset. With historical data pointing to massive surges following similar patterns, the potential for XRP price appreciation is undeniably high. While the crypto market always carries inherent risks, the confluence of a strong on-chain signal and historical precedent creates a compelling narrative for a potentially monumental rally. Investors and enthusiasts alike will be watching closely to see if XRP can indeed replicate its past performance and deliver the explosive growth many are now anticipating.

Trump is expected to sign an executive order as early as this week that would allow 401(k) plans to include a broader set of alternative assets, the Financial Times reported Friday. This order would instruct US regulatory agencies to study and remove any remaining barriers preventing professionally managed retirement funds from offering exposure to asset classes beyond traditional stocks and bonds. These would include digital assets, precious metals, corporate debt, infrastructure funds and private equity vehicles. FT Exclusive: The US president is expected to sign an executive order that would open up 401k plans to alternative investments beyond traditional stocks and bonds, according to people briefed on Trump's plans. https://t.co/M4RCM0Vq7t pic.twitter.com/mY3w0ZiHyG ‚Äî Financial Times (@FT) July 17, 2025 Trump Seeks to Modernize 401(k)s by Expanding Beyond Stocks and Bonds The shift marks a pivotal moment for US retirement policy. Currently, 401(k) plans allow workers to invest part of their salaries in tax-advantaged public securities, but most options remain limited to conventional stock and bond mutual funds. By broadening this scope, the Trump administration aims to align retirement planning with evolving market dynamics. This latest move also accelerates the president‚Äôs ongoing campaign to legitimize crypto within mainstream financial systems. Trump has positioned himself as a pro-crypto leader, campaigning on deregulating digital assets and publicly crediting the industry for helping deliver his 2024 election win. Wave Of Trump-Supported Crypto Bills Signals Push To Ease Rules This week, the House of Representatives passed three crypto-related bills strongly backed by the Trump administration. The votes followed a late-night meeting between Trump and lawmakers that helped resolve a procedural gridlock just two days prior. Together, the legislation reflects a broader effort to support digital finance and remove regulatory roadblocks. The administration has already taken early steps toward integrating crypto with retirement savings. In May, the Department of Labor rescinded a Biden-era policy that discouraged 401(k) plan administrators from offering crypto options . Trump‚Äôs executive order would take that effort further by encouraging regulatory clarity and legal protections. Wall Street Firms Prepare for Wave of Retirement-Fueled Capital For the private capital industry, the proposed changes could prove transformative. The order is expected to instruct the Labor Department to explore ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù provisions for retirement plan administrators, shielding them from liability when offering more complex, less liquid investments like private equity and infrastructure funds. Firms such as Blackstone, Apollo and BlackRock have already signaled strong interest in expanding access to the retirement market. With hundreds of billions of dollars potentially flowing into alternative investments, many of these firms have started forming alliances with major asset managers to prepare for a shift in retail capital. If implemented, the order could reshape the financial landscape by giving average Americans exposure to asset classes once reserved for institutions and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. However, critics caution that such investments often carry higher fees and are harder to value, making consumer protections and oversight critical. Still, the Trump administration sees this as a long-overdue update to a retirement system built for a different era.

Prices jumped past $123,000 this week. Now, new figures show that fresh money is flowing into the market again. That‚Äôs a sharp change after months of muted retail interest. Related Reading: Avalanche Shatters Record With 20M Transactions‚ÄîIs Real-World Use Finally Here? Fresh Capital Flooding In According to on‚Äëchain data from Glassnode, first‚Äëtime buyers picked up an extra 140,000‚ÄØBTC over the past two weeks. Their holdings climbed from 4.77‚ÄØmillion to nearly 5 million BTC‚Äîa 2.86% rise. That influx of fresh coins helped push Bitcoin past its latest high. It also shows that new investors are gaining confidence in the world‚Äôs biggest cryptocurrency. Over the past two weeks, the supply held by first-time $BTC buyers rose by +2.86%, climbing from 4.77M to 4.91M #BTC. Fresh capital continues to enter the market, supporting the latest price breakout. pic.twitter.com/W95HSAMaHI ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) July 17, 2025 Short‚ÄëTerm Holders Hit A New Cost Base Newer players aren‚Äôt the only ones getting active. Based on reports, entities that bought Bitcoin within the last six months now sit on a cost basis above $100,000 for the first time. They‚Äôve held on through price swings and have not yet sold at a loss. That suggests many expect the rally to continue. At the same time, holding on tight could create pressure if prices dip below their average buy‚Äëin point. Dip Buyers Act Fast Glassnode‚Äôs cost‚Äëbasis heatmap revealed that buyers moved quickly when Bitcoin dipped below $116,000 earlier this week. About 196,600‚ÄØBTC changed hands between $116,000 and $118,000. That buying spree added over $23 million in value near what looks like a local top. It‚Äôs a sign of strong resolve from those backing the market at lower levels. Altcoin Chat Outpaces Bitcoin Searches While whales and newer buyers are busy, the crowd on Google seems less thrilled. Search activity for ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù ticked up modestly in the last fortnight, but it‚Äôs well below the highs seen when BTC first broke $100,000 this year. At the same time, data from Santiment indicate chatter has shifted toward altcoins. With Ethereum grabbing the spotlight, many retail investors appear more excited by tokens promising bigger short‚Äëterm moves.

Riding this momentum, Bittensor (TAO) is gaining traction as experts forecast a sharp climb toward $779 by 2025, powered by its AI-based model. BONK is also heating up, with strong trading activity and record-setting launchpad revenue placing it back in the spotlight. At the same time, BlockDAG has launched a NO VESTING PASS that unlocks 100% of purchased coins at launch, only 8 days remain.This comes with a discounted price of $0.0016 and has already pushed BlockDAG past the $340.5 million funding mark. Early batches have seen 2,660% returns, positioning BDAG as a top crypto coin to buy now. Bittensor Price Prediction: $779 Forecast as AI Demand Rises Bittensor (TAO) is in the spotlight again, especially after attracting $17.5 million in backing from major firms since June 2025. The current price is near $437, but analysts predict it could climb to $779 in 2025 and possibly soar to $5,915 by 2030. This outlook stems from TAO‚Äôs innovative model, where daily rewards go directly to subnet builders creating AI applications inside its system. As AI adoption grows, Bittensor‚Äôs real-world use cases keep expanding. While there are still some risks from regulatory issues or market volatility, many believe the project has room to grow. Its AI-linked structure gives it staying power, with continued attention from crypto followers focused on long-term growth. BONK Price Forecast: $507M Activity Pushes New Targets BONK has been on an upward trend, gaining nearly 20% in the past week and trading around $0.000027. Market watchers are closely monitoring its rise as BONK‚Äôs launchpad posted $7.97 million in revenue in just one week, more than all other Solana launchpads combined. Its open interest has now topped $507 million, showing growing momentum and rising trader confidence. Looking ahead, analysts believe $0.000034 is the next resistance level. Technical indicators such as RSI and MACD remain bullish, though the overbought reading may signal a small correction before another move upward. Still, BONK‚Äôs volume and community backing make it one of the more active memecoins right now. BlockDAG‚Äôs Limited-time NO VESTING PASS Deal Adds Urgency to $340.5M Surge As Bitcoin reaches new highs, BlockDAG‚Äôs move to introduce a 10-day NO VESTING PASS is hitting the market at just the right moment. This unique offer lets buyers unlock 100% of the BDAG coins they purchase during this short window. While bonus coins remain locked, all regular purchases are fully accessible at launch, no delays, no partial unlocks. That‚Äôs a major shift in a space where most launches include long lock-up periods. This clear structure is helping BlockDAG attract attention fast. It has already raised over $340.5 million in presale and sold 23.9 billion coins. Buyers in earlier batches have seen gains of up to 2,660%, measured against the current Batch 29 price of $0.0276. Now, with BDAG priced at just $0.0016 until August 11, there‚Äôs a final shot to secure a steep discount before the price rises to the official $0.05 launch rate. That difference could mean a possible 3,025% return if targets are met. This short window, paired with full access, is rare in the crypto space. As interest builds and more coins get locked in daily, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a must-watch project. For anyone tracking the top crypto coins to buy now, BDAG is emerging as a serious contender. Summing It Up The crypto market is showing real movement again. Bittensor (TAO) is riding the AI wave with projections hitting $779, while BONK is gaining fast thanks to strong launchpad returns and a $507 million open interest. But it‚Äôs BlockDAG that‚Äôs creating the biggest shake-up. The 10-day NO VESTING PASS, the $0.0016 entry point, and its $340.5 million milestone make it hard to ignore. With 23.9 billion coins already sold and full access guaranteed at launch, the project offers a rare edge. If the question is which crypto coins to buy now, TAO, BONK, and BlockDAG each bring a powerful angle, but BDAG‚Äôs offer makes it the most immediate play.

On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $3,630 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,720 level. A clear move above the $3,720 resistance might send the price toward the $3,800 resistance. An upside break above the $3,800 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,880 resistance zone or even $4,000 in the near term. Are Downsides Limited In ETH?

A popular analyst who recently predicted the price surge said this is just the beginning. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView XRP‚Äôs all-time high is somewhat a controversial topic within the community, as different exchanges and data aggregators provide contrasting numbers. However, on most exchanges we could check, XRP blasted past the previous peak, which, according to CoinGecko, was set at $3.4. Data from CG now shows that the new record is at over $3.6, something that Coinbase, Binance, and Bitstamp concur. The XRP Army is also enjoying the moment, with big celebrations on X with multiple ‚ÄúI told you sos‚Äù and further massive price predictions. The market capitalization has also set a new record, somewhat expectedly, at beyond $210 billion. Ali Martinez, who indicated last week when XRP struggled at $2.2 that the asset is about to rip and most traders will miss it, also weighed in on the matter. The analyst with roughly $140,000 followers on X praised the move and outlined a certain metric that suggests further gains are around the corner. Previously, he noted that if XRP manages to close above $3 and break its all-time high, it could shoot up to $4.8. $XRP just hit a new all-time high and it‚Äôs just getting started! https://t.co/oPBcTCx4hV ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) July 17, 2025 The post XRP Skyrockets to New All-Time High and Analysts Believe It‚Äôs Just Getting Started appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,XRP|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|BTC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-07-18 03:23:21

The bill is set to bring clear rules for digital assets and will now head to Donald Trump for final approval. XRP price has officially broken past its previous all-time high of $3.40, hitting a new peak at $3.65 after a 20% rise. Now that XRP has broken above $3.40, a stronger rally could follow, with price targets at $3.80, $4.33, and even $4.72 in the coming weeks. On the downside, any rejection could pull XRP back toward the $2.90‚Äì$3.00 support zone. However, as long as XRP holds above this level, the bullish trend remains intact.

Why XRP Is Running Hard Liquidity Surge: Crypto markets have seen over $500B in capital return over the past two weeks, pushing Bitcoin to $123K and Ethereum to $3.4K. Lawsuit Settled: The Ripple vs. SEC case is largely behind us, with both sides having agreed to terms. ETF Speculation: Hopes for a U.S.-approved XRP ETF are growing, with odds over 85% by year-end. Institutional Buying: Big money is moving in‚Äîadoption of Ripple‚Äôs technology is increasing behind the scenes. Retail Buying Spree: Small investors are piling in, accelerating gains further with classic bull cycle behavior. Short-Term Outlook With XRP already at $3.62, a push to $5 by the end of July is no longer far-fetched. However, some profit-taking could cool the rally briefly, especially if XRP hits $3.80 .",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-18 03:39:48

Currently trading at $117,847, the asset has recorded nearly a 10% gain over the past week. The dip from peak levels, approximately a 4.1% decline, has not dampened broader investor sentiment, with several on-chain indicators suggesting renewed buying interest and reduced selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rebounds ‚Äì $0‚Äì$10K Transfer Volume Turns Positive Bitcoin Whale Withdrawals Decline, While Stablecoins Flow In In a recent analysis posted to CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform, analyst Amr Taha shared insights pointing to a strategic change in behavior among key Bitcoin holders and investors. The report, titled ‚ÄúStablecoin Flood and Whale Retreat: Binance Moves Foreshadow Risk-On Sentiment‚Äù, outlined significant trends in whale activity and stablecoin flows that may support continued bullish momentum in the near term. Taha‚Äôs research highlighted a steep reduction in whale-level Bitcoin deposits on Binance. Over the past 30 days, these deposits have dropped from $6.75 billion to $4.5 billion, a $2.25 billion decline. Historically, large deposits from whales to centralized exchanges often signal an intention to sell, so the recent drop may imply a reduction in immediate sell-side pressure. This could stabilize Bitcoin‚Äôs price in the short term, especially if whales continue to hold or move assets to cold storage instead of preparing them for sale. At the same time, stablecoin flows have increased dramatically across major exchanges. On July 16, Binance and HTX saw combined stablecoin inflows exceeding $1.7 billion. Taha interpreted this as an indication that large entities, possibly institutions or whales, are preparing to accumulate digital assets. Large stablecoin deposits often precede significant buying activity, suggesting that the market could be gearing up for another leg higher, particularly if paired with reduced sell-side movements. Macroeconomic Developments and Miner Sentiment Add Context This on-chain activity is unfolding amid broader economic and political developments. Taha‚Äôs report also pointed to speculation around President Donald Trump‚Äôs comments during a private meeting, in which he reportedly considered replacing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Though later denied, the remark sparked reactions in traditional markets, including a weaker dollar and rising bond yields. These shifts signaled a rotation into risk assets, potentially benefiting crypto markets as investors reallocate capital in anticipation of a more accommodative monetary stance. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Thesis ‚ÄòWill Retire Your Bloodline,‚Äô Says Expert Separately, CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain analyzed Bitcoin‚Äôs miner profitability using the Puell Multiple indicator. The data shows that while miners are currently making solid profits, the level has not reached historical peaks seen during prior market tops. In the 2017 and 2021 cycles, extreme miner profitability (indicated by Puell readings exceeding 2.0‚Äì3.0) often preceded sharp price corrections. At current levels, Arab Chain believes the market is not in a euphoric state, reducing the likelihood of imminent volatility due to miner-driven selloffs.

The company eyes a 6,000 BTC allocation and 1% of the total supply to become a major corporate Bitcoin holder. ‚ÄúFlywheel‚Äù strategy includes BTC accumulation, synthetic mining, and DeFi-linked revenue generation. Canadian Firm Plans Major Bitcoin Purchase Matador Technologies, a public company based in Canada, says it plans to grow its Bitcoin holdings to 6,000 BTC by 2027. The firm has also set a near-term goal of owning 1,000 BTC by 2026. The announcement marks a shift in pace for its crypto strategy. $MATA Board just green-lit our long-term #Bitcoin treasury strategy! 1,000 BTC by 2026‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ6,000 BTC by 2027 Goal: own ~1 % of Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply Current stash ‚âà 77.4 BTC BTC-denominated products ‚Üí more BTC on the balance sheet Matador Technologies ‚Äî shaping‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Matador Technologies (@buymatador) July 16, 2025 At present, Matador holds 77.4 BTC, which is worth roughly $9 million at today‚Äôs prices. Its long-term goal is to hold 1% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply. If reached, this would place the company among the top 20 corporate Bitcoin holders worldwide. CEO Deven Soni said the company is built around Bitcoin. ‚ÄúOur business is structured around Bitcoin as a core asset,‚Äù he stated. New Filing Supports Treasury Growth To support its plans, Matador filed a CA$900 million shelf prospectus on July 14. The filing will let the company raise funds over the next 25 months. Capital may come from equity offerings, convertible deals, asset sales, Bitcoin-backed loans, or new partnerships. Earlier this month, Matador received final approval from the TSX Venture Exchange to operate as a hybrid ‚Äútechnology/investment issuer.‚Äù This change gives the company more room to develop a Bitcoin-focused strategy while still working on blockchain-related projects. Strategy Focused on BTC Accumulation The company has described its approach as a ‚Äúcompounding flywheel‚Äù strategy. It includes growing its Bitcoin holdings, increasing BTC-per-share value, and using market volatility and synthetic mining to build yield. The plan also includes creating BTC-based revenue streams and working with DeFi and crypto infrastructure firms. Mark Moss, the company‚Äôs chief visionary officer, said the approach is aimed at long-term strength. ‚ÄúOur future plans to accumulate Bitcoin are designed to establish long-term stability on our balance sheet while reducing exposure to inflationary risk,‚Äù he said. Matador‚Äôs plans come during a rise in corporate Bitcoin ownership. Public and private companies now hold an estimated 1.15 million BTC. That total is around 6% of the current supply. Meanwhile, Strategy continues to lead with the largest BTC treasury, now worth more than $73 billion. Despite the announcement, Matador‚Äôs stock fell 4.65%, per Google Finance . Still, its shares remain up 37% since the beginning of the year.

In a market where volatility reigns supreme, meme tokens continue to flip narratives overnight. Some spike. Some fizzle. But the ones with real structure and community roots are quietly setting up for something much bigger. Over the last 24 hours, Brett saw a sharp 16.98% jump, reaching $0.06386 amid bullish trading. Popcat, another breakout meme contender, climbed 15.78% to settle at $0.4250 as investors cheered on strong support levels and a rise in volume. Amid this momentum, Troller Cat is carving out its own viral moment, without relying on short-term pumps. With over $350,000 raised, 1581.2% ROI already achieved, and a 15% price hike due within days, Troller Cat is fast becoming the best crypto to explode in 2025. Troller Cat ($TCAT): Viral Lore Meets Strategic Expansion Troller Cat is more than just a meme‚Äîit‚Äôs a storytelling ecosystem wrapped in a 26-stage presale. Each stage reflects an iconic troll moment in history, and Stage 13, known as ‚ÄúThe Friday Phenomenon,‚Äù embodies the transformation of ridicule into unstoppable virality. At the current Troller Cat presale price of $0.00008406, the coin has attracted over 1,300 holders and raised over $350,000 in presale funding alone. With a projected launch price of $0.0005309, anyone joining at Stage 13 stands to gain over 531.57% from today‚Äôs price. If a user invests $35,000 now, they could receive nearly 416 million $TCAT‚Äîpotentially worth $221,593 at launch. That doesn‚Äôt include staking rewards or referral bonuses, making the upside even greater for early participants. What really sets Troller Cat apart are its future plans and layered roadmap. Post-launch, Troller Cat will deploy its full Play-to-Earn Game Center, where ad revenue funds monthly token buybacks and burns. Future phases include NFT integration, governance voting for holders, and even cross-chain expansion. The roadmap ends with a tongue-in-cheek Phase 6: interstellar trolling. But behind the memes is a very real strategy aimed at long-term ecosystem value. This is what makes Troller Cat more than just a meme‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement engineered for growth. With phases mapped out to 2026 and beyond, it‚Äôs earning a spot as the best crypto to explode in 2025 by combining humor with robust infrastructure. Liquidity Lock and Transparency Trust is key in meme coin territory, and Troller Cat nails it on both fronts. Its liquidity will be locked for two full years upon launch, ensuring there‚Äôs no room for manipulation or sudden withdrawals. This lock gives holders confidence that their investment is backed by a stable pool with real protections in place. Transparency also takes center stage. Troller Cat offers a referral dashboard, real-time presale data, and transparent documentation on its audit and team verification processes. With a meme coin space often filled with red flags, $TCAT‚Äôs approach to clarity and safety gives it a serious edge for long-term believers. Brett ($BRETT): Riding a 17% Daily Pump With Eyes on Utility Brett is having a strong 24-hour run, up 16.98% to hit $0.06386. The momentum comes amid renewed interest from its growing community and speculation about upcoming ecosystem updates. Trading volume has spiked, suggesting that new participants are joining, while existing holders double down on the recent strength. The coin is gaining attention for its simplicity and branding, drawing on viral Twitter exposure and a growing list of meme partnerships. Unlike many other meme coins that disappear after an initial spike, Brett‚Äôs team appears committed to building utility around the brand, including tools and governance elements. Still, Brett‚Äôs biggest asset remains its community. On-chain engagement has been climbing, and if the momentum holds, the coin could break into the top meme coin rankings. The challenge ahead lies in maintaining utility updates to match the hype‚Äîotherwise, short-term traders could start taking profit fast. Popcat ($POPCAT): Clawing Toward Resistance With a 15% Spike Popcat has proven once again that it can move fast. In the last 24 hours, it surged 15.78% to hit $0.4250, thanks to a clean bounce off support and an uptick in volume. The Solana-based meme token continues to benefit from fast transaction speeds and low gas costs, which has helped draw in a steady stream of short-term traders. Technically, Popcat is approaching a resistance level around $0.44. If it breaks through, the path to $0.50 could open quickly. Analysts credit the recent spike to both increased volume and steady Twitter engagement. Unlike more volatile meme coins, Popcat has built a decent floor and continues to trend upward despite broader market chop. Still, Popcat‚Äôs future hinges on delivering something beyond the meme. With a loyal fanbase and consistent support, its next breakout may depend on more than just community hype. But for now, it‚Äôs showing signs of continued upward momentum‚Äîjust not yet a threat to ecosystem giants. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Troller Cat stands tall as the best crypto to explode in 2025. While Brett pumped 17% and Popcat rose over 15% in the last 24 hours, neither combines narrative, utility, transparency, and long-term ecosystem vision like $TCAT. With Stage 13 ending soon and a 15% price hike imminent, now is the time to secure your spot. A $35,000 investment could yield over $220,000 by launch. Plus, with Troller Cat‚Äôs referral rewards, burning system, and future roadmap phases, this is more than a meme‚Äîit‚Äôs a blueprint for market domination. Join the presale. Unlock your referral link. Watch the Game Center go live. And ride with the coin that trolls its way to the top.

48453668,https://cryptonews.com/?p=384172,1752813533,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/48453668.jpeg,XRP Hits All Time High Above $3.60 as Major Crypto Bills Clear House,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-all-time-high-crypto-bills-clear-house/,"XRP surged past a historic milestone on Friday, trading above $3.60 for the first time, after a wave of bullish developments reshaped the regulatory and market landscape for the Ripple-linked asset. The token peaked at $3.64, up nearly 68% over the past month, according to market data, as investors responded to a flurry of major catalysts. Chief among them was three key crypto bills passing in the US House of Representatives, including the long-awaited GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act, which aim to bring legal clarity to digital assets. XRP Gets Institutional Boost With ETF Debut Adding fuel to the rally, ProShares is set to launch the first XRP futures ETF in the US on the same day. As a result, this move opens the door for broader institutional participation in the XRP market, which until now has been largely out of reach for many traditional investors. Further, the momentum has attracted heavyweight interest. Eleven major asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, 21Shares and Bitwise, have already filed applications linked to XRP investment products. Together, these filings signal growing confidence in the asset‚Äôs long-term potential. 2023 XRP Court Win Could Soon Be Final On the regulatory front, traders are watching closely for a possible breakthrough . Market chatter suggests the US SEC may soon drop its appeal in the high-profile Ripple case . If that happens, it would cement a 2023 court ruling that found XRP sales to retail investors do not constitute securities offerings under US law. Prediction markets seem to agree. For instance, Polymarket now assigns an 88% probability that a spot XRP ETF will be approved by Dec. 2025. In the near term, traders are closely watching two key dates: July 21 and July 25. On these days, leveraged ETF proposals could be finalized. If that happens, it may trigger broader adoption of XRP-based ETFs. XRP Open Interest Soars 25% to $4.6B in 24 Hours Meanwhile, derivatives market activity has surged. Coinalyze data shows XRP open interest jumped 25% in the past 24 hours, reaching $4.6b. Nearly all of that is concentrated in perpetual contracts. Notably, Binance and Bybit dominate the market, holding $1.8b and $1.6b in open interest, respectively. Additionally, CoinGlass data reinforces the trend. In the past 24 hours, XRP liquidations reached $88.54m. This figure is higher than Bitcoin‚Äôs $79.67m and second only to Ethereum‚Äôs $206.65m. Notably, the liquidations were heavily skewed toward short positions. This suggests many traders were caught off guard by the sudden price jump. Overall, the crypto market saw widespread liquidations. More than 153,000 traders were wiped out in a single day. In total, $577m in positions were lost. XRP played a major role in driving this volatility. The rally‚Äôs strength appears to be gaining solid support. Rising institutional interest and whale accumulation are driving momentum. As a result, analysts now view a breakout toward $4 as a realistic short-term target. XRP‚Äôs rise marks a sharp turnaround for the token. For much of the past three years, it was weighed down by regulatory uncertainty. Now, things have changed. With fresh legislative clarity, ETF momentum and strong market support, XRP seems to be entering a new era of legitimacy.

Expectations currently are that the Ethereum price rally will trigger the next altcoin season and possibly lead to a push toward new all-time highs for ETH. One analyst in particular has compared this breakout to what was seen back in May 2025, something that could mean that higher levels are in store for the altcoin. Ethereum Is Mirroring Its Move From May May 2025 has remained one of the most bullish for the Ethereum price so far this year, rallying by more than 40% in a 30-day period. The price had gone from a low of around $1,770 to a high of $2,650 before retracing. But the most important thing was the trend and how the price moved before finally reaching its high. There was an initial surge, then some sideways movement, before the final upsurge to $2,600, and then the eventual top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Just Got Rejected From TSDT Resistance That Triggered Last Altcoin Season ‚Äî Details According to crypto analyst CryptosBatman on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Ethereum price is once again mirroring this price movement that led to its 40% surge.¬†The post highlights the fact that¬†Ethereum has already seen an initial breakout and has begun to move sideways.¬†However, this sideways move is not expected to last long and is actually part of the overall move. As the crypto analyst explained, the same triangle pattern that formed in May 2025 is now forming after the Ethereum price crossed the $3,000 range. Hence, the sideways movement is expected as investors take profit. Once the sideways accumulation is done and the triangle pattern is broken, then Ethereum is expected to begin rallying once again. The next target from here is above $3,600. Factors Driving The ETH Bullish Momentum Other than the fact that the Ethereum price has formed a similar triangle pattern to what was seen back in May, there are also notable developments in terms of accumulation that are also driving the price. For one, Spot Ethereum ETF inflows have continued to ramp up. Related Reading: XRP Becomes Top 3 Crypto After ProShares ETF Approval, Can It Flip ETH? Data from the Farside website shows that Ethereum ETFs have recorded positive net flows for almost two weeks straight now. The likes of BlackRock and Fidelity are leading the charge with tens of thousands of ETH being bought up daily. Ethereum treasury companies are now the rave of the moment as the likes of SharpLink and BitMine begin accumulating hundreds of millions of dollars in ETH. This rise in institutional adoption has become one of the major pushes for Ethereum as investors clamor for new highs.

How High Can the ETH Price Go?,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-ethereum-is-going-up-how-high-can-the-eth-price-go/,"The post Why Ethereum is Going Up? How High Can the ETH Price Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has skyrocketed over 70% since July 1, adding $150 billion to its market cap. This historic rally was driven by a massive short squeeze, institutional buying from BlackRock and Trump‚Äôs financial group, and upcoming U.S. regulatory reforms. With a $9 trillion retirement market on the horizon, Ethereum‚Äôs bullish momentum may just be getting started. Why Did Ethereum Surge 70% in July 2025? Ethereum is making crypto history with one of the largest short squeezes ever recorded. Since July 1, ETH has gained over 70%, recovering from a period of extreme bearish sentiment and liquidating billions in short positions. The rally was sparked when net short exposure on Ethereum hit record highs, 25% higher than the February 2025 peak, triggering a wave of forced liquidations as ETH began to rise. According to The Kobeissi Letter, a further 10% ETH price increase could result in another $1 billion in short liquidations, pushing prices even higher. Who‚Äôs Buying Ethereum? Trump and BlackRock Lead the Pack The timing of major institutional purchases suggests the smart money moved first. World Liberty Financial , linked to President Trump, bought $5 million worth of ETH just a day before Kobeissi‚Äôs post went viral. BlackRock‚Äôs Ethereum ETF has been accumulating ETH for 29 out of the past 30 days‚Äîwell ahead of the retail crowd. These actions indicate that institutional players may have anticipated the short squeeze before it fully unfolded. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin and Other Altcoins? While Ethereum stole the spotlight, Bitcoin quietly reclaimed the $120,000 level, recovering nearly $900 billion in market cap since April. XRP is also seeing bullish momentum , reflecting a broader capital rotation into altcoins. ‚ÄúEthereum could hit $15,000 to $20,000 in this cycle,‚Äù says Colin Talks Crypto . Could a $9 Trillion Retirement Market Push ETH Even Higher? The most explosive catalyst might still be ahead. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order allowing 401(k) retirement plans, worth $8.7 trillion, to invest in cryptocurrencies. If passed, this could unlock more than double the capital of the current global crypto market. This would mark the first time regulated retirement funds could directly allocate to crypto assets like Ethereum and Bitcoin. What Role Are U.S. Crypto Laws Playing in This Rally? Ethereum‚Äôs rally is not just technical‚Äîit‚Äôs political and structural. In July, the U.S. House passed : The Clarity Act ‚Äì Defines digital asset classifications The Genius Act ‚Äì Regulates stablecoins The Anti-CBDC Act ‚Äì Limits the Federal Reserve‚Äôs digital currency authority With bipartisan support now behind these bills, the U.S. crypto market is entering a more mature and regulated phase, creating confidence for long-term institutional involvement. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: Ripple‚Äôs XRP Hits New ATH Following Successful Crypto Week , How High Can Ethereum Go in 2025? Ethereum previously peaked at $4,800 in 2021. If Colin Talks Crypto‚Äôs forecast of $15,000‚Äì$20,000 holds, ETH could 3x to 4x from its prior all-time high. With bullish technicals, growing ETF demand, favorable regulations, and massive capital inflows expected, Ethereum could outpace Bitcoin‚Äôs rally in the coming months . Is This Just the Beginning for Ethereum? Yes, Ethereum‚Äôs breakout isn‚Äôt just a squeeze. It signals a larger shift in crypto‚Äôs evolution: from retail-driven hype to institution-led growth, backed by regulation and massive capital readiness. With crypto now entering the retirement market conversation, Ethereum‚Äôs path to $15,000 no longer seems like a moonshot; it may be a matter of time. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Momentum is holding firm above key exponential moving averages, keeping bulls in control for now. What‚Äôs Happening With Bitcoin‚Äôs Price? BTC price dynamics (Source: TradingView) The 4-hour chart shows Bitcoin price action stabilizing between converging support and resistance trendlines. The triangle pattern began forming after the breakout candle above $100,000 and has persisted despite multiple failed breakout attempts near $121,500. Notably, the 20/50/100/200 EMA cluster remains stacked below the current price, with the 20 EMA providing consistent dynamic support near $118,600. The rising On-Balance Volume (OBV) further supports the bullish case, as buying pressure has remained steady throughout the compression phase. A breakout above the $121,800‚Äì$122,000 upper triangle resistance could unlock the next leg higher, with volume confirmation critical for validation.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is expected to sign the GENIUS Act and may also issue an executive order allowing 401(k) retirement plans to invest in cryptocurrencies and other alternative assets. In addition to this, Trump recently nominated Eric Tung, a lawyer with extensive crypto industry ties, to the influential Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. House Passes Three Crypto Bills The US House of Representatives passed three key pieces of cryptocurrency legislation after delays caused by Republican debates over central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In a session that was held Thursday, lawmakers approved the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act with a 294-134 vote, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act with a 308-122 vote, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act by a narrower margin of 219-210. Voting in the CLARITY Act (Source: US House of Representatives ) The passage of these bills is a massive legislative milestone in the US digital asset landscape. Almost 80 Democrats voted in favor of the CLARITY Act, while more than 100 supported the GENIUS Act. The support from both parties for two of the three bills suggests that there is growing bipartisan momentum for crypto regulation, though the Anti-CBDC legislation is still deeply divisive. Republicans strongly rallied behind the legislative package as part of their self-declared ‚Äúcrypto week.‚Äù However, the legislative process was delayed on Wednesday as some Republicans demanded a clearer stance against the development of a US CBDC. Industry stakeholders mostly welcomed the House‚Äôs approval of the bills. Summer Mersinger, former commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and current CEO of the Blockchain Association, praised the Anti-CBDC measure as a defense of individual financial freedom and market competition. Despite this optimism, the opposition was also quite vocal. Representative Maxine Waters of California condemned the bills during a press conference she branded as ‚Äúanti-crypto corruption week,‚Äù and warned that the proposed legislation could weaken federal financial safeguards and open the door to systemic risks similar to the 2008 financial crisis. Truth Social post from President Donald Trump President Trump is reportedly ready to sign the GENIUS Act by Friday, assuming it remains unchanged after passing the Senate in June. Meanwhile, the CLARITY and Anti-CBDC bills will proceed to the Senate for further consideration. This means that they could be amended before returning to the House or reaching the president‚Äôs desk. Trump Eyes Crypto in 401(k) Plans President Donald Trump is also reportedly preparing to sign an executive order that could open the door for American 401(k) retirement plans to invest in alternative assets beyond traditional stocks and bonds, including cryptocurrencies. According to a report by the Financial Times , the executive order may be signed as early as this week and would direct regulatory agencies in Washington to explore how 401(k) plans could incorporate digital assets, metals, and funds related to infrastructure projects, corporate acquisitions, and private lending. President Donald Trump The initiative could cause a big shift in the investment options available to American workers saving for retirement. While the Financial Times cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter, White House spokesman Kush Desai warned that no decision should be considered final unless confirmed by President Trump himself. This potential move follows the US Labor Department‚Äôs May decision to rescind restrictions imposed during the Biden administration that limited the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans. The regulatory rollback may also pave the way for more institutional involvement in digital assets. Meanwhile, private firms have already started moving in this direction. In April, financial services giant Fidelity, which manages $5.9 trillion in assets, launched a new crypto-enabled retirement account for American investors. The broader 401(k) market consisted of over 715,000 plans that held $8.9 trillion in assets in September of 2024. Fidelity crypto offering At the state level, North Carolina lawmakers introduced legislation in March that would allow up to 5% of various public retirement funds to be allocated to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Internationally, pension funds in the United Kingdom and Japan also explored crypto allocations. In November, UK-based Cartwright reported that an undisclosed pension scheme committed 3% of its assets to Bitcoin, while Japan‚Äôs Government Pension Investment Fund was weighing the digital asset as a diversification strategy. If enacted, Trump‚Äôs executive order could be a historic development in the intersection of digital assets and retirement savings. Trump Picks Crypto Ally for Appeals Court Eric Tung, a corporate lawyer who is well known for representing major players in the crypto space, has been nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The nomination was sent to the Senate on Tuesday, but Tung‚Äôs potential appointment drew a lot of attention due to his deep ties to the digital asset industry. If confirmed, he will preside over appeals from nine western states, including California, a hub for tech and crypto companies. Trump nominations Tung is currently a partner at law firm Jones Day, and previously represented high-profile crypto clients like the Blockchain Association in its legal challenge against the US Treasury Department over sanctions on Tornado Cash. He also served as counsel in a case against BitMEX‚Äôs parent company and defended stablecoin issuers by arguing that some sales do not constitute securities offerings. Watchdog group Accountable.US criticized the nomination, and warned that Tung‚Äôs record suggests he may support deregulating the crypto sector as part of the Trump administration‚Äôs pro-crypto agenda. The group specifically mentioned his history of challenging regulatory oversight of smart contracts and stablecoins.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-18 05:30:00

This unexpected milestone has sparked curiosity about other tokens in the Solana ecosystem that may follow suit. Discover which three Solana tokens are poised for significant growth and why they stand out in the crowded crypto market. Bonk Surge: Short-Term Rally, Steady Long-Term Outlook Bonk saw a 96.59% increase over the past month, with a 27.01% spike in just one week, pushing its price quickly higher. Over the past six months, the coin experienced a slight decline of 0.79%, showing that its recent surge is more a product of short-term market activity than a long-term trend shift. The price movements reveal a burst of buyer interest that has driven recent gains, contrasting with a relatively flat performance in the broader timeline. At present, Bonk trades between key levels that set the stage for tactical moves. The nearest support is positioned at $0.00001 while immediate resistance comes in around $0.00002, with a further hurdle at $0.00003. These levels suggest that bulls are in control on a short-term basis as reflected by notable weekly gains. However, the high RSI reading of 76.97 introduces caution, implying that the asset might be overbought. Traders might consider buying on dips near the $0.00001 support and taking profits near the $0.00002 resistance. Jupiter Coin: Resilience Amid Shifting Market Trends Over the past month, JUP moved into positive territory with a gain of nearly 18%, showing signs of recovery. However, it suffered a drop of over 40% in the last six months, indicating a struggle to maintain upward momentum. The shifts in performance reflect periods of volatility, highlighting the asset's challenges. The weekly rebound of just over 11% suggests potential for short-term gains, even amid a longer-term decline. Data indicates that the coin has been testing its price boundaries repeatedly during this period, resulting in a mix of setbacks and brief recoveries as market dynamics shifted. Current price action centers around a tight range between approximately $0.34 and $0.57, with the nearest support level at $0.21 and resistance at $0.69. Bulls may push the price higher if they break through the $0.69 barrier, while bears could test the support at $0.21 if selling pressure rises. The lack of a clear trend prompts traders to watch for breakout or breakdown moves from these levels. A trading strategy might involve buying on dips within the range and placing tight stops near support to limit risk while aiming for the $0.69 level. Despite signals slightly favoring buyers, caution prevails as traders await confirmation of a broader trend before committing to larger positions. Raydium Battles a Rally Amid Long-Term Bearish Pressure Raydium surged by nearly 35% over the past month, showing strong short-term recovery despite a challenging six-month period marked by more than a 50% decline. The one-month gain of 34.91% and a weekly jump close to 29% highlight transient investor optimism that helped push prices higher temporarily. Historical trends reveal that while Raydium can experience rapid upward moves in shorter terms, its longer-term performance over six months has been notably subdued, indicating that market pressures have outweighed sustained momentum during prolonged correction phases. Raydium currently trades within a range of $1.70 to $2.59, with key technical levels in focus. Immediate resistance is near $3.05, while a second ceiling at $3.94 may challenge further bullish advances. Support is established around $1.27, with deeper interest near $0.39. The Awesome Oscillator at 0.54 and the Momentum Indicator at 0.68 indicate moderate positive momentum, although the RSI reading of nearly 67 suggests caution. Bulls control the market for now, generating a rally in momentum, but no clear trend has firmly taken shape. Trading ideas include buying retracements near $1.27 support and targeting profits close to $3.05 resistance while managing risks with stop losses. Conclusion Pump.fun's impressive valuation shows strong market interest even with its token's recent drop. BONK , with its unique appeal, JUP as an infrastructure enhancer, and RAY providing liquidity solutions, could see significant growth within the Solana ecosystem. Their roles and potential mean they are well-placed for future gains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Analysts predict PEPE could reach $0.000028 by 2025. Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $0.0002733 by 2030. Pepe Coin (PEPE), the memecoin inspired by the iconic frog meme, has rapidly become a standout in the crypto world. Ranked just behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE‚Äôs explosive rise‚Äîboasting gains of over +116290941.86% from its all-time low‚Äîhas captured investor attention globally. As it maintains its position among top memecoins, many are now asking: Will PEPE price go parabolic by the end of 2025?

However, this will require an increase in trading volume and support from the broader market. On the other hand, if the bulls fail to maintain the $0.00001100 level, a retest of $0.00000760 or even $0.00000610 is likely. Falling below $0.00000610 would put PEPE at risk of reaching new lows. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Pepecoin Price Forecast July 2025 0.00000610 0.00001050 0.00001688 PEPE Price Analysis (H1) Pepe Coin is showing potential for growth in 2025. Initially seen as a joke, meme coins like PEPE, Dogecoin, and SHIB have found their place in the market, driven by social media excitement. In the first half of 2025, the PEPE price dropped by 65%. Despite a rally in Q2 that peaked at $0.00001610 by mid-May, the overall trend remained down, and it fell 40% from the mid-May peak to the third week in June. However, Bitcoin and other altcoins rallied due to a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict, triggering a rally that even benefited PEPE. From H1‚Äôs final week to the third week of July, PEPE crypto‚Äôs technical chart shows signs of life. Currently, PEPE price has broken out from the Q2 decline, forming a falling wedge pattern. As a result, in the past 25 days, it has surged over 60%. PEPE Price Targets July 2025 Interestingly, the price action in Q2 shows a stark similarity with Elliott Wave theory. After five impulsive waves and three corrective waves, the recent wave 3 has ended. This indicates that the current ongoing rise could be the start of a new series of fresh impulsive waves, and we are experiencing Wave 1 in July. In the short term, the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands are flipped, and in the most recent week, PEPE has successfully flipped the 200-day EMA. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 71, indicating some cooling down before regaining strength in continuing Wave 1. On the other hand, if the bulls fail to maintain above the 200-day EMA, then a retest of the $0.00001100 level is likely, with a possibility of declining to $0.00000760. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Pepecoin Price Forecast July 2025 0.00000610 0.00001050 0.00001688 PEPE Price Projection 2025 (H2) The price action suggests that PEPE‚Äôs first impulse wave could possibly encounter a hurdle near $0.00001600. After a small Wave 2 correction, a much stronger Wave 3 rally could be on the horizon. This means that Q3 could see another series of new impulsive waves, from 1 to 5, as selling pressure appears to have diminished. If all the momentum continues throughout Q3 and Q4, it could potentially push PEPE to $0.00002837 by late 2025. However, for a bullish outlook, breaking the Fibonacci 0.5 level is still very essential. Failing to surpass $0.00001688 could trigger a trend reversal and lead to a price pullback.

Data this week showed U.S. retail sales climbed more than analysts had forecast in June, while new claims for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in three months. Those results reinforced the belief that the Fed can hold rates steady for longer before considering a reduction, according to a Reuters report. As of 00:38‚ÄØGMT, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six leading currencies, was unchanged at 98.456. That kept it on course for a 0.64% gain this week, following a 0.91% jump in the previous seven days. On Thursday, the index even peaked at 98.951, its highest level since June 23. A recent report showed that U.S. consumer prices rose in June by the most in five months. This suggests that recent tariff hikes may be starting to push up inflation. Investors now expect slightly less easing, just under 0.5% in rate cuts by December, down from about 0.5% forecast earlier this week. Despite this week‚Äôs strength, the dollar remains 9.3% below its level at the beginning of the year. In March and April, fears of unpredictable U.S. trade policies led to a big sell‚Äëoff that hurt confidence in U.S. assets, including the dollar, Treasury yields, and stocks. Markets reacted to Trump firing Powell rumor Concerns about the U.S. budget have shaken investors. Lawmakers‚Äô large spending and tax plans have raised doubts about fiscal stability. At the same time, President Trump has repeatedly scolded Fed Chair Powell for not cutting rates faster. Analysts at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia warned that the dollar ‚Äúremains vulnerable to the downside if concerns about U.S. policymaking further undermine investor confidence in USD assets.‚Äù They pointed to this week‚Äôs sudden dip, triggered by rumors that Trump planned to fire Powell, as proof of that risk. Bitcoin hovered just below $120,000 after briefly hitting $123,153.22, and the market got a boost when Congress passed rules for dollar‚Äëpegged stablecoins. Dollar strong against yen while euro and pound made modest moves Meanwhile Japan‚Äôs yen weakened as Sunday‚Äôs upper‚Äëhouse elections approached, with polls showing the ruling party could lose its majority. A change in power could make monetary policy less predictable. It can slow down tariff talks with Washington. On foreign exchange markets, the dollar was trading around ¬•148.60, not far from Wednesday‚Äôs three‚Äëand‚Äëa‚Äëhalf‚Äëmonth peak of ¬•149.19. Japan‚Äôs lead trade envoy, Ryosei Akazawa, held talks on Thursday with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in an eleventh‚Äëhour bid to block a 25% tariff scheduled to apply once August‚ÄØ1 has passed. Elsewhere, the euro climbed 0.25% to $1.1626, bouncing back from its Thursday trough near $1.1556, though it still finished the week 0.59% lower.

The Indonesian crypto market is experiencing significant growth in transaction volume and user numbers, driven by a tech-savvy population and increasing interest in digital assets. Indonesia has legalized the trading of crypto but has reasonably regulated it with strict regulations. Table of contents Crypto regulations in Indonesia 2025 What is the Indonesian Government Saying About Crypto? Crypto License in Indonesia 2025 Crypto Tax in Indonesia 2025 Crypto Adoption in Indonesia Conclusion FAQs Crypto regulations in Indonesia 2025 July 2025 ‚Äì OJK Regulations The new OJK regulations, after transferring regulatory oversight from Bappebti to OJK, have set a deadline of July 2025 for crypto companies to fully comply. The regulations include licensing, governance, data protection, and consumer protection, which all crypto-related companies must follow. April 10, 2025 ‚Äì Deadline of Crypto Asset List Under Article 132 of POJK 27/2024, crypto exchanges must finalize their crypto list within the deadline. Trading organizers are prohibited from trading any crypto asset that was not included in their crypto listings. March 2025- OJK issued licenses for Digital Financial Assets (DFA) Traders OJK issued 19 DFA traders‚Äô licenses , and they were processing 11 other licenses at the time. This initiative was part of a broader framework that includes a license for DFA exchanges, clearing, guarantee, settlement institutions, and custodians for digital assets under OJK supervision. January 10, 2025- Government Regulation No. 49 of 2024 and OJK Regulation No. 27 of 2024 The supervision of crypto assets officially transitioned from the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti) to the Financial Services Authority (OJK). The new OJK regulation outlines minimum paid-up capital and equity requirements and includes detailed guidelines for onboarding customers. It also implemented a new tax regime for crypto as it became subject to both income tax and value-added tax. The OJK also implemented Digital Financial Asset Trading, Including Crypto Assets, which outlines licensing, transition of applications, updates the crypto asset whitelist, and the adjustment period. January 1-6, 2025- Crypto Tax (PMK No. 131/2024 and PMK No. 81/2024) The value-added tax (VAT) was increased to 0.11% of transaction value, and for unregistered exchange platforms, the VAT rate doubles to 0.22% . While crypto tax is very low in the country, it is not totally free as it subjects mining to tax up to 0.1%. What is the Indonesian Government Saying About Crypto? In 2025, the Indonesian government is actively working on enhancing consumer protection facilities to foster a more secure and stable environment for crypto trading. The implementation of OJK supervision aims to help the public better understand the opportunities and risks involved in crypto investments. The initiative also indicates a move towards treating them as financial instruments alongside traditional assets. This integration aims to bring greater clarity and stability to the crypto market. With stricter regulation under OJK, indonesia is aiming to boost transparency and fraud prevention, which could help mitigate risks in the crypto space. The OJK also introduced a regulatory sandbox, a testing environment for new financial technologies, including crypto. With this measure, the Indonesian government is aiming to embrace innovation. Crypto License in Indonesia 2025 OJK reclassified crypto assets as digital financial assets under new terms to regulate licensing. It also changed Bappebti‚Äôs authority to issue the list of crypto assets that could be traded on crypto platforms and gave the authority to the DFA. DFA issued its first list in April 2025, which contained 1,444 crypto assets, marking an increase from Bappebti‚Äôs listing of 851. Licensing: Companies previously licensed under Bappebti will automatically be recognized as licensed Digital Financial Asset Trading Providers. However, a reapplication is necessary after which the DFA traders can provide the whitelist of crypto assets. A grace period till July 2025 is given to fully comply with new requirements. Requirement for DFA Traders: The minimum paid-up capital of 100 billion rupiah (US$6 million) and minimum equity of 50 billion rupiah (US$3 million) requirement is retained from Bappebti‚Äôs authority, while four new key changes are introduced under OJK: Fit and Proper Test for board members, shareholders, and controlling shareholders is introduced. DFA traders are to store transaction data and financial records for at least ten consecutive years. Requirements for data protection measures are to be followed. Stricter restrictions for DFA members‚Äì cannot hold positions as members of the BOC or BOD. If the regulations are abused, OJK has the authority to revoke the licenses. Crypto Tax in Indonesia 2025 Beginning from January 2025, Indonesia has implemented a set of crypto taxes along with guidance on penalties. Delay in filing can result in a fixed penalty (IDR 100,000 to IDR 1,000,000) and interest charges of 2% per month, up to 24 months. Transaction Type VAT Rate Final Income Tax (PPh) Registered exchange 0.12% 0.1% Unregistered exchange Higher (prev. 0.22%) 0.2% Mining (VAT) 1.1% 0.1% (income) Crypto Adoption in Indonesia Crypto adoption rate: Crypto investors reached 14.6 million in the country , ranking third in global adoption in Q1 2025. This is an increase of up to 3.28% from the previous year‚Äôs adoption rate. The user penetration rate is predicted to be 16.56% in 2025 and is projected to increase to 16.98% by 2026. Government‚Äôs crypto holdings: Not publicly disclosed, while the country has seen significant growth in crypto transactions and usage. In Q1 2025, the crypto transaction reached IDR 109.29 trillion. Conclusion With stricter crypto regulations in the nation, investors are feeling safe to trade cryptocurrency, marking a significant growth in trading volume and user base. Popular coins like USDT, BTC, DOGE, PEPE, and XRP are driving much of the transaction volume in Indonesia. If these regulations and security measures are preserved, Indonesia may position itself as a crypto leader in Southeast Asia in the near future.

The country was one of the largest markets for crypto as the popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum grew among the citizens. As the demand for crypto grew, China tightened its rules and regulations to maintain stability and protection. As of 2025, China has implemented one significant law that changed the entire landscape of crypto. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in China Crypto Tax in China Crypto License in China Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in China July 10, 2025 ‚Äì Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission Debate on Digital Assets The agencies held a meeting to discuss strategic responses to stablecoins and digital currencies. The rapid evolution of digital assets was discussed, and experts who joined the meeting indicated that it can result in softening China‚Äôs strict position on crypto. May 30, 2025- Comprehensive Ownership Ban The People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) issued a ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership. The crypto ban decree became effective from June 1, 2025, states the suspension of crypto transactions, asset seizure measures, enforcement, and penalties.

By implementing the recent ban on cryptocurrency, the Chinese government is reaffirming its commitment to centralizing financial control and promoting the use of its state-backed digital currency, the yuan . Its current focus is on: Outlawing private ownership of crypto Accelerating the adoption of central bank digital currency (CBDC) Mitigating financial risks related to crypto Reasserts its financial hegemony by banning decentralized crypto Crypto Tax in China As China implemented a ban on crypto trading, mining, and ownership, any crypto tax is irrelevant. It has ceased all crypto activity, while focusing on blockchain innovations with its digital yuan. The government is not focusing on crypto tax as long as the crypto ban stays. Crypto License in China China does not have any crypto license, as Beijing has expanded its crypto ban. Since no one will be able to hold crypto or other digital assets (except its own digital yuan), a license implementation is not necessary. Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Before China enforced the crypto ban in 2025, the adoption rate was fluctuating, and the market was unstable. Since Chinese crypto policies are too strict and have made the market sentiment rigid, it has influenced users to use VPNs to access foreign exchanges. This raised some concerns regarding crypto, and eventually, the government banned it. Conclusion When crypto was regulated in China, the government had a comprehensive anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financial terrorism (CFT) framework. However, after its historical changes of banning private ownership of crypto, China is focusing on centralizing the political power and encouraging the country‚Äôs own digital currency. Despite the restrictions, use of crypto for illicit activity remains a concern for the Chinese government. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

No, as of June 1, 2025, China has implemented a comprehensive ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership, making it illegal to hold or transact in crypto. Why did China ban cryptocurrency? China banned cryptocurrency to centralize financial control, accelerate the adoption of its state-backed digital yuan (CBDC), mitigate financial risks, and reassert its financial hegemony by outlawing decentralized crypto. How has crypto adoption been affected by China‚Äôs regulations? Before the 2025 ban, China‚Äôs strict policies led to fluctuating adoption and market instability, pushing users to access foreign exchanges via VPNs. The complete ban aims to eliminate private crypto use. Will China unban crypto in the future? It‚Äôs highly unlikely China will fully unban private crypto ownership in the near future. Their ban reinforces financial control and promotes the digital yuan, with no current signs of reversal for decentralized digital assets.",Cryptocurrency Regulation|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-18 05:52:13

Discover which digital currencies are expected to surge and make strategic investment choices. Ethereum Market Surge Amid Mixed Long-Term Trends Over the last month, Ethereum recorded a solid gain of 17.34%, but the past six months indicated a decline of 13.95%. A recent weekly growth of 16.85% shows a rebound, signaling renewed investor interest after a correction period. Price fluctuations have been characterized by significant volatility and shifting market sentiment. Current performance suggests a market that reacts to both short-term catalysts and longer-term adjustments, reflecting a mix of recovered momentum and residual downward pressure from previous trends. The trading range currently sits between $2110.94 and $2870.47, with bulls momentarily in control due to the impressive weekly and monthly gains. Key support levels are at $1735.29 and $975.76, while the nearest resistance is at $3254.35, with a second resistance at $4013.88. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index near 69 and positive readings on the Awesome Oscillator indicate upward pressure. Trading strategies might involve entering near lower support levels and planning exits around resistance markers. Traders should monitor breakout signs and momentum shifts to manage risk effectively. Solana Price Action: Mixed Past Trends, Bullish Levels, and Tactful Entries During the past month, Solana has shown promising gains with a 10.77% increase as traders began to see renewed interest and short-term momentum, evidenced by a recent 7.69% rise in just one week. Over the more extended six-month period, price performance was less robust, dropping 22.14%. Such fluctuations underline an asset that experiences significant volatility, with past price behavior marked by a balance of positive weekly moves and a longer-term downward pressure. The charts indicate a technical journey where rapid short-term gains contrast with broader declines, setting the stage for potential recovery or further correction under shifting market conditions. Current pricing rests in a range between $131 and $173.35, with notable support at $107.89 and resistance at $191.79. Bulls appear to be making inroads as indicated by the rise to 7.69% in the last week and reinforced by technical measures like a Relative Strength Index near 57. However, the lack of a clear trend demands cautious optimism. Levels beyond, such as second resistance at $233.74 and second support at $65.94, shape a trading corridor. Solid support zones could provide buying opportunities, while approaching resistance levels may trigger profit booking. A balanced trading approach, looking for entries around support and exits near resistance, seems prudent in capturing potential gains in the current market. ADA Market Update: Weekly Surge Amid Long-Term Pullback Cardano recorded a 25.52% gain over the past week and a 16.29% increase in the last month. The last six months showed a decline of 32.47%, pointing to a challenging long-term correction. Prices have moved within a range of $0.48 to $0.70, highlighting both quick rebounds and sustained pressure. These price shifts reflect mixed market sentiments and trading dynamics in both short and long terms. At present, ADA trades within the $0.48 to $0.70 range, with key support at $0.38 and resistance at $0.83. A second resistance exists at $1.05, while deeper support lies around $0.163. Technical indicators show an RSI at 68.96 and a moving average recommendation leaning positive. Bulls dominate the weekly outlook, though the six-month decline signals caution. Traders might consider entries near support levels and aim for exits at resistance zones, as the market currently shows short-term strength but an unclear long-term trend. Conclusion The recent sale of Bitcoin by an ancient whale has created a prime opportunity for investors. ETH , SOL , and ADA are poised to benefit from this shift. This period could see significant price increases for these coins as they attract more interest. ETH remains strong due to its versatile platform, SOL is noted for its fast transactions, and ADA is gaining attention with its continuous development. Savvy investors might find this an ideal moment to consider these options. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With the price currently hovering around $3,420, Ethereum has registered a daily gain of 7.7% and a weekly surge of more than 23%. The momentum follows a decisive breakout above the $3,000 level earlier this week, sparking renewed optimism across the derivatives and spot markets. The latest insights from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant provide context for Ethereum‚Äôs price action, suggesting that activity on Binance is a major catalyst. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Shoot Above $4,000 This Week, Predicts Analyst Ethereum Short Liquidations Shift Market Dynamics CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost notes that the recent uptick coincides with a structural shift in the derivatives market, particularly around short liquidations. A deeper analysis of exchange flows and taker behavior further supports the case for sustained upward movement, with indicators suggesting that Ethereum may be positioning itself to revisit previous highs. According to Darkfost, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally follows a prolonged five-month correction phase that began in December 2024. During this period, the market experienced a flush of long positions, especially on Binance, contributing to what he describes as a necessary ‚Äúcleanup‚Äù in the derivatives space. This recalibration helped reset speculative positioning and laid the groundwork for the recovery observed since late April. Now, the pattern has reversed. ‚ÄúShort liquidations are now dominating on Binance,‚Äù Darkfost observed, emphasizing how forced exits of bearish positions are reinforcing Ethereum‚Äôs upward price momentum. Liquidation data shows multiple short squeezes in recent weeks, with volumes reaching $32 million and $35 million, respectively. This trend suggests that many traders are positioned counter to the prevailing market movement, adding fuel to the rally as they‚Äôre forced to close out positions. Darkfost also highlighted that, if this pace of short liquidations continues, Ethereum may be poised to test its all-time high. He added that ongoing inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs and increasing adoption by institutions viewing ETH as a long-term asset could further support this potential breakout. Taker Volume on Binance Hints at Bullish Continuation In a separate post, CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk pointed to taker-side activity on Binance as another critical signal. The ETH Taker Buy/Sell Ratio (7-day moving average) recently crossed the 1.00 threshold, signaling stronger buy-side pressure from market participants. This shift was accompanied by a spike in price volatility, which reached 261.5, mirroring Ethereum‚Äôs latest price surge beyond $3,434. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Out: Smashes $3,400 Mark in Bullish Run Crazzyblockk noted that this pattern, rising buy-side taker volume aligned with surging volatility, has historically preceded extended price rallies. The divergence between taker long and short volumes further underlines dominant bullish sentiment. The analyst emphasized that tracking taker momentum on Binance may offer early signals for future market direction, as the Ethereum price appears highly responsive to activity on the platform.

Two heavyweights, Solana and Cardano, just flashed fresh buy signals that hint at a mid‚Äësummer rotation into ‚Äúhigh‚Äëgrowth crypto‚Äù plays. Yet the loudest chatter on X isn‚Äôt about Layer‚Äë1 breakouts; it‚Äôs about Remittix , a DeFi project many early movers see as the next big crypto launch thanks to its real‚Äëworld payment rails and live presale bonus. Here‚Äôs how the technical and fundamental picture stacks up for all three. Solana: Coiling for a Breakout A base near‚ÄØ$160 and rising on‚Äëchain volume have put Solana (SOL) back on radar for traders hunting the next 100x crypto. Chart watchers compare the current structure to Bitcoin‚Äôs coil before its spring squeeze, noting that a daily close above the twin moving‚Äëaverage cap around‚ÄØ$169 could ignite a run to the $190‚Äì$200 zone. Source: Tradingview The network continues to post the highest daily transactions of any major L1, proving that a low gas fee crypto can still dominate throughput even in choppy markets. If that breakout materializes, analysts eye the inverse head‚Äëand‚Äëshoulders target at‚ÄØ$219. Cardano: Regulatory Tailwinds in Waiting While SOL wrestles with resistance, Cardano (ADA) is catching speculative bids on the back of Washington‚Äôs proposed Clarity Act. Because more than 80‚ÄØ% of ADA is staked across thousands of pools, Cardano‚Äôs Ouroboros design ticks the ‚Äúsufficiently decentralized‚Äù box regulators crave. Should the bill pass, ADA could move from undervalued crypto project to regulatory darling, particularly for investors chasing yield through crypto staking. Source: Tradingview Why Remittix Is the Real Headliner Early‚Äëstage capital isn‚Äôt pouring into SOL or ADA right now, it‚Äôs flowing toward Remittix , a PayFi newcomer many are calling ‚ÄúXRP‚ÄØ2.0.‚Äù Reasons Remittix Is Gaining Traction: Cross‚ÄëBorder Utility: Direct crypto‚Äëto‚Äëbank transfers in 30+ countries Non‚ÄëCustodial & Private: No IP tracking; supports ETH, BTC, SOL, XRP with low gas fees Explosive Presale Stats: $16.3M+ raised so far in what reviewers label the best crypto presale‚ÄØ2025 Deflationary Tokenomics: Every transfer burns RTX, aligning scarcity with adoption Big Bonus Window: 50‚ÄØ% extra tokens still live for those who want to buy RTX token before listings. Analysts peg a 50x upside if Remittix captures even a sliver of the $19‚ÄØT remittance sector, an opportunity few other top crypto under‚ÄØ$1 can claim. Little wonder whales diversifying out of centralized exchanges have started flagging RTX as a new altcoin to watch in Q3. Exit Velocity: Charts vs. Cash Flow SOL and ADA both flash convincing buy signals: Solana on pure momentum, Cardano on potential legislative clarity. Yet the biggest buzz is swirling around Remittix , a PayFi rail that could convert meme‚Äëera enthusiasm into sustainable volume. For traders balancing technical setups with ‚Äúwho actually pays the bills,‚Äù RTX may offer the best blend of narrative and revenue among upcoming crypto projects.

His comments followed the House passage of a landmark stablecoin bill that could significantly reshape the digital asset landscape, Bloomberg reported . Speaking at a press event shortly after lawmakers approved the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and a third key crypto bill , Atkins said SEC staff is now examining whether to ease certain regulatory barriers. These changes could include new allowances for novel trading models and narrowly tailored relief measures to help build out the infrastructure required for tokenized securities. SEC weighing innovation exemption from regulations to incentivize tokenization‚Ä¶ SEC Chair Paul Atkins: ""Assets clearly are moving on chain. If it can be tokenized, it will be tokenized."" *SEC Chair* Read that again. Hope you're paying attention. via @yashroy87 @ElleBeyoud pic.twitter.com/C675D5ihLv ‚Äî Nate Geraci (@NateGeraci) July 18, 2025 SEC Prepares Regulatory Shift as Stablecoin Rules Advance ‚ÄúStaff is considering what other changes may be appropriate to incentivize tokenization within our regulatory framework,‚Äù he said, adding that this could involve an innovation exception designed to accommodate new market structures. The timing is significant. The US House cleared the stablecoin legislation earlier in the day, sending it to President Donald Trump for final approval. The bill outlines clear regulatory guardrails for dollar-backed stablecoins, requiring issuers to hold reserves in short-term government debt or similar safe assets overseen by state or federal regulators. Atkins welcomed the legislation,saying the SEC is eager to establish ‚Äúclear rules of the road‚Äù for the broader digital asset industry. Atkins Charts New Course for SEC With Pro-Tokenization Stance The chairman‚Äôs tone marks a sharp departure from that of his predecessor, Gary Gensler, whose tenure was defined by aggressive enforcement actions. Atkins has already indicated he plans to roll back several Gensler-era policies, including a controversial rule that allowed brokers to act as digital asset custodians. The SEC‚Äôs openness to regulatory flexibility comes as both traditional financial firms and blockchain-native companies race to tokenize real-world assets. Some are focused on wrapping popular US stocks into tokenized forms, while others aim to offer tokenized products linked to private markets. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to say exactly where things will go or what will happen, but, you know, assets clearly are moving on chain,‚Äù Atkins said. ‚ÄúSo if it can be tokenized, it will be tokenized.‚Äù Private Credit and US Treasuries Drive Tokenization Boom His remarks come amid growing momentum in the tokenization space. Many analysts now see it as a transformative shift for capital markets. In 2025 alone, tokenized real-world assets have surged. So far this year, market value has climbed more than 260%. According to a report by Binance Research, the sector has reached $23b. That is up from just $8.6b at the start of January. Much of that growth has come from tokenized private credit, which makes up 58% of the market. Tokenized US Treasury debt follows closely, accounting for 34%. Together, these two categories represent 92 percent of the total market for tokenized assets. Earlier this month, Atkins described tokenization as ‚Äúthe next step ‚Äù in bringing greater efficiency to traditional financial systems. He also hinted that a broader shift toward on-chain markets is now imminent. As policymakers move to catch up with technological innovation, the SEC‚Äôs willingness to carve out targeted exemptions could prove critical. If adopted, the innovation exception could give tokenization efforts the breathing room needed to scale, without falling afoul of outdated compliance rules.

Organized by Aeternum , the event has positioned itself as a platform for focused discussions on Web 3.0 developments. The upcoming edition will emphasize regulatory engagement, investor-founder interaction, and sector networking, coinciding with continued growth in the UAE‚Äôs blockchain and digital assets landscape. As the UAE sharpens its regulatory frameworks and capital continues to move into Web 3.0 ventures, Dubai‚Äôs position as a global blockchain hub has only solidified. The timing of the second edition of Unchained Summit lands at a pivotal moment, when policy, infrastructure, and investor interest are finally aligning. The event has established itself as the #1 Web 3.0 event for high-impact networking and deal flow, driving meaningful capital, connections, and innovations on a global scale. Who‚Äôs Speaking, and Why It Matters This year‚Äôs programme includes a roster of prominent industry figures, such as: Eowyn Chen, CEO, Trust Wallet, brings the perspective of a company trusted by over 200 million users worldwide. Andrew Vranjes, CRO, Blockdaemon, who drives global infrastructure growth across finance and DePIN. Mark Rydon, Co-founder & CSO, Aethir, whose push into decentralized cloud is changing gaming and AI. David Norris, CFO & CSO, NEAR Foundation, whose operational rigor helps scale tomorrow‚Äôs tools. Alexander Scott, Middle East Lead, Solana Superteam, enabling developer breakthroughs across MENA. Fefe Demeny, Lead Host, Crypto Banter, translating Web 3.0 for the mainstream and the next billion users. Zane Suren, MD Commercial, MEA, Zodia Custody, shaping regional digital asset regulation and custody. Bader Kalooti, Regional Head, Binance MEASAT, driving mainstream adoption at one of the world‚Äôs crypto superpowers, are among the early confirmed speakers. A Shift Towards Closed-Door Networking While large-scale expos continue to dominate parts of the Web 3.0 landscape, Unchained Summit has deliberately taken a different route. Attendance is capped. Topics are curated. The format includes private roundtables, investor-founder matchmaking, and sessions tailored for decision-makers. Organisers say this was a deliberate response to what many describe as ‚Äòconference fatigue‚Äô, where volume often eclipses value. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen enough noise,‚Äù said Sharath Kumar, Founder & CEO of Aeternum. ‚ÄúWhat the ecosystem needs is focus. Spaces where serious builders, funds, and policy makers can meet without the distractions. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre trying to offer.‚Äù ‚ÄúI'm thrilled to join the Unchained Summit in Dubai, where the brightest minds are shaping the future of blockchain infrastructure. It's an exceptional forum for collaborating on institutional-grade solutions that advance scalability, security, and interoperability, as we drive the growth of digital asset ecosystems throughout the MENA region,‚Äù said Andrew Vranjes, Chief Revenue Officer, Blockdaemon. Startups Take the Stage at Unchained Pitch Competition This year‚Äôs edition will also feature the launch of Unchained Pitch Competition, a focused pitch competition running alongside the main conference. Web 3.0 founders ‚Äì spanning DeFi, cross-chain infrastructure, tokenized assets, and beyond - will get five minutes on stage to present in front of serious investors on what they‚Äôre building and why it matters. Applications are now open and will close on 15 October 2025. Alongside the summit, Aeternum has been developing the ‚ÄúHash it Over‚Äù podcast series, which has released five episodes to date. The show has featured long-form discussions with protocol leaders, infrastructure players, and early investors, offering insight into the challenges and contradictions of Web 3.0 development. Super Early Bird tickets for the 2025 summit are now available until August 1, 2025, at discounted rates. The full speaker lineup, agenda, and partner list will be announced in the coming weeks.

BNB‚Äôs dip could cool exchange token sentiment, potentially dragging CRO (-2%) and KCS lower, as investors shift to DeFi-focused coins like AAVE (+4%). Meme coins like SHIB remain unaffected, but Layer-1s like SOL may see inflows. Regulatory clarity or renewed burn momentum could lift BNB toward $720, sparking a rally in related altcoins if $700 resistance breaks. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) After months of steady gains, Binance Coin (BNB) has taken a slight dip, causing some holders to re-evaluate their positions. But for the sharp-eyed investor, moments like these don‚Äôt mean panic. They signal opportunity. And many are using this brief cooldown to pivot into early-stage projects with stronger growth potential, higher upside, and actual utility. One name leading the charge? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ‚Äîa DeFi lending platform blending high-yield staking rewards, stablecoin innovation, and protocol-level revenue sharing. Built on Ethereum, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing to introduce a new approach to decentralized lending through its dual-model system: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) for automated lending of blue-chip assets, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) for custom agreements involving meme coins and niche tokens. At the core of this planned system is the mtToken framework, which is designed to allow lenders to receive interest-accruing tokens‚Äîsuch as mtDAI or mtETH‚Äîthat will grow in value over time and remain liquid across the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs vision for yield generation goes beyond simple lending. Once the platform launches, users are expected to have the ability to stake mtTokens within the protocol‚Äôs designated smart contracts, potentially earning a second layer of passive income sourced from platform revenue. This revenue is projected to include fees from loan interest and future financial products. A portion of these earnings will be allocated to MUTM token buybacks, creating upward pressure on token value while actively rewarding long-term participants. A key feature in development is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs own decentralized stablecoin‚Äîa $1-pegged asset that will be minted exclusively when users borrow against overcollateralized crypto assets such as ETH. This stablecoin will be burned automatically upon loan repayment or liquidation, ensuring a tightly controlled supply. Minting will be restricted to approved issuers with capped limits, and interest rates will be algorithmically adjusted to help maintain the $1 peg. Backed by protocol revenue and supported by Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs treasury, this stablecoin aims to create a self-sustaining foundation for the MUTM ecosystem while offering a more resilient approach to on-chain stability. Presale stats show growing demand‚Äîand 2700% return potential At the heart of the current hype is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance‚Äôs (MUTM) presale, now in Phase 5 at a token price of $0.03. With over 80% of this round already sold, more than 13,500 holders have contributed a combined $12.5 million, and anticipation is only growing stronger. Investors who entered during Phase 2 at $0.015 are now up 100% on paper, and with the projected listing price set at $0.06, they are already eyeing a 4x gain. But the long-term forecast is even more ambitious: early adopters are positioning for as much as 2700% growth based on post-launch adoption, stablecoin rollout, and platform rewards. Some BNB holders who shifted part of their portfolio into MUTM during early rounds now see this decision as a pivotal move‚Äîone that‚Äôs setting them up for exponential gains that large caps like BNB can no longer offer. While BNB remains a core blockchain asset, its upside is increasingly limited compared to small-cap disruptors like MUTM, which are still trading under a dollar and backed by an actual product roadmap. The trust behind the protocol is also undeniable. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance has already been audited by CertiK, one of the industry‚Äôs most respected security firms. The results speak volumes: a Token Scan Score of 95.00, a Skynet Score of 77.5, and full verification of smart contract security using both manual and automated methods. To further secure the project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is offering a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program, ensuring any remaining vulnerabilities are reported and rewarded before full deployment. As for development milestones, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is ticking every box. Phase 1 saw the presale launch, early marketing, and community growth. Phase 2 focused on building the DApp‚Äôs backend and smart contract integrations. In Phase 3, the team will be launching testnet demos, performing final audits, and preparing for beta testing. When Phase 4 goes live, users will be able to claim tokens, interact with the live platform, and stake mtTokens for protocol rewards. Key updates like Layer-2 scaling and the stablecoin module are also on the roadmap, signaling long-term evolution. Only 20% remains before price jumps to $0.035 With Phase 5 nearing completion, time is running out. Once this round sells out, Phase 6 will push the token price up by 20% to $0.035. For investors who have watched big names like BNB, SOL, and ETH climb from cents to triple digits, the message is clear: don‚Äôt wait until after the breakout. The current price of $0.03 might be the last deeply discounted entry before Mutuum Finance (MUTM) enters price discovery mode post-listing. Crypto investors are always hunting for the next opportunity that mirrors the early days of giants like BNB. Right now, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Finance offers that rare combination: a low entry price, massive upside, and a product that‚Äôs built for sustainable DeFi income, not just hype. This isn‚Äôt just another presale. It‚Äôs a smart move for anyone looking to turn a modest bet into a game-changing portfolio win.

While XRP continues to hold its ground amid market shifts, and other altcoins offer steady potential, one under-the-radar gem is stealing the spotlight, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Mutuum Finance presale phase 5 is more than 80% sold out. The presale has been purchased by more than 13600 investors. It has already collected more than $12.6 million. Mutuum Finance is climbing fast, and those who blink might miss the summer‚Äôs hottest opportunity. XRP Update: Regulatory & ETF Momentum Driving Action XRP has been trading at $3.16. Early in the week, it surged above $3 on optimism surrounding the U.S. House‚Äôs advancement of the GENIUS Act and the imminent launch of ProShares XRP Futures ETF on July 18. Institutional accumulation is apparent, with on‚Äëchain whale moves and rising CME futures volume, though resistance around $2.93‚Äì$3.00 remains a focal point. Market watchers are now eyeing whether XRP breaks past these levels, which could open the door to analyst projections in the $3.20‚Äì$4.50+ range, or risk a pullback to support near $2.85. Looming on the horizon is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as another intriguing name to keep tabs on. Mutuum Finance Draws Interest Mutuum Finance is greatly impacting the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector because it is providing a real-world applicable scalable monetary system. The popularity can even be quantified by the level of the interest of the investors since it has already crossed 13,500 token holders, coupled with over $12.5 million worth of investments that are evidence of the market‚Äôs willingness to be able to support itself in the long term. $50K Bug Bounty Program Now Live In addition to enhancing its security and transparency, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) further initiated the Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK, a blockchain security company. The project will reward 50,000 USDT to the hunters that show potential areas of concern through the program. The objective of the bounty program is to obtain adequate coverage in each of the types of vulnerability; it is broken down into the four severity levels; i.e., critical, major, minor and low. The project reflects the active will of the team towards the preservation of its ecosystem and investors‚Äô confidence. $100K Giveaway Launched to Reward Mutuum Community Mutuum Finance has launched a 100,000 giveaway to win over the community as well. The individuals who will participate will be sampled in order to ascertain the list of ten individuals that will receive $10,000 in MUTM as rewards. This grand act does not only determine those who will be rewarded beforehand, but it also indicates that the project is willing to establish a solid and worthwhile base of users. Dual-Lending: Powering What‚Äôs Next in DeFi Mutuum Finance offers a distinct platform on which users control their assets of decentralized borrowing. The platform employs such double-model structure to provide adaptability together with efficiency that encompass Peer-to-Contract as well as Peer-to-Peer of lending models. Peer-to-Contract utilizes self-executing smart contracts that execute the lending function autonomously with no intervention from humans. They are designed to run dynamically based on changing market prices, providing a variable rate of interest pegged to the present supply and demand of an in-real-time interest. On the one side, Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and provides an opportunity to be in touch with lenders and borrowers directly. This is even superior towards utilization for volatile goods because it allows customized terms of loans and flexibility based on user choice and his or her risk-bearing capability. Mutuum Finance isn‚Äôt just building hype, it‚Äôs building infrastructure, security, and momentum. With over 13,600 investors, $12.6M+ raised, and the presale nearly gone at $0.03, the opportunity is shrinking fast. If you‚Äôve been waiting for a breakout altcoin with real backbone, this is your signal.

Both are standout DeFi platforms with loyal followings and unique features. This article delves into their potential, examining key factors that might help in choosing which token could yield greater gains. Dive in to discover which of these DeFi giants may lead the charge. Compound Analysis: Past Trends and Key Level Insight COMP experienced a one-month decline of 10.08% and a more pronounced dip of 43.32% over the last six months. Despite this, a recent one-week gain of 17.21% indicates some positive movement amid a history of significant corrections. The price volatility over the past half-year suggests that while short-term rebounds can occur, the longer-term outlook has remained considerably bearish, as shown by the negative change over this period. Current price levels are trading between $35.12 and $58.17, with support near $25.88 and resistance at $71.96. Technical indicators, including an RSI of 53.68 and a positive momentum of 5.788, point to a balanced but slightly bullish short-term outlook. Traders should monitor these key levels, as a test of resistance at $71.96 could lead to a rally, while a dip toward support may offer buying opportunities. Caution is advised near the second resistance at $94.99 and second support at $2.83, where crucial market reactions may shape the trend. Aave Price Trends and Trading Levels Aave experienced a monthly climb of 13.19% alongside a notable weekly gain of 10.07%, while showing a 2.71% decline over the previous six months. The price action has been dynamic, reflecting a short-term rally amidst a longer-term retreat that underscores mixed momentum. This movement portrays the coin‚Äôs volatile yet opportunistic behavior during recent trading sessions. Aave currently trades within a range from $216.95 to $328.67. Resistance is seen at $382.91 and a second level at $494.63, while support holds at $159.46 with an additional floor at $47.74. Technical indicators show an RSI reading of 62.78 and a Momentum Indicator at 38.00. Price action appears moderately bullish but cautious. The six-month decline suggests hesitance among traders. Buying opportunities may arise near the support at $159.46, while near-term resistance at $382.91 might be an ideal zone for profit-taking. The price remains range-bound with no clear direction, pressing traders to consider careful entries and exits. Conclusion Both COMP and AAVE have shown strong potential. Each has unique features and benefits to offer. COMP has a robust governance system. AAVE excels with innovative lending options. Market conditions and user preference will heavily influence which performs better. It's important to track their developments. Both have a promising outlook for delivering higher returns.

While the medical firm hasn‚Äôt revealed reasons behind choosing Litecoin, the project‚Äôs lower fees, long-standing reputation, and transaction speed likely boosted its appeal as an alternative for treasury diversification. LTC turns bullish The native token displayed a bullish stance as the community cheered the double boost. While flashier tokens have often overshadowed Litecoin, increasing institutional interest bolstered sentiments around the time-tested token. For context, the Litecoin project has never faced downtimes in over a decade of its existence. Projects like Solana have encountered several blackouts over the years. LTC trades at $108 after soaring from yesterday‚Äôs low of $96. Chart by Coinamrketcap It has crossed the crucial level at $100, and the soaring trading volume suggests upside extension. Furthermore, the 50 EMA is about to cross the 100 EMA to the upside, confirming a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù signal. Technical indicators demonstrate buyer resurgence after LTC‚Äôs 12.5% 24-hour price surge. Litecoin‚Äôs price hovers well above the 50 and 100 Exponential Moving Averages on the 1D timeframe, indicating a strong upside momentum as bulls remain in control. Also, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence stayed above the signal line after the June 25 crossover.

On July 17, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) with overwhelming bipartisan support (308‚Äì122). The bill had already cleared the Senate in June and now awaits President Donald Trump‚Äôs signature. Once signed, the GENIUS Act will become the most consequential piece of financial legislation since the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010.

Under the law, only licensed entities, such as banks, credit unions, and qualified fintech firms, can issue these payment stablecoins. Issuers must maintain full one-to-one reserves, provide monthly third-party audits, and operate under the supervision of federal or state regulators. Importantly, algorithmic stablecoins and those not pegged to the dollar are excluded from this legal category. Consumer protections are also strengthened: holders have a first claim on reserves in the event of insolvency, and issuers are prohibited from offering interest on their coins. However, third-party platforms may still do so. A Landmark Week for Crypto Policy This development caps off what many are calling ‚ÄúCrypto Week‚Äù on Capitol Hill. Alongside the GENIUS Act, the House also passed two other major crypto bills: the Clarity for Digital Tokens Act, which aims to resolve regulatory uncertainty between the SEC and CFTC, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act , which seeks to block the issuance of a Federal Reserve-backed digital currency. While those two bills still require Senate approval, the GENIUS Act is now ready to be signed into law. The passage of the GENIUS Act was not without drama. Despite delays and pushback from a faction of House conservatives, the bill advanced after personal involvement from President Trump, who has taken a vocal pro-crypto stance during his second term.

XRP rallied over 9% on the news, and several altcoins saw similar momentum. Financial giants such as JPMorgan, Circle, and Coinbase praised the legislation, citing the newfound clarity as a green light for deeper institutional involvement. For Ripple and its global XRP ecosystem, the GENIUS Act is a massive victory . It legitimizes stablecoins as a regulated component of the U.S. financial system, paving the way for Ripple to expand its U.S. operations and further integrate stablecoin functionality, including RLUSD, into global payments infrastructure. Looking Ahead President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law on July 18. Once enacted, regulators will have 180 days to issue implementing rules. Full enforcement of the GENIUS Act is expected by the end of 2026. For Brad Garlinghouse and the XRP Army, this is more than legislation, it‚Äôs validation. It signals the U.S. is finally embracing the future of finance, with Ripple and XRP ready to play a central role in the digital transformation of money.

In the interview, McCaleb offered detailed insight into the philosophical differences that led him to leave Ripple and create Stellar . Responding to the interviewer‚Äôs request to explain the differences between Ripple and Stellar, McCaleb stated that his vision was to build what he called ‚Äúan internet-level protocol.‚Äù He emphasized that such a protocol should be operated by a non-profit entity, comparing it to how the internet functions today. According to him, a payments network should work as openly and interoperably as information flows on the internet, and this required governance and structure that he believed Ripple did not implement. He further explained that another key principle underlying Stellar‚Äôs approach is broad participation across the network. McCaleb argued that a decentralized payments platform depends on the wide distribution of its native asset and engagement from numerous independent participants. He noted that Stellar‚Äôs efforts to distribute its underlying coin as widely as possible were central to this philosophy. To the $XRP Community, watch this video and genuinely answer me this: 1. Why has Ripple been dumping XRP on retail? 2. If Ripple can change the rules, isn‚Äôt that TradFi with blockchain branding and how is it different from SWIFT or PayPal? 3. Why is RippleNet run by a‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/GZ6Z0gcwia ‚Äî Stellar Expert (@StellarExpert) July 15, 2025 Concerns over Centralization and Technical Limitations The interviewer then highlighted that decentralization remains a core value for many within the crypto community and asked McCaleb why Stellar‚Äôs nonprofit, decentralized approach could be advantageous for users and institutions. McCaleb responded by noting a critical technical concern: Ripple‚Äôs consensus algorithm makes it difficult for parties outside Ripple Labs to run nodes. He explained that this results in Ripple Labs operating the majority of the nodes, which, in his view, creates a system that is effectively centralized, comparable to existing platforms such as SWIFT or PayPal. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 McCaleb said the vision for a blockchain-based payments network should instead mirror the openness of the internet, where anyone can participate, and no single entity has the authority to impose arbitrary fees or policies. He warned that centralized control of the network undermines its ability to grow and reach widespread adoption. Closing Remarks on the Importance of Openness In his concluding remarks, McCaleb reiterated the necessity of an open, decentralized system to achieve ubiquity and sustainability. He argued that only a truly open network not controlled by a central authority has the potential to achieve global scale and user trust, similar to the development of the internet. The interview ended shortly afterward, with the host thanking McCaleb and expressing interest in hearing more from him in the future. Stellar Expert‚Äôs tweet drew attention to these points from McCaleb‚Äôs interview, framing them as critical questions for the XRP community to reflect on regarding Ripple‚Äôs ongoing strategy, its level of decentralization, and the original intent behind the technology.

Bitwise CIO Answers,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/can-cryptocurrency-friendly-laws-enacted-under-donald-trump-be-rolled-back-in-later-terms-bitwise-cio-answers/,"Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan responded to concerns about whether the pro-cryptocurrency laws passed today in the US could be overturned by future administrations. Hougan offered a clear message to skeptics: ‚ÄúNo, they will not be overturned.‚Äù Hougan wrote in Bitwise‚Äôs weekly CIO note that this question is frequently asked: ‚ÄúThe question is whether today's legislative achievements will be reversed by future administrations. My answer is clear: No. I wrote about this in detail in my Bitwise CIO memo this week. At this point, the 'arrow is out.'‚Äù Related News: Russia's Largest Bank Announces Cryptocurrency Development Expected in the Country for Years According to Hougan, cryptocurrencies have become a rare issue in Congress that has garnered bipartisan support. The GENIUS Act, which passed the Senate 68-30 in 2025 and received the support of 18 Democratic senators, is a prime example of this. Hougan noted that one of the key reasons for this support is the financial sector's interest in crypto. He said that the entry of major players like BlackRock, JPMorgan, and Morgan Stanley into crypto has made it difficult for policymakers to back down. ‚ÄúAlmost every major financial institution in the US today has a crypto-related initiative,‚Äù Hougan said, adding that millions of Americans and thousands of companies are turning to this space, making it almost impossible to turn back politically. *This is not investment advice.

Here‚Äôs why Memeclip stands head and shoulders above the rest . Snorter Bot ($SNORT) What it claims: Snorter Bot promises a Telegram-based bot for trading meme-coins on Solana, complete with sniper order features, MEV protection, scam detection, and copy-trading. Its presale has garnered approximately $1.9 million in funding. Verdict: Despite the buzz and a robust Telegram community, users still have no access to the bot. The product remains unreleased, and the presale is entirely dependent on future delivery timelines‚Äîleaving participants in limbo about when or if the service will ever materialize. Token6900 ($T6900) What it claims: Token6900 offers pure meme-fueled fun‚Äîowning up to its irreverence with no roadmap, no soft promises, and no ambition beyond being the dankest token on the market. It‚Äôs a satirical take on meme coins that has raised 590K in just a few weeks. Verdict: With no product, no utility, and no governance, Token6900 is effectively a joke in token form. Sure, the meme might get shared in Discord or Telegram, but there‚Äôs zero substance behind the code. No community strategy, no engagement engine‚Äîjust a meme wrapped in anonymity. Memeclip (MCLIP) ‚Äî Where Culture Meets Competition Unlike these presales, Memeclip is already in development . It doesn‚Äôt trade on hype about future deliverables‚Äîor rely on promises of ‚Äúcoming soon.‚Äù What you get is a gamified meme competition platform where: Weekly on-chain meme challenges . Users submit their best, the community votes, and winners receive $MCLIP tokens immediately. Governance-ready tokenomics include a total supply of 9 billion tokens and a 2.07 billion token presale allocated across 33 structured stages. The pricing is transparent and hard-capped, leaving no room for surprise dilution or insider dumps. Culture as a product ‚Äîmemes aren‚Äôt decoration. They are the product. Memeclip‚Äôs entire platform is built around joke creation, voting, and tokenized competition. DAO integration in sight , ensuring that $MCLIP holders will help decide future challenge themes, rules, expansion plans, and feature rollout‚Äîmaking users part of the platform‚Äôs evolution. Why It Matters Real utility now: Memeclip runs active competitions. You don‚Äôt have to wait for code to launch or bots to roll out‚Äîyou‚Äôre competing and earning. Meanwhile, Snorter Bot‚Äôs code is still hidden behind a presale, and Token6900 has nothing functional at all. Engagement through participation: With Memeclip, the users are not just speculating‚Äîthey‚Äôre participating. Every meme submitted and vote cast helps shape the platform‚Äôs momentum. Snorter Bot users are waiting on a product, and Token6900 holders are holding jokes. Transparent, fair token structure: The presale‚Äôs staged approach ensures early buyers are rewarded, and long-term holders aren‚Äôt diluted by backdoor allocations. No surprise token cliffs or hidden vesting. Snorter Bot and Token6900 both lack this level of clarity. Cultural resonance with purpose: Memeclip elevates meme culture into a competitive sport‚Äînot just marketing noise. In contrast, Snorter Bot is all about trading mechanics, and Token6900 is, at best, a meme-only token with zero ambition beyond humor. Industry Feedback Crypto analysts note that Snorter Bot‚Äôs delays and Token6900‚Äôs lack of roadmaps make them risky bets. Analysts say: ‚ÄúSnorter Bot is intriguing but still vapor‚Äîno product, no timeline.‚Äù ‚ÄúToken6900 is funny, but there‚Äôs no strategy‚Äîjust shock value.‚Äù By contrast, early Memeclip participants are actively submitting memes, engaging with weekly challenges, and watching their $MCLIP balance grow‚Äîall in real time. Final Verdict Snorter Bot: Have to wait until a bot actually works. Token6900: Just jokes without substance. Memeclip: Stress tested tokenomics for longevity. Vibrant Community. 100x potential. If you want to invest in future tech that may‚Äîor may not‚Äîland, go for the others. But if you want a presale that‚Äôs already delivering community-driven competition, transparent tokenomics, and actual on-chain culture, Memeclip is the clear leader .

Concurrently, the cryptocurrency has gained 4.71 percent of its value today. Technical indicators still give strong bullish signals, and the price charts also project a bullish market scenario for the day. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $5,190.17 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn‚Äôt be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB up? BNB found support, and the price moved toward $747.4. Moreover, the cryptocurrency has gained up to 4.71 percent of its value if looked at from an overall view. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin‚Äôs price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the start of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2028, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $5,108.65 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB‚Äôs price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coingecko Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB‚Äôs price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin‚Äôs price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, and it reached above $650 in May. Heading into July, BNB is trading approximately $653.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-18 07:40:00

48461788,https://coinpedia.org/?p=483669,1752824537,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Donald Trump‚Äôs New¬† Executive Order Could Add Crypto to 401(k) Retirement Accounts,https://coinpedia.org/news/donald-trumps-new-executive-order-could-add-crypto-to-401k-retirement-accounts/,"The post Donald Trump‚Äôs New Executive Order Could Add Crypto to 401(k) Retirement Accounts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News President Donald Trump is reportedly preparing to sign an executive order that could open U.S. retirement plans, known as 401(k)s, to cryptocurrency and other alternative assets. The move could drastically change how nearly $9 trillion in retirement savings are managed and allocated. A New Direction for 401(k) Investments According to a Financial Times report , the executive order may be signed as early as this week. It would direct Washington regulators to explore pathways for allowing 401(k) accounts to include crypto assets, metals, infrastructure funds, and even private equity and loans. Traditionally, these retirement accounts have been limited to stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. This plan builds on momentum gained earlier this year, when the Department of Labor under Trump‚Äôs influence reversed Biden-era guidance that discouraged the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in retirement plans. Financial giant Fidelity also introduced a new retirement account in April that includes crypto options, further hinting at institutional appetite for such changes. Official Yet Unconfirmed While the executive order seems imminent, Trump‚Äôs camp has emphasized that nothing is official yet. White House spokesman Kush Desai told the media that any decision must come directly from Trump himself. However, he reiterated the president‚Äôs commitment to enhancing financial opportunities for everyday Americans. Big Institutions Preparing Major financial firms are already preparing for this potential shift. Companies like Blackstone, BlackRock, and Apollo are reportedly working on private market offerings tailored for retirement investors. Partnerships with major 401(k) providers such as Vanguard and Empower are also underway, setting the stage for rapid adoption if the order goes through. With over $8.9 trillion held in U.S. retirement accounts, even a small percentage allocated to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum would significantly boost market liquidity and long-term price stability. Global Impact If finalized, the U.S. wouldn‚Äôt be alone in this move. Countries like Japan and the UK have already begun considering or allocating small portions of pension funds to Bitcoin. This global trend shows increasing comfort with crypto as a long-term investment vehicle. For now, all eyes are on Trump. If the order is signed, it could mark a major milestone in crypto adoption, one that integrates digital assets into the heart of American financial planning. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Developed by the makers of CoinPoker, the platform has generated quite a bit of buzz within the cryptocurrency community thanks to its leveraged trading capabilities without asking for any KYC details. The purpose of this article is to highlight the key features of CoinFutures and how it stacks up against the needs of the modern trader who has become ever more inclined to jump into crypto during the current bull cycle. What is CoinFutures? The official website gives a small and clear definition of the platform as a system where users can earn based on their correct price prediction of their favorite assets. Investors can either give a ‚Äúshort‚Äù prediction, believing that the asset‚Äôs value will drop, or go ‚Äúlong‚Äù if they believe the asset could surge in the long term. Features like ‚Äúcash out before the bust‚Äù are highlights of this platform, essentially allowing investors to withdraw before the market turns negative. The platform, powered by AI-driven smart algorithms, mirrors current volatile macroeconomic conditions to offer users a trade-like experience without the complexities of real trading. In simple terms, CoinFutures offers a gamified approach to crypto trading without involving complexities such as wallets or exchanges. How One Can Trade Crypto Futures on CoinFutures? Regardless of how easy CoinFutures makes the prospect of trading crypto futures sound, there are some innate complexities present. That said, the website has provided instructions (in clear terms, no less) on how the entire system works. Picking a Cryptocurrency CoinFutures instructs that users must first pick a cryptocurrency. The options available are many, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being the top two choices. For now, however, the options are limited, with the only other assets including Dogecoin, Tron, and Litecoin. But CoinFutures promises that more will be added in the future. Picking an asset will reveal the crypto‚Äôs price charts, which will be instrumental in deciding the options in the next step. Predicting an Asset‚Äôs Price Action Investors (or in this case, players) will then have to predict whether the price of an asset will go up or down. The options available are simple, with little up and down buttons provided to simplify the process. Selecting the Price and Multiplier Investors must then select the price point the asset is likely to hit. Manual inputs are available, but if the predictions are general, a simple scroll option lets investors add or subtract the price. Choosing a multiplier is also an option. It is said to amplify the prediction. Similar to standard leveraged trading, this protocol involves high risk and high rewards. Placing the Prediction and Cashing Out After placing the prediction, investors can look at the price chart to keep tabs on whether their prediction is likely to pan out. Because CoinFutures is flexible, it also allows investors to cash out quickly if the market is turning against them or going ‚Äúbust‚Äù. What Factors Make CoinFutures a Suitable Platform? CoinFutures offers a unique approach to crypto futures trading. It isn‚Äôt complex and relies on gamification, going as far as portraying investors as ‚Äúplayers‚Äù and the entire ecosystem as betting. This trait alone makes it fit for those who think of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem as akin to a game. Secondly, the price chart shows simulated real crypto volatility, while also allowing investors to amplify their bets with up to a 1000x multiplier. This strategy lets players tap into the volatile markets and leverage the high-risk, high-reward paradigm to earn large returns. Despite the gamified approach, CoinFutures‚Äô crypto futures trading style isn‚Äôt bereft of strategic depth. Players abreast of market conditions could gain an edge when predicting. While veteran crypto enthusiasts can stick to manual mode, less confident players wanting to manage risks can opt for auto-mode instead. This mode lets players set a stop-loss and take-profit level. All of these features wouldn‚Äôt be as effective without a strong user interface, which CoinFutures provides. It has the same CoinPoker-esque approach to design: simple, unique, and yet stylish. All the options are clearly provided, and the additional data about other players‚Äô bets adds another layer to the strategic element of this ‚Äútrading game.‚Äù For those who prefer anonymity, CoinFutures‚Äô no-KYC approach is also an aspect worth highlighting. Payment Options Available on CoinFutures Although CoinFutures revels in being a crypto-centric ecosystem, the payment options available make it accessible to all. For those looking for fiat modes of payment, the following options are available: VISA/Mastercard credit/debit cards Google Pay Apple Pay PIX And for investors looking to deposit on the platform using only crypto, the available options include: USDT USDC Ethereum BTC POL BNB Pros and Cons of CoinFutures CoinFutures takes a not-very-nuanced approach to crypto futures trading, which means that while it offers several benefits, it has some shortcomings as well. Pros It features a simple UI that doesn‚Äôt take long to learn Supports multiple top cryptocurrencies The gamification of crypto futures trading makes it appealing for beginners Offers up to 1000x leverage Flexible in terms of cashing out; users can cash out before they bust Cons Users must download the app to use it Cryptocurrency options could be better How to Get Started with CoinFutures? Here are the steps required to get started with CoinFutures: Step 1 - Register and Download CoinPoker CoinFutures is accessible via the CoinPoker application. Users must download it after completing the registration process . Step 2 - Make a Deposit The next step is to make a deposit, which can be done using the options mentioned in the earlier sections of this article. Step 3 - Open the Crypto Futures Tab Users must then open the ‚ÄúCrypto Futures‚Äù tab to access this betting game before starting to play. The Verdict: Is CoinFutures a Worthy Platform? The cryptocurrency market is bullish right now, and people are itching to get in before the current cycle ends. For them, CoinFutures offers an opportunity to interact with the cryptocurrency ecosystem in a gamified way. It removes the complexities associated with crypto trading, such as exchanges and KYC requirements, and instead offers a simple betting game. The added advantage of flexible cash-out makes it suitable for risk-averse players, and since CoinFutures is available as a small download, players can get started whenever they want. Considering these positive attributes, it is safe to say that yes, CoinFutures is a worthy platform. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

Predictions suggest XRP could reach $5.05 by the end of 2025. Long-term projections show XRP could hit $26.50 by 2030 and $526 by 2050. XRP, one of the top five crypto assets, is gaining renewed traction as institutional adoption expands and its prolonged legal standoff nears resolution. Since President Trump returned to office, XRP has seen a surge in on-chain activity, bullish investor sentiment, and increasing chatter around a possible XRP ETF approval. In July 2025, XRP marked a new all-time high of $3.66 , coinciding with the launch of the ProShares Ultra XRP ETF , which is a milestone that further fueled optimism. With more asset managers eyeing approval and institutional capital flowing in, investors are now closely watching where XRP could head next in this evolving market landscape. With these developments in play, XRP price prediction is becoming a major focus for investors. Can XRP reach $100? Is a $500 target realistic in the long term? This article dives deep into XRP price prediction for 2025 and beyond through 2030.

We expect the XRP coin price to reach $5.81 in 2025. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High 2025 $2.3 $4.89 $5.81 XRP Price Today Cryptocurrency XRP Token XRP Price $¬†3.50159126 10.27% Market cap $¬†207,231,838,974.48 Circulating Supply 59,182,189,917.00 Trading Volume $¬†23,282,077,518.7639 All-time high $3.84 Jan 04, 2018 All-time low $0.002802 Jul 07, 2014 XRP Price Analysis 2025 (H1 2025) In the first half of 2025, the XRP price movement transitioned from a period of decline into a phase of consolidation. In Q2, XRP tested the upper boundary of a multi-month descending wedge at $2.65 around mid-May. However, it failed to hold above a crucial swing low support near $2.10, showing signs of limited upside momentum due to ongoing global tensions at that time. Investors were optimistic in Q2 about a positive legal catalyst around June 16, expecting a favorable update in the SEC lawsuit. Instead, the court issued a 60-day pause in appeals, leaving market sentiment hanging, which proves less momentum in price action. Even matters worsened when, in the first half‚Äôs last month, precisely on June 17, the SEC postponed the approval of Franklin Templeton‚Äôs XRP spot ETF, due to market instability amid geopolitical concerns. During the third weekend of June, the U.S. even fired airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, shaking the global markets. Even top assets like BTC, ETH, dropped, and XRP was no exception either, as it also dipped sharply to $1.94, as sentiment deteriorated. However, the announcement of a ceasefire in the fourth week of June helped the market bounce back, including XRP, and moving to July, bullish sentiment is evident in its price action. XRP Crypto Price Prediction July 2025 Starting June 23rd, the XRP price showed a sharp rebound from its low of $1.94 triggered by a ceasefire news between the US, Israel, and Iran. The bullish sentiment accelerated more on June 28, when Ripple‚Äôs CEO announced they were dropping the cross-appeal in the SEC case . Later, in early July, CLO Stuart Alderoty mentioned that the SEC has also officially ended a four-year legal battle by dropping its appeal against Ripple, too, providing major relief to XRP holders. Nate Geraci , president of The ETF Store, called Ripple‚Äôs move a pivotal moment. He even remarked that the odds of BlackRock jumping into XRP also increased. The ongoing July is filled with positive sentiment that continues to strengthen the XRP price. The investors have been engaged in a ‚Äúbuy-the-dip‚Äù mindset, and investor panic appeared to subside. In July, several more factors joined, like Grayscale added XRP to its Digital Large Cap Fund , and Ripple‚Äôs application for a U.S. banking license further boosted confidence and institutional trust in XRP. More developments that are supporting the ongoing bullish sentiment are due to the third week of July‚Äôs events, for instance, Ripple partners with Ctrl Alt and Dubai Land Department for tokenized real estate on XRP Ledger, which has boosted its utility. The top two major highlights of July is that ProShares launched the first XRP futures ETF on July 18; as a result, the XRP price spiked massively, and other one is that the key crypto bills are passed in the US House of Representatives, including the long-awaited GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act. This would boost legal clarity to digital assets like XRP, and the recent ETF Debut has increased hopes for other asset managers‚Äô applications filed for spot XRP ETFs to be approved before year-end. On the chart, the entire rally appears like a breakout from the upper resistance of the falling wedge pattern. The gains that are displayed from June‚Äôs third week to when writing is nearly 85%, and the day it breached $2.40 in July second week it surged more than 60%. This breakout was catalyzed by Bitcoin‚Äôs new all-time high of $123,231, which pulled altcoins like XRP upward. XRP has now entered a price discovery with a recent ATH marked at $3.66. Similarly, from a technical indicators perspective, XRP price golden cross between its 20-day and 50-day EMAs has expanded. The MACD also shows a golden cross between the MACD line and the signal line, with a strong histogram at 0.1178. This indicates strength in bullish momentum, which is evident in AO too, which is at 0.7373. ncreased exchange outflows, and whale transactions are driving liquidity into the asset. The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) indicator has surged to 0.24, up from 0.04 earlier in early july, highlighting growing accumulation and surging money inflow. However, there are warning signals to consider, which alarm short-term caution with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 89, indicating overheated overbought conditions. A short-term pullback or sideways consolidation is likely before the next leg upward. On the contrary, if XRP price fails to hold the $3.40 support, a retest of $2.95 is possible. Year Potential Low Potential Average Potential High June 2025 $1.95 $3.00 $4.00 XRP Price Prediction 2025 Moreover, XRP has partnered with Wormhole to utilize its phenomenal cross-chain interoperability. Through this road in development, they seek a real-world adoption to boost. Therefore, consistent developments and crucial partnerships, If XRP manages to break above its all-time high of $3.40 in July 2025, after clearing the high-volume resistance zone at $2.40. Then odds are high that it could realistically target $5 by year-end. This potential rally would likely be fueled by growing optimism from banks, institutional investors, and the possibility of ETF approval which has highest odds in H2 of 2025. Source: TokenTerminal Adding to the bullish case, Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD, is now integrated into its Ripple Payments system, and it is performing well per data from the token terminal. The transfer count has surged from 242 transfer counts to 3.1K transfer counts, holders count surged from 818 to 3.3K, and transfer volume grew from $88 million to $694 million, further solidifying its role in global finance. Notably, institutional dominance is strong as per coincarp , with the top 100 addresses holding 70% of XRP‚Äôs circulating supply, which is positioning XRP as the third-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.

There is a possibility that XRP can break through the $8.50 level and hold the price by the end of 2026. The minimum price of XRP will be around $5.50, with an average trading price of $6.25. Ripple Price Prediction 2027 By 2027, market analysts and experts predict that XRP coin price will range between $7.00 to $13.25. XRP price might record an average level of $9.00. XRP Price Prediction 2028 As per our XRP price prediction 2028, Ripple could increase its use cases. We expect the XRP future price to range between $11.25 to $16.00. The average trading price of Ripple could be around $13.75. XRP Price Prediction 2029 Partnerships with multiple governments and wider adoption might strengthen XRP‚Äôs price in 2029. The price of XRP might record a trading range between $14.25 to $21.50, with an average price of $16.50. XRP Price Prediction 2030 The XRP prediction 2030 depends on Ripple‚Äôs ability to expand its offerings across the crypto market. If everything remains positive, the Ripple coin price could scale between $17.00 to $26.50. With that price range, the average tag could be $19.75. Ripple (XRP) Price Projection 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, 2050 Based on historic price sentiments and XRP‚Äôs rising popularity, here are the XRP future price projections for 2031, 2032, 2033, 2040, and 2050.

Yes, XRP is still a good investment for those with a long-term view. With the Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit nearing settlement, increasing institutional interest, and rising on-chain activity, XRP‚Äôs fundamentals remain strong. The integration of RLUSD and potential ETF listings further boosts its utility and market potential. While short-term volatility may persist, XRP price prediction models point to significant upside. If regulatory clarity continues, XRP could be well-positioned to reach ambitious targets like $100‚Äîor even higher‚Äîin the coming years. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

After years of waiting, the XRP community finally saw the breakout they had been hoping for. In just seven days, the token has jumped over 33% , showing that the bulls are back in control. But here‚Äôs the surprise, XRP isn‚Äôt the top performer this week. Another top 3 coin has stolen the spotlight, outperforming XRP‚Äôs performance. Stellar (XLM) Leads the Pack Stellar (XLM) is grabbing attention with a massive rally this month. Over the past week, XLM surged more than 62% , far outpacing XRP‚Äôs gains. It‚Äôs now trading around $0.49, up over 365% in a year. XLM‚Äôs rise is fueled by growing retail and institutional interest, strong partnerships, and real-world use cases. Its role in asset tokenization and hosting PayPal‚Äôs PYUSD stablecoin adds even more credibility. Analysts are watching closely as XLM consolidates near $0.50, with resistance levels at $0.56‚Äì$0.60. Bonk (BONK): The Meme Coin on Fire Bonk (BONK), a meme token on the Solana network, is another standout. In just a week, BONK has jumped by about 53% , leaving XRP and many other altcoins behind. After hitting a recent high of $0.00004022, BONK has slightly pulled back to $0.0000357, but its market cap is still impressive at $2.89 billion.

It has soared nearly 229% in just one month, and 43.5% in a week , crushing XRP‚Äôs performance over the same period. Trading volume peaked at $1.18 billion in 24 hours, showing strong market excitement. If PENGU holds support between $0.025‚Äì$0.027, analysts believe it could rally toward $0.033‚Äì$0.040 soon. Other Coins In The Race Other coins like Hedera (HBAR) and Algorand (ALGO) are also gaining over 40%, but none can match Stellar‚Äôs explosive move.

HBAR‚Äôs price trend is being fueled by strong technical setups and fundamental catalysts. With market cap surging to $11.92 billion and trading volume skyrocketing by 126.07%, the token is now one of the top performers in the altcoin space. The sharp price rise is fostered by hopes of a spot ETF approval in the U.S., Hedera‚Äôs expanding DeFi ecosystem with a $215 million TVL, and strategic enterprise integrations. If you are a HBAR holder, you need to check out this short-term HBAR price prediction. HBAR Price Analysis: The daily chart I‚Äôve shared below clearly shows that HBAR has broken out of a long-term falling wedge pattern. After being in a tight range for months between $0.10 and $0.22, the breakout was confirmed with a strong bullish candle backed by surging volume. Source: Trading View The price now trades at $0.2816, approaching the $0.2976 intraday high, with an eye toward key resistance at $0.37353. It is worth noting that, if the momentum persists, HBAR‚Äôs path to the $0.50 level looks increasingly realistic . That being said, the key support lies at $0.2376. Talking about technicals, the RSI, which sits at 85.17, is deep in overbought territory. On the other hand, the Bollinger Bands are widening, reflecting rising volatility. This is while the price is trading well above the 20-day SMA and Bollinger mid-line at $0.1902, indicating sustained bullish momentum. FAQs Why is HBAR price surging today? HBAR‚Äôs rally is fueled by ETF optimism, strong DeFi growth with $215M in TVL, and key enterprise partnerships. What is the next resistance for HBAR? The next major resistance lies at $0.37353, followed by a psychological target at $0.50. Is it a good time to buy HBAR? While the trend is bullish, RSI suggests overbought conditions.

A recent report revealed that stolen funds from services so far have surpassed the numbers from previous years. Related Reading: Crypto Relief: House Advances GENIUS, CLARITY, Anti-CBDC Bills After Narrow Vote Stolen Crypto Service Funds Hit $2B In 6 months On Thursday, Chainalysis shared its ‚Äú2025 Crypto Crime Mid-Year Update,‚Äù revealing that digital assets theft this year has been ‚Äúmore devastating‚Äù than the entirety of 2024, with over $2.7 billion worth of funds stolen from crypto services so far. The report noted that, by the end of June, more value had been stolen year-to-date (YTD) than during the same period in 2022, the previous worst year on record, suggesting that theft from crypto services could potentially increase another 60% by year‚Äôs end. 2025‚Äôs YTD activity shows a significantly steeper trajectory into the end of the first half than any previous year, with an alarming velocity and consistency. 2022 required 214 days to hit the $2 billion mark in value stolen from services, while 2025 reached comparable theft volumes in 142 days. Additionally, 2025 is 17.27% worse than 2022 during the same six-month period, while 2023 and 2024 saw more moderate and steady accumulation patterns. The surge in the cumulative trend value from crypto services theft ‚Äúpaints a stark picture of 2025‚Äôs escalating threat environment.‚Äù According to the report, ‚ÄúIf this trend continues, we could see 2025 end with more than $4.3 billion stolen from services alone.‚Äù However, it‚Äôs worth noting that the North Korean-linked $1.5 billion hack of Bybit accounts for most of the service losses. The massive breach, which is the largest crypto hack in history, signals a ‚Äúbroader pattern of North Korean cryptocurrency operations, which have become increasingly central to the regime‚Äôs sanctions evasion strategies.‚Äù Last year, known North Korean-related losses reached their highest number, with the value reaching $1.3 billion. Nonetheless, Bybit‚Äôs February hack surpassed it, making 2025 the worst year to date. Personal Wallet Attacks Surge Amid the shifting landscape, the report highlights that the surge in crypto thefts represents an immediate threat to participants. Notably, attackers are increasingly targeting individual users, as personal wallet incidents represent a growing share of total ecosystem theft. YTD, these compromises account for 23.35% of all stolen funds activities in 2025, with Bitcoin (BTC) theft accounting for a substantial share of stolen value. Chainalysis also found that the average loss from compromised personal BTC wallets has increased, suggesting a deliberate target on higher-value individual holdings. Moreover, the number of individual victims on non-Bitcoin and non-EVM chains, like Solana, is increasing. This suggests that Bitcoin holders experience larger losses in terms of value taken, despite being less likely to fall victim to targeted theft. Related Reading: SUI Eyes 140% Move As Price Reclaims $4 ‚Äì New ATH Imminent? Within the personal wallet incidents, a violent subsection has also seen a dramatic surge this year, showing a correlation with BTC price movements and suggesting opportunistic targeting during high-value periods. The forward-looking implication is that, if the value of native assets increases, the value compromised from personal wallets will also likely rise. Per the report, theft using physical violence or coercion against individuals, also known as ‚Äúwrench attacks,‚Äù could potentially hit twice the number of 2021, the next highest year on record. As of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $119,807, a 14.8% increase in the monthly timeframe.

As the altcoin season nears, investors eagerly watch both contenders. Questions loom: which of these blockchain titans will yield the highest returns? Dive into the analysis to discover which altcoin is primed for significant growth. Ethereum Price: Momentum Rally Amid Key Support and Resistance Levels Ethereum experienced strong weekly and monthly growth, with a 20.82% increase over one week and a 24.05% rise over the past month. A slight drop of 4.45% over the last six months indicates that earlier lows provided a foundation for the recent rebound. Price movements have shown a noticeable uptick recently, reflecting renewed strength despite previous declines. The upward shifts suggest that short-term momentum is favoring buyers, while a longer-term view reveals marginal reductions. Current trading levels see Ethereum operating within a range of about $2,110 to $2,870. Immediate support stands near $1,735, while the nearest resistance is around $3,254. Bulls have pushed prices upward, but the relative strength index at 77.24 hints at overbought conditions, introducing caution. Trading ideas include watching for breaks above $3,254 for continued bullish moves or considering buys near the $1,735 support if a pullback occurs. The balance between these key levels will guide short-term decisions. Cardano Price Dynamics and Key Technical Levels Cardano has shown dynamic movements over the recent period with a strong one-month increase of 18% and an impressive weekly boost of over 26%. Over the past six months, the coin experienced a notable decline of more than 31%, highlighting significant volatility. Price levels have varied between approximately $0.48 and $0.70, reflecting fluctuations influenced by broader market pressures. Technical measures have shifted, with bursts of momentum occasionally offset by downturns, marking an environment of both opportunity and risk. At present, Cardano trades within a range from $0.478 to $0.699, with immediate resistance at $0.83 and secondary resistance at $1.05. The nearest support level is positioned at $0.38, with a lower safety net at $0.163 for deeper corrections. Technical indicators signal moderate momentum, while the Relative Strength Index at approximately 72 hints at overbought conditions. Bullish activity is present in the current price zone, yet bearish pressures persist due to resistance and underlying volatility. The trend does not favor either bulls or bears clearly, suggesting a cautious approach. Traders may wait for a breakout above the $0.83 resistance for long positions or consider entering near the $0.38 support level during corrections. Conclusion ETH and ADA both offer unique advantages in the crypto market. ETH has a well-established infrastructure and developer community. ADA, on the other hand, focuses on a more secure and peer-reviewed approach. While both are strong contenders, the choice between them will depend on the investor's belief in long-term growth and technological progress. Either one could potentially deliver 3x returns, but individual research and strategic investment choices are key. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

According to Thursday‚Äôs issue of People‚Äôs Daily , Xi raised these points during an urban development session in Beijing on July‚ÄØ17. He observed that officials tend to direct new initiatives toward select areas, citing ‚Äúartificial intelligence, computing power, new‚Äëenergy vehicles.‚Äù He then asked, ‚ÄúShould every province in the country be developing industries in these areas?‚Äù This query was featured in the Party‚Äôs official organ, People‚Äôs Daily. According to Business Times , analysts warned that some provincial authorities, keen to impress central leadership, were funneling investments into limited priority areas, resulting in over-investment and hindering industry rationalization. Senior leaders have increasingly urged an end to aggressive undercutting in major industries, cautioning that such competitive discounting are shrinking companies‚Äô profits and pushing down what workers earn. Beijing moves to curb unfair EV competition In a related development, on Wednesday Premier Li‚ÄØQiang led a State Council session promised to stop unfair price battles in the electric‚Äëvehicle industry. Earlier this month, the Party‚Äôs top economic committee said it would tighten rules on how local governments make investment decisions. Although the economy has shown underlying strength, slow household spending and a continued uptick in output are exerting downward pressure on prices. Nominal‚ÄØGDP expansion decelerated to 3.9% in Q2, marking the lowest such outcome apart from the pandemic era since records began in‚ÄØ1993. For years, subnational authorities have pursued an investment‚Äëfirst strategy to outpace their peers, fueling rapid economic growth. But chasing growth has left governments with huge debts and wasteful projects, created too much unneeded output that gets sold overseas, and worsened tensions with other countries. In a recent issue , Qiushi, the Party‚Äôs flagship ideological periodical, delivered a sharp assessment of disorderly competition at the local level. It denounced secretive subsidy schemes, imprudent bets on hyped industries, and protectionist measures that disadvantaged external participants. Xi cautions against rapid urbanization Back in March‚ÄØ2024, Xi cautioned provinces against uniform approaches and encouraged them to cultivate ‚Äúnew productive forces.‚Äù These include sectors aligned with regional advantages, while steering clear of speculative ‚Äúindustry bubbles.‚Äù Imbalanced supply and demand are evident in legacy industries like steel as well as in nascent areas such as electric vehicles and photovoltaic equipment. Although the count of EV manufacturers declined for the first time last year, utilization remains below 50‚ÄØpercent of installed capacity. Data compiled by Caixin Global report reveal that 26 out of 31 provinces with 2025 new energy storage objectives have collectively set ambitions in excess of double the countrywide benchmark. During the session, Xi criticized certain local administrations for overreach, emphasizing that ‚Äúpromoting urbanization should be a gradual process that unfolds naturally.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt must align with the laws of economic and social development and should not be divorced from reality or driven by a rush for quick success,‚Äù he added.

It may reach $10, says Javon Marks, citing fractals and the Fibonacci sequence in the long-term price setup. Over $23B in trading volume signals strong retail activity on Coinbase and Kraken this week. XRP Breakout Sparks $10 Forecast After weeks of consolidation and sideways movement, XRP went on the offensive last week, which culminated yesterday when it skyrocketed past $3.65 to tap a new all-time high (on most exchanges and data aggregators). The 20% move up followed the U.S. House of Representatives passing three crypto bills, including the Genius Act. The legislation is expected to set rules for digital assets and is now headed to Donald Trump for final approval. With the price now above the previous high of $3.40, analysts are watching for possible moves toward $3.80, $4.33, and $4.72 in the short term. The intense price action has pushed XRP into focus across major trading platforms. Crypto analyst Javon Marks shared that XRP could still be on track for a move toward $10, using fractal patterns and Fibonacci extensions to support the longer-term outlook. Market Cap and Trading Volume Surge XRP‚Äôs market cap has crossed $215 billion at its peak, climbing from $185 billion the day before. This puts it firmly in third place, according to that metric. Over $23 billion in trading volume was recorded in the last 24 hours. Analysts noted steady buying on Coinbase and Kraken, with increased participation from retail investors. Some pointed to ‚Äúunit bias,‚Äù where traders prefer assets that seem cheaper per unit. $XRP has seen massive net buying on Coinbase and Kraken over the past 36 hours We‚Äôre seeing a clear wave of retail flood in Unit bias is in full effect ‚Äì XRP‚Äôs lower price makes it psychologically more attractive More coins per dollar = perceived value pic.twitter.com/QnBLpZHlub ‚Äî Dom (@traderview2) July 18, 2025 Mixed Technical Signals as RSI Stretches XRP closed above the $3 level earlier in the week and has held above that line since. The RSI reading is now at 89, showing that the asset may be in overbought territory. Some traders may view this as a signal for a potential cooldown. However, the MACD indicator still shows upward momentum. The current chart setup points to possible continuation if buying pressure remains strong. Market participants are watching for volume shifts and price confirmation near key resistance zones.

The milestone comes just one day after ETHA posted $489 million, reflecting the growing appetite for the world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency among institutional investors. ETF Frenzy Reshaping ETH Landscape Data from SoSoValue shows that on July 17, spot Ethereum ETFs raked in daily total net inflows of $602.02 million, just shy of the July 16 all-time high of $726.74 million. ETHA led the charge, attracting a record-breaking $546.70 million in fresh capital. The fund has been on a run of 10 straight green trading days since recording nearly $47 million in outflows on July 2. In that time, it has accumulated $2.132 billion in net inflows, driving much of the sector‚Äôs total of $2.8 billion gained in the same period. But while BlackRock was the star of the show yesterday, several other funds helped fuel the rally, albeit on much smaller scales. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH saw $17.19 million in inflows, bringing its total assets to $2.09 billion. Grayscale‚Äôs traditional ETH fund added $29.9 million, even though its mini ETH Trust (ETHE) remained flat. Elsewhere, Bitwise‚Äôs ETHW ETF also saw demand, pulling in a respectable $4.44 million and pushing its cumulative inflows to over $408 million. Meanwhile, 21Shares‚Äô CETH fund drew $3.78 million in new capital, with total assets now at $41 million. Even smaller ETFs like Franklin Templeton‚Äôs EZET and Invesco‚Äôs QETH have maintained steady flows, though no daily inflows were reported yesterday. Cumulative inflows across all Ethereum ETFs have now surpassed $7 billion, per SoSoValue, with combined assets under management at $17.32 billion, representing 4.19% of ETH‚Äôs total market cap. The funds have now seen inflows for 10 consecutive weeks, with the last red mark coming in early May, when the sector collectively bled slightly more than $38 million. Since then, the crypto investment products have hit high notes, with the $1.78 billion in total net inflows since July 14 being the pick of the bunch. SoSoValue‚Äôs data also shows that July has been the most successful month for spot ETH ETFs since inception. So far, they have attracted more than $2.88 billion in new capital, with ten trading days still to go. The next highest figure was recorded in December 2024, when the sector received inflows worth $2.08 billion. ETH Price Soars on Institutional Tailwinds The market has reacted positively to this tidal wave of institutional capital, with ETH‚Äôs price catapulting to levels not witnessed in six months. At the time of this writing, ETH had reached $3,630, after surging 8.5% in the last 24 hours. The asset also gained 22.2% over the past seven days, and rallied 43% across one month, dramatically reversing its year-on-year negative performance to just -6.3%, and narrowing the gap to its $4,878 all-time high to less than 26%.

While ETH has surged by over 20% in the last seven days, altcoins like XRP, Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Stellar (XLM) have also seen major increases. As the bullish mood in the market continues, the expiration date for option contracts in the crypto market has come today, as it does every Friday. According to data for the third week of July, $4.95 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and $880 million worth of Ethereum (ETH) options will expire on July 18 on the Deribit derivatives exchange. Accordingly, the Put/Call Ratio of BTC options is 0.78, the maximum loss point is $114,000 and the notional value is $4.95 billion. When we look at Ethereum, ETH options have a Put/Call Ratio of 1.04, a maximum loss point of $2,950, and a notional value of $880 million. The maximum pain point is the level at which the cryptocurrency price settles at a certain value as an option approaches its expiration date, resulting in significant losses for the largest number of option traders. At this point, significant volatility could be seen in Bitcoin's price following the $4.9 billion options expiration on July 18th. While the maximum pain point is at $114,000 for BTC and $2,950 for Ethereum, investors could push prices to this level through market manipulation, as market prices are above the maximum pain point. Corporates are Coming! Greeks.live analysts said that Ethereum has quickly taken over the bull market and market sentiment has shifted sharply to optimism. Analysts noted that the options market is still approaching FOMO, with institutional investors losing their composure and starting to enter the market. ‚ÄúEtheruem led the recovery of all altcoins, and the continued uptrend without a pullback greatly encouraged market participants and further raised their expectations. The rate of call option (bull bet) transactions has increased in the last two weeks, while institutions are also changing their positions.‚Äù *This is not investment advice.

The clock is ticking on what could be the biggest stealth breakouts of the year, Pepe coin and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Phase 5 Mutuum Finance presale recently crossed 80% sold out at $0.03. This is as cheap as the token gets, with later phases guaranteeing a hike in price. Presale has garnered more than $12.6 million and opened up to more than 13600 unique holders. While casual investors chase old headlines, savvy whales are quietly loading up on this under-the-radar DeFi rocket with real utility, low float, and explosive upside. PEPE and a few others are also trending, but if you‚Äôre looking for that potential 50x moonshot, Mutuum Finance is the one you‚Äôll wish you bought before July ends. PEPE‚Äôs Rebound Signals Growing Momentum as July Heats Up As speculative energy returns to the market mid-July, PEPE has emerged as one of the meme coins regaining traction, currently trading around $0.0000138. After a dip earlier in the summer, whale accumulation and renewed on-chain activity have helped push PEPE back into bullish territory, with recent breakouts above resistance drawing attention from short-term traders. While PEPE‚Äôs community-driven volatility remains a key factor, its performance is beginning to mirror a broader shift in sentiment as traders hunt for tokens that could ride the next wave. And while PEPE rides the rebound narrative, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quietly positioning itself as the lesser-known token that could outpace them all in the coming months. Mutuum‚Äôs Phase 5 Presale Approaches Sellout as Demand Surges Mutuum Finance is gaining traction in Phase 5 of the presale. The project stands out from other projects in that it has real use cases and does not rely on hype. Investor interest is growing with the project having already passed more than $12.6 million and having over 13600 token holders. Mutuum Finance to Introduce USD‚ÄëCollateralized Stablecoin Mutuum Finance is building a fully-collateralized USD-stabilized stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The project was also audited by CertiK, the most secure blockchain security firm. Besides providing reassurance to the investors regarding the code base integrity and transparency, the audit conducted indicates that the project is confident to establish a secure DeFi protocol. For the promise to be made a reality, the project has launched a 50,000 Bug Bounty Program in association with CertiK. The four categories of vulnerabilities are specifically categorized as critical, major, minor and low. Building a Stronger Future Together: Community Growth and Rewards Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is awarding a $100,000 giveaway , as a token of appreciation to early supporters and in remembrance of presale frenzy. Ten winners will receive a $10,000 award in MUTM tokens as a token of appreciation for being among the early adopters of the project. As more and more community are growing at an accelerating rate, the early adopters are rewarded not only with the potential future benefits but also with real rewards. With its unique leaderboard system the top 50 holders of Mutuum Finance will be rewarded with bonus tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already raised $12.6 million, drawn in over 13,600 holders, and is nearly sold out in Phase 5 at its lowest price of $0.03. Backed by real-world utility, a CertiK audit, and an upcoming USD-backed stablecoin, it‚Äôs positioned for serious upside. A $100,000 giveaway and leaderboard rewards are accelerating adoption ahead of schedule. If you‚Äôre looking for a 50x DeFi breakout before 2025 ends, this is the one to watch. Secure your spot before the next price jump.

Investors are on the lookout for the next big opportunity. This article dives into specific coins that seem poised for significant growth, offering insights into which assets could see remarkable returns in the coming months. Stellar Price Surge with Key Support and Resistance Levels Last month, Stellar surged by nearly 79%, marking a significant short-term rally. Despite this impressive performance, the coin saw a mild downturn of about 3.8% over the past six months, suggesting a mixed long-term outlook. While recent gains display strong momentum, the overall trend remains nuanced, indicating that traders should remain attentive to market changes. The current trading range for Stellar is between $0.21 and $0.28, with key support at $0.18 and resistance at $0.31. If the price stays above $0.18, bullish traders might look to accumulate on dips. A breakout above $0.31 could lead to higher resistance at $0.38, providing profit-taking opportunities. However, with the relative strength index around 83, the coin appears overbought, warranting caution for a possible correction. Monitoring price behavior near these levels is crucial, as traders could find potentials to buy low and sell high in this range-bound market. Cosmos Price Update: Balancing Recent Gains and Long-Term Decline Cosmos experienced a 14.79% rise in the past month, along with a 13.42% jump over the last week. However, a six-month decline of nearly 29% reflects ongoing challenges. The price movement has shown volatility but also hints at a recovery. The coin previously traded lower and has shifted toward a steadier range recently. The short-term growth signals a rebound, even amid broader market pressures observed over the half-year period. Current evaluation of Cosmos shows the price trading within a modest range, with visible support and resistance levels for traders. The coin trades between $3.56 and $4.63, with immediate resistance at $5.16 and secondary resistance at $6.22. Support appears around $3.03, while a secondary level lies near $1.97. Market indicators present a mixed picture with slight bullish pressure. Many traders are monitoring the potential for an upward breakout above $5.16, while caution remains due to the broader downward trend reflected in the half-year performance. Quant QNT: Short-Term Gains Amid Mixed Six-Month Trends Quant experienced a modest price uplift with nearly a 6% increase over the last month and a brisk 4.15% gain over the past week. Over the six-month period, the coin recorded about a 5% decline, reflecting a mix of short-term recovery and longer-term pressure. Price behavior has shown variability as recent gains underline temporary optimism while the overall decline suggests ongoing market reassessment. Trading activity during these periods indicates that the market has been reactive to both immediate stimuli and broader sentiment shifts. Currently, Quant trades within a range of roughly $86.73 to $126.77. Immediate resistance is noted near $146.18 with a second barrier at $186.22, and support levels exist around $66.10 with a deeper test at $26.06. Technical indicators such as a Momentum reading of 5.20 and an RSI of 57.04 imply balanced market sentiment with a slight bullish tilt. Bulls appear to be applying moderate pressure, driving short-term gains, though the absence of a pronounced trend calls for caution.

Sounds seamless, right? In reality, for many, every single one of these micro-transactions could trigger a taxable event, turning a simple purchase into a complex accounting headache. This burdensome reality has long been a major barrier to the widespread adoption of digital assets for everyday use. But there‚Äôs promising news on the horizon: the White House is signaling continued support for a crypto tax exemption for de minimis transactions, a move that could significantly streamline how we use digital currencies. What Exactly is the De Minimis Rule Crypto Exemption, and Why Does It Matter? The term ‚Äúde minimis‚Äù comes from the Latin phrase ‚Äúde minimis non curat lex,‚Äù meaning ‚Äúthe law does not concern itself with trifles.‚Äù In the context of taxation, a de minimis exemption allows small amounts of income or gains to be excluded from tax reporting requirements. While common in other areas of finance ‚Äì for instance, a small amount of foreign currency gain might be exempt ‚Äì it has been notably absent for cryptocurrency until now. For cryptocurrency, this exemption is crucial. Currently, if you use Bitcoin to buy a $5 gift card and that Bitcoin has appreciated by even a few cents since you acquired it, you theoretically owe capital gains tax on that tiny profit. Tracking hundreds, if not thousands, of such micro-transactions over a year becomes an accounting nightmare for individuals and a deterrent for merchants considering accepting crypto. A de minimis rule crypto exemption would simplify this process immensely, making it practical to use crypto as a medium of exchange rather than just an investment vehicle. Key aspects of a potential de minimis exemption for crypto: Simplified Reporting: Eliminates the need to track tiny gains on everyday purchases. Encourages Adoption: Makes cryptocurrency more user-friendly for daily transactions. Reduces Burden: Alleviates the tax compliance load for individuals and small businesses. Fosters Innovation: Creates a more fertile ground for crypto-based payment solutions to flourish in the U.S. White House Crypto Policy: A Clear Signal for Everyday Payments In a recent media briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed the White House‚Äôs ongoing commitment to supporting de minimis tax exemptions for cryptocurrency transactions. This reiteration underscores the administration‚Äôs broader aim to integrate crypto payments seamlessly into everyday life. This isn‚Äôt a new stance; the Trump administration has consistently expressed interest in fostering an environment where digital assets can be used without unnecessary friction. The current White House crypto policy reflects a growing recognition that for digital currencies to achieve their full potential as a medium of exchange, the existing tax framework needs to adapt. Officials are actively exploring various legislative pathways to enshrine this exemption into future U.S. laws. This proactive approach suggests a serious intent to move beyond discussions and towards concrete policy implementation, which is a significant positive for the crypto community. This support follows previous attempts by lawmakers to introduce similar measures. For example, Senator Cynthia Lummis, a vocal proponent of clear crypto regulation, made an unsuccessful bid to incorporate a crypto tax exemption for gains under $300 into the recently enacted One Big Beautiful Bill Act. While that particular effort didn‚Äôt pass, the White House‚Äôs continued backing indicates that the idea itself has strong bipartisan support and remains a high priority. Understanding Cryptocurrency Taxes: How This Could Change Your Digital Wallet Experience Currently, the IRS treats cryptocurrency as property for tax purposes, similar to stocks or real estate. This means that every time you sell, trade, or use crypto to purchase goods or services, it‚Äôs considered a taxable event. You‚Äôre required to calculate your capital gain or loss based on the difference between the fair market value of the crypto at the time of the transaction and your cost basis (what you originally paid for it). For those new to the space or simply trying to navigate their digital assets, cryptocurrency taxes can be incredibly complex. Imagine the scenario: You buy 0.001 BTC for $50. A month later, you use that 0.001 BTC to buy a $55 coffee. You just realized a $5 capital gain, which you need to report. Now multiply that by dozens or hundreds of small transactions throughout the year. The administrative burden quickly becomes overwhelming. A de minimis exemption would free users from this reporting nightmare for small transactions, allowing them to use crypto like cash without the constant worry of tax implications. This shift would fundamentally alter the user experience, making crypto wallets far more practical for daily spending. The proposed exemption would likely apply to capital gains on transactions below a certain threshold, such as $50 or $200, which has been debated in various legislative proposals. This targeted relief would specifically address the micro-transaction problem, paving the way for broader merchant adoption and everyday utility. What Does This Mean for US Crypto Regulation? The White House‚Äôs stance on de minimis exemptions is a significant indicator for the future of US crypto regulation . It suggests a pragmatic approach, focusing on removing barriers to innovation and adoption rather than solely on stringent controls. This move could be part of a broader strategy to ensure the U.S. remains competitive in the global digital asset landscape. A clear, favorable stance on such a fundamental tax issue sends a strong signal to innovators, investors, and the general public that the government is serious about integrating digital assets into the mainstream economy. It could: Boost Innovation: Encourage startups to build payment solutions leveraging crypto. Attract Investment: Make the U.S. a more attractive destination for crypto businesses. Increase Adoption: Lead to more merchants accepting crypto and more consumers using it. Set a Precedent: Potentially influence other countries to adopt similar user-friendly tax policies. While the legislative path is often winding, the clear support from the executive branch provides significant momentum. It demonstrates a willingness to address the practical challenges faced by crypto users and businesses, potentially setting a positive tone for other forthcoming regulatory frameworks, including stablecoin legislation and market structure rules. The Path Forward for Crypto Tax Exemption While the White House‚Äôs consistent backing for a crypto tax exemption is a major step, the actual implementation requires legislative action. This means working with Congress to draft and pass a bill that incorporates the de minimis provision. The process can be slow, involving debates over the exact threshold, scope, and effective date of the exemption. Key considerations for lawmakers will include: Threshold Amount: Determining the maximum gain that can be exempted (e.g., $50, $200, $600). Transaction Type: Specifying whether it applies to all transactions or only certain types (e.g., purchases of goods/services). Anti-Abuse Provisions: Ensuring the exemption isn‚Äôt exploited for large-scale tax avoidance. Bipartisan Support: Building consensus across political divides to ensure passage. The fact that officials are ‚Äúexploring legislative pathways‚Äù suggests that concrete proposals are being developed or refined. This ongoing dialogue between the executive branch and Capitol Hill is essential for translating policy intentions into actionable law. The collective effort aims to make crypto more accessible and usable for the average American, moving it beyond a niche investment and into a practical payment method. The White House‚Äôs consistent backing for a de minimis crypto tax exemption marks a pivotal moment for the digital asset ecosystem in the United States. By addressing one of the most significant practical barriers to everyday crypto use, this policy shift has the potential to unlock a new era of mainstream adoption, innovation, and financial freedom. While legislative hurdles remain, the clear signal from the executive branch offers immense hope for a future where using cryptocurrency is as simple and straightforward as using traditional money. This isn‚Äôt just about tax relief; it‚Äôs about paving the way for a more integrated and user-friendly digital economy.

On¬†January 20, 2025, the day Gensler officially stepped down as SEC Chair, XRP was trading at¬†$2.95. As of¬†July 18, the token has surged to¬†$3.41, marking a¬†15.42% gain¬†over six months. XRP price since Gensler resigned. Source: CoinMarketCap That means a $1,000 investment in XRP on the day Gensler exited the SEC is now worth¬†$1,154, netting a return of $154 in just under 180 days. This follows months of bullish momentum that began building after Gensler‚Äôs resignation announcement back in¬†November 2024, when XRP was trading around¬†$1.10. From that November 21 price level, XRP has now climbed over¬†209%. XRP price since Gensler announced he would resign. Source: CoinMarketCap XRP trading volume In parallel, XRP‚Äôs trading volume has remained elevated. Over the last 24 hours, the token saw¬†$22.81 billion¬†in trading activity, up¬†91%¬†compared to the previous day while its market cap has topped¬†$201.8 billion, placing it firmly as the¬†third largest cryptocurrency¬†by market cap, behind only Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). On-chain data from Santiment and Ali Martinez recently showed that whales holding between 100 million and 1 billion XRP have been aggressively adding to their positions, driving both price and market cap upward. Moreover, XRP‚Äôs price action since January shows a breakout from months of consolidation, firmly decoupling from broader crypto stagnation and rising nearly¬†490% year-over-year. While correlation doesn‚Äôt equal causation, the timing of Gensler‚Äôs resignation and XRP‚Äôs subsequent price surge has not gone unnoticed by market watchers. With the SEC‚Äôs posture toward digital assets now in flux and the broader market continuing to rally, many investors view XRP as a strategic bet on regulatory normalization and institutional acceptance. As of July 18, XRP is trading at¬†$3.41, just¬†under its all-time high of $3.84¬†set in January 2018.

XRP: Is it 2017 all over again? ""History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes,"" American writer Mark Twain said. The enduring adage suggests recurring patterns and themes throughout history, rather than exact replicas of past events, and applies to the ongoing bull market in XRP (XRP). The payments-focused cryptocurrency hit lifetime highs above $3.5 early Friday, extending the ascent that began in November following a breakout from a multi-year symmetrical triangle or price squeeze. Since 2018, XRP's price had been coiled tightly within a symmetrical triangle, much like a spring storing energy. The pattern eerily mirrors price action observed a decade ago, when prices consolidated in a symmetrical triangle for years, setting the stage for a humongous rally in 2017. XRP picked up a strong bid at $0.00056 and broke out of the multi-year triangle in March 2017, eventually rallying to a high of $3.3 by early January 2018. Thats a staggering several thousand percent surge in ten months. Intriguingly, XRP's price action from the bear market of 2018 to the present day appears to be an almost exact replay of that historical pattern, as the 580% surge from the early November follows a multi-year squeeze in the symmetrical triangle. In other words, if the history continues to rhyme, XRP could see bigger gains in the months ahead, potentially matching the powerful bull run of 2017. Short-term outlook: Bull breather likely With XRP's recent sharp move higher, Bollinger bands, or volatility bands placed two standard deviations above and below the 20-day simple moving average, have widened to the highest since December. The spread between the bands has reached levels that have historically marked an onset of broad rangeplay. Additionally, momentum indicators such as the MACD histogram, have flipped bearish on shorter duration time frames alongside RSI turning lower from overbought, or above 70 levels, to signal correction. Therefore, XRP could consolidate in a broad range before chalking out the next leg higher. AI's take: XRP's sharp rally has stretched its Bollinger Bands to multi-month highs, suggesting volatility could lead to a broad trading range next. While momentum indicators like the MACD and RSI are flipping bearish on shorter timeframes, signaling a potential correction, this wider range could allow for profit-taking or consolidation before the next major move. Resistance: Record highs Support: $3.4, $3, $2.9 Bitcoin: $120K resistance holds Since Monday, Bitcoin (BTC) has failed at least three times to establish a foothold above $120,000, leaving multiple candles with long upper wicks on the daily chart. That signifies bullish exhaustion. The crisscross price moves around the 50- and 100-hour SMAs also suggest the same. This, coupled with the 14-day RSI rolling over from the overbought zone, indicates scope for price pullback. Its common for markets to revisit key breakout points before staging bigger rallies, meaning prices could revisit the May high (former record high) of $111,965. AI's take: The recent price action suggests that BTC needs to consolidate or find fresh momentum before attempting another sustained push higher. Resistance: $123,181, $130,000, $140,000. Support: $117,500, $115,740, $111,965. Ether: To outperform BTC Ether's (ETH) hourly chart shows a bearish divergence of the RSI. That, coupled with pullback risks in market leader bitcoin, suggests potential for price losses in ETH. That said, the ether-bitcoin ratio seems headed for a bullish golden cross of the 50- and 200-day SMAs. Ether, therefore, could continue to outperform BTC. Moreover, ETH's hourly chart averages continue to trend north, indicating a bullish set up to suggest that price pullbacks, if any, could be short-lived and the overall trajectory favors a move to $4,000. AI's take: Ether's stronger long-term bullish setup against BTC (golden cross) and trending hourly averages suggest any dips will be brief. Resistance: $4,000, $4,100, $4300. Support: $3,420, $3083, $3,000. Solana: May highs in focus Here's a refined version, making it more concise and impactful: Solana's SOL (SOL) climb has temporarily stalled at the $185-$187 resistance range, last seen in May. However, with the Guppy momentum indicator recently turning bullish and prices holding comfortably above the Ichimoku cloud, it looks like it's only a matter of time before this resistance flips into solid support. Volatility could pick up soon as the indicator measuring the spread between Bollinger bands bounces of long-held support. A potential cross below the Ichimoku cloud on the hourly would increase the risk of a deeper pullback. AI's take: Expect volatility to pick up, and while a push to $200 is likely, watch for any hourly break below the Ichimoku Cloud as a warning for deeper pullbacks. Resistance: $187, $200, $218. Support: $168, $157, $145.",Markets|XRP|Bitcoin|Solana|Ether|Markets|News,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|BTC|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-07-18 09:32:17

No middlemen. No hidden fees. No delays. Just a clear, transparent connection between you and a professional trader, powered by smart contracts. This is no longer a hypothetical. This is the on-chain investing revolution‚Äîand Grvt Strategies is leading the charge. Grvt (pronounced ‚ÄúGravit‚Äù) is launching ‚ÄúStrategies‚Äù, an entirely new investment paradigm, a peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace where everyday users can allocate capital into professionally curated investment and trading strategies managed by top-tier professionals. For over a century, wealth creation has been tightly bound to the institutions of Wall Street. If you weren‚Äôt on the inside‚Äîworking in finance, connected to the right funds, or able to meet minimum thresholds‚Äîyou were on the outside, often limited to passive products or secondhand exposure. But the tides are turning. Technology is reshaping what it means to invest. And the next wave is not just digital‚Äîit‚Äôs decentralized. Grvt Strategies sits at the center of this shift, pioneering a new model where investing is open, peer-to-peer, and finally accessible to all. The story of modern investing is a story of slow democratization. Wall Street was the original gatekeeper‚Äîan ecosystem built on exclusivity, relationships, and regulatory walls. Fintech changed the game by streamlining access: think Robinhood, eToro, and Wealthfront. It brought user-friendly design and lower barriers, but still operated within the traditional finance (TradFi) framework. DeFi took it further‚Äîremoving intermediaries altogether and building financial tools directly on-chain. In theory, anyone with an internet connection could participate. In practice, the landscape became fragmented, opaque, and risky for the average user. The Grvt Breakthrough: Think Airbnb, But For Investing Grvt Strategies takes inspiration from the user-centric design of platforms like Airbnb and applies it to wealth creation. Instead of navigating opaque investment products, users browse a curated marketplace of strategies, each one managed by verified traders, complete with performance metrics, risk profiles, and fully audited logic, all visible on-chain. With just a few clicks, users can allocate capital to strategies that match their goals, risk appetite, or market view. But unlike copy trading platforms, which often suffer from delays and slippage, Grvt integrates strategy execution directly into smart contracts, meaning there‚Äôs zero lag, no middlemen, and real-time participation. Why This Matters: From Wall Street To All Streets Grvt Strategies is powered by a mix of DeFi innovation and TradFi professionalism. The first cohort of Strategy Managers includes elite players such as Ampersan (ex-Optiver market makers who‚Äôve supported $400B+ in digital asset volume), AllDefi (a quant-driven team from one of the top-performing crypto hedge funds), b-cube.ai (a VASP-regulated AI platform offering institutional-grade algorithmic strategies), Rogue Traders (a prop trading team with a mentorship-driven mission), and others like Meerkat and MizerXBT, top-ranked traders and PhDs Clearly, this kind of roster is a clear signal that the era of investing in the dark is indeed over. Prioritizing Simplicity The old model kept high-performance investing locked behind fund structures and wealth thresholds. The new model? Non-custodial, fully transparent, and user-controlled. On Grvt, users are not following trades, they‚Äôre investing alongside the experts, directly and securely, in a fully automated system. Put simply, they retain control of their assets, always. In this way, Grvt is designing trust and clarity into every interaction. The platform reimagines the investment experience through modern UI/UX inspired by consumer platforms like Airbnb and Amazon. Users can browse strategies like they would shop for gear: clean filters, smart search, and clear risk indicators. Something New Grvt Strategies isn‚Äôt trying to compete with old models, rather it‚Äôs creating an entirely new one. It‚Äôs the bridge between retail investors and institutional strategies, between transparency and performance, between opportunity and action. In any case, the future is peer-to-peer, on-chain, and built for everyone, and that‚Äôs where Grvt Strategies thrives. Visit Grvt Strategies‚Äô official website for additional information.

The surge in XRP‚Äôs price also reflects increased demand for remittance-friendly tokens. Cardano (ADA) took part in the rally and gained 14.6%. The renewed push in the market began in November 2024, when Donald Trump won the elections. Bitcoin gained 36% that month, its fourth-best performance since 2021. GENIUS Act and CBDC ban define Washington‚Äôs crypto pivot The gains come after three significant crypto bills passed in the U.S House of Representatives. Among the most influential developments was the enactment of the GENIUS Act. The bill establishes a structure to regulate stablecoins and provide consumer protection. The House approved it and is currently awaiting the signature of the President. Another bill targets regulatory clarity, which seeks to separate the roles of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It seeks to distinguish between commodities and securities in the digital asset world. The bill is now moving to the Senate. A third bill was also enacted by a narrow margin, given that it would not allow the issuance of any central bank digital currency in the future. The proposal bans a U.S. government-backed digital dollar, which is also being considered in the Senate. The three bills are part of what the Trump administration has called ‚Äúcrypto week,‚Äù which aims to make the United States a global leader in blockchain finance. The administration says that it desires to create the ‚Äúcrypto capital of the world,‚Äù using the power of law to create transparency and opportunity to push innovation. Trump‚Äôs crypto links stir conflict concerns While crypto markets rally on policy progress, President Trump has had direct exposure to the industry, which has raised concerns. The financial disclosures made in July 2025 revealed that he obtained $58 million in 2024 related to crypto activities, mainly through the sale of WLFI tokens associated with World Liberty Financial. Those earnings ranked behind only his hospitality earnings and are projected to increase. Projections in 2025 predict a further $390 million through token sales and through his meme coin, launched earlier this year. The disclosures also show Trump has invested in digital ETFs, tokenized real estate, and mining Bitcoins, raising concerns about transparency and impact. His critics have said such investments are a conflict of interest because his administration promotes pro-industry reforms. The current crypto movement resembles the 2021 bull run market cap, which reached over $3 trillion in a rally marked by DeFi, NFTs, and pandemic liquidity. That upward momentum was interrupted by the crash of large exchanges such as FTX and Terra, and the price of Bitcoin bottomed at $15,625. The crypto market very close to a $4 trillion market cap, making the market cap almost as large as that of the world‚Äôs most valuable publicly traded company, Nvidia.

The latest reading from the Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a fascinating snapshot of investor psychology. As of July 18, this crucial indicator, provided by the software development platform Alternative, registered a value of 73. While it marks a slight dip of one point from the previous day, the index firmly remains within the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone. But what does this really mean for your crypto holdings, and how can you navigate these fluctuating sentiments? Understanding the Crypto Fear & Greed Index: A Barometer of Market Sentiment The Crypto Fear & Greed Index serves as a powerful barometer for gauging the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market. Ranging from 0 to 100, it provides a clear visual representation: 0 signifies ‚ÄòExtreme Fear,‚Äô suggesting investors are highly anxious and likely selling, potentially signaling a buying opportunity for contrarians. Conversely, 100 indicates ‚ÄòExtreme Greed,‚Äô where euphoria drives prices up, often warning of an impending correction as the market becomes overbought. This tool is invaluable for investors seeking to understand the collective mood and make more informed decisions, moving beyond mere price charts to grasp the underlying human element of the crypto market sentiment . The index doesn‚Äôt just pull a number out of thin air. It meticulously aggregates data from six distinct factors, each weighted to reflect its influence on overall market psychology. Let‚Äôs break down how this comprehensive score is calculated: Volatility (25%): This component measures the current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin, comparing them to average values over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often signals fear, while stable markets can foster greed. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): This factor analyzes the current volume and market momentum of Bitcoin, comparing it to historical averages. Strong buying volume and momentum often correlate with greedy sentiment. Social Media (15%): The index scans various social media platforms for crypto-related hashtags and analyzes the speed and frequency of posts. A high volume of positive sentiment posts can indicate increasing greed. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) Historically, this component gathered public opinion through weekly polls, directly asking investors about their market outlook. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): This metric assesses Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. An increasing Bitcoin dominance can sometimes signal fear, as investors might be moving out of altcoins and into the perceived safety of Bitcoin. Conversely, decreasing dominance might suggest a shift towards altcoin speculation, indicating higher risk appetite and potentially greed. Google Trends (10%): By analyzing search query data for crypto-related terms, the index gauges public interest and curiosity. Sudden surges in searches for terms like ‚ÄúBitcoin price manipulation‚Äù or ‚Äúcrypto crash‚Äù often indicate fear, while terms like ‚Äúhow to buy crypto‚Äù or ‚ÄúBitcoin rally‚Äù suggest growing public interest and greed. The current reading of 73, firmly in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone, suggests that despite a minor pullback, investors are still feeling largely optimistic and confident about the market‚Äôs trajectory. This is a crucial insight, as historical data often shows that extreme greed can precede market corrections, while extreme fear can present prime buying opportunities. Navigating the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô Zone: What Does It Mean for Your Strategy? When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index hovers in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone, it‚Äôs a double-edged sword. On one hand, it reflects strong positive momentum, with many assets potentially seeing upward price action. This can be exhilarating for investors who have held through leaner times. On the other hand, sustained periods of high greed can lead to irrational exuberance, where fundamental analysis takes a backseat to FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). This is precisely when the market becomes susceptible to sharp pullbacks or even significant corrections. Consider the historical patterns: often, when the index hits extreme greed (e.g., above 80-90), it signals that the market is overheating. This is when seasoned investors might start taking profits, reducing their exposure, or at least becoming more cautious about new entries. Conversely, extreme fear (e.g., below 20-30) often marks capitulation, presenting excellent long-term buying opportunities for those brave enough to go against the prevailing sentiment. For current investors, being in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone might prompt questions like: Have my assets reached their short-term peak? Is it time to de-risk or rebalance my portfolio? Am I making decisions based on emotion rather than sound strategy? It‚Äôs vital to remember that while the index provides a valuable sentiment overlay, it should not be the sole basis for your investment decisions. It‚Äôs a complementary tool to your technical and fundamental analysis. The Impact of Market Volatility and Bitcoin Dominance on Cryptocurrency Trends Market volatility is an inherent characteristic of the cryptocurrency space, and its influence on the Fear & Greed Index is significant. High volatility, especially rapid downward movements, quickly pushes the index towards fear, as investors panic and sell off assets. Conversely, sustained periods of lower volatility or consistent upward trends can fuel greed. Understanding this dynamic is key to interpreting the index‚Äôs movements. When the market is calm, investors might feel more confident, leading to speculative buying. However, sudden spikes in volatility, often triggered by macro-economic news or regulatory FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt), can rapidly shift sentiment. The role of Bitcoin dominance also provides critical insights into broader cryptocurrency trends . When Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance rises, it often suggests that investors are moving capital from altcoins into Bitcoin, which is typically seen as the less risky asset in the crypto space. This flight to ‚Äúsafety‚Äù can indicate underlying fear or uncertainty about the altcoin market. Conversely, when Bitcoin dominance falls, it often signals an ‚Äúaltcoin season,‚Äù where investors are more willing to take risks on smaller, potentially higher-growth altcoins, reflecting a more greedy or speculative market environment. The current reading of the index, combined with Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance, can give a nuanced view of where capital is flowing and the overall risk appetite. Actionable Insights for Navigating Current Cryptocurrency Trends Given the index‚Äôs current position in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone, what actionable steps can you take? Here are some considerations: Exercise Caution: While optimism is good, extreme greed can precede corrections. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on FOMO. Review Your Portfolio: This might be a good time to rebalance. Consider taking some profits, especially from assets that have seen significant gains, to reduce your overall risk exposure. Stick to Your Strategy: If you have a long-term investment plan, don‚Äôt let short-term market euphoria derail it. Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) remains a robust strategy regardless of sentiment. Monitor Key Indicators: Keep an eye not just on the Fear & Greed Index, but also on Bitcoin dominance, market volume, and significant news events that could trigger shifts in sentiment. Educate Yourself: Understand the underlying factors contributing to market movements. Knowledge is your best defense against emotional trading. The crypto market is notoriously cyclical, and understanding sentiment indicators like the Fear & Greed Index can provide an edge. It‚Äôs a tool that helps you gauge when the crowd might be getting too excited or too fearful, allowing you to potentially act contrarian to the masses, a strategy often favored by successful investors. Conclusion: Decoding Market Sentiment for Smarter Crypto Decisions The Crypto Fear & Greed Index , currently at 73 and firmly in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone, offers invaluable insights into the collective psyche of the market. While it reflects a generally optimistic outlook, it also serves as a subtle reminder to approach the market with a balanced perspective. By understanding its components‚Äîfrom market volatility and momentum to social media buzz and Bitcoin dominance ‚Äîinvestors can gain a deeper appreciation of the forces shaping cryptocurrency trends . This index isn‚Äôt a crystal ball, but rather a powerful lens through which to view market psychology, helping you to make more rational, less emotional decisions in the dynamic world of digital assets. Use it as a guide, combine it with your own research, and always prioritize a disciplined approach to your investments.

Companies are announcing multi-million dollar moves one after another, with the latest announcement coming from Mei Pharma. At this point, according to BWEnews, Nasdaq-listed MEI Pharma launched a Litecoin (LTC) treasury strategy worth $100 million. Mei Pharma's $100 million investment in LTC institutional investment suggests growing institutional interest in altcoins beyond Bitcoin. This raises the expectation that more firms will allocate a portion of their treasury reserves to cryptocurrencies and diversify their portfolios. This move by Mei Pharma stands as one of the largest institutional LTC acquisitions to date. This move follows similar treasury diversification moves by companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Sharplink Gaming, but MEI Pharma stands out for its preference for Litecoin over more mainstream institutional options like Bitcoin and Etheruem. Litecoin, which has increased by 10% in the last 24 hours, has increased by 14% in the last week and 28% in the last month. *This is not investment advice.

A market cap at this level would place the crypto sector just behind Nvidia , which recently crossed the $4 trillion milestone and now holds a valuation of $4.2 trillion. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the crypto market has reached a peak of $3.8 trillion, while TradingView lists it slightly higher at $3.9 trillion, both figures exceeding the previous all-time high of $3.73 trillion recorded in December. Meanwhile, other trackers like CoinGecko have already indicated that the market has crossed the $4 trillion threshold, reflecting the sector‚Äôs rapid momentum in the current rally. Bitcoin climbed back above $120,000 on Thursday, marking a minor daily increase. However, Ether and XRP have outpaced Bitcoin in gains following the US House‚Äôs approval of key crypto legislations before its August recess. Ether surpassed $3,600 for the first time since January, bringing its fortnightly gains to 40%. Ripple‚Äôs XRP also soared by nearly 20% in a single day, hitting a year-to-date high of $3.64 during early trading on Friday. Analysts Predict More Crypto Market Upside Market analysts believe that further gains could be on the horizon as institutional confidence strengthens. Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, noted that traders are witnessing digital asset prices surge due to a combination of regulatory clarity and growing institutional support. He expressed optimism that this growth trend will continue as financial institutions compete to integrate crypto assets into their services. Nassar Al Achkar, chief strategy officer at CoinW crypto market exchange, shared a similar view, stating that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have seen renewed interest as traders adopt a risk-on approach in response to positive regulatory signals. Al Achkar highlighted the passing of the GENIUS Act and President Trump‚Äôs proposed plans to open the US retirement market to crypto investments, which could potentially unlock trillions of dollars in institutional capital into the crypto market.

This isn‚Äôt just a fantasy; it‚Äôs the reality of a recent, truly monumental Bitcoin whale transfer that has sent ripples across the entire cryptocurrency landscape. Such a significant move from a long-dormant address immediately sparks curiosity, speculation, and intense on-chain analysis among market participants. What could compel a holder of such immense wealth to finally stir after more than a decade? And what are the broader implications for the future of the crypto market? Understanding the Monumental Bitcoin Whale Transfer The cryptocurrency world was abuzz with activity following reports from Onchain Lens on X, detailing an extraordinary BTC transfer . An address, identified as a long-term dormant Bitcoin whale , which had previously held an astonishing 80,000 BTC, initiated a significant movement of its remaining stash. On July 14, this enigmatic entity first transferred 40,010 BTC, valued at approximately $4.69 billion at the time, to Galaxy Digital . This initial move alone was enough to capture headlines, but it was merely a prelude to an even larger event. Just days later, the same address completed another massive transfer, sending its remaining 40,192 BTC, equivalent to a staggering $4.83 billion, also to Galaxy Digital . This second transfer brought the total moved by this single address to over 80,000 BTC, effectively emptying its wallet after nearly a decade and a half of inactivity. A portion of these newly moved funds has reportedly already been distributed to various exchanges, including prominent platforms like Coinbase Pro, indicating potential liquidity events or strategic positioning. The sheer scale of these transactions underscores their importance, making them one of the largest single whale movements in recent memory. Who is This Dormant Giant? Unraveling On-Chain Clues The identity of this Bitcoin whale remains shrouded in mystery, as is often the case with large cryptocurrency holders. However, the 14-year dormancy period provides crucial clues and raises compelling questions. Addresses that remain untouched for such extended periods are often associated with early adopters, miners, or even individuals who simply forgot about their holdings. The sudden activation of such a significant wallet, especially one holding over 80,000 BTC, immediately triggers deep-dive on-chain analysis . Early Adopter? This whale could be an individual or entity that acquired Bitcoin in its very nascent stages, perhaps when its value was negligible. Mining Pool? Less likely for a single address of this nature, but possible if it was a solo miner from Bitcoin‚Äôs early days. Lost Keys Recovered? While rare for such a large sum, it‚Äôs not impossible that access to the wallet was regained after a long period. Regardless of the precise identity, the movement of such old coins is often interpreted as a signal of either significant profit-taking, strategic re-allocation, or an institutional-level transaction. The public nature of blockchain transactions allows experts to track these movements, even if the owner remains anonymous. This transparency is a double-edged sword: it allows for invaluable market insights through on-chain analysis but also generates intense speculation. Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Role: A Key Player in the Bitcoin Ecosystem The choice of Galaxy Digital as the recipient for such a colossal BTC transfer is highly significant. Founded by renowned investor Mike Novogratz, Galaxy Digital is a prominent financial services and investment management company dedicated to the digital asset, blockchain, and cryptocurrency industries. Unlike typical retail exchanges, Galaxy Digital primarily caters to institutional clients, offering a suite of services including: Trading and Liquidity: Providing over-the-counter (OTC) trading desks for large block trades that wouldn‚Äôt typically be executed on public exchanges to avoid significant price slippage. Asset Management: Managing digital asset funds and investment products. Principal Investments: Investing directly in blockchain companies and technologies. Advisory Services: Offering strategic advice to clients in the crypto space. Mining: Engaging in Bitcoin mining operations. When a Bitcoin whale moves billions in BTC to an entity like Galaxy Digital, it strongly suggests an institutional-grade transaction rather than a simple retail sell-off. This could imply an OTC sale to an institutional buyer, a transfer for secure institutional custody, or even part of a complex rebalancing strategy for a large fund or family office. The involvement of Galaxy Digital often points towards a structured, strategic move rather than a speculative, short-term play. What Does This Mean for the Crypto Market Impact? The movement of nearly $10 billion worth of Bitcoin from a dormant whale naturally raises questions about its potential crypto market impact . Such a massive injection of liquidity or potential selling pressure could significantly influence Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory and broader market sentiment. Let‚Äôs consider the various scenarios: Potential Selling Pressure: If the whale intends to sell a substantial portion of these holdings, moving them to exchanges (even indirectly via Galaxy Digital and then Coinbase Pro) could increase the circulating supply available for trade. This influx could potentially lead to a short-term price dip, especially if market demand doesn‚Äôt absorb the supply efficiently. Institutional Accumulation: Conversely, if Galaxy Digital facilitated an OTC sale to one or more institutional buyers, this would be a highly bullish signal. It indicates strong institutional demand for Bitcoin, absorbing large blocks of BTC without causing public market volatility. This scenario would reflect growing confidence and adoption from traditional finance. Custody and Security: The transfer could simply be for enhanced security and professional custody. Large holders often move assets from self-custody to institutional custodians for better management, insurance, and compliance. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily imply an immediate sale. Market Confidence and Volatility: Regardless of the underlying reason, such a monumental BTC transfer inevitably creates a buzz. It can lead to increased volatility as traders react to the news, attempting to front-run potential price movements. However, if the market interprets the move as institutional accumulation, it could bolster long-term confidence. The fact that a portion has already moved to exchanges like Coinbase Pro suggests some level of market interaction is indeed occurring. Actionable Insights for Bitcoin Investors For both seasoned and novice Bitcoin investors , understanding and reacting to events like this requires a measured approach. While the immediate instinct might be to panic or speculate wildly, a calm and informed perspective is crucial for navigating the evolving crypto market impact . Monitor On-Chain Data Closely: Tools and platforms offering on-chain analysis provide invaluable insights into large wallet movements, exchange flows, and miner activity. Keeping an eye on these metrics can offer early indications of potential market shifts. While not predictive, they add a layer of transparency. Don‚Äôt Overreact to Short-Term Noise: Large whale movements are significant, but they don‚Äôt always dictate the long-term trend. Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamentals, macroeconomic factors, and broader adoption narratives often hold more weight over time. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on single events. Consider the Institutional Angle: The involvement of players like Galaxy Digital often points to institutional strategies. If these transfers represent OTC deals or custody arrangements, they are generally positive for Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term prospects, signaling maturity and mainstream acceptance. Practice Robust Risk Management: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and that you have a clear investment strategy. Volatility is inherent in the crypto market, and events like this underscore the importance of not over-extending yourself. Stay Informed and Skeptical: Always verify information from multiple reputable sources. The crypto space is rife with speculation and misinformation. Rely on data-driven insights rather than unsubstantiated rumors. This Bitcoin whale transfer serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and often opaque nature of the cryptocurrency markets. It highlights the continued importance of institutional players and the fascinating insights that on-chain analysis can provide. The recent movement of nearly $10 billion in Bitcoin from a 14-year dormant address to Galaxy Digital represents one of the most significant BTC transfer events in recent history. While the precise motivations of this mysterious Bitcoin whale remain unknown, the involvement of an institutional heavyweight like Galaxy Digital suggests a sophisticated, strategic play rather than a simple retail liquidation. This event has undoubtedly sparked intense debate and speculation about its immediate and long-term crypto market impact , underscoring the vital role of on-chain analysis in deciphering these complex movements. For investors, it‚Äôs a critical moment to observe, learn, and apply informed strategies rather than succumbing to fear or greed.

He is also expected to call for expanding energy sources for data centers. The U.S. government is scheduled to establish the AI Action Plan in the coming days. Trump is also expected to provide more details on AI policy on July 23 during an event hosted by the tech consortium Hill and Valley Forum and the All-In podcast. Trump wants the U.S. to lead in artificial intelligence The proposal will not focus much on a sweeping vision of the long-term effects of AI, but will be limited to actions of the Executive Office of the President. The policy will be the most significant policy directive in the AI industry, showing the Trump administration‚Äôs efforts to position the U.S. as a global hub for artificial intelligence. Trump revoked some existing AI policies and directives from the Biden era that limited U.S. AI innovation. The Trump administration has revealed plans to reduce regulatory barriers in the AI industry, while promoting AI adoption and innovation in the country. The U.S. Senate removed the AI moratorium provision from Trump‚Äôs Tax Bill earlier this month through a 99-1 vote. The sweeping tax would have restricted states from regulating AI, but the tech industry is focused on reducing such laws nationwide. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy will reportedly lead the plan, which will be deployed in a nationwide promotional campaign. Many believe the proposal would highlight the administration‚Äôs goals of supporting infrastructure by simplifying environmental standards in the National Environmental Policy Act. They also revealed that the President would not include guidance on strengthening power grids in the plan. The proposal would also include security measures to prevent foreign adversaries from accessing the U.S. AI technology by establishing global AI partnerships. It also revealed a collaboration between the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation and the Export-Import Bank to advance Trump‚Äôs export promotion orders to support global U.S. hardware and software deployment. Conservatives have condemned the Export-Import Bank, arguing it‚Äôs a tool to bail out big corporations. Some argued that the senior White House policy adviser AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, and the senior White House policy adviser on AI, Sriram Krishnan, will spearhead a third executive order that calls for all large language models procured by the government not to be biased. The initiative follows Trump‚Äôs directive earlier this year to develop a framework that will enhance global AI dominance in the country. The President also awaits signing a flurry of executive orders to establish some of the policies included in the plan. Trump advances other AI and energy plans The announcement also champions other efforts by industry players to forge international partnerships in pursuit of advancing in the sector. The administration revealed earlier this year a $500 billion investment collaboration by OpenAI and SoftBank to establish more AI infrastructure in the U.S. Many firms condemned what they saw as a limiting approach to AI under President Joe Biden. The President also announced earlier this week in the inaugural Pennsylvania energy and innovation summit plans to invest roughly $70 billion to construct more AI data centers in Pennsylvania. Senator Dave McCormick argued that the proposal would boost the local economy, acknowledging that Trump had kept his promise to serve the people of Pittsburgh.

But so is the threat. Ripple CTO Calls Out Fake XRP Rewards Scam Crypto scams are nothing new, but this one stands out for using AI. A deepfake video has surfaced, falsely showing Garlinghouse announcing a ‚ÄúRipple Rewards Program‚Äù tied to their legal progress against the SEC. In the video, the fake Garlinghouse says: ‚ÄúFour years ago, we entered a battle we didn‚Äôt choose. But we fought and won against the SEC‚Ä¶ Now, it‚Äôs our turn to say thank you. I‚Äôm launching Ripple Rewards Program. 100 million XRP airdrop was created for you.‚Äù David Schwartz quickly responded on X, warning: ‚ÄúObvious scam is obvious.‚Äù AI tools are making crypto scams harder to detect, and more dangerous than ever. XRP‚Äôs Price Jump Creates a Perfect Setup for Scams XRP‚Äôs recent rally has made it a hot topic. With its price jumping to $3.43 and sentiment rising ahead of a possible Ripple vs SEC settlement, the buzz is loud and scammers are using it to their advantage. Crypto analyst Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, says XRP could be gearing up for a bull run. That‚Äôs the kind of news fraudsters look for. They know investors are watching closely, and use fake airdrop promises to trick them into clicking on phishing links or connecting to shady wallets. These scams often lead to major losses for unsuspecting victims. A Pattern of Scams Tied to Ripple‚Äôs Legal Wins Scammers have previously taken advantage of Ripple‚Äôs legal triumphs . In August 2024, Ripple achieved a significant win as Judge Analisa Torres imposed a $125 million fine, which is less than the SEC‚Äôs $2 billion request. The victory paved the way for a surge of fake XRP airdrops and promotions. Ripple issued a statement, cautioning, ‚ÄúWith Wednesday‚Äôs historic victory, we‚Äôve seen an uptick in scams. Please beware of scam ‚ÄòRipple‚Äô accounts, fake executive accounts, or others promoting ‚ÄòXRP Giveaways‚Äô or ‚ÄòXRP Airdrops.‚Äô‚Äù Similarly, after a ruling that XRP is not a security, scammers flooded the space with fake offers. David Schwartz noted, ‚Äú There are no airdrops, giveaways, or special offers associated with this ruling .‚Äù What XRP Investors Need to Know As deepfake technology becomes more advanced, it‚Äôs harder to tell what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs not. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs more important than ever for the XRP community to be cautious. If you see a giveaway or airdrop being promoted, don‚Äôt click anything unless it‚Äôs from Ripple‚Äôs official sources. Never send funds or personal info to unknown links. Ripple will never ask you to. The price action might be exciting, but protecting your crypto should always come first.",News,EN,0,0,XRP|REGULATION|TRADING|AIRDROP|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-18 09:59:54

The breakout unfolded while Bitcoin continues to consolidate just north of the $120 000 pivot, a level that many market technicians view as decisive for the entire altcoin complex. Technical strategist Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) published a daily DOGE/USD chart via X. In it, Dogecoin‚Äôs price action is framed by a multi-month falling-trend line whose boundary was first breached in November last year. Since that escape, price has returned to the diagonal three separate times‚Äîeach touch ringed by Kevin in orange, signalling what he describes as ‚Äútextbook post-breakout behaviour.‚Äù Related Reading: This Fibonacci Level Puts The Dogecoin Price Above $10 This Cycle ‚ÄúOnly a matter of time before #Dogecoin makes its move back up to the .28-.30 level and then well beyond,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúAs long as BTC holds up and keeps showing strength this should come sooner rather than later.‚Äù Dogecoin Price Targets Kevin‚Äôs roadmap is built around a dense cluster of Fibonacci retracements that dominate the right margin of his chart. Immediate resistance lies at the 0.618 and 0.65 retracement bands‚Äîapproximately $0.261 and $0.285, respectively‚Äîfollowed by 0.703 at $0.329 and the 0.786 level at $0.413. Lower down, the 0.5 retracement at $0.190 has acted as a floor throughout July, while 0.382 at $0.138 marks the last line of defence for medium-term bulls. Beyond the classical retracement grid, Kevin projects an aggressive trio of Fibonacci extension lines‚Äî1.618 ($3.97), 1.65 ($4.33) and 1.703 ($5.00)‚Äîarguing that Dogecoin‚Äôs ‚Äúthin-air zone‚Äù above last cycle‚Äôs peak could enable a parabolic overshoot if liquidity conditions mirror those of 2021. He stresses, however, that such targets ‚Äúremain contingent on Bitcoin punching through $120,000-$123,000 and, ideally, sprinting toward $140,000-$150,000 where overhead supply thins out dramatically.‚Äù ‚ÄúPeople are already forgetting that #BTC drives this market and if BTC goes down it will all go down. ‚Ä¶ BTC needs to break $123,274‚Äîpoint-blank period. I don‚Äôt like the moseying around at this level for too long.‚Äù Related Reading: Dogecoin Poised For A Monster Rally Amid Brewing Altcoin Season For now, Bitcoin‚Äôs sideways grind below its all-time high has tempered altcoin exuberance. The macro picture is complicated by the fact that, as Kevin notes, ‚ÄúBTC, Total 2, ETH, and many other Alts are at major resistance levels‚Äîso do not try and be a hero here. If you missed the lows, that‚Äôs unfortunate, but do not FOMO at major resistance.‚Äù Should Bitcoin deliver the breakout the analyst community is looking for, the DOGE/BTC pair could accelerate sharply, validating Kevin‚Äôs view that the memecoin is ‚Äúplaying catch-up‚Äù and may be poised for an outsized percentage move once the broader market trend resumes. With Dogecoin now perched on the lip of its 0.618‚Äì0.65 resistance shelf, traders are watching for a daily close above $0.285 to confirm the next leg higher. Failure to hold the wedge top near $0.19 would, by contrast, postpone the bullish narrative and leave the post-breakout retest zone vulnerable. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.242.

With the crypto market's fluctuations, certain meme-based digital currencies show promising signs. Delve into this article to learn which coins could deliver serious returns, backed by unexpected market optimism. Find out which tokens stand out and may offer significant profits in the near future. Dogecoin Price Update: Short-Term Strength vs Long-Term Weakness DOGE experienced a robust 17.02% gain over the past week and a 12.64% rise over the last month. The 6-month performance showed a significant downturn of 47.15%, reflecting mixed market sentiment. Rapid upward movements contrasted with extended pressure over half a year. Recent numerical changes reveal quick bursts of buying and underline lingering long-term challenges. Currently, Dogecoin trades between $0.14 and $0.20. The nearest resistance stands at $0.23 while support is observed at $0.11. Additionally, a secondary resistance at $0.30 and a lower support at $0.05 provide further boundaries for price movement. The Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator suggest short-term momentum is present. The Relative Strength Index at 63.21 indicates slightly overbought conditions. Traders might consider making short-term entry plays around the $0.11 support level, targeting profits near the $0.23 resistance. Monitoring movements around the secondary resistance at $0.30 could provide additional signals. Turbo Altcoin: Surging Weekly Gains Amid Extended Trends Turbo experienced a notable 63.72% increase over the past month, along with a 57.40% jump in the last week, while facing a 23.75% decline over the previous six months. The price has shown explosive short-term gains followed by corrections, indicating high volatility in its behavior. The recent fluctuations suggest that although short-term rallies can spark trader interest, longer-term trends necessitate caution and a well-defined strategy for sustained trading. Turbo is currently trading within a range of $0.00283 to $0.00459, with resistance at $0.00551 and support at $0.00198. Secondary resistance is at $0.00727, and secondary support is near $0.00022. The Awesome Oscillator is at 0.00128, while the Momentum Indicator registers at 0.00207. An RSI of 73.30 indicates a strong short-term rally nearing overbought territory. Bulls are active in the lower part of the range, but caution is needed as resistance levels approach. Entries near support with stop losses are advisable, along with targeting short-term profits at resistance levels. Pepe Crypto: Price Trends and Tactical Levels Last month, Pepe experienced a noticeable upward price movement with a 15.69% gain, following an impressive weekly surge of 25.97%. Over the past six months, the coin faced a 29.24% decline, marking some volatility in its longer-term performance. Price fluctuations were significant, with the coin trading between $0.0000075 and $0.0000128 during the most recent period. This range reflects a mix of positive momentum in the short run and caution stemming from earlier downward pressure. The data underlines a shift in market sentiment over the short and medium terms. Current movement centers around key technical levels. The nearest resistance is at $0.0000158 and the next at $0.0000211, while support is around $0.0000052. Despite recent highs within a confined range, the Relative Strength Index reading of 67.09 indicates a lean towards the upper end of typical trading conditions. Bulls are pushing prices higher, yet caution remains due to mixed signals. Traders might consider testing the lower resistance for a breakout or seek buying opportunities near support. Market participants can focus on price action as the coin looks to establish a more defined trend. Conclusion DOGE , TURBO , and PEPE show strong potential for serious returns this quarter. DOGE benefits from high visibility and strong community support. TURBO has gained attention with recent innovative updates. PEPE's growing popularity adds to its appeal. These factors make them noteworthy candidates for significant gains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

A significant new chapter has just unfolded in a high-profile case involving the WEMIX token and its former steward. South Korean prosecutors have launched a crucial appeal against the acquittal of Henry Chang, the former CEO of gaming giant Wemade and current head of blockchain firm NEXUS. This development reignites scrutiny over alleged manipulation of the WEMIX token‚Äôs circulation volume, sending ripples through the Korean crypto landscape. What Sparked the WEMIX Token Controversy? At the heart of this legal saga is a 2022 statement made by Henry Chang, then CEO of Wemade. Prosecutors contend that Chang‚Äôs announcement regarding the suspension of WEMIX token liquidation misled investors. This claim suggests that the statement encouraged individuals to purchase the cryptocurrency, potentially leading to financial gains for Wemade through a rise in its stock price and stabilization of the WEMIX token‚Äôs market value. The initial charges focused on whether this statement constituted a deliberate act to manipulate the market, creating an artificial demand for the token. The difficulty for the prosecution has been quantifying these alleged gains and definitively proving direct causation between Chang‚Äôs statement and investor behavior, particularly given the volatile nature of cryptocurrency markets. Why Was Henry Chang Acquitted, and Why the Appeal? In a surprising turn for many observers, the Seoul Southern District Court cleared Henry Chang of the charges in the first trial. While the exact reasoning for the acquittal has not been fully disclosed, such decisions often hinge on the prosecution‚Äôs inability to provide irrefutable evidence of intent or a direct, quantifiable link between the alleged manipulation and specific investor losses. The defense likely argued that market fluctuations are complex and influenced by numerous factors beyond a single company‚Äôs statements. However, the Seoul Southern District Prosecutors‚Äô Office was not deterred. On July 17, they filed an appeal with the Seoul Southern District Court, signaling their firm belief that an injustice occurred or that critical evidence was not fully considered. Their appeal underscores the ongoing challenges legal systems face in prosecuting cases within the nascent and often opaque cryptocurrency industry. They are likely seeking a re-evaluation of the evidence, particularly focusing on the perceived misleading nature of the statement and its indirect but significant impact on market perception and Wemade‚Äôs financial standing. What Does This Mean for Korean Crypto Regulation? This renewed Wemade legal battle has significant implications for the broader framework of crypto regulation in South Korea. The nation has been proactive in establishing a regulatory environment for digital assets, aiming to protect investors while fostering innovation. Cases like WEMIX serve as litmus tests for these regulations, highlighting areas where clarity is still needed or where existing laws need to be adapted for the unique characteristics of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. Increased Scrutiny on Disclosures: The case emphasizes the critical importance of transparent and accurate disclosures from crypto projects and their executives regarding tokenomics, circulation, and treasury management. Precedent Setting: The final outcome of this appeal could set a significant precedent for how ‚Äòmarket manipulation‚Äô is defined and prosecuted in the context of digital assets, particularly concerning statements made by project founders or companies. Investor Protection Focus: It reinforces South Korea‚Äôs commitment to investor protection, indicating that authorities are willing to pursue legal action against alleged misconduct, even when direct financial losses are hard to quantify. The outcome will undoubtedly influence future legislative efforts and enforcement actions, shaping how crypto businesses operate within the country. Navigating the Wemade Legal Battle and Market Implications For Wemade, the appeal means continued legal uncertainty. While Henry Chang is no longer CEO, the company‚Äôs reputation and the perception of the WEMIX token remain closely tied to the outcome of this case. A successful appeal by the prosecution could lead to a re-trial or a reversal of the acquittal, potentially impacting investor confidence in both Wemade and the WEMIX ecosystem. From a market perspective, ongoing legal battles can introduce volatility. Investors often react to news of regulatory actions or legal proceedings, leading to price fluctuations for the affected assets. The WEMIX token, having already experienced significant price movements in the past, will likely remain under close observation as the appeal progresses. For other crypto projects, the lesson is clear: transparency and cautious communication are paramount. Companies must ensure their public statements are verifiable and do not inadvertently create misleading impressions, especially concerning token supply, distribution, and liquidation plans. What This Means for Future Crypto Transparency The WEMIX case, regardless of its final verdict, serves as a powerful reminder of the growing demand for accountability and transparency in the cryptocurrency space. As regulators worldwide grapple with how to govern decentralized finance, the emphasis on clear communication from project teams will only intensify. For investors, this case underscores the importance of conducting thorough due diligence. Relying solely on company announcements, especially those regarding tokenomics, can be risky. Cross-referencing information, understanding the project‚Äôs fundamentals, and being aware of the regulatory landscape are crucial steps. Ultimately, the appeal against Henry Chang ‚Äòs acquittal is more than just a legal dispute; it‚Äôs a critical moment for the entire Korean crypto industry.

48467936,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74670,1752832843,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) Set to Expand Shibarium With AI Features, Meanwhile, This Token Prepares to Jump 20% to $0.035",https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-set-to-expand-shibarium-with-ai-features-meanwhile/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB) is once again making waves, this time by teasing the addition of AI-powered features to its Shibarium ecosystem. While this announcement has reignited short-term hype among meme coin enthusiasts, more experienced investors are shifting their attention toward projects that deliver not just buzz‚Äîbut lasting financial utility. That shift is becoming evident in the rising traction of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi platform designed to offer passive yield, stable returns, and real use cases built around lending, borrowing, and protocol-generated income. Now priced at $0.03 in Phase 5, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is seeing its presale sell out rapidly, with 78% of the current phase already sold, over 13,500 token holders, and $12.5 million raised. As soon as Phase 6 kicks off, the price will climb by 20% to $0.035, closing the window on what investors are calling one of the few high-conviction entries of 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is building tools that allow crypto users to put their digital assets to work. One of the core innovations in this system is the mtToken‚Äîa passive yield-generating asset issued to users who deposit tokens like USDT, DAI, ETH, or AVAX into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs lending pools. These mtTokens are not just receipts. They accrue value automatically over time and can be staked in special smart contracts to earn a share of the protocol‚Äôs revenue, creating a second layer of returns on top of the lending APY. For example, a user who deposits stablecoins into a pool receives mtDAI or mtUSDT, which grow in value based on interest earned from lending activity. That same user can stake these mtTokens in a rewards module and receive dividends, powered by buybacks funded from platform revenue. This dual-reward mechanism makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs structure fundamentally different from meme tokens that rely solely on community-driven speculation. A Stablecoin With a Backbone What sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) further apart is its upcoming decentralized stablecoin‚Äîan overcollateralized digital asset designed to maintain a consistent $1 value. Unlike failed algorithmic models, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs stablecoin will only be minted when users borrow against blue-chip collateral such as ETH, DAI, AVAX, or mtTokens. Each unit will be backed by more value than it represents, with strict issuance caps enforced through protocol-approved issuers. The interest rate on borrowing this stablecoin will be governed by Mutuum Finance (MUTM) governance and adjusted to help maintain the $1 peg. If the price moves above $1, interest rates will be lowered to encourage borrowing. If it drops below, rates will rise to tighten supply and stimulate arbitrage. All loans will remain overcollateralized, with automatic liquidation triggers in place to preserve the protocol‚Äôs solvency and stability. This stablecoin is expected to serve not just as a borrowing tool, but as a key component of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs internal liquidity engine‚Äîstrengthening its treasury and supporting long-term sustainability within the platform‚Äôs lending infrastructure. From Meme Waves to Yield-Powered Utility Investors are already reacting. A large whale wallet moved $200,000 out of SHIB and AVAX holdings into Phase 2 of MUTM, acquiring tokens at just $0.015. Today, that position has already doubled in value, sitting at $0.03, and is projected to be worth at least $0.35 post-launch‚Äîan expected return of over 11x. With the public listing planned at $0.06 and price targets from analysts calling for values well into the $0.30+ range, the upside appears aligned with the platform‚Äôs growing adoption. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not only building smarter tools for asset management but also laying down a detailed roadmap. The team has already completed most of Phase 1, including audits, listings, and an AI helpdesk. Phases 2 through 4 include Layer-2 integration, stablecoin testnet, beta launch, and the final release of the live Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol. Additionally, the platform has been audited by CertiK, achieving a Token Score of 95 and a Skynet Score of 77.5, reinforcing confidence from a technical security standpoint. To sweeten early engagement, a $100,000 giveaway is in progress, alongside a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with structured rewards for critical, major, minor, and low-severity findings. With this multi-layered buildout and a strong tokenomics framework backed by real use, the project has positioned itself far beyond short-lived meme trends. As SHIB attempts to reinvent itself through AI integrations, smart capital is flowing into Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äîa platform delivering real results, layered income, and a future-ready stablecoin model. With only 22% of Phase 5 tokens remaining and a 20% price increase looming, time is running out to secure the final sub-$0.035 entries.

Ali Martinez (@ali_charts), a widely followed analyst, recently posted a chart highlighting a significant development where the MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) ratio for XRP has just crossed above its 200-day moving average. This crossover, known as a golden cross , previously led to a substantial price move in late 2024. According to Martinez, ‚Äúthe last time the MVRV ratio flashed a golden cross, XRP soared 630%.‚Äù The last time the MVRV ratio flashed a golden cross, $XRP soared 630%. That signal just appeared again. pic.twitter.com/hatA0Jfvt2 ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) July 17, 2025 The historical breakout, as seen on the chart, coincided with a rapid price increase from around $0.55 in November to $3.39 in early January. With the same MVRV signal appearing again, speculation has intensified about the possibility of a similar rally. If XRP were to repeat the 630% gain from its current level, the price could climb toward $23.65 in the weeks ahead. MVRV Ratio and Market Psychology The MVRV ratio is often used to assess the profitability of holders and identify potential reversal points. When this ratio moves above its long-term moving average, it may signal a transition from undervaluation to overvaluation, especially in markets driven by strong sentiment. The chart posted by Martinez shows that the MVRV ratio has just broken above the 200-day moving average. While this does not guarantee a repeat of that performance, the technical setup is compelling. The previous golden cross marked the beginning of a steep ascent, and many traders now see this crossover as a potential early indicator of a new bullish phase for XRP. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Is XRP About to Go On a Historic Rally? The timing of this crossover is particularly notable. XRP has already shown signs of renewed momentum, breaking above key resistance levels over the past few days, and experts believe it has entered an ultra-bullish region . This recent breakout aligns with increased volume, bullish sentiment, and the broader rally in altcoins. The combination of a rising MVRV ratio and strong price action suggests there may be further upside ahead. XRP may be on the verge of a historic move, and if it hits $23.65, many XRP holders will be rich enough to retire .

One of the most powerful and legally savvy strategies they use is known as Buy, Borrow, Die . This approach helps the ultra-rich accumulate wealth, access liquidity, and legally avoid capital gains taxes ‚Äîoften permanently. Here‚Äôs how this strategy works, why it‚Äôs popular, and what it might mean for crypto holders like you. üõí Step 1: Buy (or HODL) Appreciating Assets The journey starts with buying assets that grow in value over time . This could include: Stocks (e.g. Apple, Tesla) Real estate Business shares And yes‚Äî crypto assets like BTC, ETH, or SOL When these assets appreciate, the gains are unrealized ‚Äîmeaning you don‚Äôt pay capital gains tax until you sell . So if you buy 10 BTC at $10K and it grows to $60K, that‚Äôs a $500K gain... but no taxes are due as long as you don‚Äôt sell. üí≥ Step 2: Borrow (Don‚Äôt Sell) Rather than cashing out and triggering a taxable event, the wealthy simply borrow against their assets . For example: They take out loans using their stocks or real estate as collateral. In crypto, this could mean using platforms like Aave, Maker, or centralized services offering crypto-backed loans . These loans aren‚Äôt considered income , so no taxes apply . This borrowed money can be used to: Fund a luxury lifestyle Reinvest in more assets Cover living expenses Key advantage : You maintain ownership of the asset, it continues to grow in value, and you defer taxes indefinitely . ‚ö∞ Step 3: Die (Yes, Really) Here's where the magic happens. When someone dies, their assets usually receive a ""step-up in basis"" under U.S. tax law: The cost basis (the original purchase price) is reset to the current market value. If your heirs sell the asset right after your death, they owe zero capital gains tax . So if you held BTC that went from $10K to $100K and passed it on‚Äîyour heirs' new cost basis is $100K. No tax is due if they sell at that price. Translation : The capital gains tax you avoided during life is permanently erased upon death . üîÅ The Cycle: Repeat, Grow, Escape Wealthy families use this strategy for generations: Buy appreciating assets (crypto, real estate, stocks) Borrow instead of selling to avoid taxes Die , leaving tax-free wealth to heirs This allows wealth to compound tax-free , with minimal government interference. üß® Can Crypto Users Use This? Yes‚Äîbut with caution: Crypto lending platforms allow you to borrow against assets without selling. Be aware of liquidation risks (crypto is volatile). This strategy assumes long-term bullishness on your assets. Be ready for changing tax laws ‚Äîthis loophole is under political scrutiny. üßæ Why Governments Are Watching Critics argue Buy, Borrow, Die favors the ultra-wealthy , widening the wealth gap. Governments are eyeing ways to: Tax unrealized gains Remove the step-up in basis Close loopholes around wealth transfers Crypto holders could eventually see similar scrutiny, especially as DeFi lending and self-custody blur the lines of regulation . üß† Final Thoughts The Buy, Borrow, Die strategy is a masterclass in long-term wealth planning , taking full advantage of current tax laws. Whether you‚Äôre holding stocks or stacking sats, understanding this strategy can inspire you to think bigger about: Asset appreciation Leveraging rather than liquidating Generational planning While it may seem like a trick reserved for billionaires, crypto gives everyone a unique opportunity to be their own bank ‚Äîand maybe, just maybe, play the same wealth game.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|BUSINESS|BTC|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-07-18 10:07:35

Walton estimated the company will report a $14 billion profit in Q2, translating to roughly $11 billion in net profit over the past 12 months.

This move, recommending mediation in an administrative lawsuit between Dunamu and the National Tax Service, marks a potential shift from protracted legal battles to more pragmatic, negotiated settlements. What does this mean for the future of crypto taxation and regulation in one of Asia‚Äôs most dynamic digital asset markets? What‚Äôs at Stake for Upbit and Dunamu in This Tax Dispute? The dispute centers around a hefty 2.6 billion won (approximately $1.87 million) tax assessment. For Dunamu, the parent company behind the powerhouse Upbit exchange, this isn‚Äôt just about the money; it‚Äôs about setting a precedent. As a major player in the global crypto landscape, the resolution of this case could influence how future tax liabilities are calculated and enforced for other digital asset businesses in South Korea. The administrative lawsuit underscores the ongoing complexities faced by companies operating in a relatively new and rapidly evolving sector like cryptocurrency. The case highlights several critical aspects: Financial Implications: The 2.6 billion won is a substantial sum, impacting Dunamu‚Äôs financials. Regulatory Clarity: The outcome could provide much-needed clarity on specific tax interpretations for crypto exchanges. Industry Precedent: A negotiated settlement or a court ruling will inevitably set a benchmark for similar cases involving other exchanges or crypto businesses. Why is the Seoul High Court Pushing for Mediation? The Seoul High Court ‚Äòs recommendation for mediation is a telling sign of its approach to complex financial disputes, particularly those involving novel asset classes like cryptocurrencies. Rather than proceeding directly to a formal ruling, the court indicated it would set a later hearing date and present a mediation proposal. This strategic move suggests a preference for efficient resolution outside of a potentially lengthy and resource-intensive litigation process. One key reason cited by the court was that a related case involving similar legal issues had already been resolved. This indicates a recognition that: Precedent Exists: There‚Äôs a framework or understanding from a previous resolution that could guide this case. Efficiency: Mediation can be significantly faster and less costly than a full-blown trial. Flexibility: Negotiated settlements often allow for more creative and mutually beneficial outcomes than strict court rulings. This approach from the Seoul High Court demonstrates a pragmatic desire to manage the burgeoning number of crypto-related legal challenges in a way that is both fair and expeditious for all parties involved. Understanding the Broader Implications of This Crypto Tax Dispute The crypto tax dispute involving Dunamu and Upbit is not an isolated incident but rather a microcosm of the global challenges governments face in taxing digital assets. South Korea, a nation at the forefront of blockchain innovation and adoption, has been actively working to establish clear regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. However, defining what constitutes taxable income, how to value volatile assets, and when tax events occur remains a complex puzzle. Key challenges in crypto taxation include: Asset Classification: Are cryptocurrencies commodities, currencies, or securities? This impacts how they are taxed. Valuation: The extreme volatility of crypto assets makes precise valuation for tax purposes difficult. Cross-border Transactions: The global nature of crypto transactions complicates jurisdiction and enforcement. Defining Taxable Events: When does a crypto transaction trigger a tax liability? Is it only on conversion to fiat, or also on crypto-to-crypto trades? This particular crypto tax dispute could set a significant precedent for how the National Tax Service approaches future assessments, potentially leading to clearer guidelines for the entire industry. It highlights the ongoing tension between regulatory bodies seeking to ensure compliance and industry players navigating nascent and often ambiguous legal landscapes. Dunamu ‚Äòs Stance and the Potential Outcomes of Mediation For Dunamu , the operator of Upbit, entering mediation could be a strategic move. While the specifics of their legal arguments against the tax assessment are not publicly detailed, the very act of engaging in mediation suggests a willingness to find common ground. Mediation offers several advantages over traditional litigation: Benefits for Dunamu: Confidentiality: Mediation proceedings are typically confidential, allowing both parties to discuss sensitive financial information without public scrutiny. Cost and Time Savings: Avoiding a full trial can save millions in legal fees and years in court proceedings. Control Over Outcome: Unlike a court ruling, mediation allows both parties to actively shape the resolution, leading to a more satisfactory outcome for all. Preservation of Relationships: A negotiated settlement can be less adversarial, potentially preserving a more cooperative relationship with regulatory bodies in the long run. The outcome of this mediation could range from a full dismissal of the tax claim, a reduced tax liability, or a structured payment plan. Regardless of the specifics, a successful mediation would represent a pragmatic resolution that allows Dunamu to focus on its core business operations rather than prolonged legal battles. Is Mediation the Future for Crypto Legal Battles? The emphasis on mediation in this high-profile case raises an important question: Is alternative dispute resolution (ADR) the way forward for the increasingly complex legal challenges in the crypto space? Given the technical nature, rapid evolution, and often ambiguous legal status of cryptocurrencies, traditional litigation can be slow, expensive, and ill-equipped to handle the nuances of digital assets. Mediation offers a flexible framework that can: Accommodate Technical Expertise: Mediators can bring in or be themselves experts in blockchain technology and crypto markets, leading to more informed discussions. Foster Innovation: By providing a less adversarial environment, mediation can encourage solutions that support innovation while ensuring regulatory compliance. Reduce Uncertainty: A quicker resolution through mediation can reduce the period of uncertainty that can negatively impact business operations and market sentiment. This case could serve as a blueprint for how other jurisdictions and companies approach similar disputes. As crypto regulations continue to evolve globally, the ability to resolve disagreements efficiently and constructively will be paramount for the industry‚Äôs sustainable growth. Conclusion: A Path Towards Clarity and Resolution The Seoul High Court‚Äôs recommendation for mediation in the Upbit operator Dunamu‚Äôs tax dispute is a significant and positive development. It signals a pragmatic approach to resolving complex financial and regulatory issues within the cryptocurrency sector. For Dunamu, it offers a pathway to potentially mitigate a substantial tax burden and gain clearer operational guidelines. For the broader South Korean crypto industry, it could set a valuable precedent for how future tax disputes are handled, leaning towards negotiation rather than prolonged litigation. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, such collaborative approaches between regulatory bodies and industry players will be crucial.

Last week, Washington buzzed with rumors that Miller was pulling away from Musk after his public spat with Trump. Rumors pointed out to her refreshed social media profile and Musk unfollowing her on X as signs they‚Äôd split. In her interview with Reuters, Miller put it simply said ‚ÄúMy paycheck still comes from him.‚Äù Despite Musk‚Äôs departure from the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at the end of May, and her own exit from the government, Miller continues working for Musk. Late Wednesday, in what appeared to be her first Musk‚Äërelated public comment in about two weeks, she issued a statement on behalf of xAI condemning recent environmental protests at one of its sites in Tennessee. What exactly is Katie Miller‚Äôs role inside Musk‚Äôs network? Katie Miller wouldn‚Äôt elaborate on her specific responsibilities or confirm whether she serves as a spokesperson for Tesla, SpaceX or Musk‚Äôs AI venture, xAI. Under Trump, Katie Miller joined Musk‚Äôs short‚Äëlived Department of Government Efficiency, designed to streamline federal bureaucracy. Soon after, Musk and Trump clashed over federal spending, igniting their own public feud. More than a month ago, Miller exited DOGE to move into Musk‚Äôs circle according to a report by CNN . Reports indicate she became a communications consultant across his businesses, though her exact duties remain hidden. In recent days she overhauled her X profile, removing a SpaceX rocket banner in favor of snapshots from workouts, beach outings and family time, leading some to read it as a sign she was stepping back from Musk. Musk, for his part, unfollowed her on X. He had also dropped Stephen Miller weeks earlier, though he later followed him again. According to three Republican sources, this fueled suspicions that Katie Miller had quietly ceased working with Musk amid his split with Trump. Miller did not address follow‚Äëup questions about her profile revamp or Musk‚Äôs unfollow. Colleagues called her a Trump loyalist and were surprised she stayed with Musk while he tried to oppose policies her husband supported, like the Big Beautiful Bill. Miller‚Äôs ties to Trump administration run deep Katie Miller‚Äôs Washington career dates back to her University of Florida graduation and a master‚Äôs in public administration from GWU before joining the Trump team. She and her husband, senior adviser Stephen‚ÄØMiller, widely acknowledged as the architect of the administration‚Äôs hard‚Äëline immigration measures, both held posts in the 2017‚Äì2021 Trump White House. She began as a special assistant to President Trump, then served as press secretary for Vice President Pence, and later as a DHS spokeswoman under Kirstjen Nielsen, when the agency enforced the ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù policy separating over 5,000 children from their parents. Stephen Miller was one of the driving forces behind that measure and advocated for even tougher actions affecting tens of thousands more families. Introduced by mutual friends in 2018, Katie and Stephen were married in 2020 at the Trump Hotel in D.C., in a ceremony officiated by a senior aide to Ambassador David‚ÄØFriedman. Last December, Trump selected Miller as one of his inaugural DOGE advisory board members, granting her ‚Äúspecial government employee‚Äù status.

In a period of renewed market optimism and significant capital rotation, HTX‚Äôs latest listings have once again showcased substantial wealth-generating potential. This solidifies the platform‚Äôs reputation as a go-to destination for investors looking to capitalize on emerging market trends. Between July 7 and 14, new listings across the Meme, NFT, and Infrastructure sectors achieved impressive gains. These remarkable results highlight HTX‚Äôs strategic ability to identify and list high-potential assets, providing significant wealth creation opportunities for its global user base. Meme Coin Resurgence Led by M and MOG The resurgence of meme coins saw two prominent assets deliver significant returns: ‚óè Memecore ($M) surged an astounding 482% in just days, firmly topping the gainers‚Äô list. Positioned as the first Layer 1 blockchain designed for the Meme 2.0 era, $M is set to become an engine driving meme culture, value creation, and community collaboration. ‚óè MOG Coin ($MOG), another prominent meme coin, recorded a remarkable 112% increase. This Ethereum-based asset has recently garnered significant attention and discussion across social platforms. The surge in meme coin assets reaffirms the market logic that ‚Äúemotion is value‚Äù. As one of the first platforms to list these tokens, HTX has effectively transformed community sentiment into trading activity, delivering tangible returns for users. Infrastructure and Cross-Chain Narratives Regain Momentum with Strong Performances from OMNI and TANSSI Technologically driven assets also performed well this week. ‚óè Omni Network ($OMNI) jumped 260%, driven by renewed interest in inter-chain interoperability. As an Ethereum-native interoperability protocol, Omni Network enables low-latency communication across all Ethereum rollups and offers a secure, high-performance, and globally compatible architecture ‚Äî positioning Ethereum as a single, unified operating system for both users and developers. ‚óè Tanssi Network ($TANSSI) climbed the ranks with an 82% increase.

HTX‚Äôs early identification of the infrastructure trend empowered previously overlooked assets to gain significant momentum on the platform, showcasing the precision of its listing strategy. $PENGU Surges on Enterprise NFT Buzz, NFT Sector Stages Strong Comeback Recently, the rise of the ‚Äúenterprise NFT‚Äù narrative has sparked growing interest, with both established brands and new IPs leveraging NFTs to broaden community engagement. As a result, NFT assets are experiencing a resurgence, demonstrating strong wealth potential in this new context. ‚óè Pudgy Penguins ($ PENGU ) witnessed an impressive 89% surge in a short period. This collection of 8,888 NFTs drives Web3 innovation through IP licensing and community-driven empowerment. Each holder gets exclusive access to experiences, events, IP licensing opportunities, and more. $PENGU has distinguished itself as one of the few NFT projects to achieve both substantial traffic and high trading volume. Popular Assets Rally as XLM and KNC Maintain Resilience Beyond the newly listed assets, established popular assets also saw significant movement: ‚óè XLM (Stellar) rose 88%, benefiting from heightened payment activity and growing stablecoin clearing needs. As an open payment network, Stellar bridges diverse financial systems, empowering anyone to create low-cost financial services for their communities. This interconnectedness enhances individual access, reduces banking costs, and boosts business revenue. ‚óè Kyber Network ($KNC) recorded a 65% gain, emerging as a standout in the DEX sector.

However, before this next rocketship takes off, there could be more sideways price action. Investors will probably need to remain patient. Crypto bills passed up to the Senate The crypto story continues to gain momentum in the US as three landmark bills gained approval in the House this week. The GENIUS Act , CLARITY Act , and CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act were all passed on to the Senate for consideration. If these bills do make it into law this will firm up the case for crypto in the most powerful country in the world - quite a rapid turnaround from the bleak and unyielding anti-crypto stance presented by the Biden administration. While the CLARITY Act will help to provide consumer protection and clear regulatory guidelines for businesses, and the GENIUS Act will promote the setting up of regulation for stablecoins, arguably the most impactful bill is the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Anti-CBDC Act the most important CBCD‚Äôs (Central Bank Digital Currencies) have generally been kept on the down-low in mainstream media for quite some time, and it‚Äôs only in recent times that the likes of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and others, have felt emboldened enough to announce the future implementation of CBDCs. This programmable digital currency would allow central banks to wield far more power over citizens than they already have, allowing them to manipulate, confiscate, and sanction bank accounts at will. $BTC retests support Source: TradingView Meanwhile, Bitcoin continues on into the latter stages of its bull market. As can be seen in the short-term time frame, the price broke out of the relatively short downtrend but the bulls were unable to maintain momentum and the price is falling back down. The trendline is about to be tested again, and possibly the horizontal support at $118,000. If this gives way and the bears are able to confirm the breakdown, $117,000 down to $116,000 would be a possible net waiting to catch the price. Falling below that would mean a collapse back down to $112,000. That said, as things stand, this looks as though it may just be a retest of support. As has been the case for quite some time now, the trend is up, and if in doubt, go with that trend. $BTC volatility increase Source: TradingView The daily chart shows a lot of volatility since $BTC crossed above $118,000. The candle wicks to the up and to the downside are evidence of the struggle going on among the bulls and the bears. This support level is continuing to hold, but as already mentioned, a collapse, or even just a wick back down to $112,000 could still be on the cards. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) which signals overbought and oversold conditions, is key to further price appreciation. The indicator has already been well into the overbought zone, but it still did not get above the last peak at 78.29. The indicator will probably need to bounce off of the yellow moving average and head higher to take out that last peak, if this doesn‚Äôt happen, bearish divergence is still in play. Weekly Stochastic RSI indicators approach a top again Source: TradingView The weekly time frame reveals that generally all is well with the Bitcoin bull market. That said, the Stochastic RSI indicator lines are approaching the top again. There could be two or three weeks left in them yet, and there‚Äôs always the chance that they could move along the top for quite some time. However, when they get this high it is best to keep an eye open for any other potential topping signals. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

At a meeting of the Money Marketeers of New York University, he remarked , ‚ÄúI believe it makes sense to cut the FOMC‚Äôs policy rate by 25 basis points two weeks from now.‚Äù Waller believes tariff-induced inflation is only temporary According to Waller, the economic and labor market data show that the economy is still growing, though more slowly. He argued, however, that unemployment risks have risen, warranting a rate reduction. The Fed Reserve Governor believes a weaker job market is ‚Äúgreater and sufficient‚Äù to cut interest rates, adding that policymakers should not wait for a deeper decline in the labor market. He added that they can choose to disregard the short-term impact of tariffs and instead prioritize broader economic concerns. In his view, more attention should be directed toward underlying inflation, which is dangerously close to the Fed‚Äôs 2% goal, rather than temporary tariff-related price pressures. Even before Thursday, Waller had previously insisted that tariff effects would only be temporary. The Feds are set to meet from July 29 to July 30 in Washington to discuss policies and possible rate cuts. So far, among Fed officials, Waller and Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman are the only two to express a willingness to consider rate reductions as early as this month. Other officials like Governor Adriana Kugler and New York Fed President John Williams, however, over tariff fears, have suggested that policymakers should wait longer before slashing rates. Investors anticipate that rate cuts will be implemented in September US June‚Äôs data showed a less-than-expected rise in core inflation for the fifth consecutive month, even as Trump‚Äôs April tariff announcements augmented the cost of certain items. Waller predicts that the economy will ‚Äúremain soft‚Äù for the remainder of 2025 after only growing at a slow 1% rate in the first six months. Nevertheless, most investors believe the central bank will maintain interest rates as they are after the meeting this month. However, they expect the Feds to reduce rates later in September. Waller, when asked about possible September rate cuts, said that any additional cuts beyond this month would entirely rely on incoming economic data. He said he prefers they start now, not waiting until the labor market plunges. Waller is still being considered to be one of the possible successors to Fed Chair Jerome Powell, when his term ends. However, Waller stated he has not discussed the position with any administration officials. President Donald Trump has been at odds with Powell for months now. He has consistently asked Powell to lower interest rates, but those calls have been dismissed. Recently, the Fed chair also came under fire over the renovation at the central bank‚Äôs headquarters. Some Republicans have accused Powell of excessive spending on the project, urging more investigations into the matter. When asked to comment on the renovation issue, Waller noted that in his experience, construction projects often face similar challenges, emphasizing that while he wasn‚Äôt defending the situation, it wasn‚Äôt uncommon. He added that inflation had turned out to be much higher than anticipated when bids were made in 2017, stating that it‚Äôs clearly a factor. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

From meteoric rises to sudden, sharp declines, the digital asset space keeps investors on their toes. It‚Äôs a reality that even the most prominent figures in the industry acknowledge. Recently, Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the visionary founder of Binance Exchange, reiterated a crucial truth on X (formerly Twitter): ‚ÄúCrypto is volatile.‚Äù This statement, echoing his sentiments from January, serves as a powerful reminder that while cryptocurrency offers immense opportunities, it inherently carries significant risks due to its fluctuating nature. Understanding this fundamental aspect of crypto volatility is the first step towards mastering the digital asset landscape. Understanding the Nature of Crypto Volatility What exactly does it mean for an asset to be volatile? In simple terms, it refers to the rate at which the price of a security increases or decreases over a given period. For cryptocurrencies, this rate is often exceptionally high compared to traditional assets like stocks or bonds. A 10% move in a single day might be considered a major event in the stock market, but it‚Äôs almost commonplace in crypto. CZ‚Äôs consistent message about volatility isn‚Äôt a warning to stay away; rather, it‚Äôs an educational point. He emphasizes that this inherent characteristic presents both challenges and unparalleled possibilities. For those new to the space, the wild swings can be daunting. For seasoned investors, they can be opportunities for substantial gains ‚Äì provided one understands how to navigate them. Why Does the Crypto Market Experience Such Wild Swings? Unpacking Market Dynamics To truly grasp crypto volatility , we must delve into the underlying factors that drive these rapid price movements. Unlike traditional markets with centuries of regulatory frameworks and established norms, the cryptocurrency market is still relatively young and evolving. Several key elements contribute to its dynamic nature: Supply and Demand Imbalance: The market is highly reactive to shifts in buying and selling pressure. Large institutional buys or sells, even from individual whales, can significantly impact prices due to relatively lower liquidity compared to mainstream financial markets. News and Sentiment: Cryptocurrency prices are incredibly sensitive to news. Positive developments (e.g., major institutional adoption, regulatory clarity, technological breakthroughs) can trigger rallies, while negative news (e.g., hacks, regulatory crackdowns, FUD ‚Äì Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) can lead to sharp sell-offs. Social media sentiment also plays a massive role. Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of a unified global regulatory framework creates uncertainty. Announcements from governments or financial bodies regarding crypto regulation can cause immediate market reactions as investors try to anticipate future implications. Speculative Nature: A significant portion of crypto trading is driven by speculation rather than fundamental value. This leads to rapid price changes based on hype cycles, technical analysis patterns, and herd mentality. Technological Developments: Updates, upgrades, or even vulnerabilities in blockchain protocols can affect investor confidence and, consequently, asset prices. Interconnectedness: Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin often influence the entire market. A significant move in Bitcoin can ripple across altcoins, creating a cascading effect. Understanding these market dynamics is crucial for anyone looking to engage with digital assets. It‚Äôs not just about watching charts; it‚Äôs about comprehending the forces that shape them. Are Cryptocurrency Risks Worth the Potential Rewards? Navigating Cryptocurrency Risks CZ‚Äôs statement explicitly mentions both risks and opportunities. Let‚Äôs first address the risks. The high volatility of cryptocurrencies means that while gains can be substantial, losses can be equally swift and severe. Investors must be acutely aware of these potential downsides: Capital Loss: The most obvious risk is the potential to lose a significant portion, or even all, of your invested capital. Prices can plummet unexpectedly, leaving little time to react. Emotional Stress: The rollercoaster nature of crypto markets can take a heavy toll on an investor‚Äôs mental well-being. Panic selling during downturns or FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) during rallies often leads to poor decisions. Security Risks: While blockchain technology is secure, individual exchanges, wallets, or user practices can be vulnerable to hacks, phishing attacks, or scams. The decentralized nature also means fewer traditional consumer protections. Liquidity Issues: While major cryptocurrencies are highly liquid, some smaller altcoins may suffer from low liquidity, making it difficult to buy or sell large quantities without impacting the price. Regulatory Changes: Sudden, adverse regulatory changes in a specific country can severely impact the value of crypto assets held by its citizens or within its jurisdiction. These cryptocurrency risks are not to be taken lightly. Responsible investing in this space requires a clear understanding of what you stand to lose and a robust risk management strategy. Unlocking Investment Opportunities Amidst Volatility Despite the inherent risks, CZ and countless others highlight the significant opportunities that crypto volatility presents. It‚Äôs precisely these rapid movements that can lead to outsized returns not commonly found in traditional markets. What are these opportunities? High Growth Potential: Early adoption of innovative projects can lead to exponential returns if they gain widespread acceptance and utility. Bitcoin and Ethereum are prime examples of assets that have delivered life-changing returns for early investors. Diversification: Cryptocurrencies can offer a degree of portfolio diversification, as their price movements often do not correlate directly with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk. Technological Innovation: Investing in crypto is also investing in groundbreaking technology. Blockchain, DeFi (Decentralized Finance), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and Web3 are revolutionizing various industries, creating new economic paradigms. Accessibility: Crypto markets are global and operate 24/7, offering accessibility to investors worldwide, regardless of traditional banking hours or geographical location. For those willing to learn and manage risk effectively, the digital asset space continues to offer compelling investment opportunities that are simply not available elsewhere. Strategies for Navigating Crypto Volatility Like a Pro Given the dual nature of risks and opportunities, how does one navigate this volatile landscape effectively? It boils down to informed decision-making, disciplined execution, and a long-term perspective. Here are some actionable insights: Strategy Description Benefit in Volatility Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) Invest a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the asset‚Äôs price. Reduces the risk of buying at a market peak and averages out your purchase price over time. HODLing (Hold On for Dear Life) Buying cryptocurrencies and holding them for the long term, ignoring short-term price fluctuations. Aims to capture the long-term growth potential of assets, riding out short-term downturns. Diversification Spreading investments across various cryptocurrencies and other asset classes. Mitigates risk by not putting all your eggs in one basket. If one asset performs poorly, others might compensate. Risk Management & Stop-Loss Orders Setting predetermined limits on potential losses and using tools like stop-loss orders. Protects capital by automatically selling an asset if its price drops to a certain level, preventing larger losses. Thorough Research (DYOR) Conducting in-depth research on projects, teams, technology, and use cases before investing. Helps make informed decisions, reducing reliance on hype and improving conviction during market downturns. Beyond these strategies, it‚Äôs essential to invest only what you can afford to lose. Emotional discipline is paramount. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on fear or greed. Remember, CZ‚Äôs statement about volatility is a call for prudence, not panic. CZ and Binance‚Äôs Perspective on the Evolving Crypto Landscape As the founder of Binance, one of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Binance CZ has a unique vantage point on the market. His consistent messaging about volatility underscores a commitment to investor education and responsible engagement with digital assets. Binance itself has evolved, offering various tools and resources designed to help users navigate the complexities of the market, from educational academies to advanced trading features that allow for better risk management. CZ‚Äôs repeated emphasis serves as a bedrock principle for anyone stepping into crypto: acknowledge the swings, prepare for them, and leverage knowledge to turn potential pitfalls into opportunities. It‚Äôs a pragmatic approach that recognizes the inherent nature of innovation ‚Äì often disruptive, often unpredictable, but ultimately transformative. In conclusion, Changpeng Zhao‚Äôs simple yet profound statement, ‚ÄúCrypto is volatile,‚Äù encapsulates the core truth of the cryptocurrency market. It‚Äôs a realm of unprecedented growth potential, but one that demands respect for its inherent unpredictability. By understanding the underlying market dynamics , acknowledging the cryptocurrency risks , and actively seeking out the significant investment opportunities , investors can position themselves to thrive. The key lies in education, disciplined strategy, and a long-term vision. Embrace the volatility, but do so with knowledge and caution, transforming what might seem like chaos into a calculated path toward financial empowerment.

What does CZ mean by ‚ÄúCrypto is volatile‚Äù? CZ means that cryptocurrency prices can experience rapid and significant fluctuations, both upwards and downwards, over short periods. This is a fundamental characteristic of the crypto market, distinguishing it from more traditional, stable asset classes. 2. Why is cryptocurrency so volatile compared to traditional assets? Cryptocurrency‚Äôs high volatility stems from several factors, including its relatively small market size compared to traditional finance, speculative trading, sensitivity to news and social media sentiment, regulatory uncertainty, and lower liquidity for many altcoins. These factors can lead to amplified price movements. 3. What are the main risks associated with crypto volatility? The primary risks include the potential for significant capital loss due to sharp price drops, emotional stress from market swings leading to poor decisions, security vulnerabilities (hacks, scams), and liquidity issues for less popular assets. It‚Äôs crucial to invest only what you can afford to lose. 4. How can investors benefit from crypto volatility? While risky, volatility can present significant investment opportunities. It allows for high growth potential if assets appreciate rapidly, offers portfolio diversification benefits, and provides chances to buy assets at lower prices during market dips. Active traders can also profit from short-term price movements. 5. What strategies can help navigate crypto volatility? Effective strategies include Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) to average out purchase prices, HODLing for long-term growth, diversifying investments across different assets, implementing risk management techniques like stop-loss orders, and conducting thorough research (DYOR) to make informed decisions. 6. Is Binance a good platform for managing crypto volatility? Binance, founded by CZ, offers various tools and educational resources designed to help users manage volatility, including advanced trading features, risk management tools, and an extensive academy for learning about crypto. However, no platform can eliminate volatility itself; user education and responsible trading practices remain key. Did you find this article insightful?

The token just topped Coinbase‚Äôs 24-hour trading volume chart, clocking in a massive $1.38 billion. Momentum is building fast. Volatility is up. Traders are clearly circling back. Price action? Sharp. XRP pushed past $3.60, reclaiming its place among the crypto elite. With a market cap now over $210 billion, XRP has jumped into the #3 spot globally , right behind Ethereum. The rally isn‚Äôt limited to U.S. exchanges. Over in South Korea, XRP is booming. On Upbit , the country‚Äôs biggest crypto exchange , the XRP/KRW pair recorded a staggering $2.2 billion in trading volume over 24 hours. That‚Äôs 33% of the platform‚Äôs entire trading volume in one day. Zoom out, and the picture gets clearer: the XRP ecosystem is seeing a revival. Hype, liquidity, and whale moves are all lining up. One major wallet has caught attention , and it belongs to Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen. Larsen just moved about $26 million worth of XRP to Coinbase. But that‚Äôs just the latest in a string of transactions. Since January, Larsen‚Äôs wallet has shifted around 106 million XRP. Here‚Äôs the transfer that sparked buzz: BREAKING: $XRP surges to #1 in 24H trading volume on Coinbase, soaring to $1.38 billion. pic.twitter.com/vgjJpmmaA2 ‚Äî Whale Insider (@WhaleInsider) July 18, 2025 This kind of movement tends to coincide with market events. Is it a selloff? Internal reshuffling? Hard to say , but the timing is impossible to ignore. Larsen‚Äôs transactions come just as XRP‚Äôs global trading activity and price take off. Sentiment Shift or Something Bigger for XRP? The surge in XRP trading could reflect a deeper narrative shift. XRP has often seen bursts of activity when there‚Äôs speculation about regulatory clarity, Ripple Labs developments, or simply technical breakouts. This time, though, the confluence of volume across U.S. and Asian exchanges , plus high-profile whale activity , suggests something more coordinated. A post from @CryptoBriefing added fuel to the speculation: NEW: Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen moved approximately $26‚ÄØmillion worth of $XRP to Coinbase. Since the start of the year, his wallet has transferred roughly 106‚ÄØmillion XRP in total. pic.twitter.com/f0XXtYZy4V ‚Äî Crypto Briefing (@Crypto_Briefing) July 17, 2025 They noted the unusual volume imbalance and network wallet shuffling, pointing toward possible institutional plays. Some believe larger players may be positioning for upcoming legal or market news tied to Ripple. Coinbase is still the main gate for U.S. retail crypto traders. For XRP to lead volume there , surpassing tokens like Bitcoin and Ethereum , signals a very real retail-driven resurgence. The $1.38B figure isn‚Äôt a blip. It‚Äôs a sign. Traders are hunting for volatility. And right now, XRP‚Äôs delivering. XRP is showing strength. And history shows when XRP breaks out, it often does it fast and hard. Whether this momentum holds depends on a few key things: Whale selling pressure (like Larsen‚Äôs moves) Regulatory chatter around Ripple Broader crypto market sentiment But one thing‚Äôs clear: XRP isn‚Äôt done yet. Not by a long shot. This isn‚Äôt just another pump. It‚Äôs a wave , and XRP is riding the front of it. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Timmer says that if the Fed is forced to prop up the bond market, such as by buying the debt securities, the US dollar index (DXY) may tumble even lower. ‚ÄúIf the Fed is forced back into the bond market to hold down nominal and real rates, the dollar may well lose more of its supremacy premium. Currencies are the release valve for unsustainable fiscal policy, as Japan found out a few years ago. The same is now true for the dollar, which continues to lose strength despite the Fed‚Äôs hawkish policy stance.‚Äù Source: Jurrien Timmer/X The DXY, a measure of the value of the dollar relative to a basket of six other leading currencies from major economies, is currently at 98, down over 9% on the year. Timmer also says that if GDP growth cannot outpace the interest rate paid on government debt, the Fed intervention in the bond market will likely have to occur. ‚ÄúWith the debt ceiling now passed, the debt is rising again and the jaws between what the Treasury is selling and what the Fed is buying continue to widen. This will only last for so long, in my view. We are now in round two of fiscal dominance, with the first $5 trillion helicopter drop taking place during COVID and now the second one about to get underway from the OBBB (One Big Beautiful Bill Act). The math is simple but difficult: as long as nominal GDP growth outpaces the funding rate (10-year Treasury yield), the debt can be considered sustainable. Hopefully, that happens, as a capex cycle (capital expenditure) from both the OBBB and the AI (artificial intelligence) boom increases productivity and therefore the non-inflationary speed limit for the US economy. If not, and if the term premium rises further, in a few years we could have an unsustainable debt spiral on our hands, requiring the Fed to re-enter the bond market to suppress the term premium once again.‚Äù Source: Jurrien Timmer/X Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat ‚Äì Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

The total crypto market cap crossed $4 trillion for the first time. As capital flows into altcoins and institutional interest grows through spot ETFs and on-chain assets, the altcoins season may finally be here. Analysts note the explosive moves in altcoins like ETH, SOL, and meme coins as clear signs of a major shift. Ethereum has already crossed $3,600, posting a 20% gain over the past week. While other altcoins like Sui, Avalanche, Cardano, Dogecoin, and XRP have rallied between 15% and 20% during the same period. Key Indicators Flash ‚ÄòAltseason‚Äô According to Cryptorank, three key metrics show that a major shift is underway as investors rotate out of Bitcoin and into altcoins. Firstly, the Altcoin Index has jumped to 50 from just 15 a month ago. The sharp rise reflects strong altcoin performance and growing appetite for risk. Traders are actively seeking opportunities beyond Bitcoin. The Altcoin Season Index rises when most of the top 50 coins (excluding Bitcoin) outperform BTC over a set period. Once the index crosses 75, it signals the start of a full-blown altcoin bull market. Are we entering altseason? Three key metrics suggest investors are rotating capital into non-BTC assets in a potentially pivotal moment this cycle: 1/ Altcoin Index hits 50, up from 15 in under a month, signaling strong alt performance and risk appetite https://t.co/MIJpdU3jMX pic.twitter.com/0jqobGW7Rm ‚Äî CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) July 18, 2025 Secondly, Bitcoin‚Äôs market dominance has dropped below 58%, down from 62% in less than a month, despite BTC hitting a new all-time high and holding steady around $120K. And finally, the Fear and Greed Index has been firmly held in the Greed zone since June 23. The high market confidence, combined with the FOMO, is pushing traders toward more volatile altcoins. Technical Patterns Support a Breakout Veteran trader Peter Brandt recently pointed to a classic cup and handle pattern on the altcoin market cap chart, which indicates a strong setup for a breakout. With the market cap nearing the $1.70 trillion breakout level, altcoins may be on the verge of a major surge.

He believes the altcoin bull market is officially here. He expects ETH to slow down a bit soon, giving a chance to buy the dip before it moves higher. He also points to what he calls the ‚Äúbiggest bullish divergence ever‚Äù on altcoins, signaling the start of a major rally with plenty of upside still ahead. The biggest bullish divergence ever on #Altcoins starts to become confirmed. This would signal that we're at the start of the entire rally and reversal and there's still so much more to come. pic.twitter.com/B3gIlcfUYS ‚Äî Micha√´l van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) July 17, 2025 While altcoin season offers massive upside, it comes with serious risks. Raoul Pal warns against chasing pumps, since altcoins tend to move in waves. Instead, focus on tokens that consistently beat BTC, ETH, and SOL on weekly charts. Expert Benjamin Cowen says most altcoins are weakening against ETH and BTC. While ETH may have bottomed, many altcoins could still fall. Liquidity may shift back to Bitcoin soon, but a few coins like XRP may already be stable. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a significant move set to reshape the investment infrastructure within this decentralized realm, multichain middleware platform Bifrost (BFC) has unveiled its ambitious plans for StableDAO, coupled with a strategic token burn mechanism. This announcement marks a pivotal moment for Bifrost and the broader Web3 ecosystem, promising to inject much-needed stablecoin-based liquidity into promising projects while enhancing the value proposition for BFC and BiFi token holders. What is Bifrost and Why Does it Matter for Web3 Investment? Before diving into the specifics of StableDAO, it‚Äôs crucial to understand the foundation laid by Bifrost . As a multichain middleware platform, Bifrost acts as a vital bridge, connecting various blockchain networks and enabling seamless interoperability. In the fragmented world of Web3, where different blockchains often operate in silos, Bifrost provides the necessary infrastructure for assets and data to flow freely. This capability is not just a technical feat; it‚Äôs a fundamental enabler for complex decentralized applications and services that require cross-chain communication and liquidity. By facilitating smoother interactions across chains, Bifrost empowers developers and users, laying the groundwork for a more unified and efficient Web3 experience. The platform‚Äôs role as a middleware solution positions it uniquely to identify and support emerging Web3 projects. Its deep understanding of multichain dynamics makes it an ideal candidate to orchestrate sophisticated investment strategies, precisely what StableDAO aims to achieve. This strategic positioning allows Bifrost to play a crucial role in directing capital where it‚Äôs most needed, thereby accelerating the growth of the decentralized economy. StableDAO: A New Frontier for Web3 Investment and Stablecoin Liquidity? At the heart of Bifrost‚Äôs latest initiative is StableDAO, envisioned as a cutting-edge Web3 investment infrastructure. The primary goal of StableDAO is to provide stablecoin-based liquidity to high-quality Web3 projects. Why stablecoins? In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, stablecoins offer a beacon of stability, providing a reliable medium of exchange and a predictable store of value. By leveraging stablecoins, StableDAO can offer a more secure and less volatile form of capital injection for promising decentralized applications and protocols. The mechanism is straightforward yet powerful: StableDAO will accumulate stablecoins, which will then be strategically deployed to support innovative Web3 ventures. This influx of stablecoin liquidity is critical for several reasons: Reduced Volatility Risk: Projects receiving funding in stablecoins are shielded from the extreme price fluctuations often associated with native cryptocurrencies, allowing them to focus on development rather than market swings. Enhanced Predictability: Stable funding allows for better financial planning and resource allocation within Web3 projects. Broader Accessibility: Stablecoins are often easier for traditional investors to understand and utilize, potentially bridging the gap between conventional finance and decentralized applications. Fostering Innovation: By providing a stable financial backbone, StableDAO enables emerging projects to experiment, build, and scale without the constant pressure of market instability. This initiative isn‚Äôt just about funding; it‚Äôs about building a robust, resilient investment framework within Web3 that prioritizes stability and long-term growth. StableDAO represents a strategic evolution in how decentralized projects secure vital capital. The Strategic Token Burn: Boosting Value and Scarcity for BFC and BiFi Perhaps one of the most compelling aspects of the StableDAO announcement is the integrated token burn plan. Token burning is a deflationary mechanism where a certain amount of cryptocurrency tokens are permanently removed from circulation, often to reduce supply and potentially increase the value of the remaining tokens. Bifrost‚Äôs plan is particularly noteworthy: 30% of StableDAO‚Äôs profits will be allocated to burn BFC tokens. 2% of StableDAO‚Äôs profits will be allocated to burn BiFi tokens. This aggressive token burn strategy demonstrates a strong commitment to enhancing the value proposition for both BFC and BiFi token holders. By consistently reducing the circulating supply of these tokens, Bifrost aims to create a more scarce asset, which, assuming consistent demand, could lead to increased price appreciation over time. This mechanism directly aligns the success of StableDAO with the interests of the token holders, creating a powerful incentive for community participation and long-term holding. The significant 30% allocation for BFC underscores its central role within the Bifrost ecosystem and its importance in the broader Web3 infrastructure. The inclusion of BiFi, another token within Bifrost‚Äôs suite of offerings, further strengthens the overall ecosystem‚Äôs value capture. This dual token burn approach is a sophisticated move to create a symbiotic relationship between the new investment infrastructure and the existing token economy. How Does Stablecoin Liquidity Empower Web3 Projects? The provision of stablecoin liquidity by StableDAO is more than just financial support; it‚Äôs an empowering force for Web3 projects. In the nascent stages of decentralized development, access to reliable and predictable funding is a significant hurdle. Many promising projects struggle to secure capital that isn‚Äôt subject to the wild swings of speculative crypto markets. Stablecoin liquidity addresses this challenge head-on. Imagine a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol building a new lending platform. If its treasury is primarily held in a volatile asset, a sudden market downturn could severely impact its ability to operate, pay developers, or even cover operational costs. However, with funding in stablecoins, the project gains a stable financial foundation, allowing its team to: Focus on Core Development: Less time is spent managing treasury volatility and more time is dedicated to building and improving the product. Execute Long-Term Roadmaps: Predictable funding enables projects to plan and execute ambitious roadmaps without constant financial uncertainty. Attract and Retain Talent: Stable financial footing makes a project more attractive to top-tier developers and talent, ensuring sustained innovation. Foster Ecosystem Growth: By de-risking funding, StableDAO indirectly encourages more builders to enter the Web3 space, knowing that viable funding avenues exist. This strategic injection of stablecoin liquidity positions StableDAO as a crucial player in nurturing the next generation of Web3 innovation, moving beyond speculative funding towards sustainable growth models. The Broader Impact on Web3 Investment and Ecosystem Growth The launch of StableDAO and its associated token burn plan extends beyond the immediate benefits to Bifrost and its token holders; it carries significant implications for the entire landscape of Web3 Investment . This initiative represents a maturing of the decentralized finance and Web3 space, moving towards more sophisticated and sustainable funding mechanisms. Historically, much of the investment in Web3 has been driven by venture capital or speculative trading in native tokens. While effective, these methods often come with their own set of challenges, including high volatility and a focus on short-term gains. StableDAO introduces a model that prioritizes stability and long-term value creation by: Diversifying Funding Sources: Offering a stablecoin-centric investment vehicle diversifies the options available to Web3 projects. Setting a New Standard: It could inspire other platforms to adopt similar profit-sharing and token burn models, leading to healthier tokenomics across the industry. Enhancing Investor Confidence: A clear, profit-driven token burn mechanism can instill greater confidence among investors, knowing that a portion of the project‚Äôs success directly benefits token holders through scarcity. Promoting Sustainable Development: By providing stable capital, StableDAO supports projects that aim for utility and long-term viability rather than quick flips. This strategic move by Bifrost highlights a growing trend within Web3 to build more robust, transparent, and community-aligned financial infrastructures. It signifies a step towards a more mature investment environment where innovation is supported by stable, reliable capital. Benefits and Actionable Insights Let‚Äôs summarize the key benefits and what this means for you, the Web3 enthusiast or investor: Key Benefits: For BFC and BiFi Holders: Direct value accrual through consistent token burns, potentially leading to increased scarcity and price appreciation. For Web3 Projects: Access to stablecoin-based, non-dilutive funding, reducing volatility risk and enabling long-term development. For the Web3 Ecosystem: A new model for sustainable investment, fostering innovation and stability within the decentralized space. Enhanced Liquidity: StableDAO will inject much-needed liquidity into the ecosystem, making it easier for quality projects to thrive. What Does This Mean For You? (Actionable Insights) Research Bifrost: If you‚Äôre interested in middleware solutions and cross-chain interoperability, delve deeper into Bifrost‚Äôs technology and roadmap. Monitor StableDAO‚Äôs Performance: Keep an eye on the types of projects StableDAO funds and its overall profitability, as this directly impacts the token burn. Consider BFC/BiFi: For those interested in deflationary assets linked to a growing Web3 investment infrastructure, BFC and BiFi might warrant further investigation based on your personal risk assessment. Stay Informed: The Web3 space moves fast. Regularly check Bifrost‚Äôs official announcements and community channels for updates on StableDAO‚Äôs progress and the token burn schedule. A Compelling Future for Web3 Investment? Bifrost‚Äôs announcement regarding StableDAO and its innovative token burn plan represents a significant leap forward in the evolution of Web3 investment . By strategically deploying stablecoin liquidity to quality projects and linking the success of this endeavor directly to the scarcity of its native tokens, Bifrost is not just launching a new product; it‚Äôs setting a new standard for sustainable growth and value creation in the decentralized world. This initiative holds the promise of fostering a more stable, predictable, and ultimately more prosperous Web3 ecosystem for developers, investors, and users alike. The future of decentralized investment looks brighter with such thoughtful and community-aligned strategies taking center stage.

Data from CoinGlass confirms that traders have been rushing to open long positions on XRP as OI has been steadily increasing since the beginning of July, moving from around $2.5 billion to their current level for a 300% increase in less than a month. Open interest for traditional futures has also jumped to 2,650 contracts worth $459 million, marking a new record for the CME Group‚Äôs recently launched XRP futures. The launch of an XRP-linked exchange-traded fund (ETF) this week alongside the passing of the Genius Act by the House of Representatives have catalyzed this explosive move. As a result, XRP has now delivered year-to-date gains of 67%, making it the best-performing token of the top 5. XRP Price Prediction: On Track to Hit $4 After Local High Breakout XRP is now just 10.1% away from making a new all-time high. The weekend‚Äôs price action may close the deal if bullish momentum continues to gain traction. Yesterday, the price broke through its January 16 high of $3.40. This is the highest level that XRP has reached in years and the closest it has been since January 2018 to retesting its all-time high. This is a historical moment for Ripple. A set of legal victories has given its native asset a dramatic boost since October this year. Now, with a pro-crypto leadership team at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the sky is the limit. The price seems to be retesting the $3.4 resistance from above. If it stays above this mark, the odds favor a bullish XRP price prediction of $4. This level could be hit during the weekend. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is as stretched as it can get as it has reached 88 in the daily chart. This is an extreme overbought level that could anticipate a strong pullback. However, positive momentum still favors a bullish XRP price prediction of $4 and possibly beyond.

The move came as broader market conditions turned favorable and adoption gained momentum, with cryptocurrency market capitalization topping the $4 trillion mark for the first time. Behind BNB‚Äôs price action lies a combination of technical strength and market fundamentals, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model. Binance, the crypto exchange that launched BNB, maintained its dominant position in the second quarter, handling over 35% of global trading volume, according to TokenInsight . The continued use of BNB for trading fee discounts and other exchange functions has helped sustain demand, even as overall spot volume fell. The token was also bolstered by Windtree Therapeutics, a Nasdaq-listed biotech company based in Pennsylvania, which announced plans to raise as much as $200 million to build a BNB treasury. The company has already secured a $60 million agreement with blockchain investor Build and Build Corp., with the possibility of $140 million more. Windtree joins companies including 10X Capital and Nano Labs in investing in the cryptocurrency for their corporate treasuries. BNB Chain also revealed its 2025‚Äì2026 roadmap , which includes scaling gas limits and adding privacy features. Together with efforts like the Ondo Global Markets Alliance, which aims to bring tokenized securities such as stocks and ETFs to BNB Chain, these developments hint at a growing institutional role for BNB beyond its original exchange use. The rally also follows a $1 billion burn and coincides with the token's eighth anniversary, reinforcing long-term interest even as volatility persists near the $740 mark.

Is the rally now over, or is there more to come? $XRP sets new all-time high Source: TradingView Since retesting a local bottom at $1.91, the $XRP price has just surged and surged, taking everyone by surprise, except no doubt, the grand XRP army, who are now probably wearing smiles to match their fortitude in holding a coin that many might have thought was on the way to zero. This 92% pump has been reward indeed for all those who held on through the misery of that descent to $0.11 following the bull market top of January 2018. As things stand, some investors could be shorting $XRP right now, content in the knowledge that after such a huge rise in price, and with the all-time high now broken, this heavily-backed altcoin might have had its day. However, massive caution is advised. Yes, there is likely to be a lot of volatility now that the top has been surpassed, but as can be seen in the short-term price chart above, the $XRP price has been back to exactly tag and retest the previous all-time high before rising again. Look out for some swings this way and that, but if the price stays above $3.40, there could eventually be another break even higher. $XRP bulls look to build on top of previous high Source: TradingView The daily chart shows the sideways price action since December 2024. While this might have frustrated some, this was building the price structure for this latest surge. If the bulls can keep the price above $3.40, or perhaps above $3.00, this can provide the platform for further growth. A slight concern is the height of the Stochastic RSI indicators, which will have to come down and reset at some point. At the same time, the RSI is showing that the indicator still hasn‚Äôt surpassed the previous peak at just above 95.00. Given that price action is rising, the indicator will need to avoid a downtrend which could signal bearish divergence. Do not fade $XRP Source: TradingView The weekly time frame puts the position of $XRP into perspective. While the years through most of 2021 to the end of 2024 were extremely lean, the vertical price pump, once the price had got above the descending trendline, is something to see. The bulls were then able to lay down quite a bit of price structure on top of the 2021 previous high at $1.96, enabling the eventual surge out of the descending trendline. Where to next? The bulls will try and flip the blue resistance line into support, which will happen if the price is still above at the end of this week. The MACD at the bottom of the chart looks very bullish, with a strong cross up of the blue indicator line above the orange signal line. Also, a potential series of green bars may have just begun in the histogram. Do not fade $XRP. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The latest news from DigitalX, an Australia-based digital asset manager , is no exception. Their recent announcement of a substantial increase in their Bitcoin holdings underscores a growing confidence among traditional investment firms in the long-term viability and value of cryptocurrencies. This isn‚Äôt just about adding more numbers to a balance sheet; it‚Äôs a powerful statement about the evolving landscape of global finance and the undeniable rise of digital currencies. DigitalX‚Äôs Strategic Expansion: Boosting Bitcoin Holdings DigitalX, a pioneering entity in the digital investment space, recently shared exciting news via X (formerly Twitter). The firm has successfully acquired an additional 57.5 BTC, pushing its total Bitcoin treasury to an impressive 425.1 BTC. At current market valuations, this portfolio is valued at approximately $78.2 million, a testament to the firm‚Äôs strategic foresight and commitment to the digital asset sector. This significant accumulation reflects a deliberate strategy to strengthen their position in the market, providing both stability and growth potential for their stakeholders. What does this mean for DigitalX and the broader market? Let‚Äôs break it down: Increased Exposure: A larger Bitcoin treasury means DigitalX has greater direct exposure to Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements, aligning their interests closely with the asset‚Äôs performance. Market Confidence: Such substantial purchases by a publicly listed company often signal confidence to other institutional and retail investors, potentially encouraging further adoption. Strategic Asset Allocation: It indicates a belief in Bitcoin as a core asset for long-term value preservation and appreciation, potentially diversifying traditional portfolios. Why Are Institutional Bitcoin Holdings So Important? The accumulation of Bitcoin by institutions like DigitalX goes beyond mere financial transactions; it‚Äôs a powerful validation of the asset class. When established financial entities commit significant capital to Bitcoin, it lends credibility and stability to a market often perceived as volatile and speculative. This shift from niche interest to mainstream investment is crucial for the cryptocurrency ecosystem‚Äôs maturity. Benefits of Institutional Adoption: Legitimacy: Institutional involvement helps legitimize Bitcoin as a serious asset class, reducing skepticism among traditional investors. Market Stability: Large, long-term holdings by institutions can help reduce market volatility, as these entities are less likely to engage in speculative day trading. Infrastructure Development: Increased institutional demand often spurs the development of robust regulatory frameworks, custodial solutions, and trading platforms, making the market safer and more accessible. Capital Inflow: It brings significant capital into the market, which can support price appreciation and fund further innovation within the crypto space. Challenges and Considerations: Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape remains a challenge, with different jurisdictions taking varied approaches to digital assets. Market Volatility: While institutions can help stabilize, Bitcoin remains a volatile asset, posing risks to even large-scale investors. Security Concerns: Managing large amounts of digital assets requires sophisticated security protocols to prevent hacks and theft. This trend of increasing Bitcoin holdings by institutions is a cornerstone of Bitcoin‚Äôs journey towards mainstream acceptance. It signals a maturation of the market, moving beyond early adopters to embrace a broader financial audience. Navigating the Landscape of Institutional Crypto Investment The methods by which institutions engage with crypto are diverse, reflecting varying risk appetites and strategic objectives. From direct purchases to exchange-traded products (ETPs) and even mining operations, the avenues for institutional crypto investment are expanding rapidly. DigitalX‚Äôs direct purchase of Bitcoin is a clear sign of their conviction in the underlying asset itself, rather than just exposure through derivatives or funds. Consider the different approaches: Investment Method Description Pros Cons Direct Purchase Acquiring and holding Bitcoin directly on balance sheets. Full control, direct exposure to price.

DigitalX‚Äôs choice to directly accumulate Bitcoin showcases a strong belief in its foundational value. This direct approach often requires robust internal processes for custody and risk management, highlighting the firm‚Äôs sophistication in handling digital assets. The growth of institutional crypto products and services is a clear indicator that the financial world is adapting to, and embracing, this new asset class. What Does This BTC Investment Signify for the Market? Every major BTC investment by an institutional player contributes to a larger narrative: Bitcoin‚Äôs journey from a fringe digital experiment to a globally recognized asset. DigitalX‚Äôs recent acquisition is not an isolated event but part of a broader trend of increasing institutional adoption that is reshaping market dynamics. Impact on Market Sentiment: Bullish Signal: Large purchases are often interpreted as a bullish signal, indicating that smart money sees long-term value in Bitcoin. Supply Shock Potential: As more Bitcoin is taken off exchanges and held in long-term institutional treasuries, the circulating supply available for trading decreases, potentially leading to price appreciation if demand remains constant or increases. Increased Liquidity: While long-term holdings reduce circulating supply, the presence of large institutions can also bring more liquidity to the market through their trading activities and derivatives. This ongoing institutional embrace suggests that Bitcoin is increasingly viewed not just as a speculative asset, but as a legitimate store of value, a hedge against inflation, and even a form of ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô. The growing conviction behind such significant BTC investment decisions is a key driver for the cryptocurrency market‚Äôs continued expansion and maturation.

DigitalX‚Äôs continued growth in its Bitcoin holdings exemplifies the confidence and strategic vision required to thrive in this cutting-edge financial frontier.

This follows significant increases in individual crypto prices. The market is up today, with 96 of the top 100 coins per market cap appreciating over the past 24 hours. At the same time, the total crypto trading volume is at $284 billion, the highest it‚Äôs been in a while. TLDR: Crypto market cap surpassed $4 trillion; Vast majority of top 100 coins are green; BTC is back above $120,350, and ETH is gradually approaching $4,000; Traders are ‚Äúaggressively positioned‚Äù for ETH‚Äôs rapid move to $4,000 by 25 July‚Äù Market sentiment continues rising within the greed zone; ETH spot ETFs saw the second-highest inflows ever, following yesterday‚Äôs ATH; US BTC recorded positive flows for eleven consecutive days; ‚ÄùBTC is participating, but this rally belongs to ETH; There‚Äôs a 12% chance that BTC ends the year above $170,000. Crypto Winners & Losers At the time of writing, all the top 10 coins per market cap are still green. Bitcoin (BTC) has appreciated by 1.6% to the price of $120,352. This is the smallest increase in this category. Also, Ethereum (ETH) rose by 6.5%, currently trading at $3,652. The price is gradually approaching the long-awaited $4,000 mark. The highest gainer is Dogecoin (DOGE) . It‚Äôs up 14.9% to $0.2434. XRP (XRP) and Cardano (ADA) also saw double-digit increases of 12.9% and 12.3% to $3.56 and $0.868, respectively. Notably, XRP hit a new ATH of $3.65 today. In the top 100 coins category, 96 coins are green and 4 are red. Of the green ones, 14 have double-digit rises in the past days. At the top is Uniswap (UNI) with a 19% rise to $10.53. It‚Äôs followed by Hedera (HBAR) , which saw a 16.1%, now trading at $0.281. On the other side, Bonk (BONK) is down 7.4%, changing hands at $0.00003636. Pump.fun (PUMP) follows with a drop of 5% to $0.005102. The other two red coins are down below 0.2%, meaning they‚Äôre practically unchanged. Meanwhile, the crypto market surge has been fueled by positive regulatory developments. Specifically, the US House of Representatives passed three key crypto-related bills. However, Congresswoman Maxine Waters argued that the CLARITY Act, one of the above-mentioned three bills, would cause ‚Äúinvestor harm.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe bill presents several serious risks: it exposes consumers to exploitation by bad actors in the crypto industry, undermines national security, and ignores Donald Trump‚Äôs escalating conflicts of interest tied to his personal involvement in cryptocurrency,‚Äù Waters wrote on Thursday. ‚ÄòThis Isn‚Äôt Just a Spike, It‚Äôs a Regime Change‚Äô Sean Dawson, Head of Research at onchain options platform Derive.xyz , commented on Ethereum‚Äôs surge over the past week, surpassing $3,500. ‚ÄúBTC is participating,‚Äù he says, ‚Äúbut this rally belongs to ETH.‚Äù Several factors point to a structural shift in positioning, including the technical setup, option flows, and liquidations. Thanks to macro tailwinds, falling rates, and ETF momentum, the second half of 2025 may be Ethereum‚Äôs strongest in years, he explains. ‚ÄúEthereum‚Äôs moment in the sun has finally arrived,‚Äù Dawson writes in an email. ‚ÄúTraders are aggressively positioned for a rapid move to $4K by July 25.‚Äù Dawson argues that the sharp rally marks a potential breakout moment for ETH ‚Äúfueled by bullish macro conditions, rising institutional inflows, and an overwhelming shift in sentiment.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just a spike, it‚Äôs a regime change. We‚Äôre seeing explosive upside bets and a wave of short liquidations. The market may finally be waking up to ETH‚Äôs asymmetric upside.‚Äù Currently, there is a 14% chance that ETH ends July above $4,000. There is also a 27% chance it surpasses $5,000 by the end of 2025. Also, there is an 18% chance that BTC moves above $125,000 by the end of July, and a 12% chance it ends the year above $170,000. Meanwhile, in the past 24 hours, 25% of Derive‚Äôs ETH trading volume has been concentrated on call options between $3,000 and $4,000 for the 25 July expiry. This is ‚Äúa strong signal that traders are aligned on a fast, continued breakout,‚Äù says Dawson. Also, 8% of all open interest for that expiry is sitting on the $4,000 ETH strike. This reflects ‚Äúa growing appetite for leveraged long exposure as bullish conviction builds‚Äù.

This is ‚Äúfueling an aggressive short squeeze that pushed prices even higher,‚Äù Dawson says. Source: Derive.xyz Levels & Events to Watch Next At the time of writing, BTC trades at $120,352. It started the day at the daily low of $117,785, climbing to the intraday high of $120,689 before slightly correcting to the current price. The coin is approaching the $122,838, which it recorded four days ago. Investors are watching for BTC to retake and keep the $121,000 level first. Moreover, Ethereum is currently trading at $3,652. It rose from the intraday low of $3,382 to $3,669 in a matter of hours. All eyes are now on the $3,700 level. Meanwhile, the crypto market sentiment continues climbing within greed territory. The Fear and Greed Index increased from 70 yesterday to 71 today . The level suggests a positive outlook on the market. However, it may also indicate overconfidence, with the market becoming overbought, which would lead to a correction. Moreover, on 17 July, the US BTC spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) saw more positive flows, marking eleven days in a row. They recorded $522.6 million in inflows. The total has now reached $54.39 billion. BlackRock recorded $497.3 million in inflows on Thursday, while Fidelity , Grayscale , VanEck , and Invesco saw inflows between $5 million and $7 million. At the same time, US ETH ETFs saw positive flows for the tenth day in a row. It recorded another significant amount: $602.02 million on Thursday, which is the second-highest level ever, following Wednesday‚Äôs record of $726.74 million. Of this amount, BlackRock recorded $546.7 million. It‚Äôs followed by Grayscale‚Äôs $29.9 million. Fidelity , Bitwise , and 21Shares account for the rest. Meanwhile, SharpLink Gaming bought an additional 32,892 ETH worth $115 million, bringing the company‚Äôs total to 144,501 ETH. The company has allocated 99.7% of its ETH holdings to staking protocols, generating some 415 ETH in rewards since June.

Investors largely reacted to a number of quarterly earnings reports from major companies, in addition to retail sales data. Is this rally sustainable?

Analysts eye $1.18 and $1.31 targets if ADA closes daily above the $0.85 breakout level. Open Interest on ADA hits $1.65 billion, setting a new record and showing rising trader confidence. Cardano Holds Gains Near $0.85 After Breakout Cardano (ADA) traded at $0.852 after rising 7% in 24 hours and 20% over the week. The move followed a breakout from a long downward trend, with buyers now pushing into higher price zones. Earlier resistance around $0.74 had held the price in check during multiple attempts this year. That level has now been breached. ADA touched nearly $0.78 last week before a brief pullback, but buyers stepped in again, pushing the price above $0.84 heading into the weekend. Analysts Watch the $0.85 Level for Confirmation Crypto analyst Ali Martinez said a daily close above $0.85 could open the way toward $1.31. His view is based on earlier market structure and current momentum. ADA has cleared the $0.68 mark, which may now serve as support if prices remain above it.

He added that holding above $0.82 could shift attention to $1.18. On the downside, $0.68 and $0.58 are the nearest support zones in case of any pullback. Open Interest Pushes Higher With Price Cardano‚Äôs recent gains are backed by rising interest in its futures market. Data from CoinGlass shows Open Interest (OI) on ADA has grown by 16% in the last 24 hours, reaching $1.65 billion, surpassing the previous record high of $1.50 billion set on January 18. Source: Coinglass Open Interest reflects capital tied to active trading positions. A steady rise often means traders are committing more capital, which can support ongoing moves. This increase adds weight to the recent price trend. In fact, with ADA reclaiming the $0.80 range and testing $0.85, traders are focused on whether it can close the day above that level.

SharpLink has aggressively raised capital to buy ETH, now holding over 280,000 ETH, with nearly all assets staked for rewards. SBET stock trades at almost 4x the value of its ETH holdings, making its valuation excessive compared to simply owning ETH or ETFs. Despite being bullish on Ethereum, I see SBET's price as speculative and would avoid the stock at this premium to its net asset value. If it seems like every other article I've written in July has been about Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) treasury companies, you'll have to forgive me; but I have more to say. Not to be forgotten, with Bit Digital ( BTBT ), BTCS Inc. ( BTCS ), and BitMine Immersion Technologies ( BMNR ) all turning into Ethereum Treasury companies this summer, SharpLink Gaming, Inc. ( SBET ) was one of the true early players in this game. In this article, we'll look at SharpLink Gaming's operational history, ETH holdings, and stock valuation. SharpLink Gaming Before Ethereum SBET stock has been on an incredible roller-coaster ride since the end of May: Data by YCharts After closing at $2.79 per share on May 21st, the stock absolutely exploded over $124 per share roughly one week later. This action is a perfect example of hype running into a lack of liquidity. As of the quarter ended in March, there were less than 1 million shares of SBET outstanding. There were 54.5 million shares traded during the May 27th session. And we need to be clear about this; there is absolutely nothing fundamentally driving this performance other than the company's exposure to Ethereum. The underlying business itself is bringing minimal revenue to the table: Q1-25 Revenue (SharpLink 10-Q) Prior to becoming an Ethereum rocket ship stock, SharpLink Gaming was involved with sports betting and iGaming. For the quarter ended March, SharpLink reported just $742k in revenue - a 24% year-over-year decrease - as well as an operating loss of nearly $1 million. This was actually an improvement from the Q1-24 operating loss of $1.7 million. Q1-25 Balance Sheet (SharpLink 10-Q) At the end of March, SharpLink had roughly $1.4 million in cash, $2.8 million in total assets, $693k in total liabilities and shareholder equity of about $2.1 million. The point is, this was not a company that had much going for it and the stock price reflected that. Data by YCharts Before the company priced a $4.5 million offering in late-May, SBET shares traded at a slight discount to book value. Prior to all of the Ethereum activity, SharpLink was actually exhibiting strong revenue growth between 2021 and 2023 before falling by 26% in 2024. At this point though, the underlying business that SharpLink had been primarily operating before the late-May ETH purchases is completely immaterial to the valuation of the company's share price going forward. Capital Raises On May 27th, SharpLink announced a $425 million Private Investment in Public Equity, or PIPE, with the expressed purpose of starting an Ethereum Treasury. The stock immediately surged 400% on the news. As part of the PIPE, the company sold 58.7 million shares at a $6.15 share price. The day before the announcement of the PIPE, CEO Rob Phythian and CFO Robert DeLucia purchased a combined $200,000 in SBET stock at a share price of $6.72. Also on May 26th, the company added Joseph Lubin to the Board of Directors and elected him Chairman of the Board. Lubin co-founded Ethereum in 2014 and is also the founder of Metamask developer ConsenSys. Given Lubin's history with Ethereum, it is certainly not a surprise to see SharpLink opting for an ETH treasury strategy rather than Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) or Solana ( SOL-USD ); each of which has seen growing balance sheet interest at the corporate level. Subsequent to the PIPE, SharpLink has also commenced a $1 billion ATM to purchase more ETH. At several points over the last few weeks, SharpLink has tapped that ATM to buy Ethereum. On July 17th, the company disclosed an additional $5 billion ATM to bring the aggregate ATM offering to $6 billion. In the prospectus, SharpLink disclosed 40.5 million shares of common stock sold through the $1 billion ATM for gross proceeds of $721 million. Ethereum Holdings vs. Valuation By my back of the envelope math, after the PIPE and shares issued through the ATM, there are roughly 100 million SBET shares outstanding as of July 17th. At a closing share price of $36.40 on that same date, SharpLink has an estimated market capitalization of a little over $3.6 billion. Top ETH Holders, 7/17/25 ( strategicethreserve.xyz ) On July 15th, SharpLink touted the largest corporate Ethereum stack at 280,706 ETH. The company's reign at the top was short-lived, as BitMine Immersion disclosed over 300k ETH two days later. Assuming SBET still has 280.7k ETH as of July 17th, the market value of those coins is a hair over $1 billion. Thus, SBET holders are paying nearly 4x the value of the ETH held by the company. To be sure, the company is staking its assets. Per the July 17th prospectus, 99.7% of SharpLink's ETH is staked and generating rewards. ETH Staking, 1yr ( stakingrewards.com ) The question is, how much should SBET shareholders pay for a company that is generating 3% APY on staked assets? I don't think nearly 4x the underlying is the right price. Perhaps the enthusiasm is more about the potential price performance of ETH than the potential rewards from staking? In which case, SBET makes little sense against simply buying spot ETFs. Sure, you miss out on staking rewards through an ETF (for now), but you also don't have to pay $36 for about $10 of staked ETH. Closing Points I don't want to come off as a total curmudgeon in this piece. I'm actually bullish on ETH long term and see the passing of the GENIUS Act by the United States Congress as a big win for Ethereum and smart contract chains alike. That said, I think the action that we're seeing in the public equity markets is concerning, and it reminds me of the 2017 crypto run a great deal. Back then, nano-cap parabolas were achieved by simply putting 'blockchain' in the corporate name. This time around, mentioning a 'digital asset treasury' strategy in a press release opens the door to an ATM. In my view, this is late-cycle behavior and a decent reason to resist FOMO in both crypto and crypto-adjacent equities. I'm told it is different this time. But I'm not so sure about that. For me, the play is simple: If you like ETH, buy ETH. SBET is not a stock I would personally buy at nearly 4x NAV.",ETH-USD|SBET,EN,0,0,ETH|BUSINESS|TRADING|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-18 12:00:00

Advanced decentralized exchanges are making a mark in the derivatives market. This rise hints at potential growth opportunities for specific coins. Curious about which assets might be set to soar? Dive into the details to uncover the next big movers in the crypto world. Injective (INJ): Week Gains Amid Mixed Trends Last month saw Injective trade with a 15.67% price increase, although the broader half-year picture shows a 45.84% drop. The coin experienced notable week-long fluctuations with its price range between $8.39 and $13.74. Over the period, movements mirrored the volatile nature of altcoins, with buyers pushing prices notably in the short term while the longer outlook remained subdued. These past movements highlight a market that has been reactive and volatile, balancing quick spikes against longer-term declines. Current activity presents a trading window defined by a resistance level at $16.71 and support at $6.01, with an upper resistance near $22.05 and a second support around $0.66. The week's advance with a 21.97% increase underscores recent bullish pressure, despite indicators like a Summary Recommendation of 0.33 and a Moving Average Recommendation of 0.67 suggesting caution. The Awesome Oscillator at 1.60 and Momentum Indicator at 2.90, along with an RSI near 64.87, indicate that while buyers are active, momentum is mixed. Traders might consider positions within these key levels, weighing short-term gains against mid-term risks in a market that, though currently bullish, lacks a clear trend direction. Uptrend Shift Amid Long-Term Setback dYdX prices experienced a dramatic swing recently. A rise of 27.60% over the past month, along with a weekly gain of 13.82%, contrasts with a six-month decline of 55.38%. The sharp increases indicate a brief surge in demand, although long-term performance shows significant downward pressure. Shorter timeframes show promising momentum, yet the longer view reflects caution and the need for careful position sizing. Current price action is focused on clearly defined support and resistance levels. Immediate support lies at $0.32, with another level at $0.12, while key resistance points are at $0.72 and $0.91. Indicators show that bulls have gained control, supported by positive momentum and renewed buying interest. However, an RSI of 68.122 suggests potential market saturation. Traders may consider long positions near support while watching for bearish signals, especially if resistance at $0.72 is not breached, allowing for short-term tactical opportunities. Conclusion The recent surge in trading volumes for INJ and DYDX highlights a growing interest in advanced decentralized exchange platforms. Both coins are showing potential to capture a significant share of the derivatives market. This growth suggests a shift towards more sophisticated trading options.

According to market analyst Crypto Ninja, ‚ÄúIf XRP hits the same fib as the 2017 cycle, we will hit $23 by August 1st. This is not hype, this is just data. I‚Äôm not saying this will happen, I‚Äôm just saying it happened once before. Same setup! Same result?‚Äù Crypto Ninja notes that XRP‚Äôs 2017 bull cycle propelled it to the previous all-time high (ATH) of $3.40, and if history repeats, the current momentum could drive prices toward the $23 zone by August 2026. Therefore, XRP might be getting ready for a rollercoaster ride in the next year, having surged to new historic highs of $3.65 . Despite a pullback to $3.45, XRP remains up 33.7% this week, holding strong as the 3rd-largest cryptocurrency. The Valhalla Gate Key Comes Into Play Top analyst EGRAG CRYPTO claims XRP‚Äôs breakout to $3.65 is the Valhalla Gate Key, a critical trigger that could launch prices toward the $12‚Äì$23 range. The analyst pointed out , ‚Äú XRP ‚Äì $3.65 Is the Valhalla Gate Key (Mini $12 - Max $23). This is one of my favorite charts and it is my go-to MACRO chart for navigating XRP ‚Äôs next move.‚Äù Based on this analysis, he showcases a monthly XRP chart highlighting two cycle tops and three mid-cycle peaks aligned with the 9-period SMA. The chart reveals XRP typically forming both a cycle top and a mid-cycle top during each bull run, though on varying timelines. In Cycle 1, XRP peaked at $0.0614 in Dec 2013, corrected, then rebounded off the 9 SMA to reach a mid-cycle top of $0.0280 in Dec 2014. In Cycle 2, XRP hit a mid-cycle top of $0.3988 in May 2017 before a six-month retracement formed a bullish pennant. After retesting and bouncing off the 9 SMA, XRP surged to a cycle top of $3.80 in January 2018. EGRAG‚Äôs chart reveals that in Cycle 3, XRP hit a mid-cycle top of $3.40 in January 2025 before correcting after a November 2024 to January 2025 rally. Having hit the linchpin at $3.65, XRP might well be destined for greater heights with the $12‚Äì$23 range being in the picture, according to EGRAG CRYPTO. This analysis aligns with Crypto Ninja‚Äôs prediction that $23 might be in the offing if XRP follows in the footsteps of its 2017 bull cycle. Why XRP Is Leading the Altcoin Rally Trading volume soared over $12‚ÄØbillion, with futures open interest near $10‚ÄØbillion, signaling institutional-level participation. Whale data shows major holders adding to positions, even as some profit-taking occurred, highlighting both strength and caution . Market sentiment is further buoyed by the launch of US XRP futures ETFs and chatter about leveraged XRP instruments. The XRP Ledger also recently surpassed 7.18 million wallets , underscoring growing adoption and strengthening institutional confidence in the ecosystem. As a result, analysts are forecasting continued gains, with optimistic targets up to $4.47‚Äì$5, depending on market conditions. Conclusion XRP is capitalizing on a rare convergence of fundamental breakthroughs, on-chain momentum, institutional flows, and regulatory alignment. It‚Äôs not just riding the broader crypto wave, it's flying ahead, powered by utility and narrative.

A recent announcement from South Korean crypto exchange Upbit has caught the attention of many investors, particularly those holding EGLD tokens. This isn‚Äôt just another routine update; it‚Äôs a critical heads-up about an upcoming temporary halt in services that could affect your trading strategies. Are you prepared for the changes coming to EGLD on Upbit? What‚Äôs Happening with Upbit EGLD Deposits and Withdrawals? Upbit, one of the leading digital asset exchanges, has officially communicated a temporary suspension of Upbit EGLD deposits and withdrawals. This crucial decision is set to take effect around 09:00 UTC on July 24 . The announcement, made via their official website, emphasizes that this is a temporary measure, but one that demands immediate attention from users. For those unfamiliar, EGLD is the native cryptocurrency of the MultiversX blockchain, formerly known as Elrond. This token facilitates transactions, smart contract execution, and network staking within the MultiversX ecosystem. When an exchange like Upbit decides to pause services for a specific asset, it‚Äôs typically for a significant underlying reason. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of the key details: Exchange: Upbit (South Korea) Affected Token: EGLD (MultiversX) Action: Temporary suspension of deposits and withdrawals Start Time: Approximately 09:00 UTC on July 24 Reason: Upcoming network upgrade for MultiversX It‚Äôs important to note that while deposits and withdrawals will be halted, trading of EGLD on Upbit is generally expected to continue as usual unless specified otherwise. However, users planning to move their EGLD in or out of the exchange around this date will need to adjust their plans accordingly. Why is the MultiversX Upgrade So Important? The primary driver behind Upbit‚Äôs decision is an impending MultiversX upgrade . Network upgrades are fundamental to the evolution and security of any blockchain. Think of it like a major software update for your computer or smartphone ‚Äì it brings new features, enhances performance, fixes bugs, and strengthens security protocols. MultiversX (formerly Elrond) is a highly scalable, secure, and decentralized blockchain network designed for the new internet economy, decentralized applications, and enterprise use. Its innovative sharding architecture aims to deliver high throughput and low transaction costs. For a network like MultiversX, upgrades are vital for: Enhanced Scalability: Improving the network‚Äôs ability to handle more transactions per second, reducing congestion. Security Enhancements: Patching vulnerabilities and implementing stronger cryptographic measures to protect user assets and data. New Features and Functionality: Introducing new capabilities for developers and users, fostering innovation within the ecosystem. Performance Optimization: Making the network faster and more efficient, leading to a smoother user experience. During such upgrades, the underlying blockchain infrastructure undergoes significant changes. To ensure the integrity of user funds and prevent any discrepancies, crypto exchanges temporarily halt deposit withdrawal services for the affected token. This allows them to synchronize their systems with the upgraded network, verify all transactions, and ensure a seamless transition once the upgrade is complete and the network is stable. Navigating Crypto Exchange Announcements: What Should You Do? In the dynamic world of digital assets, announcements from your preferred crypto exchange are a common occurrence. Knowing how to react to them is crucial for safeguarding your funds and managing your portfolio effectively. When an exchange like Upbit announces an EGLD suspension , here are some actionable steps you should consider: Verify the Source: Always confirm the announcement on the exchange‚Äôs official website or verified social media channels. Phishing attempts are common in crypto. Understand the ‚ÄòWhy‚Äô: Grasping the reason behind the suspension (e.g., network upgrade, fork, maintenance) helps you assess the duration and potential impact. Plan Your Transactions: If you intended to deposit or withdraw EGLD around July 24, make sure to complete those transactions well in advance of the announced suspension time or postpone them until services resume. Monitor Official Channels: Keep a close eye on Upbit‚Äôs announcements for updates on when services will resume. They will typically provide a follow-up notice. Assess Your Exposure: If a significant portion of your portfolio is in EGLD and you might need access to it, consider whether holding it on the exchange during the suspension aligns with your immediate needs. Being proactive rather than reactive is key. This particular Upbit EGLD update serves as a reminder to always be aware of the operational status of the assets you hold on exchanges. Beyond the EGLD Suspension: Broader Implications for Traders While an EGLD suspension might seem like a minor inconvenience, it‚Äôs part of a larger picture of how crypto exchanges manage asset integrity and user security. For traders, understanding these broader implications can provide an edge. Market Impact: In the short term, such suspensions can sometimes lead to minor price fluctuations as traders react to the news, but for scheduled network upgrades, the impact is often minimal unless the upgrade itself is controversial or introduces significant changes that affect tokenomics. Exchange Responsibility: Exchanges like Upbit bear a significant responsibility to ensure the smooth operation of digital asset trading. Halting deposit withdrawal services during a critical network upgrade is a standard security protocol. It prevents potential loss of funds due to incompatible transactions between the old and new network versions, and it ensures that all user balances are accurately reflected post-upgrade. Trust and Reliability: Timely and transparent communication from exchanges regarding such events builds trust with their user base. Upbit‚Äôs clear announcement about the MultiversX upgrade demonstrates their commitment to keeping users informed and their assets safe. It‚Äôs a testament to the continuous evolution of blockchain technology that these upgrades are necessary. While they may cause temporary interruptions, they ultimately contribute to a more robust, secure, and efficient decentralized future. Understanding Deposit Withdrawal Pauses: A Common Practice? Is an EGLD suspension for a network upgrade an isolated incident? Not at all. Temporary pauses in deposit withdrawal services are a common and necessary practice across all major crypto exchanges. These pauses are implemented for a variety of reasons, all aimed at protecting user assets and maintaining the integrity of the trading platform. Here‚Äôs a table outlining common reasons why exchanges might pause deposit and withdrawal services: Reason for Pause Explanation User Impact Network Upgrade / Hard Fork Blockchain protocol changes requiring synchronization to avoid compatibility issues. (e.g., MultiversX upgrade for EGLD) Temporary inability to move funds; trading often continues. Scheduled Maintenance Routine system checks, server upgrades, or security enhancements for the exchange‚Äôs infrastructure. Platform-wide or specific asset downtime; typically announced well in advance. Security Incidents / Hacks Response to a detected security breach or suspicious activity to prevent further loss of funds. Immediate halt of all services; can be prolonged until the issue is resolved. Wallet Maintenance Upgrading or re-indexing specific hot/cold wallets to ensure optimal performance and security. Affects only the specific token‚Äôs deposits/withdrawals. High Network Congestion Excessive transaction volume on the blockchain leading to slow confirmations and high fees. Temporary pause to prevent stuck transactions or overpaying fees. As you can see, the Upbit EGLD suspension falls under the most common and often least disruptive category: a network upgrade. This proactive measure ensures that when the MultiversX network is fully upgraded, Upbit‚Äôs systems are perfectly aligned, allowing for seamless and secure transactions once services resume. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Crypto User Given the frequent nature of these events, what can you do to be better prepared? Set Up Alerts: Many exchanges offer notification services for significant announcements. Utilize them. Diversify Holdings: While not always practical, having funds across multiple platforms or in a personal wallet can offer flexibility during exchange-specific events. Understand Your Assets: Know which blockchain your tokens operate on and be aware of their major roadmap events (e.g., upcoming upgrades, hard forks). Read the Fine Print: Always read official announcements thoroughly. They contain crucial details about timings and affected services. The temporary EGLD suspension by Upbit for the MultiversX upgrade is a prime example of how exchanges work to protect their users during critical blockchain developments. It‚Äôs a standard operational procedure that ensures the long-term health and security of the digital asset ecosystem. Conclusion: Staying Ahead in the Crypto Game The announcement from Upbit regarding the temporary EGLD suspension for deposits and withdrawals on July 24 is a clear signal to all users to prepare. This measure, driven by the essential MultiversX upgrade , highlights the dynamic nature of blockchain technology and the proactive role played by leading platforms like Upbit in ensuring asset security and operational integrity. While a temporary halt in deposit withdrawal services might cause minor adjustments to your plans, it is ultimately a beneficial step for the long-term health and efficiency of the EGLD network. Staying informed through official channels and understanding the reasons behind such actions will empower you to navigate the exciting, yet ever-evolving, world of cryptocurrency with confidence.

In Taipei, Vice President Hsiao‚ÄØBi‚Äëkhim acknowledged that talks between state authorities and private-sector players had been tough, as mentioned in a Bloomberg report. When asked about the blacklist of Chinese chip makers, she said, ‚ÄúThis has been a very challenging conversation between governments and private businesses,‚Äù and added, ‚ÄúBut we have generally aligned in understanding that ultimately, export control is to ensure that technology innovated, developed, and produced in Taiwan, is not used to compromise our security or to harm the safety and security of the Taiwanese people.‚Äù She noted Taiwan will coordinate with foreign partners to defend values central to its society. Government sources have stressed these measures form part of ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. In June, Taipei added Huawei Technologies Co . and its fabrication partner SMIC to its restricted‚Äëentities list. Officials said the move aims to stop weapons from spreading and reduce other security threats. Under the updated regulations, local suppliers must obtain government authorization before engaging with any organization on the strategic high‚Äëtech commodities list. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that a number of Taiwanese vendors were helping Huawei establish chip‚Äëmanufacturing sites in southern China, territory Beijing claims and has threatened to seize if peaceful reunification fails. Chinese cyber threats targeted Taiwan‚Äôs chip sector At the same time, Reuters reported, researchers at Proofpoint cautioned on Wednesday that China‚Äëaligned hacking groups have intensified campaigns to infiltrate Taiwan‚Äôs semiconductor sector and the analysts who cover it. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen entities that we hadn‚Äôt ever seen being targeted in the past being targeted,‚Äù said Mark‚ÄØKelly, a threat researcher specializing in China‚Äërelated cyber operations. Proofpoint traced at least three separate China‚Äëlinked groups running campaigns between March and June, and warned some may still be active. These attacks happened as the U.S. tightened limits on American‚Äëdesigned chips going to China, and as China scrambled to replace its shrinking stock of advanced U.S. parts, especially for AI. Although they declined to name specific victims, the analysts told Reuters that roughly 15‚Äì20 organizations, including small local suppliers, banking analysts in the U.S., and large multinationals, had been targeted. Major Taiwanese foundries such as TSMC, MediaTek, UMC, Nanya Technology, and RealTek were contacted.¬†It remains unknown whether any breaches succeeded. In May, Taiwan‚Äôs AI exports jumped 38.6% year‚Äëon‚Äëyear to $51.74‚ÄØbillion. That was the fastest pace in nearly 15‚ÄØyears and the first time exports exceeded $50‚ÄØbillion, the finance ministry said. Exports rose for the 19th month in a row, beating the 25% increase economists expected and April‚Äôs 29.9% rise. Companies like TSMC, the world‚Äôs biggest contract chipmaker, supply Nvidia, Apple and other major tech firms. The ministry said strong AI demand and buyers ordering early to avoid possible U.S. tariffs helped boost May exports.

In a recent X post, BarriC charted an ambitious path for XRP: a climb to $4, a surge to the $10‚Äì$20 range, and ultimately a parabolic rise toward $100 and even $1,000. While his forecast has captured the imagination of many investors, it has also reignited debates over the realism of such targets. XRP Approaches Critical Milestone XRP is currently trading around $3.43, having reached an intraday high of $3.65, fueled by renewed bullish sentiment and rising market participation. The token has gained significant ground over the past week, breaking key resistance levels and entering price territory not seen in years. BarriC‚Äôs forecast hinges on XRP decisively breaking the psychological $4 mark, a move he argues would confirm the start of a multi-stage rally. According to BarriC, once XRP enters the $4 range, momentum will carry it swiftly into double-digit territory, between $10 and $20. He attributes this expected rise to increased utility, growing institutional interest, and a coming shift in global finance where XRP will play a key role in cross-border payments and liquidity management. $XRP is about to hit $4 Then $XRP will skyrocket into double digits $10-$20 Then It‚Äôs a clear path for #XRP to skyrocket beyond $100 towards $1,000 ‚Äî BarriC (@B_arri_C) July 18, 2025 Triple-Digit XRP: Vision or Fantasy? BarriC doesn‚Äôt stop at $20. He claims that once XRP proves its utility at scale, the floodgates will open, propelling the token to $100 and eventually toward the $1,000 mark. His outlook is based on the premise that XRP will become a foundational layer in a new financial system, facilitating trillions in cross-border value transfers. This narrative aligns with broader enthusiasm about Ripple‚Äôs enterprise partnerships and the growing legitimacy of digital assets following pro-crypto r egulatory milestones like the GENIUS Act. Still, BarriC‚Äôs call for $100‚Äì$1,000 XRP is far from universally accepted. Skepticism Among Analysts While some traders share a cautiously bullish outlook, many analysts remain skeptical of triple-digit XRP price predictions. Critics argue that reaching $100 would require XRP‚Äôs market cap to exceed $5 trillion, more than double that of Apple or Microsoft. They caution that such valuations are unrealistic without unprecedented global adoption and regulation. Veteran traders like Javon Marks suggest that XRP could plausibly reach $15‚Äì$20 in the current cycle, especially if bullish momentum holds and institutional inflows increase. However, most agree that $100 remains a long-term aspiration, not an imminent milestone. Others have been even more blunt in their criticism, with some describing $100 forecasts as ‚Äúdelusional‚Äù given the current market structure, token distribution, and regulatory headwinds still facing the digital asset space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Where XRP Stands Now From a technical perspective, XRP has shown strength in recent weeks, breaking out of long-term resistance and establishing higher support levels. Analysts highlight $3.00 and $2.65 as near-term support zones, while $4.00‚Äì$4.20 remains the next key resistance. A clean break above this range could open the door to $5 and beyond, giving more weight to the early phases of BarriC‚Äôs prediction. However, the path to triple-digit XRP is littered with obstacles, from macroeconomic uncertainty to the pace of institutional adoption. Still, in a market often driven as much by belief as by fundamentals, bold predictions like BarriC‚Äôs have the power to shape sentiment and stir momentum. BarriC‚Äôs assertion that XRP is heading for $100, and even $1,000, paints a compelling, if controversial, vision for the token‚Äôs future. While the technical and fundamental arguments for a continued rally are strong, the leap to triple digits remains highly speculative. Nonetheless, XRP‚Äôs recent surge, coupled with shifting regulatory winds and expanding utility, means the token could be entering one of the most pivotal phases of its history. Whether or not it fulfills BarriC‚Äôs vision, the road ahead promises to be anything but dull. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Over the last three days, the whale operating from a Bitcoin address ending in ‚Äúf4au0‚Äù has been systematically disposing of its cryptocurrency reserves. Most notably, on July 15, intelligence data from Arkham, spotted by EmberCN, showed that a whale from the Satoshi era executed a transfer of 40,000 BTC, with 18,343 BTC valued at $2.172 billion being directed to Galaxy Digital, a platform that provides over-the-counter (OTC) Bitcoin trading services.

The recent transaction has now completed the full liquidation of the 80,000+ Bitcoin holdings, which Arkham confirms have been entirely sent to exchanges. When originally acquired fourteen years ago, these Bitcoins were valued at merely $132,000, equating to approximately $1.64 per coin. This investment has delivered the whale an extraordinary 72,000-fold return. It‚Äôs worth noting that Bitcoin began with zero value when Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper in 2009. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs price subsequently rose from its sustained $0.10 level to $0.20 on October 26, 2010. Source: Investopedia During 2011, BTC began climbing above $1, ultimately reaching a high of $29.60 on June 8, 2011. The whale likely accumulated their Bitcoin position between February and April 2011. This transaction exemplifies the effectiveness of the popular cryptocurrency strategy ‚ÄúHODL,‚Äù which advocates maintaining investment positions despite market volatility. This contrasts sharply with the German Government, which many criticized for ‚Äúpaper handing‚Äù $3.51 billion after selling 54,000 BTC when Bitcoin traded around $58,000 in 2024. Additionally, this isn‚Äôt the first instance of dormant Bitcoin whales becoming active, particularly during bullish market phases. Last year at this time, a wallet connected to a Bitcoin miner who earned 50 BTC as a mining reward on July 14, 2010, just months following the Bitcoin network‚Äôs launch, also transferred their complete Bitcoin holdings to the Binance exchange. The miner generated over $3 million in profits from coins that were previously worth fractions of a penny. 1.75M Satoshi-era Wallets Still Hold $121B in Bitcoin A Fortune report indicates that approximately 1.75 million Bitcoin wallets have remained dormant for over ten years. These wallets collectively contain 1,798,681 BTC, representing approximately $121 billion in value. Source: Fortune Notably, the sudden reactivation of inactive wallets often generates speculation that Bitcoin whales may be preparing to liquidate substantial portions of their holdings, which can result in increased Bitcoin price volatility. For instance, during the previous occasion when the ‚Äúf4au0‚Äù Bitcoin whale disposed of their holdings , approximately $236 million was deposited directly to exchanges, including Binance and Bybit, indicating that portions of the position were likely being prepared for sale. Currently, it appears the selling pressure on Bitcoin has temporarily stalled price momentum. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $118,606, down 0.8% during the early trading hours of Friday. CoinGlass data reveals that traders continue to short Bitcoin, establishing a significant liquidation barrier at $121,500. However, analysts maintain that the bull run remains far from over, particularly with the emerging altcoin season, which has seen XRP establish new all-time highs above $3.7 and Ethereum break through its six-month resistance level of $3,500 . The total crypto market cap is rapidly approaching the $4 trillion mark, propelled by strong gains in Bitcoin, Ether, XRP. #Crypto #Trump https://t.co/xp4hohXxhE ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) July 18, 2025 Regarding Bitcoin, technical analysis suggests that surpassing the $121,000 resistance level could open the path for Bitcoin to advance toward $132,000.

To support this claim, analysis from sources dated July 17 reveals that TASE soared more than 200% compared with the outcome released in October 2023. In 2023, Israel‚Äôs Gross Domestic Product (GDP) decreased by around 20% due to reduced investments and consumer spending in the face of the devastating war. However, in 2024, the outcome started taking an impressive turn, recording a 2% moderate growth and GDP growth of 1%. The government had increased its spending, playing a crucial role in this growth. Following this tremendous success, the OECD has anticipated a 4.9% economic boom in the country in 2026. Another significant achievement Israel experienced in 2024 was 161,000 new trading accounts created in the country‚Äôs capital market, based on a report released on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange website this month. These trading accounts were triple the number of accounts opened in 2023. TASE reports also highlighted that 87,000 new trading accounts were opened in 2025. About 33,000 of them were located in investment companies. The only way to go was up for Israel after disruptions In the report, Hadar Romano, a Data & Information Services Manager at TASE, stated that 2023 came with several uncertainties. She then highlighted that by 2024, they noticed some changes, which included more people getting involved in the capital market. Romano added that the individuals opened trading accounts while considering the low prices displayed in TASE‚Äôs indices. Based on her argument, these enabled them to access the local capital market easily, and are also the factor that drove trading volumes to high levels. Avi Hasson, Startup Nation Central CEO in Israel, commented on the situation. He highlighted several factors behind the increased market sentiment in the country. According to Hasson, global investors have shifted their focus to Israel following the events in the past 22 months. They speculated that the risks around the country‚Äôs security and economy had reduced, he explained. Hasson emphasizes the role of the tech sector in Israel‚Äôs economy With these positive outcomes in its economy, Israel has undermined its enemy‚Äôs strength, mostly Hezbollah in Lebanon. US intervention heavily swayed the balance of power in the Israel-Iran conflict . Hasson noted that Israel‚Äôs tech market, employing various energy skills, its increasing population, and new startups have attracted international investors and firms. He continued that they considered the Middle East‚Äôs future, not the current situation. The CEO emphasized Israel‚Äôs technology sector as the main factor behind its economic success. He highlighted that around 20% of Israel‚Äôs GDP and 56% of its exports come from advanced tech goods and services. The country‚Äôs government support for experimentation and development has been the primary factor behind this achievement.

PEPE is now up by 8% in a week and by 41% in the past fortnight, although it can boast only a modest 15% increase in the past year. Yet its chart and indicators suggest that its current rally still has space for further gains in the coming days, and that PEPE could hit $0.000020 again soon. And in the longer term, a sustained bull market could see it return to its ATH by the end of the year, following in the footsteps of over major tokens. Pepe Price Prediction: Is PEPE Going To Follow XRP And Hit a New ATH In July 2025? As we see from its chart, PEPE is probably about halfway through a breakout, with its indicators on course to hit overbought positions in the coming days. Most notably, its relative strength index (yellow) has just touched 70, indicating increased buying pressure that could fade if and when the indicator hits 80. Source: TradingView What‚Äôs particularly bullish about the current moment is that PEPE‚Äôs MACD indicator (orange, blue) has only recently climbed to a positive level, and it still hasn‚Äôt reached the heights of previous peaks. This supports the notion that the current PEPE rally still has time left before it might confront a significant correction. And we can see that some whales and high-profile traders have begun betting big on PEPE, with prominent leveraged trader James Wynn going long on the meme coin with 10x leverage this week.

Clearly, demand has returned to the coin in a big way, which again supports the notion that its current rally still has quite a bit of steam left in it. With regards to the longer term, this will depend on the trajectory of the wider crypto market, which at the moment looks like it has entered a bull phase. If the bull market can continue, there‚Äôs no reason why the PEPE price can‚Äôt hit $0.000020, $0.000025 and $0.000030 in the coming months. Of course, its status as a meme coin with no fundamentals puts it at risk of sudden dumps, particularly if whales lose interest in it. But so far there‚Äôs no real evidence that whales will abandon it anytime soon, so we can expect it to close out 2025 in style. New Dot-Com Meme Coin TOKEN6900 Raises $600,000 in Presale: Is This the Next Pepe? Pepe remains one of the biggest meme coins in the market, but we could see several newer tokens challenge its status in the near future. Probably the newest of its potential challengers is TOKEN6900 (T6900), an ERC-20 coin that launched its presale a few weeks ago. num-num number go up pic.twitter.com/Kr4njYq2Dn ‚Äî Token6900 (@Token_6900) July 17, 2025 It has already raised just over $680,000 in this sale, with its viral use of dot-com memes serving to attract lots of attention. This puts it in the same bracket, for example, as SPX6900, which has also emerged recently, and which also riffs on nostalgia for the dot-com bubble. In this vein, TOKEN6900 has made a point of promising no fundamentals and no utility, instead emphasizing the FOMO element in what it does. It aims to create hype and social contagion, with the coin currently building a community of followers who could help support its price going forward. As a token, it will have a total supply of 930,993,091 tokens, with holders able to stake T6900 to earn themselves a regular income. Its sale won‚Äôt run for long, but investors can join it now by going to the TOKEN6900 website and connecting a compatible wallet. At the moment, T6900 is selling for $0.006625, but this will rise again in just under two days.

Yet FUNToken‚Äôs recent rally has stood out because it is not simply the result of rumors or paid campaigns. The sustained price appreciation reflects a combination of verifiable ecosystem growth, transparent deflationary mechanics, and deliberate product delivery that together have fueled genuine investor confidence. Today, FUNToken trades around $0.01098, with daily trading volumes exceeding $60 million and a market capitalization estimated near $120 million. This valuation is a significant milestone for a project that began as an experimental gaming utility token and has evolved into a credible ecosystem with clear adoption metrics. This article unpacks why FUNToken‚Äôs recent price movement is grounded in substance rather than speculation, and how each piece of the strategy reinforces a sustainable growth narrative. Not just noise: Why FunToken‚Äôs price spike reflects real-world ecosystem traction A defining feature of FUNToken‚Äôs model is its quarterly burn mechanism funded directly by platform revenue. On June 24, 2025, the project executed its largest burn to date, removing 25 million FUN from circulation. This burn reduced supply by approximately 0.23 percent, but more importantly, demonstrated that user engagement and platform traction are driving measurable scarcity. The significance of this event cannot be overstated. Many tokens promise deflationary supply but ultimately rely on treasuries or premined reserves to create artificial scarcity. FUNToken, in contrast, ties every burn to revenue generated through actual user activity. This model delivers a powerful message: as more people participate in the ecosystem, the circulating supply shrinks in a predictable, transparent way. Every burn is conducted on-chain and verifiable in real time. This is a critical safeguard in a market where trust is hard-won and easily lost. Telegram AI Bot as a Gateway to Daily Use One of the most underestimated contributors to FUNToken‚Äôs traction has been its AI-powered Telegram bot . For many Web2 users, Telegram is already a familiar environment. By embedding token earning and engagement mechanics inside the chat interface, FUNToken has lowered the barrier to entry for newcomers who may have never used a decentralized wallet before. These engagement numbers are not only vanity metrics. They drive transaction volume, expand the holder base, and generate platform revenue that ultimately funds future burns. In other words, the same behaviors that bring new users in also reinforce the deflationary economics supporting price appreciation. Roadmap Milestones That Anchor Expectations Speculative price spikes often fade quickly when investors realize there is no substance behind the surge. FUNToken has avoided this trap by pairing each product launch and feature rollout with clear, time-bound roadmap commitments. Some of the most important milestones shaping market confidence include: Q3 to Q4 2025: The launch of the FUNToken mobile wallet on iOS and Android, complete with staking features and simplified token swaps inside a single app Q4 2025: The introduction of over free-to-play gaming titles designed to generate recurring transaction volume and organic demand. On top of that, community-driven quests and external partnerships with mid-size game developers Q1 2026: The target of expanding to 40 games, and adding multiple features to FUN Wallet like fiat on-ramps and multi-chain support, signaling that the user base is scaling well beyond the initial early adopters CertiK Audit as a Trust Anchor In a market saturated with promises, independent validation sets projects apart. FUNToken‚Äôs decision to complete a comprehensive CertiK audit and integrate CertiK Skynet monitoring is a major reason the recent rally has been met with optimism rather than skepticism. The audit confirmed that FUNToken‚Äôs smart contract is immutable. There are no hidden minting functions and no administrative loopholes that could compromise supply integrity. Every burn is final. Every token movement is verifiable. CertiK Skynet adds a real-time monitoring layer that flags suspicious activity and ensures contract health is visible to the entire community. This transparency reinforces trust, particularly among institutional participants and larger holders who expect rigorous safeguards. For Web3 users who have seen countless projects dilute supply or change terms after launch, CertiK‚Äôs oversight is a critical differentiator. Price Performance That Reflects Utility FUNToken‚Äôs climb from around $0.0045 in late June to the current price near $0.0104 has not happened in isolation. The surge aligns with several observable drivers: The 25 million token burn was the catalyst, demonstrating that the team was executing on its deflationary promise. Engagement through the Telegram AI bot increased substantially, driving new wallets and expanding demand. The announcement of the Q3‚ÄìQ4 2025 wallet launch reassured the community that roadmap commitments are on track. CertiK‚Äôs audit results and Skynet monitoring reduced perceived risk for participants evaluating longer-term positions Together, these factors have created an environment where price appreciation is tied to real-world traction rather than speculative hype. A Model Consistent With Web3 Ideals Web3 has always prioritized principles like transparency, user ownership, and provable scarcity. FUNToken‚Äôs recent performance underscores that the project is aligned with these ideals rather than chasing short-term gains. Scarcity is not manufactured through vague supply adjustments but enforced through on-chain burns funded by revenue. Engagement is not created through airdrops but driven by a familiar, gamified experience that appeals to Web2 users. Security is not simply claimed but verified through independent audits and live contract monitoring. This combination has given the project credibility and staying power. As more users experience the ecosystem firsthand, the foundational mechanics reinforce the perception that the price is supported by adoption, not hype. Conclusion In a market where many tokens rise and fall on rumors alone, FUNToken‚Äôs recent rally stands out as a credible example of how real-world traction can drive sustainable price growth. From the transparent execution of its largest-ever burn to the clear roadmap milestones and a vibrant community engaging daily with the AI-powered Telegram bot, every piece of the story is verifiable. Whether you are an experienced Web3 participant or a newcomer curious about gaming-based digital economies, FUNToken‚Äôs trajectory is a reminder that scarcity, transparency, and engagement can still drive meaningful value in crypto.

One of the most significant trends in recent years has been the rise of stablecoins ‚Äì digital assets designed to maintain a stable value, often pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. They act as a crucial bridge between the volatile world of cryptocurrencies and the stability of traditional finance. Now, an exciting announcement has emerged from the Qtum ecosystem, signaling a major step forward for the network and the broader decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape. Patrick Dai , the visionary founder of Qtum, recently took to X (formerly Twitter) to reveal ambitious plans for the launch of a native Qtum stablecoin . This move is not just another token launch; it represents a strategic enhancement designed to bolster liquidity, utility, and adoption within the Qtum network, pushing the boundaries of blockchain innovation and strengthening the overall crypto ecosystem . Unveiling the Qtum Stablecoin: What Does It Mean for the Network? The news of a native Qtum stablecoin has sent ripples of anticipation through the community. But what exactly does this mean for the Qtum network and its users? At its core, a stablecoin aims to mitigate the notorious price volatility associated with cryptocurrencies. By pegging its value to a more stable asset, it provides a reliable medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account within the blockchain environment. For Qtum, the introduction of its own stablecoin could unlock a myriad of possibilities, addressing several key needs: Enhanced Liquidity: A native stablecoin can significantly boost liquidity for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and other DeFi protocols built on Qtum, making trading more efficient and less prone to slippage. Predictable Transactions: For users and businesses conducting transactions, a stablecoin offers predictability, removing the risk of value fluctuations between the start and end of a payment. New dApp Opportunities: Developers can leverage the stability of the new Qtum stablecoin to build more robust and user-friendly decentralized applications (dApps) for lending, borrowing, payments, and even complex financial instruments. Reduced Friction: Currently, users often rely on stablecoins from other chains (e.g., USDT, USDC) bridged to Qtum, which can introduce additional fees and complexities. A native stablecoin simplifies the user experience. This development is a clear signal of Qtum‚Äôs commitment to building a self-sufficient and thriving DeFi ecosystem, ensuring that its users have access to stable financial tools directly on their preferred network. Patrick Dai‚Äôs Vision: Driving Blockchain Innovation on Qtum Behind every significant blockchain development is a driving force, and for Qtum, that force is its founder, Patrick Dai . Known for his foresight and dedication to pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in the decentralized space, Dai‚Äôs announcement of the Qtum stablecoin is a testament to his ongoing commitment to blockchain innovation . From its inception, Qtum was designed as a hybrid blockchain, combining the robust security of Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO model with the smart contract capabilities of Ethereum‚Äôs EVM. This unique architecture has allowed Qtum to carve out a distinct niche in the crowded crypto landscape. Dai‚Äôs vision extends beyond simply providing a platform for smart contracts; he aims to create a truly decentralized, scalable, and user-friendly blockchain that can support real-world applications. The stablecoin fits perfectly into this grander scheme. It‚Äôs a foundational layer that enables more sophisticated financial services, making the network more appealing to both developers looking to build next-generation dApps and users seeking practical blockchain solutions. This strategic move by Patrick Dai reinforces Qtum‚Äôs position as a forward-thinking project continually adapting to the evolving needs of the crypto ecosystem . Empowering Decentralized Finance: How Qtum‚Äôs Stablecoin Can Reshape DeFi The emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi) has revolutionized traditional financial services, offering permissionless, transparent, and censorship-resistant alternatives. However, the inherent volatility of most cryptocurrencies has been a significant barrier to mainstream DeFi adoption. This is where stablecoins play a pivotal role, and Qtum‚Äôs entry into this space with its own native stablecoin holds immense potential to reshape its DeFi landscape. Consider the current state of DeFi on Qtum. While the network supports smart contracts, the absence of a deeply integrated, highly liquid native stablecoin limits the scope and efficiency of financial protocols. With the new Qtum stablecoin , we can anticipate: Robust Lending and Borrowing: Users can confidently lend and borrow stable assets without worrying about sudden price crashes affecting their collateral or loan value. Efficient Yield Farming: Providing liquidity to stablecoin pairs will become more attractive, offering more predictable returns for yield farmers. Seamless Payments and Remittances: The stablecoin can facilitate low-cost, near-instant cross-border payments and remittances, making it a viable alternative to traditional banking rails. Gateway for Institutional Adoption: Institutions often seek stability. A reliable native stablecoin could pave the way for greater institutional interest and investment in Qtum‚Äôs DeFi protocols. By providing this essential building block, Qtum is not just participating in decentralized finance ; it‚Äôs actively empowering it, aiming to foster an environment where financial innovation can truly flourish on its network. Beyond the Stablecoin: Qtum‚Äôs Broader Blockchain Innovation Landscape While the Qtum stablecoin is a significant step, it‚Äôs important to view it within the broader context of Qtum‚Äôs ongoing commitment to blockchain innovation . Qtum has always prided itself on its unique technological foundation. Its hybrid architecture, combining Bitcoin‚Äôs UTXO model with Ethereum‚Äôs EVM, offers a compelling blend of security, scalability, and flexibility. Furthermore, Qtum has been at the forefront of implementing features like Account Abstraction, which aims to make blockchain interactions more user-friendly and secure by allowing for customizable transaction logic. The stablecoin launch complements these existing innovations by providing the financial stability necessary for real-world utility. Imagine a scenario where enterprises can build supply chain solutions on Qtum, using the stablecoin for payments and settlements, leveraging the network‚Äôs robust security and smart contract capabilities. Or consider the potential for gaming dApps, where in-game economies can utilize the stablecoin for predictable value, enhancing the player experience. Qtum‚Äôs dedication to continuous improvement, including research into scalability solutions like sharding and advancements in its Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, positions it as a leader in the race for true blockchain adoption. The stablecoin is not an isolated event but a strategic piece in Qtum‚Äôs larger puzzle of creating a comprehensive and resilient blockchain infrastructure that can stand the test of time and support the diverse needs of the evolving crypto ecosystem . The Ripple Effect: How Qtum‚Äôs Stablecoin Impacts the Wider Crypto Ecosystem The introduction of a new, well-supported stablecoin by a prominent network like Qtum doesn‚Äôt just affect its immediate ecosystem; it sends a ripple effect across the entire crypto ecosystem . Stablecoins are increasingly seen as the backbone of decentralized finance, facilitating everything from trading to lending and payments. As more networks launch their native stablecoins, it contributes to a more diversified and robust stablecoin market, reducing reliance on a few dominant players. For the wider market, a successful Qtum stablecoin could: Increase Interoperability: As the stablecoin gains traction, it could become a valuable asset for cross-chain transfers and interoperable applications, connecting Qtum more deeply with other blockchain networks. Attract New Users: The promise of stability and utility can draw new users into the Qtum network who might be hesitant to engage with highly volatile cryptocurrencies. This expands the overall user base of the crypto space. Foster Competition and Innovation: Qtum‚Äôs move might encourage other Layer 1 blockchains to accelerate their own stablecoin initiatives or improve existing ones, leading to healthier competition and more rapid blockchain innovation across the board. Enhance Market Maturity: The proliferation of diverse and well-managed stablecoins signals a maturing market, moving beyond speculative trading towards practical, everyday financial applications. This strategic step by Patrick Dai and the Qtum team is a testament to their ambition not just for their own network but for their contribution to the broader adoption and utility of blockchain technology within the global financial landscape. Challenges and the Road Ahead While the prospect of a native Qtum stablecoin is exciting, the journey ahead will not be without its challenges. The stablecoin market is highly competitive, dominated by established players with significant liquidity and brand recognition. Qtum‚Äôs stablecoin will need to differentiate itself, perhaps through unique features, strong community support, or seamless integration with its existing dApps. Regulatory scrutiny on stablecoins is also intensifying globally. Ensuring compliance, transparency regarding reserves, and robust auditing will be paramount for the stablecoin‚Äôs long-term success and credibility. Furthermore, achieving widespread adoption will require continuous development, strong partnerships, and effective marketing efforts to educate users and developers about its benefits and use cases within the decentralized finance ecosystem. Despite these hurdles, the commitment from Patrick Dai and the Qtum team, coupled with the inherent advantages of a native stablecoin, positions this initiative for success. It represents a bold step towards a more stable, efficient, and user-friendly crypto ecosystem . A New Era for Qtum The announcement of a native Qtum stablecoin by founder Patrick Dai marks a pivotal moment for the network. It‚Äôs a strategic move that underscores Qtum‚Äôs unwavering commitment to blockchain innovation and its vision for a more robust and accessible decentralized finance landscape. By introducing stability and enhanced utility, this stablecoin has the potential to significantly expand Qtum‚Äôs reach, attract new users and developers, and solidify its position as a key player in the ever-evolving crypto ecosystem .

With this evolution comes an urgent, undeniable need for clear regulatory frameworks. A recent, significant statement from former U.S. SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins has ignited a fresh and crucial debate on stablecoin regulation , specifically regarding who should hold the reins of oversight for these increasingly vital digital currencies. His assertion, as reported by Odaily, that stablecoins fall squarely under the authority of banking regulators, marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing discussion about how best to integrate cryptocurrencies into the existing financial system. Why is SEC Stablecoins Oversight Being Questioned? Paul Atkins, a figure with a deep understanding of financial markets, having served as a Commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from 2002 to 2008, brings a wealth of experience to this discussion. His perspective on SEC stablecoins oversight is particularly noteworthy because the SEC has traditionally asserted jurisdiction over digital assets it deems to be securities. However, stablecoins, by their very design, often blur these lines. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are engineered to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, or to a basket of assets. This pegging mechanism, often backed by reserves, makes them resemble traditional financial instruments more than speculative investments. Atkins‚Äô argument suggests that the fundamental nature of stablecoins‚Äîtheir role as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and their reliance on reserves‚Äîaligns them more closely with traditional banking functions, such as demand deposits or money market funds. This perspective challenges the prevailing notion that the SEC, primarily focused on investor protection and securities markets, is the sole or even primary appropriate regulator for these assets. The implication is that stablecoins, particularly those backed by fiat currency, function less as an investment contract (a security) and more as a digital form of money, thus necessitating oversight from entities familiar with managing systemic financial risks and ensuring monetary stability. The Argument for Banking Regulators Crypto Control The core of Atkins‚Äô position is rooted in the unique characteristics of stablecoins and the established expertise of banking regulators. When considering banking regulators crypto oversight, several compelling arguments emerge: Financial Stability: Banking regulators, such as the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state banking departments, are primarily responsible for ensuring the stability and soundness of the financial system. Stablecoins, especially large ones, could pose systemic risks if their reserves are mismanaged or if they experience a ‚Äòrun‚Äô similar to a bank run. These regulators possess the tools and experience to manage such risks, including capital requirements, liquidity rules, and stress testing. Consumer Protection: Traditional banking oversight includes robust frameworks for consumer protection, such as deposit insurance (FDIC), anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, and consumer complaint mechanisms. If stablecoins are viewed as a form of digital money, then similar protections would be vital for users. Banking regulators are well-versed in enforcing these safeguards. Reserve Management: A key aspect of stablecoins is their backing by reserves. Banking regulators have extensive experience in overseeing the management of reserves for banks and other financial institutions, ensuring transparency, auditing, and proper asset allocation. This expertise is directly applicable to ensuring the integrity and solvency of stablecoin issuers. Payments System Integration: Stablecoins are increasingly used for payments and remittances. Banking regulators, in collaboration with central banks, oversee the national and international payments infrastructure. Their involvement could facilitate safer and more efficient integration of stablecoins into the broader financial payments ecosystem. This perspective posits that while the SEC‚Äôs role in regulating investment products is crucial, the specific risks and functionalities of stablecoins might be better addressed by agencies whose mandate is centered on financial intermediation and systemic risk. Navigating the Complexities of Digital Asset Oversight The regulatory landscape for digital asset oversight in the United States is notoriously complex and often fragmented. Multiple agencies currently assert or seek jurisdiction over various aspects of the crypto market, leading to a patchwork of rules and sometimes conflicting guidance. This environment creates significant challenges for innovators, investors, and consumers alike. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the key players and their traditional roles: Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): Focuses on securities markets, aiming to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets. It applies the ‚ÄòHowey Test‚Äô to determine if an asset is an investment contract. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC): Regulates commodity markets, including derivatives. It views Bitcoin and Ethereum as commodities. Treasury Department (FinCEN): Primarily concerned with anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) regulations. Federal Reserve: Oversees banks, monetary policy, and the payments system. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC): Charters, regulates, and supervises all national banks and federal savings associations. The challenge for stablecoins is that they can exhibit characteristics that touch upon the mandates of several of these agencies. Are they a security? A commodity? A payment instrument? A banking product? Atkins‚Äô statement pushes for a clearer categorization that would assign primary responsibility to banking regulators, potentially streamlining the approach to digital asset oversight for this specific class of crypto assets. Shaping US Crypto Policy : What‚Äôs Next for Stablecoins? The debate surrounding stablecoin regulation is not merely academic; it has profound implications for the future direction of US crypto policy and the broader global digital economy. Atkins‚Äô intervention adds a significant voice to a growing chorus advocating for a tailored regulatory approach for stablecoins, distinct from that applied to other cryptocurrencies. A shift towards banking regulator oversight for stablecoins could lead to several potential outcomes: Increased Legitimacy and Adoption: Clear, robust regulation by established financial authorities could instill greater confidence among institutional investors and traditional financial firms, potentially leading to wider adoption of stablecoins for payments, settlements, and other financial activities. Stricter Compliance Requirements: Stablecoin issuers would likely face more stringent requirements concerning capital reserves, liquidity, risk management, and consumer protection, mirroring those applied to traditional banks. This could increase operational costs but also enhance stability. Potential for Innovation Constraints: While beneficial for stability, overly prescriptive banking regulations could, in some views, stifle innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, which often leverages stablecoins. Balancing innovation with risk management will be key. Inter-Agency Cooperation or Conflict: Such a shift would necessitate greater cooperation between the SEC, CFTC, and banking regulators to delineate their respective roles clearly, or it could exacerbate existing jurisdictional disputes. The U.S. Congress has also been actively considering legislation specifically for stablecoins, with various proposals attempting to define their legal status and assign regulatory authority. Atkins‚Äô comments reinforce the urgency and complexity of these legislative efforts, suggesting a path that prioritizes financial stability and consumer protection through existing banking frameworks. Benefits of Clear Stablecoin Oversight by Banking Regulators If banking regulators were to take the lead, the benefits could be substantial: Enhanced Financial Stability: Leveraging their expertise in systemic risk, banking regulators can implement robust frameworks to prevent ‚Äòruns‚Äô on stablecoins and ensure their backing assets are securely managed. Improved Consumer Confidence: With regulatory clarity and oversight, consumers can use stablecoins with greater assurance, knowing there are established protections in place, similar to those for traditional bank accounts. Streamlined Institutional Adoption: Financial institutions often require clear regulatory pathways before engaging with new technologies. A well-defined framework from banking regulators could accelerate the integration of stablecoins into mainstream finance. Reduced Regulatory Arbitrage: By clearly defining stablecoins under a specific regulatory umbrella, it minimizes the ability for issuers to choose jurisdictions based on the laxity of rules. Challenges and Considerations However, the path to clear stablecoin regulation is not without its hurdles: Defining ‚ÄòStablecoin‚Äô: Not all stablecoins are created equal. Some are fiat-backed, others crypto-backed, and some algorithmic. A nuanced approach is needed to avoid a one-size-fits-all regulation that could harm certain models. Jurisdictional Overlap: Even if banking regulators take the lead, aspects of stablecoins might still fall under the purview of the SEC (e.g., if they are part of a broader investment scheme) or CFTC (if used in derivatives). Innovation vs. Regulation: The crypto industry thrives on innovation. Overly restrictive regulations could stifle the development of new stablecoin use cases and technologies, potentially pushing innovation offshore. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community For participants in the crypto ecosystem, Atkins‚Äô statement serves as an important signal: For Stablecoin Issuers: Prepare for increased scrutiny on reserve management, transparency, and capital requirements. Engaging with banking regulators proactively could be beneficial. For Developers and DeFi Projects: Stay informed about evolving regulatory frameworks. Understanding the compliance landscape will be crucial for building sustainable applications that utilize stablecoins. For Users and Investors: Be aware that the regulatory environment for stablecoins is in flux. While increased oversight can bring stability, it also means adapting to new rules regarding how stablecoins can be used or held. In conclusion, Paul Atkins‚Äô call for banking regulators to oversee stablecoins represents a significant inflection point in the ongoing dialogue about how to effectively regulate digital assets. It highlights a growing consensus that stablecoins, due to their unique characteristics and potential systemic impact, may require a specialized regulatory approach that leverages the expertise of traditional financial overseers. While the path forward is complex and involves navigating intricate jurisdictional debates, the ultimate goal remains clear: fostering a secure, stable, and innovative environment for the future of digital finance. The evolution of US crypto policy around stablecoins will undoubtedly shape the landscape for digital assets for years to come. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What exactly are stablecoins? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility. They achieve this by pegging their value to a stable asset, most commonly a fiat currency like the U.S. dollar, but sometimes to commodities (like gold) or other cryptocurrencies. They act as a bridge between traditional finance and the crypto world, offering the stability of fiat currencies with the benefits of blockchain technology. 2. Why is the regulation of stablecoins so important? Regulation of stablecoins is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it addresses financial stability concerns, especially for large stablecoins, by ensuring their reserves are properly managed and transparent. Secondly, it protects consumers from potential fraud or mismanagement. Thirdly, clear regulation can foster greater adoption by institutions and businesses, integrating stablecoins more safely into the broader financial system. 3. What is the key difference between SEC oversight and banking regulator oversight for stablecoins? The SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) primarily focuses on investor protection and regulating securities, determining if an asset is an investment contract. Banking regulators (like the Federal Reserve or OCC) focus on the soundness and stability of financial institutions, systemic risk, and consumer protection related to deposits and payments. Atkins argues that stablecoins, functioning more like digital money, fall better under banking oversight due to their reserve-backed nature and potential systemic impact. 4. How might this shift in regulatory focus impact the broader crypto market? A shift towards banking regulator oversight for stablecoins could bring increased legitimacy and stability to the crypto market, potentially encouraging greater institutional adoption. However, it might also lead to stricter compliance requirements for stablecoin issuers, which could impact innovation, particularly in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. It would also clarify the regulatory status of a significant portion of the digital asset market. 5. What does this mean for average stablecoin users? For average stablecoin users, increased oversight by banking regulators could mean enhanced protection and greater confidence in the stability and reliability of the stablecoins they use. This might involve more robust reserve audits, clearer terms of service, and potentially mechanisms for dispute resolution or even some form of insurance, similar to traditional banking products.

Recently, a strong 15% intraday rally lifted the token to $19 recently, marking over 70% gains since the late-June ceasefire, and signaling an important turning point for the Chainlink ecosystem. LINK Price Gains Steam with SEC Task Force Entry In a recent rally, much of the recent strength in LINK price was fuelled by BTC rise and the announcement of a strategic partnership with Mastercard in early July. But in the recent week, the Chainlink crypto saw a boost in market sentiment as Chainlink co-founder Sergey Nazarov acknowledged the growing adoption of the project. He confirmed via his X post that the utility is boosting as major financial institutions like Westpac and Imperium Markets, further reinforcing LINK‚Äôs use case within real-world finance. In another pivotal development, Chainlink revealed its inclusion as one of five crypto projects to join the newly-formed U.S. SEC Crypto Task Force. Chainlink Labs joined the SEC Crypto Task Force along with @ERC3643Org , @EntEthAlliance , @Etherealize_io , and @lfdecentralized to discuss the need for standards enabling the compliant issuance and trading of tokenized assets at scale.

It also hints at its increasing influence on crypto policy shaping and infrastructure-level integration in U.S. financial systems. Moreover, the passing of the CLARITY and GENIUS Acts , aimed at improving regulatory transparency and innovation in crypto, also contributed to broader bullish momentum. Technical Indicators Signal Strong Accumulation, but Short-Term Cooldown Possible On the technical front, LINK price has reclaimed the 200-day EMA, with a golden cross now confirmed between the 20-day and 50-day EMAs. Bullish momentum is also backed by a golden cross seen in the MACD indicator, with the histogram reading 0.441. The Awesome Oscillator (AO) also supports the upside view, printing a value of 2.840, while the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) rose to 0.19 from 0.03, clearly signaling rising accumulation. Yet, while the indicators lean bullish, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows overbought conditions at 80.16. This raises the possibility of a temporary consolidation or pullback before LINK price resumes upward movement. LINK Price Chart Forms Multi-Year Ascending Wedge Technical chart patterns add further interest to the bullish narrative in Chainlink crypto.¬†The LINK price history suggests that its entire price action in the last couple of years occurred within a multi-year ascending broadening wedge, and its recent 25-day rally appears to stem from a bounce off the wedge‚Äôs lower boundary. If this pattern continues to play out, it could unlock upside levels above $28 and even approach $30. Prominent analyst Ali Martinez echoed this view, stating that LINK price is hovering just under the $18 resistance and a breakout could push it toward the $22‚Äì$28 range.

For users of South Korea‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, a significant development has just unfolded, marking a pivotal step forward in crypto compliance . Upbit has officially announced the integration of BDACS and Custella into its Travel Rule-compatible network, a move that directly impacts how users manage their virtual assets . This update, reflected in Upbit‚Äôs revised list of supported Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) published on July 18, means more seamless and compliant transactions for millions. Understanding the Travel Rule: Why It Matters for Your Virtual Assets Before diving into the specifics of Upbit‚Äôs announcement, let‚Äôs demystify the ‚ÄòTravel Rule‚Äô. Originating from traditional finance, this regulation was extended to cryptocurrencies by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) ‚Äì an intergovernmental organization that sets international standards to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. In essence, the Travel Rule mandates that virtual asset service providers (VASPs) like Upbit must collect and transmit specific information about the sender and receiver for transactions exceeding a certain threshold. Combating Illicit Finance: The primary goal is to prevent the misuse of cryptocurrencies for illegal activities such as money laundering, terrorism financing, and sanctions evasion. Enhancing Transparency: It brings a level of accountability to crypto transactions, similar to traditional bank transfers. Global Standard: While implementation varies, the FATF‚Äôs recommendations push for a globally harmonized approach to digital asset regulations . For users, this means that for transactions above a specified amount (in South Korea, it‚Äôs typically 1 million won or approximately $717), exchanges need to know who is sending and who is receiving the funds. This ensures a safer, more transparent ecosystem for everyone involved in South Korean crypto . Upbit‚Äôs Strategic Expansion: Strengthening the Upbit Travel Rule Network Upbit, a powerhouse in the South Korean crypto market, has consistently been at the forefront of regulatory compliance. Their latest move to add BDACS and Custella to their Travel Rule-compatible VASP list underscores this commitment. This isn‚Äôt just a minor update; it‚Äôs a strategic expansion that broadens the scope of compliant transactions available to Upbit users. Previously, sending or receiving virtual assets from platforms not integrated with Upbit‚Äôs Travel Rule solution could be cumbersome, often requiring manual verification processes or being restricted entirely for larger amounts. With BDACS and Custella now on board, the process becomes significantly smoother. Users can confidently deposit and withdraw virtual assets exceeding the 1 million won threshold, knowing their transactions are compliant with local regulations. What Does This Mean for Your Deposits and Withdrawals? The practical implications of this integration are straightforward and beneficial for Upbit users: Feature Before Integration After Integration (with BDACS/Custella) Virtual Asset Transfers > 1M Won Potentially restricted or required manual verification. Seamless deposits and withdrawals between Upbit and BDACS/Custella. Compliance Assurance Varies by platform; potential for non-compliance issues. Full Upbit Travel Rule compliance for linked transactions. User Experience Can be complex for larger transfers. Simplified and expedited process. This enhanced interoperability simplifies the user experience, making it easier for individuals and institutions to move their digital holdings across compliant platforms without unnecessary hurdles. It‚Äôs a clear win for convenience and regulatory peace of mind. The Broader Picture: Navigating Digital Asset Regulations in South Korea South Korea has emerged as a leader in establishing clear frameworks for digital asset regulations . The country‚Äôs financial regulators, including the Financial Services Commission (FSC) and its Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), have been proactive in implementing FATF guidelines, making crypto compliance a non-negotiable aspect of operating in the market. Upbit‚Äôs continuous efforts to expand its Travel Rule network are a direct response to, and a reflection of, this stringent regulatory environment. This proactive approach by exchanges like Upbit helps to: Foster Trust: A regulated environment builds confidence among retail and institutional investors. Prevent Market Manipulation: Stronger oversight can deter illicit activities that destabilize the market. Promote Innovation Responsibly: While regulating, South Korea aims to ensure that innovation in the blockchain and crypto space can still thrive within a secure and lawful framework. The integration of more VASPs into compliant networks is essential for the maturation of the crypto industry, transforming it from a niche, unregulated space into a legitimate component of the global financial system. What Are the Benefits of This Enhanced Crypto Compliance? Upbit‚Äôs latest move brings a multitude of benefits, extending beyond just the convenience of transactions: Increased Security for Users: By ensuring that funds are transferred between verified entities, the risk of scams and fraudulent activities is significantly reduced. This directly contributes to a safer environment for your virtual assets . Legitimacy and Trust: For the broader South Korean crypto market, such compliance efforts enhance its legitimacy in the eyes of traditional financial institutions and global regulators. This can pave the way for greater institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance. Reduced Regulatory Risk for Upbit: By proactively expanding its Travel Rule solution, Upbit reinforces its position as a compliant and responsible exchange, minimizing potential fines or operational restrictions from regulatory bodies. Improved Market Integrity: A robust Upbit Travel Rule implementation helps to maintain the integrity of the market by deterring illicit flows of funds, fostering a healthier trading environment. These benefits collectively contribute to a more stable and reliable cryptocurrency ecosystem, which is vital for long-term growth and widespread adoption. Challenges and the Road Ahead for Digital Asset Regulations While Upbit‚Äôs step is commendable, the journey towards fully seamless global crypto compliance is still ongoing. Challenges remain, particularly concerning the interoperability of different Travel Rule solutions across various jurisdictions and the delicate balance between compliance and user privacy. Different countries adopt different thresholds and reporting mechanisms, creating a complex web for international transactions. However, the trend is clear: regulators worldwide are pushing for greater transparency and accountability in the digital asset space. We can expect more integrations like Upbit‚Äôs, as exchanges strive to meet evolving digital asset regulations and facilitate a more interconnected yet compliant global crypto economy. The future will likely see further standardization and technological advancements to make Travel Rule compliance even more efficient and user-friendly. Actionable Insights for Navigating Compliant Crypto Exchanges For crypto enthusiasts and investors, staying informed about these regulatory shifts is key. Here are some actionable insights: Verify VASP Compatibility: Always check if the VASP you are sending funds to or receiving from is compatible with your primary exchange‚Äôs Travel Rule solution, especially for larger transactions. Understand Thresholds: Be aware of the local Travel Rule thresholds (like South Korea‚Äôs 1 million won) to anticipate when additional information might be required. Prioritize Compliant Platforms: Opt for exchanges like Upbit that actively embrace crypto compliance . This not only protects you but also contributes to the legitimacy of the entire industry. Keep Records: Maintain clear records of your transactions, especially those exceeding Travel Rule thresholds, for potential future reference or tax purposes. By taking these steps, you can ensure your engagement with virtual assets remains smooth, secure, and fully compliant. Conclusion: Upbit‚Äôs Forward-Thinking Approach to Crypto Compliance Upbit‚Äôs decision to integrate BDACS and Custella as Travel Rule-compatible platforms is more than just a technical update; it‚Äôs a significant statement about the evolving landscape of crypto compliance . This move enhances user experience by streamlining high-value transfers, reinforces Upbit‚Äôs commitment to regulatory standards, and contributes to the overall maturity and legitimacy of the South Korean crypto market. As the world of digital asset regulations continues to evolve, exchanges that proactively embrace and implement these measures will undoubtedly lead the way, fostering a safer, more transparent, and ultimately, more accessible future for virtual assets globally. This is a crucial step towards a more robust and trusted digital economy.

In the video, an AI-rendered version of Garlinghouse claimed Ripple was launching a ‚ÄúRipple Rewards program‚Äù with a 100 million XRP airdrop to thank supporters for the company‚Äôs legal win over the US Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Fake message says ‚Äòwe did this together‚Äô In the clip, Garlinghouse stated, ‚Äú Four years ago, we entered a battle we didn‚Äôt choose. But we fought and we won against the SEC.

He also shared a YouTube Short, where the real Garlinghouse educates viewers on the dangers of deepfake scams. The video reiterated that ‚ÄúRipple will never ask you to send XRP.‚Äù Obvious scam is obvious. ‚Äî David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) July 18, 2025 Scammers have been trying to steal tokens from investors since Ripple began its court battle with the SEC back in December 2020. They have been syncing with the company‚Äôs ‚Äúlegal victories‚Äù to stage deceptive campaigns. Each time Ripple won a court case against the SEC , several fake XRP airdrops or reward programs flooded social media, targeting unsuspecting investors. ‚ÄúA lot of scammers are taking advantage of the recent good news to try to cheat and steal. There are no airdrops, giveaways, or special offers associated with this ruling,‚Äù he said on X. In August 2024, Judge Torres ordered the company to pay a $125 million fine, a fraction of the $2 billion originally sought by the SEC. After that court ruling, scammers created fake giveaway schemes, forcing Ripple to warn its community again. ‚Äú And once again with Wednesday‚Äôs historic victory, we‚Äôve seen an uptick in scams. Please beware of scam ‚ÄòRipple‚Äô accounts, fake executive accounts or others promoting ‚ÄòXRP Giveaways‚Äô or ‚ÄòXRP Airdrops.‚Äô Ripple and its executives will NEVER ask you to send funds anywhere ,‚Äù the firm‚Äôs statement read. Fraudulent activity on XRPL On June 4, Panos Mekras, the co-founder of XRPL-based decentralized finance platform Anodos Finance, said on X that the network was experiencing an influx of low-effort scam projects. Mekras mentioned that projects that rush to launch tokens and hold presales without a working product or verifiable use case are more likely to be scams. ‚Äú Sceptical of any project launching a token and doing presales, especially if they don‚Äôt have a working product or anything to prove ,‚Äù he wrote. Ripple CTO David Schwartz supported his sentiments, asserting that open blockchain ecosystems are ‚Äúvulnerable to bad actors‚Äù. ‚Äú Mathematically, this almost has to be true of almost any open ecosystem. It‚Äôs just so much easier to create a scam than something real, ‚Äù he remarked.. Despite the deepfake controversy, XRP is trading at $3.43, up 4.8% in the past 24 hours. Market analytics show the token in the middle of a dense cluster of bid walls between $3.50 and $3.5746. If prices dip, these walls could slow or even reverse potential sell-offs.

While Bitcoin smashed past $123,000, XRP quietly broke its record, climbing to $3.66 for the first time in years. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs more interesting, XRP has outperformed Bitcoin by a massive 277% in the past year, and it did so without ETF approvals or big institutional boosts. Meanwhile, Experts believe this rally could be far from over, hinting at even bigger gains ahead. XRP Outpaces Bitcoin by 277% In the last 12 months, XRP has climbed 277% against Bitcoin, while Bitcoin rose about 88%. The XRP/BTC ratio jumped from 0.00000902 to 0.0000303, showing clear relative strength. What makes this impressive is the lack of support tools XRP doesn‚Äôt have: No U.S.-approved spot XRP ETF yet. No major corporate treasury wave. No native DeFi yield is baked into the network. Still, buyers showed up. As of now, XRP is trading around $3.44 , reflecting a gain of 4.5% seen in the last 24 hours, not far from the fresh $3.66 all‚Äëtime high. One year ago, XRP was about $0.44, that‚Äôs a 9x gain. Institutional Money Flowing In Institutional interest in XRP is heating up fast. ProShares is set to launch its Ultra XRP ETF on NYSE Arca, giving investors leveraged exposure. On the top of it, big names like Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Teucrium are also lining up with active ETF filings. Apart from all, recently reported record-breaking daily volumes for XRP and Micro XRP futures, over $235 million in a single day, a sign that professional traders are piling in. Ripple Expands Global Reach Ripple isn‚Äôt slowing down, it continues building real‚Äëworld use. It recently partnered with Ctrl Alt to bring institutional-grade custody to Dubai‚Äôs real estate market, enabling tokenized property titles on the XRP Ledger.

The global cryptocurrency market has just witnessed an extraordinary milestone, attracting a staggering $10 billion in funding during the second quarter of 2025 . This isn‚Äôt just a big number; it represents the highest level of crypto market funding seen in three years, signaling a pivotal moment for the industry. This massive influx of capital, as highlighted by a CryptoRank report via BeInCrypto, points to a clear trend: increasing institutional participation and a growing embrace from governments worldwide. It‚Äôs a powerful validation of the crypto space, moving it further into the mainstream financial landscape. What‚Äôs Driving This Unprecedented Crypto Market Funding Frenzy? The sheer volume of capital flowing into the crypto market in Q2 2025 is more than just a statistic; it‚Äôs a resounding vote of confidence. This isn‚Äôt merely retail speculation; it‚Äôs the sophisticated financial world placing significant bets on the future of decentralized technologies. So, what exactly is fueling this remarkable surge? Growing Institutional Appetite: Large financial institutions, once hesitant, are now actively seeking exposure to digital assets. They‚Äôre recognizing the potential for diversification, high returns, and the inherent innovation within blockchain technology. This includes hedge funds, venture capital firms, traditional asset managers, and even corporate treasuries. Evolving Regulatory Clarity: While challenges remain, many jurisdictions are making strides in establishing clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies and blockchain. This evolving landscape provides a greater sense of security for institutional investors, reducing perceived risks and making it easier for them to allocate significant capital. Technological Maturation: The underlying technology has advanced considerably. We‚Äôre seeing more robust infrastructure, scalable solutions, and real-world use cases emerging across various sectors, making crypto projects more attractive and viable investment opportunities. Macroeconomic Factors: In an era of shifting global economics, digital assets are increasingly viewed as a hedge against inflation or a source of uncorrelated returns, drawing in capital from diverse investment portfolios. This confluence of factors has created a fertile ground for substantial crypto market funding , propelling the industry into a new phase of development and adoption. A Clear Shift in Crypto Investment Trends: Towards Maturity Beyond the headline-grabbing dollar figures, the CryptoRank report sheds light on a crucial evolution within the market: a significant shift in crypto investment trends . We‚Äôre observing a distinct pivot from early-stage, high-risk ventures towards more established, late-stage projects. What does this mean for the ecosystem? Historically, much of the venture capital in crypto flowed into nascent startups, often with unproven concepts and minimal products. While this fostered incredible innovation, it also came with high failure rates. The current trend suggests a more discerning approach: Focus on Proven Models: Investors are prioritizing projects with demonstrable traction, a clear product-market fit, existing user bases, and robust technology. This reduces speculative risk and points to a more sustainable growth trajectory. Scalability and Sustainability: Late-stage projects often have developed scalable solutions and clearer paths to long-term sustainability, making them more appealing for larger capital injections. Increased Due Diligence: As the market matures, investors are conducting more rigorous due diligence, demanding stronger governance, clearer roadmaps, and experienced teams. This maturation is further evidenced by elevated levels of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and Merger and Acquisition (M&A) activity within the crypto sector. We‚Äôre seeing successful crypto companies either going public or being acquired by larger traditional or crypto-native firms, a hallmark of any maturing industry. This consolidation and public listing activity not only provides liquidity for early investors but also offers new avenues for public market participants to gain exposure to digital assets, cementing crypto‚Äôs place in the broader financial landscape. The Impact of Institutional Crypto Investment on Digital Asset Growth The surge in institutional crypto investment is not just about capital; it‚Äôs about legitimacy, infrastructure, and accelerated adoption. When major financial players enter the space, they bring with them not only vast sums of money but also expertise, established networks, and a demand for more sophisticated financial products and services. Consider the ripple effects of this institutional embrace on digital asset growth : Enhanced Market Liquidity: Larger capital pools mean more robust trading volumes and narrower bid-ask spreads, making the market more efficient and attractive for all participants. Development of Robust Infrastructure: Institutions demand secure, compliant, and scalable solutions for custody, trading, and asset management. This demand drives the development of enterprise-grade infrastructure, benefiting the entire ecosystem. Increased Mainstream Acceptance: As reputable institutions invest, it chips away at the perception of crypto as a niche or risky asset class, encouraging broader public and corporate adoption. Innovation in Regulated Products: The push from institutions often leads to the creation of regulated crypto products like ETFs, mutual funds, and structured products, making digital assets accessible to a wider range of investors who prefer traditional investment vehicles. However, this increased institutionalization also presents challenges. Concerns about centralization of power, potential for market manipulation by large players, and the need for robust consumer protection frameworks become even more critical as the industry integrates with traditional finance. Governments, in their support, are often focused on these regulatory aspects, aiming to foster innovation while mitigating systemic risks. Beyond the Numbers: The Future of Blockchain Funding The $10 billion funding milestone in Q2 2025 is more than just a fleeting moment; it‚Äôs a strong indicator of the future trajectory for blockchain funding and the broader digital economy. This capital infusion is set to accelerate development across various high-potential sectors within the crypto space. Which areas are poised to benefit most from this renewed investor confidence? Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Continued innovation in lending, borrowing, and decentralized exchanges, with a focus on regulatory compliance and user-friendly interfaces. Web3 Infrastructure: Projects building scalable, secure, and interoperable foundational layers for the next generation of the internet. Real-World Asset (RWA) Tokenization: Bringing traditional assets like real estate, art, and commodities onto the blockchain, unlocking new liquidity and investment opportunities. Enterprise Blockchain Solutions: Companies leveraging blockchain for supply chain management, identity verification, and data security in traditional industries. For investors, this shift means a greater emphasis on fundamental analysis, understanding project utility, and assessing long-term viability rather than purely speculative plays. For innovators and project developers, it underscores the importance of building robust, compliant, and genuinely useful applications that solve real-world problems. The future of blockchain funding will likely favor those who can demonstrate not just technological prowess, but also strong governance, clear business models, and a commitment to regulatory adherence. A New Era for Digital Assets The record-breaking $10 billion in crypto market funding during Q2 2025 is an undeniable testament to the maturation and growing acceptance of the digital asset ecosystem. It signifies a powerful shift, driven by increasing institutional crypto investment and a clearer regulatory outlook. As crypto investment trends pivot towards more established projects, and as blockchain funding continues to fuel innovation, we are witnessing an exciting acceleration in digital asset growth . This is not just a temporary surge; it‚Äôs a foundational step towards integrating cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology firmly into the global financial infrastructure. The road ahead will undoubtedly have its challenges, but with such significant capital and institutional backing, the crypto market is poised for an unprecedented era of expansion and innovation. Get ready for a future where digital assets play an even more central role in our financial lives.

Industrial and consumer-facing companies across the region are now reporting weaker profits, rising expenses, and slower investment as the impact of U.S. trade policies finally crashes into their bottom lines. What started as a mild 0.2% drop in expected profits for firms on the Stoxx Europe 600 index has now become a projected 0.7% decline, according to LSEG, as more companies speak out about the real-world consequences of escalating trade tensions. Europe‚Äôs profit margins are slim The biggest names in manufacturing are already taking hits. Jaguar Land Rover , owned by Tata Motors, said its retail sales dropped 15.1% for the quarter that ended June 30. The company blamed a complete stop in U.S.-bound shipments in April, directly linked to the new American import tariffs. Volvo Group‚Äôs CEO, Martin Lundstedt, said weak North American demand, driven by both the tariffs and the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs 2027 emissions rules, forced them to ‚Äúreduce production capacity‚Äù on that side of the Atlantic. Norway-based Tomra Systems, which builds machines for recycling waste, said its clients are now backing off from buying new equipment. In its own words, customers are hesitating due to ‚Äúmacroeconomic and tariff uncertainty,‚Äù which has started delaying investment decisions across the board. The same mood has taken hold at Swiss industrial heavyweight ABB. The company said buyers in its robotics division are now in a ‚Äúwait-and-see mode‚Äù because of continued tariff complications , which has already led to project delays. EU lines up countermeasures while pushing talks With less than two weeks until Trump‚Äôs self-imposed August 1 deadline, officials in Europe are scrambling to stop another wave of duties. Negotiations between the European Union and the United States are happening behind closed doors, but there‚Äôs no guarantee they‚Äôll end in a deal. If they don‚Äôt, Brussels is preparing to retaliate. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the European side is ‚Äúvery eager‚Äù to strike a trade agreement. She told reporters Thursday that Brussels is finally exploring ‚Äúways to lower their tariff and their non-tariff barriers that we have long said harm our workers and our companies.‚Äù But while public talk suggests cooperation, behind the scenes, Brussels is building a legal and political wall of countermeasures. Michal Baranowski, Poland‚Äôs undersecretary at the Ministry of Economic Development and Technology, broke down the plan in an interview with CNBC‚Äôs Europe Early Edition. ‚ÄúThe first part of the EU‚Äôs strategy is to negotiate with U.S. officials in good faith,‚Äù he said . ‚ÄúThe second one is, let‚Äôs prepare for countermeasures in case we don‚Äôt [reach a deal]. And we have countermeasures on both the steel and aluminium tariffs as well as the initial package of 72 billion [euros] for so-called reciprocal tariffs.‚Äù Baranowski said they‚Äôre also watching other countries in similar situations to get a broader view of how everyone else is responding, though coordination isn‚Äôt the goal. Baranowski also made it clear that the transatlantic trade link is vital for both sides, saying, ‚ÄúWashington has as much to gain or to lose from this relationship as Europe.‚Äù His remarks came shortly after Maros Sefcovic, the EU‚Äôs top trade official, visited Washington for further discussions. But the urgency is clear. The U.S. and EU are tied together in the biggest trade and investment partnership on Earth. Together, they account for nearly 30% of the world‚Äôs trade in goods and services and 43% of the world‚Äôs GDP. In 2024, total trade between the two hit 1.68 trillion euros, or around $1.96 trillion. That breaks down to 4.6 billion euros in daily transactions; money that both sides depend on to keep jobs, supply chains, and businesses moving. Trump has repeatedly complained that this relationship is unfair. He continues to point at the EU‚Äôs trade surplus with the U.S. as proof that Europe is taking advantage of American industry.

However, signs of buyer exhaustion and potential distribution are starting to surface. From price action patterns to miner behavior and funding sentiment, the market seems to be entering a sensitive inflection point where a correction may be needed before the next leg up. Let‚Äôs break it down from the top. By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart On the daily timeframe, Bitcoin remains well inside its long-term ascending channel and recently printed a clean breakout above the $108K‚Äì$110K resistance zone. The price reached as high as $123K and is seemingly targeting the $140K area. This zone coincides with a potential area of profit-taking and the mid-line of the channel. The market structure remains decisively bullish, with higher highs and higher lows continuing uninterrupted. The 50-day and 100-day moving averages, located around the $100K mark, are positively sloped, offering strong dynamic support just below the price. If Bitcoin declines, this zone, along with the lower boundary of the channel, is the most probable area for a bullish reaction. Still, as long as the price holds above $108K, bulls remain in firm control, and the market might not revisit the lower boundary of the channel anytime soon. The 4-Hour Chart The 4-hour chart reveals a developing Head and Shoulders pattern, with the left shoulder already formed, the head established near $123K, and the right shoulder currently shaping up. Importantly, this pattern is not yet confirmed, as the neckline has not been broken. However, the structure suggests that if the neckline around the $117K‚Äì$116K low fails to hold, a bearish continuation toward the golden Fibonacci zone becomes highly probable. The potential rebound zone lies between $112K and $111K, which corresponds to the 0.618‚Äì0.786 retracement levels. This region aligns with the base of the rally from early July, making it a confluence of both technical and psychological support. If the neckline breaks with volume, the drop could accelerate rapidly as trapped longs exit and short-term momentum flips bearish. Until then, bulls still have time to defend the neckline and invalidate the reversal structure, but the window is narrowing. Onchain Analysis Bitcoin Retail Activity Surge Moving on to on-chain metrics, the Miners Position Index has spiked recently, indicating a notable rise in miner outflows to exchanges. Historically, this level marks increased selling activity from miners, often aligning with local tops or periods of cooling in the market. The timing of this spike, right as BTC tapped $123K, is not coincidental. Miners tend to offload during periods of price strength to maximize profits and fund their operations. This kind of on-chain behavior often precedes either a local top or a sideways grind while the market absorbs this supply. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean a macro reversal is coming, but it does raise short-term caution, especially when paired with overheated funding and slowing spot momentum.

He Warned: ""Don't Be Late!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/fed-member-waller-made-important-statements-regarding-cryptocurrency-and-interest-rate-cuts-he-warned-dont-be-late/,"There's speculation about when the Fed will resume its interest rate cuts, which have been on hold since January. At this point, the majority of Fed members expect the first rate cut of the year to occur in July or September at the latest. Speaking recently, Fed member Christopher Waller stated that he wants to cut interest rates in July due to rising growth and labor market risks. Speaking at the New York University Money Marketers meeting, Waller said he believes the Fed should cut interest rates at the end of July because of the growing risks to the economy and the high likelihood that inflation from tariffs will lead to a persistent increase in price pressures. ‚ÄúIt makes sense for the FOMC to cut the policy rate by 25 basis points at its meeting in two weeks at the end of July. ‚ÄúI see the hard and soft data on economic activity and the labor market as consistent: The economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed significantly, and risks to the (Federal Open Market Committee's) employment mandate have increased. This justifies lowering interest rates.‚Äù Waller warned that delaying a rate cut this month could lead to more aggressive measures in the future. He added that Fed policy is not set in stone and that decisions about where to set interest rates will be made on a meeting-by-meeting basis. The FED last lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points in December 2024. Aside from his expectations for a rate cut, Waller also made statements about stablecoins. Following the approval of the GENIUS and Clarity Acts in the US House of Representatives, Waller stated that stablecoins introduce competition to the payments system but do not pose a threat. Waller added that no one from the Donald Trump administration contacted him about the Fed chair position. *This is not investment advice.

The recent dYdX acquisition of Pocket Protector marks a pivotal moment, signaling a bold new direction for how users interact with and experience crypto trading. This strategic move by dYdX, a leading decentralized cryptocurrency exchange, aims to integrate advanced social and user-driven trading features, promising a more engaging and collaborative environment for traders worldwide. Why is the dYdX Acquisition of Pocket Protector a Game Changer? dYdX has long been recognized as a powerhouse in the decentralized exchange (DEX) space, offering perpetuals and spot trading with a focus on high performance and deep liquidity. However, the crypto market is constantly evolving, and user demands are shifting. Traders are no longer just looking for efficient execution; they crave community, shared insights, and the ability to learn from others. This is precisely where Pocket Protector comes into play. Pocket Protector, a crypto social trading platform, brings its innovative engineering team and co-founders directly into the dYdX ecosystem. This isn‚Äôt just a simple partnership; it‚Äôs a full integration designed to supercharge dYdX‚Äôs scaling strategy. The core idea is to infuse the robust trading infrastructure of dYdX with the dynamic, interactive elements that make social trading so compelling. Imagine a world where you can not only execute trades seamlessly but also: See what top traders are doing in real-time. Engage in discussions about market trends and strategies. Potentially even replicate successful trades (with appropriate risk management). This strategic move is set to redefine the user experience on dYdX, moving beyond mere transactional interactions to foster a vibrant, knowledge-sharing community. Understanding the Rise of Social Trading in Crypto What exactly is social trading , and why has it gained such immense traction in the crypto space? At its heart, social trading allows individuals to observe and potentially copy the trades of more experienced or successful investors. It‚Äôs about leveraging collective intelligence and breaking down the traditional barriers of financial markets. In the volatile world of cryptocurrencies, where information asymmetry can be a major challenge, social trading platforms offer several benefits: Knowledge Sharing: Novice traders can learn from veterans, understanding different strategies and market analysis techniques. Transparency: Many platforms offer detailed statistics on traders‚Äô past performance, allowing users to make informed decisions about who to follow. Community Building: It fosters a sense of community, where traders can discuss, debate, and share insights, making the often solitary act of trading a more collaborative experience. Reduced Entry Barrier: It simplifies complex trading for newcomers, making crypto more accessible. While centralized platforms like eToro have popularized social trading in traditional markets, its application within a decentralized exchange context like dYdX presents unique opportunities and challenges, primarily around maintaining decentralization and user autonomy. The Future of Decentralized Exchange: Beyond Basic Trading For years, the primary focus of a decentralized exchange has been on security, transparency, and censorship resistance, often at the expense of user experience and advanced features. However, as the DeFi ecosystem matures, the demand for more sophisticated and user-friendly interfaces is growing. The dYdX acquisition signifies a major step in this direction. Integrating social features into a DEX is not without its complexities. Unlike centralized platforms, DEXs operate on blockchain technology, meaning every interaction is recorded and immutable. This presents both advantages and challenges: Advantages: Enhanced transparency of trading data, verifiable performance metrics for social leaders, and censorship resistance for community discussions. Challenges: Ensuring user privacy while facilitating social interaction, managing on-chain data for social features efficiently, and designing user interfaces that are both intuitive and decentralized. dYdX‚Äôs move suggests a vision where a decentralized exchange can offer the best of both worlds: the security and autonomy of DeFi combined with the engaging, community-driven features typically found on centralized platforms. This could involve features like on-chain leaderboards, decentralized chat functionalities, and even permissionless copy-trading protocols. Revolutionizing Crypto Trading: What This Means for Users The implications of this dYdX acquisition for the everyday user engaged in crypto trading are profound. Imagine logging into dYdX and not only seeing your portfolio but also: Accessing Curated Insights: Top traders on the platform share their analysis, providing valuable context for market movements. Participating in Discussions: Join decentralized forums to discuss specific assets, trading strategies, or macro trends without fear of censorship. Discovering New Strategies: Observe how successful traders manage risk, use leverage, or identify opportunities, allowing you to refine your own approach. Potential for Automated Copy-Trading: While details are yet to be revealed, the integration of a social trading platform could pave the way for features that allow users to automatically mirror the trades of chosen experts, democratizing access to advanced trading strategies. This shift promises to make crypto trading less intimidating for newcomers and more enriching for experienced traders. It transforms the trading experience from a solitary endeavor into a collaborative journey, potentially leading to better-informed decisions and improved overall market efficiency. Driving DeFi Innovation: A Blueprint for the Future Beyond the immediate benefits to dYdX users, this dYdX acquisition serves as a significant catalyst for broader DeFi innovation . It sets a precedent for how decentralized protocols can evolve to meet the growing demands for user-centric features while maintaining their core principles of decentralization and transparency. This strategic integration could inspire other DeFi projects to explore similar avenues, leading to a new wave of user-friendly and community-driven applications across the ecosystem. It highlights a maturing DeFi landscape where the focus is shifting from purely foundational infrastructure to enhancing the end-user experience. The future of DeFi could see: More intuitive interfaces for complex protocols. Increased interoperability between different DeFi applications. Greater emphasis on community governance and collective intelligence. dYdX is not just acquiring a company; it‚Äôs acquiring a vision for a more connected, collaborative, and accessible future for decentralized finance. This move could well be a blueprint for how DeFi continues to grow and onboard the next wave of users, proving that decentralization doesn‚Äôt have to mean isolation. The dYdX acquisition of Pocket Protector is more than just a business transaction; it‚Äôs a strategic maneuver that could redefine the landscape of decentralized finance. By integrating sophisticated social trading features, dYdX is poised to offer a richer, more interactive, and community-driven crypto trading experience on its decentralized exchange . This bold step not only enhances dYdX‚Äôs platform but also serves as a powerful example of how continuous DeFi innovation can bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and mainstream usability. As the DeFi space continues to mature, such strategic integrations will be crucial in fostering adoption and unlocking the full potential of decentralized finance for everyone.

The chart below illustrates a surge in fund inflows over recent days. Cumulative net inflows since ETHA's launch have reached $7.66 billion, while assets under management (AUM) now stand at $8.47 billion. Across all spot Ethereum ETFs, inflows totaled $602 million in the past 24 hours. This positive trend has now continued for 10 consecutive weeks. Combined AUM for these ETFs is currently $17.32 billion. Interest in Staking Options Capital inflows may have intensified in response to BlackRock's recent filing with the SEC seeking to add a staking feature to ETHA. This initiative comes shortly after the REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF entered the market with a similar option. BlackRock‚Äôs request was filed through Nasdaq under Rule 19b-4, a provision used by exchanges to list new funds. Previously, 21Shares, Grayscale, and other management companies filed similar proposals to update their Ethereum products. Nasdaq has proposed using ‚Äúall or part‚Äù of the ETH from the trust for staking through one or more vetted providers. According to the filing, the assets would not be pooled with other participants‚Äô ether, and the fund would not assume the risks associated with tracking errors and blockchain forks. The custodian and primary transaction agent for the BlackRock product is Coinbase, which is also likely to serve as the fund‚Äôs staking partner. The REX-Osprey Solana Staking ETF, previously approved by the Commission, operates under a stricter regulatory structure based on the Securities Act of 1940. Most crypto funds, including those governed by Rule 19b-4, rely instead on the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. So far, no staking fund has received approval under the 1934 Act model, but the SEC has expressed ongoing interest in such products. The Commission is also developing recommendations to help streamline the approval process for cryptocurrency-based ETFs. The SEC has stated that most staking-related transactions are exempt from securities laws and do not require registration. At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at approximately $3,616.

Nearly all cryptocurrencies are trading in positive territory, with Bitcoin (BTC) reclaiming $120,000 and Ethereum (ETH) registering record increases. BTC had dipped below $118,000 late on Thursday but rebounded from this level to reclaim $120,000, reaching an intraday high of $120,989 before declining to current levels. The flagship cryptocurrency is up 1.51% and trading around $120,215. Meanwhile, ETH is up nearly 8% in the past 24 hours and over 21% in the past week as bullish sentiment around the asset surges. The world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency raced past $3,500 earlier today, trading around $3,596. Sentiment around Ripple (XRP) is even more bullish, with the altcoin up nearly 18% in the past 24 hours, and over 40% over the past week. Solana (SOL) crossed $180 earlier today, with the price up nearly 8%, trading around $184. Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 15%, while Cardano (ADA) is up 16%, trading around $0.869. Stellar (XLM) , Chainlink (LINK) , Hedera (HBAR) , Litecoin (LTC), Toncoin (TON) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases. Dow Jones, Nasdaq, S&P 500 Trade Flat US stocks traded mostly flat on Thursday, with traders cautiously optimistic. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 140 points, while the S&P 500 remained flat as traders factored in key earnings reports from major banks and tech giants. The Nasdaq Composite registered a marginal increase. Trading has been muted since the index reached a new all-time high amid earnings reports and bullish news from Nvidia. Key inflation data has boosted investor sentiment this week. However, investors are also being cautious, thanks to the uncertainty created by President Donald Trump's pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Key Crypto Bills Pass Ahead Of August Recess The US House of Representatives has passed three key crypto legislations after significant delays in Congress due to concerns around central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Lawmakers finally voted 294-134 to pass the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act. The bill aims to establish a clear market structure for cryptocurrencies. Lawmakers also voted 308-122 in favor of the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act and 219-210 in favor of the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. Nearly 80 Democrats voted in favor of the CLARITY Act, and over 100 in favor of the GENIUS Act. SEC Extends Deadline On In-Kind Redemptions For Bitwise ETFs The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delayed its decision on whether to allow in-kind redemptions for Bitwise‚Äôs spot BTC and ETH ETFs on NYSE Arca. The SEC stated that it needed more time to fully consider the implications of the proposed rule change. If the rule change is approved, investors can receive BTC or ETH directly, potentially offering tax benefits. The move comes amid growing criticism that the SEC is delaying key crypto decisions. Grayscale recently challenged the SEC‚Äôs handling of its Digital Large Cap ETF. The asset manager accused the market regulator of violating statutory deadlines. However, the SEC, under current Chair Paul Atkins, is shifting its stance. Atkins has promised more transparency in the SEC's functioning and a more innovation-friendly approach. Trump Could Pass Executive Order To Open Retirement Funds To Crypto United States President Donald Trump could sign an executive order allowing American 401(k) retirement plans to invest in alternative assets, including cryptocurrencies. According to sources, Trump could sign the executive order as early as this week. The new 401(k) investment options include several types of assets, including cryptocurrencies, metals, and funds focused on infrastructure deals, corporate takeovers, and private loans. The order instructs regulatory agencies to find the best way for 401(k) plans to invest in crypto. It will also direct agencies to investigate any obstacles preventing such investments. However, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said nothing should be considered official unless it comes from President Trump himself. ‚ÄúPresident Trump is committed to restoring prosperity for everyday Americans and safeguarding their economic future. No decisions should be deemed official, however, unless they come from President Trump himself.‚Äù Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) has rebounded after facing substantial selling pressure on Thursday as sellers dragged the price to an intraday low of $117,389. The flagship cryptocurrency had struggled to regain $120,000 this week as it lost momentum after Monday‚Äôs rally to a new all-time high. However, BTC rebounded from Thursday‚Äôs low to briefly cross $120,000 before settling at $119,101, ultimately registering a marginal increase. However, it crossed $120,000 during the current session, with the price up over 1%, trading around $120,289. Analysts attribute BTC‚Äôs recovery to the US House of Representatives clearing three key crypto bills aimed at creating a clear regulatory framework for the crypto industry. The landmark bills were approved on Thursday, setting the stage for a clear regulatory framework for digital assets. The key piece of legislation, the GENIUS Act, sailed through the House with a 308-122 vote in favor. The bill was approved by the Senate in June. The other bills that cleared the House are the CLARITY Act and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act. The CLARITY Act defines whether cryptocurrencies fall under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Meanwhile, the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act prohibits the Federal Reserve from creating its own CBDC without prior approval from Congress. Market sentiment and the rally were also boosted by reports that President Trump could approve crypto investments for retirement accounts. President Trump could sign the executive order as early as this week, clearing regulatory hurdles to allow 401(k) retirement plans to invest in crypto. BTC‚Äôs rally is taking another breather as it trades around $120,000. The flagship cryptocurrency struggled to regain this level after Monday‚Äôs rally and subsequent decline. However, it briefly crossed $120,000 on Thursday and reached an intraday high of $120,800 during the ongoing session. Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered their 10th successive day of inflows, recording $799 million on Wednesday. Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen over $5.2 billion in inflows since July 2. BTC started the previous week in the red, dropping nearly 1% on Monday and settling at $108,273. It recovered on Tuesday, rising 0.62% and settling at $108,942. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as BTC rose over 2% to cross $111,000 and settle at $111,255. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price rose 3.51%, crossing $115,000 and settling at $115,159. Price action remained positive on Friday as BTC rose 1.50% and settled at $116,885. Despite the positive sentiment, BTC lost momentum on Saturday, registering a marginal decline and settling at $116,616. The price recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to cross $118,000 and settle at $118,624. Source: TradingView Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC raced past $123,000 and set a new all-time high at $123,091. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped to $119,714, ultimately registering an increase of 0.92%. Selling pressure returned on Tuesday as traders began locking their profits. As a result, BTC plunged to an intraday low of $115,701 before settling at $117,682, a drop of almost 2%. The price recovered on Wednesday, rising nearly 1% to reclaim $118,000 and settle at $118,641. BTC faced volatility and selling pressure on Thursday as sellers attempted to overwhelm buyers. Despite the selling pressure, it reached an intraday high of $120,812 before settling at $119,101, up 0.39%. The current session sees BTC up almost 1%, trading at $119,801. If BTC can reclaim and close above $120,000, it could start an uptrend that takes the price past $130,000. On the other hand, if sellers regain control, it could drop below $110,000, potentially falling as low as $105,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum‚Äôs (ETH) upward trajectory continued as it extended its gains to a sixth consecutive day. Bullish sentiment around the asset has seen a substantial increase in recent sessions as institutional interest and ETH treasury companies drive up the asset‚Äôs price. The world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency crossed $3,300 on Wednesday and $3,400 on Thursday. ETH has surged past $3,600 during the ongoing session, and is trading around $3,606. With bulls in control, ETH is eying the $4,000 mark. The asset‚Äôs price is up nearly 7% in the past 24 hours, and over 22% in the past week. ETH is also becoming increasingly scarce on OTC platforms, suggesting a significant increase in institutional demand. The scarcity was highlighted by Wintermute CEO Evgeny Gaevoy, who stated that institutions are also leveraging derivatives for hedging and yield generation. Gaevoy stated, ‚ÄúThis divergence isn‚Äôt temporary‚Äîit‚Äôs the sign of a more mature, sophisticated, and specialized crypto market.‚Äù Institutional investors are increasingly treating BTC and ETH as macro assets in portfolios and anchoring their crypto strategies around them. Over-the-counter (OTC) volumes jumped over 400% in the first half of the year, with Wintermute‚Äôs OTC spot trading volumes outpacing centralized exchanges. Like BTC, ETH started the previous week in the red, dropping 1.12% and settling at $2,543. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising nearly 3% to cross $2,600 and settle at $2,616. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as ETH rose almost 6%, crossing $2,700 and settling at $2,770. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price rose 6.51% to cross $2,900 and settle at $2,950. With sellers active around $3,000, ETH could only register a marginal increase on Friday and settle at $2,956. It lost momentum on Saturday, dropping 0.49% and settling at $2,942. The price recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 1% to end the weekend at $2,970. Source: TradingView ETH started the current week on a bullish note, rising 1.50% to cross $3,000 and settle at $3,015. The price fell to a low of $2,932 on Tuesday but recovered to reclaim $3,000 and settle at $3,140. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as ETH rallied over 7%, crossing $3,300 and settling at $3,374. The price continued pushing higher on Thursday, rising over 3% to cross $3,400 and settle at $3,470. The current session sees ETH up over 4%, trading around $3,620. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) surged past $180 during the ongoing session, reaching an intraday high of $184 before declining to current levels. The altcoin has posted substantial gains over the past few sessions, up over 10% in the past week. SOL is up over 4% in the past 24 hours, trading around $180-$181. The rally comes after several bullish developments, including the launch of a staked Solana ETP on the Deutsche B√∂rse Xetra. The ETP gives investors exposure to SOL, offering staking rewards. Additionally, the spillover effect from ETH‚Äôs ETF inflows has created demand for altcoins like SOL, leading to surging trading volumes. SOL dropped nearly 2% on Monday (July 7) and settled at $148. The price recovered on Tuesday, rising almost 2% to reclaim $150 and settle at $151. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as SOL rose 3.54%, crossing the 50-day SMA and settling at $157. SOL rallied on Thursday, rising nearly 5% to cross $160 and settle at $164. The price faced selling pressure and volatility on Friday as sellers attempted to overwhelm buyers. As a result, it fell nearly 1% and settled at $162. Sellers retained control on Saturday as SOL fell 1.37% and settled at $160. The price recovered on Sunday, registering a marginal increase and moving to $161. Source: TradingView SOL reached an intraday high of $168 as the week started on a bullish note. However, it could not stay at this level and dropped to $162, ultimately registering an increase of 0.68%. The price fell to an intraday low of $157 on Tuesday as selling pressure intensified. However, it rebounded from this level to reclaim $160 and settle at $164. Bullish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as SOL rallied, rising nearly 6% to cross $170 and settle at $173. Buyers retained control on Thursday despite selling pressure. As a result, SOL recovered from a low of $168, rising 1.29% to $175. The price raced to an intraday high of $184 during the ongoing session. However, it could not stay at this level and moved to its current level of $179, up over 2%. Ripple (XRP) Price Analysis Ripple‚Äôs (XRP) stunning rally has taken the altcoin past key levels in recent sessions. It crossed the $3 mark on Wednesday and continued rising on Thursday, consolidating its position before a marginal decline. However, the rally has lost momentum during the ongoing session, with the price down 1.38% after reaching an intraday high of $3.66. Despite the decline, analysts are confident XRP will cross $3.50 sooner rather than later. XRP‚Äôs current rally is being fueled by growing regulatory optimism around crypto-friendly legislation in the US. The launch of ProShares XRP Futures ETF has also had a positive impact on XRP‚Äôs price action. XRP registered a marginal decline on Monday (July 7) before recovering on Tuesday, rising 1.81% to $2.31. The price registered an increase of over 4% on Wednesday, crossing the 200-day SMA and settling at $2.40. Buyers retained control on Thursday as XRP rose nearly 6%, crossing $2.50 and settling at $2.54. Bullish sentiment intensified on Friday as XRP soared to an intraday high of $2.97. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $2.73, ultimately registering an increase of over 7%. Price action remained positive over the weekend as XRP registered a marginal increase on Saturday and then rose over 4% on Sunday to settle at $2.83. Source: TradingView XRP started the current week in positive territory, rising over 4% to settle at $2.95. Despite the positive sentiment, the price lost momentum on Tuesday and fell 1.33% to $2.91, but not before dropping to an intraday low of $2.80. XRP recovered on Wednesday, rising over 4% to cross $3 and settle at $3.03. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price rallied nearly 15% and settled at $3.48, with buyers eying the $3.50 mark. XRP raced to an intraday high of $3.66 during the ongoing session. However, it could not stay at this level and moved to its current level of $3.42, down nearly 2%. Near Protocol (NEAR) Price Analysis Near Protocol (NEAR) has surged in recent sessions, going past key resistance levels and moving averages. The price dropped 0.99% on Monday (July 7) but recovered on Tuesday, rising nearly 4% and moving to $2.24. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as NEAR rose 4.01% and settled at $2.33. Bullish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price rallied, rising nearly 8% to cross the 50-day SMA and settle at $2.51. Despite the positive sentiment, NEAR lost momentum on Friday after facing volatility. As a result, it registered a marginal decline and settled at $2.50. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.90% to $2.48. Source: TradingView NEAR recovered on Sunday, rising nearly 2% to end the weekend at $2.53.

Charles Schwab, a titan in the traditional brokerage space, is poised to launch spot trading for two of the largest digital assets: Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). This pivotal move signals a significant acceleration in the integration of digital currencies into conventional investment portfolios, marking a new era for Schwab Bitcoin trading and beyond. What Does Rick Wurster‚Äôs Announcement Mean for Investors? Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster recently confirmed plans to introduce spot trading for Bitcoin and Ethereum. This announcement, initially hinted at in April as a key goal for the year, solidifies Schwab‚Äôs commitment to expanding its digital asset offerings. For individual and institutional investors alike, this development brings several compelling advantages: Enhanced Accessibility: Investors who are already comfortable with Schwab‚Äôs platform can now directly buy and sell Bitcoin and Ethereum without needing to navigate dedicated crypto exchanges. This lowers the barrier to entry significantly. Trusted Brand: Schwab‚Äôs reputation for reliability and robust customer service can provide a sense of security for those wary of the often-unregulated crypto market. Integrated Portfolios: The ability to hold traditional stocks, bonds, and digital assets within a single account simplifies portfolio management and reporting. Rick Wurster‚Äôs strategic vision highlights a recognition of the growing demand for digital assets among a broad client base, moving beyond mere curiosity to direct investment opportunities. This proactive step by a major player like Schwab is likely to encourage other traditional financial institutions to follow suit, further legitimizing the asset class. Why is Ethereum Spot Trading a Game-Changer? While Bitcoin often grabs headlines, the inclusion of Ethereum spot trading alongside BTC is equally, if not more, significant for the evolving digital asset landscape. Ethereum, the backbone of decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), represents a broader exposure to the innovation within the blockchain space. Here‚Äôs why Ethereum‚Äôs inclusion is a game-changer: Diversified Exposure: Investors gain access to a cryptocurrency with different use cases and growth drivers compared to Bitcoin, allowing for more diversified digital asset investment strategies. Ecosystem Growth: Ethereum‚Äôs network supports thousands of decentralized applications. Direct access to ETH trading through a regulated platform like Schwab could funnel more capital into the Ethereum ecosystem, fostering further development and adoption. Institutional Validation: Schwab‚Äôs decision to offer Ethereum spot trading signals a growing institutional confidence not just in Bitcoin as ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù but in the broader utility and potential of programmable blockchains like Ethereum. This move underscores the maturation of the crypto market beyond its initial speculative phase. The Broader Impact on Institutional Crypto Adoption The entry of a financial giant like Charles Schwab into the spot crypto trading arena is a powerful catalyst for institutional crypto adoption . This isn‚Äôt just about one company; it‚Äôs a ripple effect that validates the asset class and paves the way for wider acceptance. Consider these implications for the broader market: Increased Liquidity: More capital flowing through regulated channels typically leads to increased market liquidity, which can reduce volatility and improve price discovery. Regulatory Clarity: As major players enter, they often work with regulators to establish clearer guidelines, benefiting the entire industry. This push for clarity is crucial for long-term growth and stability. Competitive Pressure: Schwab‚Äôs move will undoubtedly put pressure on competitors like Fidelity, Vanguard, and others to accelerate their own digital asset strategies, leading to a race for market share in the crypto space. This competition ultimately benefits consumers with more options and potentially lower fees. Mainstream Normalization: When investing in Bitcoin or Ethereum becomes as straightforward as buying a stock on a familiar platform, it normalizes digital assets as a legitimate part of a balanced investment portfolio, moving them from niche speculation to mainstream consideration. Navigating the Future of Digital Asset Investment As the landscape of digital asset investment rapidly evolves, investors need to be prepared for both the opportunities and the challenges that come with increased institutional involvement. While Schwab‚Äôs announcement is overwhelmingly positive, responsible investing remains paramount. Key considerations for navigating this future include: Understanding Risk: Despite increased legitimacy, cryptocurrencies remain volatile assets. Investors should thoroughly understand the risks involved before allocating capital. Diversification: As with any investment, diversification is key. Integrating Bitcoin and Ethereum into a broader portfolio rather than making them the sole focus can help manage risk. Staying Informed: The crypto market is dynamic. Keeping abreast of regulatory changes, technological advancements, and market trends will be crucial for informed decision-making. Security Practices: Even when trading through a reputable platform, understanding basic security practices for online accounts is vital to protect investments. Schwab‚Äôs initiative represents a significant step towards making digital asset investment a standard component of modern finance, promising a more integrated and accessible future for all investors. Charles Schwab‚Äôs strategic decision to launch Bitcoin and Ethereum spot trading is more than just a new product offering; it‚Äôs a profound statement on the maturation and mainstream acceptance of digital assets. With Rick Wurster‚Äôs clear commitment, Schwab is not just reacting to market trends but actively shaping the future of investment, making crypto more accessible, legitimate, and integrated than ever before. This bold move is set to redefine institutional crypto adoption and empower a new generation of investors to confidently engage with the transformative potential of digital currencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When will Charles Schwab‚Äôs Bitcoin and Ethereum spot trading be available? A1: While Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster announced plans and indicated it was a key goal for the year, a precise launch date has not been publicly confirmed. Investors should monitor official Schwab announcements for specific timelines. Q2: What is ‚Äúspot trading‚Äù for cryptocurrencies? A2: Spot trading involves the immediate buying and selling of cryptocurrencies for instant delivery. When you engage in spot trading, you directly own the underlying asset (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) rather than a derivative product. Q3: How does Schwab‚Äôs entry impact the broader cryptocurrency market? A3: Schwab‚Äôs entry is expected to significantly boost institutional crypto adoption, increase market liquidity, and provide greater legitimacy to Bitcoin and Ethereum as investment assets. It may also encourage other traditional financial institutions to offer similar services, fostering competition and innovation. Q4: Will Schwab offer other cryptocurrencies for trading in the future? A4: While the initial announcement focuses on Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), it‚Äôs common for platforms to expand their offerings based on client demand and regulatory developments. Future expansions are possible but not confirmed. Q5: Is investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum through Schwab safer than through a crypto exchange? A5: Trading through a regulated and established brokerage like Schwab can offer enhanced security features, customer support, and regulatory oversight compared to some less regulated crypto exchanges. However, the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies remains regardless of the trading platform.

The move came as part of a broader altcoin rally fueled by the House passage of the GENIUS Act, which aims to expand blockchain innovation incentives and is expected to be signed into law by President Trump at a White House ceremony Friday at 2:30 p.m. ET. Traders are also anticipating further momentum from the expected passage of the CLARITY Act in the coming weeks, which would provide long-sought regulatory guidance for digital asset classification. MEI Pharma Inc. (MEIP), a Nasdaq-listed drug development company, said in a press release issued on Friday that it intends to sell roughly 29.2 million shares at $3.42 each in a private investment in public equity, or PIPE. This type of fundraising allows a public company to sell stock directly to institutional investors without conducting a public offering. The deal is expected to close on or around July 22, pending customary conditions. If completed, MEI plans to use 100 percent of the net proceeds to buy LTC, becoming the first publicly traded company to adopt the cryptocurrency as a primary treasury reserve asset. Charlie Lee, who created litecoin in 2011, is expected to join MEI‚Äôs board of directors following the closing of the deal. He also participated as a lead investor in the private placement. Digital asset trading firm GSR, another lead investor, has been appointed to manage MEI‚Äôs planned crypto reserves. Other participants in the raise include the Litecoin Foundation and several prominent digital asset investors, including ParaFi, CoinFund, Hivemind, MOZAYYX, Primitive and RLH Capital. ‚ÄúThis milestone not only reflects growing institutional confidence in LTC but also sets the stage for broader adoption in traditional capital markets,‚Äù Lee said in a statement. MEI, which is developing oncology drug candidates including the oral CDK9 inhibitor voruciclib, said the decision to integrate Litecoin into its treasury was part of a longer-term diversification strategy. The company cited Litecoin‚Äôs reliability, low transaction fees and uninterrupted uptime since launch as key factors in its choice. Titan Partners Group, a division of American Capital Partners, acted as the sole placement agent for the offering. MEI said the PIPE was structured to comply with Nasdaq listing requirements, including its minimum pricing rules. A resale registration statement will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after the transaction closes. No Litecoin has yet been purchased, and MEI‚Äôs treasury plan remains contingent on the successful completion of the financing. Shares of MEI Pharma surged 46% to $6.58 in early trading Thursday, following the company‚Äôs announcement of its planned $100 million LTC treasury strategy. The stock had closed at $4.50 the previous day and touched an intraday high of $9.00, marking its highest level in 52 weeks.

This isn‚Äôt a hypothetical scenario; it‚Äôs the groundbreaking reality unfolding with MEI Pharma. In a move that has sent ripples across both the traditional financial sector and the burgeoning cryptocurrency market, the Nasdaq-listed clinical-stage pharmaceutical company has announced its ambitious plans to hold a substantial $100 million worth of Litecoin (LTC) in its treasury. This revelation, first reported by BWEnews on Telegram, marks a significant moment, potentially signaling a new wave of corporate crypto adoption among mainstream companies. MEI Pharma‚Äôs Bold Foray into Litecoin: What Does it Mean? The news that MEI Pharma, a company primarily focused on developing novel therapies for cancer, is venturing into the volatile yet promising realm of cryptocurrencies has captured widespread attention. This isn‚Äôt a small, experimental allocation; a $100 million MEI Pharma Litecoin treasury represents a considerable commitment to digital assets. For a company rooted in a highly regulated and traditional industry like pharmaceuticals, such a decision is nothing short of revolutionary. Typically, corporate treasuries are managed with a focus on liquidity, capital preservation, and a modest return, often investing in low-risk assets like government bonds or money market funds. MEI Pharma‚Äôs decision to allocate such a significant portion to Litecoin, a cryptocurrency known for its price volatility, suggests a strategic re-evaluation of traditional treasury management principles. It raises questions about their long-term financial strategy and their outlook on the future of digital assets as a store of value or even a potential growth engine. The Accelerating Trend of Corporate Crypto Adoption: Is This the New Norm? MEI Pharma‚Äôs announcement is not an isolated incident but rather a continuation of a growing trend: Corporate Crypto Adoption . Over the past few years, several high-profile companies have made headlines by adding cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin, to their balance sheets. Pioneers like MicroStrategy, led by Michael Saylor, have aggressively accumulated Bitcoin, viewing it as a superior inflation hedge and a strategic asset in a world of depreciating fiat currencies. Tesla, under Elon Musk, also famously invested in Bitcoin, though their stance has varied. This trend highlights a shift in perception. What was once dismissed as a niche, speculative asset class is increasingly being considered by mainstream corporations as a legitimate component of a diversified treasury strategy. Companies are seeking alternatives to traditional cash holdings, which are vulnerable to inflation, especially in an era of unprecedented quantitative easing and low interest rates. Cryptocurrencies, with their decentralized nature and finite supply (in the case of Bitcoin and Litecoin), offer a compelling narrative as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Why are companies increasingly considering digital assets for their treasuries? Inflation Hedge: Many see cryptocurrencies, especially those with capped supplies like Bitcoin and Litecoin, as a defense against the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. Diversification: Adding non-correlated assets to a treasury can reduce overall portfolio risk and potentially enhance returns. Innovation & Forward-Thinking Image: Embracing digital assets can project a modern, innovative image, potentially attracting new talent and investors. Potential Capital Appreciation: While volatile, cryptocurrencies have shown significant growth potential over long periods, offering a chance for substantial returns. Why a $100 Million LTC Treasury? Unpacking MEI Pharma‚Äôs Strategic Choice Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of MEI Pharma‚Äôs announcement is their specific choice of Litecoin for their LTC Treasury . While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) typically dominate the headlines for institutional adoption, Litecoin‚Äôs selection prompts a deeper dive into its unique characteristics and potential strategic advantages. Often referred to as ‚Äòsilver to Bitcoin‚Äôs gold,‚Äô Litecoin was created with the aim of faster transaction times and a larger total supply. Here are a few reasons why MEI Pharma might have opted for Litecoin: Faster Transactions and Lower Fees: Litecoin boasts significantly faster block generation times (2.5 minutes) compared to Bitcoin (10 minutes), leading to quicker transaction confirmations and generally lower fees. For a company that might foresee potential transactional uses or simply values efficiency, this could be a factor. Market Cap and Liquidity: While not as large as Bitcoin or Ethereum, Litecoin holds a respectable position in terms of market capitalization and liquidity. This ensures that a $100 million investment can be acquired and potentially liquidated without causing undue market disruption, a crucial consideration for corporate treasuries. Perceived Stability (Relative): Compared to many smaller altcoins, Litecoin has a longer history and a more established network, offering a degree of perceived stability. It often tracks Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements but with its own distinct characteristics. Growth Potential: Some investors might see Litecoin as having more upside potential relative to its current valuation compared to Bitcoin, which has already achieved massive market penetration. It could be viewed as an undervalued asset with room for significant appreciation. Technological Similarities: Being a fork of Bitcoin, Litecoin shares many of its underlying technological principles, making it relatively familiar for those who have researched Bitcoin. This decision suggests MEI Pharma has conducted thorough due diligence, evaluating various digital assets beyond just the top two, and found specific attributes in Litecoin that align with their treasury objectives. A Nasdaq Company‚Äôs Crypto Leap: Signaling Mainstream Acceptance? The fact that MEI Pharma is a Nasdaq Company Crypto holder carries immense weight. Nasdaq is home to some of the world‚Äôs most innovative and influential technology and biotechnology firms. When a company listed on such a prestigious exchange makes a move into digital assets, it sends a powerful signal to the broader financial community. It suggests that cryptocurrencies are moving beyond the fringes of speculative investment and are becoming a viable asset class for publicly traded companies. This institutional endorsement can have several cascading effects: Increased Investor Confidence: It could encourage other institutional investors and traditional corporations to explore similar strategies, viewing MEI Pharma‚Äôs move as a validation. Regulatory Scrutiny and Clarity: As more regulated entities engage with crypto, it could prompt regulators to provide clearer guidelines and frameworks, which would benefit the entire industry. Market Maturation: The involvement of traditional companies brings more mature financial practices, risk management strategies, and reporting standards to the crypto space, contributing to its overall maturation. Broader Public Acceptance: When a pharmaceutical company, dealing with public health, embraces crypto, it can help normalize digital assets in the eyes of the general public. MEI Pharma‚Äôs pioneering step could well be a harbinger of more widespread institutional adoption in sectors beyond just tech and finance. Evaluating the Litecoin Investment: Risks, Rewards, and Market Implications While the prospect of a $100 million Litecoin Investment is exciting, it‚Äôs crucial to examine both the potential rewards and the inherent risks. Like all cryptocurrencies, LTC is subject to significant price volatility. Its value can fluctuate dramatically within short periods, influenced by market sentiment, regulatory news, technological developments, and broader economic factors. Potential Rewards: Capital Appreciation: If Litecoin‚Äôs value increases, MEI Pharma‚Äôs treasury holdings could grow significantly, enhancing its balance sheet. Diversification: Litecoin‚Äôs price movements may not always correlate directly with traditional assets, offering diversification benefits. Innovation & Brand Enhancement: The move positions MEI Pharma as an innovative company, potentially attracting a new demographic of investors interested in digital assets. Key Risks: Market Volatility: A significant drop in LTC‚Äôs price could negatively impact MEI Pharma‚Äôs financial statements and shareholder value. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Adverse regulations could impact LTC‚Äôs value or the ability to hold it. Security Risks: Holding large amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security measures to prevent hacks or loss. Accounting and Reporting Challenges: Accounting for highly volatile digital assets on a corporate balance sheet presents complexities and requires specific expertise. Reputational Risk: If the investment performs poorly, or if the crypto market faces a severe downturn, it could lead to negative public perception and shareholder backlash. The market implications for Litecoin itself are also noteworthy. A $100 million investment from a Nasdaq-listed company could provide a significant boost to LTC‚Äôs visibility and legitimacy, potentially attracting more retail and institutional investors to the asset. It could also encourage other companies to consider Litecoin, creating a positive feedback loop. The Road Ahead: What This Means for Crypto and Corporate Finance MEI Pharma‚Äôs strategic move into a Litecoin Investment for its treasury is a compelling narrative that underscores the ongoing convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset space. It challenges conventional wisdom about corporate treasury management and highlights the increasing willingness of mainstream companies to embrace innovative financial strategies. While the immediate impact on MEI Pharma‚Äôs stock performance and Litecoin‚Äôs price remains to be seen, this development undeniably contributes to the broader narrative of cryptocurrency‚Äôs maturation and integration into the global financial system. It serves as a potent reminder that the digital revolution is not confined to tech startups but is steadily permeating established industries, pushing the boundaries of what is considered conventional. As the landscape continues to evolve, the actions of companies like MEI Pharma will be closely watched, potentially paving the way for even greater institutional engagement with digital assets. Their bold step might just be the catalyst that encourages other cautious corporations to explore the uncharted, yet potentially rewarding, territories of the crypto market.

The reactions follow the publishing of a number of articles by Russian media linked to a registration entry for the popular messenger on the website of Russia‚Äôs telecom watchdog, Roskomnadzor. Telegram reportedly establishing presence in Russia Telegram plans to create a representative office in Russia, local media outlets reported, including the official TASS news agency. The Hi-Tech Mail website claimed to be breaking the news on Thursday, which was later covered by other publications. According to the reports, the company intends to comply with Russia‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúlanding law‚Äù and has already met two of its requirements ‚Äì to open an online account with Roskomnadzor, Russia‚Äôs media censor, and fill out an electronic feedback form. The reports referred to a registration record on the website of Roskomnadzor, or the Federal Service for Supervision of Communications, Information Technology and Mass Media. According to the quoted entry , the British Virgin Islands-registered company is yet to fulfil another obligation under the said legislation ‚Äì ‚Äúto create a branch or open a representative office or found a Russian legal entity.‚Äù Screenshot of Telegram‚Äôs registration record on Roskomnadzor‚Äôs website. Source: Hi-Tech Mail The law ‚ÄúOn the activities of foreign persons in the information and telecommunications network Internet on the territory of the Russian Federation,‚Äù often referred to simply as the ‚Äúlanding law,‚Äù was adopted on July 1, 2021, and came into force on January 1, the following year. Among other requirements, it also obliges foreign firms to install a traffic counter on their platforms, choosing from a list of Roskomnadzor-approved counters, and restrict access to information that has been deemed to violate Russian regulations. It‚Äôs unclear when precisely Telegram started the process, Hi-Tech Mail noted, adding that Roskomnadzor declined to comment on the matter. The Russian edition of Forbes recalled that the messaging app was added to a list of foreign internet companies operating in Russia in November 2021, alongside other well-known global brands such as TikTok, Twitter (now X) and Apple. The ‚Äúlanding law‚Äù requires online platforms with a daily audience exceeding 500,000 users to establish an authorized legal entity in Russia. Failure to comply with the obligation may result in various penalties, ranging from a ban on advertising and accepting payments to blocking access. The magazine‚Äôs requests for comments from both the regulator and the messenger remained unanswered as well, leaving reports that Telegram is opening a Russian office without an official confirmation or denial. ‚Äò100%‚Äô ‚Äì Durov rejects reports Telegram is registering in Russia On Thursday, the Russian-born founder of Telegram posted only ‚Äú100%‚Äù on his Telegram channel as a reply to his previous post, from early July, in which he described the news about the messenger leaving the Russian market as part of a ‚Äútargeted campaign to discredit Telegram,‚Äù implying it‚Äôs a fake. The short comment by the 40-year-old Pavel Durov was interpreted by both Russian and foreign media outlets publishing in the Russian language as a denial of the latest reports that his company is in the process of registering in Russia. The initial information was also rejected by Durov‚Äôs former spokesman, Georgy Lobushkin, who quoted his own source and wrote on his Telegram channel: ‚ÄúThere are no such plans and there can‚Äôt be for many reasons.‚Äù In an interview in June, discussing difficult relations with governments following his arrest in France, Durov made it clear he had no business in Russia or with the government administration under President Vladimir Putin. Last month, lawmaker Anton Gorelkin noted that Telegram has not complied yet with the ‚Äúlanding law,‚Äù remarking it is ‚Äúan entity that worries the state,‚Äù which, in turn, decided to compete with the platform by launching a ‚Äúnational messenger,‚Äù Forbes pointed out. Putin signed a law to establish one at the end of June. According to an earlier statement by Russia‚Äôs Minister of Digital Development Maksut Shadayev, the new service will be based on the Max platform, developed by the popular Russian social media network VK. Formerly known as Vkontakte, VK was also co-founded by Durov almost two decades ago.

For many, the process of navigating legal frameworks, verifying claims, and finding willing buyers for their entitlements has been a labyrinthine nightmare. But now, a beacon of hope has emerged. Crypto exchange Backpack has stepped forward with a groundbreaking, non-profit initiative designed to simplify this arduous journey, offering a direct and no-fee pathway for global FTX creditors to sell their claims to interested third-party buyers. Revolutionary Relief: What Does Backpack Offer FTX Creditors? In a significant announcement made via X (formerly Twitter), Backpack unveiled its dedicated platform, a direct response to the urgent needs of those affected by the FTX debacle. This isn‚Äôt just another marketplace; it‚Äôs a meticulously designed ecosystem where the entire process, from initial identity verification to final settlement, is seamlessly managed within the Backpack environment. The most compelling aspect? It‚Äôs a no-fee service, ensuring that creditors can maximize their potential recovery without incurring additional costs that often erode their already diminished assets. Backpack‚Äôs commitment goes beyond mere facilitation. It embodies a broader vision of supporting the crypto community, especially those in challenging geopolitical circumstances. The company had previously expressed its dedication to assisting FTX creditors , particularly those in regions like China and Russia, who face unique hurdles in accessing and recovering their frozen funds. This new platform is a tangible manifestation of that promise, offering a unified, accessible, and transparent mechanism for claim resolution. Why is Backpack the Go-To Platform to Sell Crypto Claims? The traditional routes for distressed asset recovery can be fraught with intermediaries, high commissions, and bureaucratic delays. Backpack‚Äôs innovative approach to help users sell crypto claims stands in stark contrast. By centralizing the entire transaction flow, Backpack provides an unparalleled level of efficiency and security. Here‚Äôs why this platform is poised to become the preferred solution: Zero Fees: Unlike many other services that charge a percentage of the sale, Backpack‚Äôs non-profit model ensures that creditors retain the full value of their sale, making it an incredibly attractive option. End-to-End Management: From the moment a creditor registers to the final settlement, every step‚Äîidentity verification, claim validation, offer confirmation, and fund transfer‚Äîis handled securely within the Backpack platform. This eliminates the need for multiple third-party services and reduces complexity. Global Accessibility: Designed to serve creditors worldwide, the platform specifically addresses the unique challenges faced by individuals in regions with stricter capital controls or limited access to international financial services. Transparency and Trust: By bringing the entire process in-house, Backpack aims to foster a higher degree of trust and transparency, mitigating the risks associated with less regulated, peer-to-peer claim sales. This streamlined approach empowers individuals to regain control over their financial futures, transforming a previously complex and costly endeavor into a straightforward, user-friendly experience to effectively sell crypto claims . How Does Backpack‚Äôs FTX Claims Platform Work for You? Understanding the operational flow of the FTX claims platform is key to appreciating its efficiency. Backpack has meticulously designed a multi-step process that prioritizes both security and user experience: Identity Verification (KYC/AML): Creditors first undergo a robust Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) check. This crucial step ensures compliance and the legitimacy of all participants. Claim Validation: Once identity is confirmed, creditors submit documentation pertaining to their FTX claim. Backpack‚Äôs team then validates the authenticity and details of the claim, ensuring accuracy for potential buyers. Offer Confirmation: Verified claims are then presented to a network of interested third-party buyers. Creditors receive offers and can review them within the platform, choosing the one that best suits their needs. Secure Settlement: Upon acceptance of an offer, Backpack facilitates the secure transfer of funds from the buyer to the creditor, and the claim ownership is transferred. The entire settlement process is handled internally, minimizing external risks. This integrated approach means that creditors don‚Äôt have to juggle multiple platforms, legal advisors, or payment processors. The FTX claims platform by Backpack acts as a single, secure conduit for resolution, providing peace of mind to those who have already endured significant financial distress. Beyond Recovery: Backpack‚Äôs Vision for Crypto Asset Recovery Backpack‚Äôs initiative is more than just a temporary fix; it signifies a deeper commitment to fostering trust and stability within the broader digital asset ecosystem. The company‚Äôs previous statements about acquiring claims and facilitating repayment underscored their proactive stance in helping the community heal from the FTX fallout. This new platform is a natural evolution of that commitment, solidifying their role as a responsible and innovative player in the crypto space. The concept of efficient crypto asset recovery is vital for the long-term health and reputation of the industry. Incidents like FTX erode public confidence and highlight the need for robust mechanisms to address financial collapses. By providing a no-fee, streamlined solution, Backpack is setting a new standard for how exchanges and platforms can support their users during times of crisis. It demonstrates a commitment to user welfare that extends beyond typical trading services, reinforcing the idea that the industry can self-regulate and provide solutions to its own challenges. What‚Äôs Next for the Backpack Exchange and Its Users? The launch of this no-fee claims platform further solidifies the position of the Backpack exchange as a forward-thinking and user-centric entity in the competitive crypto landscape. While primarily known for its trading services, Backpack is increasingly demonstrating its versatility and dedication to solving real-world problems faced by crypto users. This move is likely to enhance the reputation of the Backpack exchange , attracting not only those seeking claim resolution but also new users who value a platform committed to ethical practices and comprehensive user support. As the crypto industry matures, the focus is shifting from pure speculation to building sustainable, trustworthy infrastructure. Backpack‚Äôs initiative is a significant step in this direction, showcasing how innovation can be leveraged to provide genuine value and support to the global crypto community. It positions Backpack not just as a trading venue, but as a crucial pillar in the evolving landscape of digital finance. A New Dawn for FTX Creditors The journey for FTX creditors has been long and arduous, marked by uncertainty and frustration. However, Backpack‚Äôs launch of a no-fee, non-profit platform to facilitate the sale of FTX claims offers a much-needed ray of hope. By streamlining the entire process and eliminating prohibitive costs, Backpack is empowering individuals worldwide to reclaim a piece of their financial stability. This initiative is a testament to the power of innovation and community-driven solutions in the crypto space, setting a precedent for how future crises might be managed with greater efficiency and empathy. It‚Äôs a powerful step towards restoring trust and enabling recovery for those most impacted by one of crypto‚Äôs largest collapses.

Recently, the crypto community was alerted to a significant development: a massive 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury. This isn‚Äôt just a number; it‚Äôs a signal that can provide valuable insights into the current state and potential future direction of the digital asset landscape. But what exactly does this mean, and why should you pay attention to such a large stablecoin injection? Let‚Äôs unpack this crucial event and explore its wider implications for the market. Understanding the 250 Million USDC Minted Event When we hear about a large sum of USDC minted , it‚Äôs natural to wonder about the mechanics behind it. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar, co-founded by Circle and Coinbase. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, USDC aims to maintain a stable value, making it a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the decentralized world. So, what does it mean for 250 million USDC to be ‚Äúminted‚Äù? Creation of New Supply: Minting refers to the process of creating new tokens. In the case of USDC, this happens when an authorized entity (like Circle) receives fiat currency (USD) from an institutional client or partner. For every dollar received, one USDC is created and put into circulation. Responding to Demand: Large mints, such as this 250 million injection, typically indicate a significant demand for USDC. This demand can come from various sources: institutional investors looking to enter the crypto market, traders seeking liquidity, or decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols requiring stable collateral. Treasury Role: The ‚ÄúUSDC Treasury‚Äù isn‚Äôt a physical vault but rather a digital address or smart contract where newly minted tokens are initially held before being distributed. It‚Äôs a transparent ledger entry, verifiable on the blockchain, showing the creation of these new units. This particular event, reported by Whale Alert, highlights a substantial influx of new capital or a repositioning of existing capital within the crypto ecosystem. It signifies that someone, or a group of entities, has deposited a quarter of a billion US dollars with Circle, expecting an equivalent amount of USDC in return. This action suggests a strong intent to engage with the digital asset space, whether for trading, yield farming, or other investment strategies. Decoding Stablecoin Supply Dynamics and Crypto Market Trends The increase in stablecoin supply is often viewed as a bullish indicator for the broader cryptocurrency market. Why? Because stablecoins like USDC act as a primary on-ramp for fiat currency into the crypto ecosystem. When more stablecoins are minted, it suggests that more traditional capital is entering the space, ready to be deployed into various digital assets. Let‚Äôs consider the dynamics: Increased Liquidity: A larger supply of USDC means more liquidity available within exchanges and DeFi protocols. This increased liquidity can facilitate larger trades, reduce slippage, and make the market more robust. Potential for Buying Pressure: While USDC itself is stable, the reason for its minting is often to purchase other cryptocurrencies. Traders and investors use stablecoins to buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, or altcoins without directly using fiat on exchanges, especially in jurisdictions with strict banking regulations or for speedier transactions. This anticipation of buying pressure can positively influence crypto market trends . DeFi Growth: USDC is a cornerstone of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. It‚Äôs used extensively for lending, borrowing, yield farming, and providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges. A significant increase in USDC supply can fuel further growth in DeFi, leading to higher total value locked (TVL) and more innovative financial products. Historically, periods of significant stablecoin minting have often preceded upward movements in the crypto market. While correlation doesn‚Äôt always imply causation, the logic is sound: new capital entering the ecosystem via stablecoins is typically looking for opportunities to generate returns, and those returns often come from volatile assets. Consider this simplified view: Stablecoin Action Potential Market Impact Reasoning Large Minting (e.g., 250M USDC) Increased Liquidity, Potential Buying Pressure More fiat capital entering crypto, ready for deployment. Large Burning (Redemption) Reduced Liquidity, Potential Selling Pressure Fiat capital exiting crypto, or moving to other stablecoins. Stablecoin Held on Exchanges ‚ÄúDry Powder‚Äù for Future Buys Funds waiting for opportune moments to invest. This 250 million USDC minting event suggests that a substantial amount of ‚Äúdry powder‚Äù is now available, poised to potentially influence future market movements. It‚Äôs a signal that institutional or large-scale retail interest remains strong, indicating confidence in the long-term prospects of digital assets. The Significance of Whale Alert Reports in Tracking Digital Currency The information about the 250 million USDC mint came from Whale Alert , a popular and respected cryptocurrency transaction tracker. Why are reports from services like Whale Alert so important for understanding the flow of digital currency ? Transparency and Visibility: Blockchain technology is inherently transparent. Whale Alert leverages this by monitoring and reporting large transactions across various cryptocurrencies. This provides real-time visibility into significant movements that might otherwise go unnoticed by the average investor. Market Sentiment Indicator: Large transactions, especially those involving stablecoins or significant amounts of Bitcoin and Ethereum, can be powerful indicators of market sentiment. A large stablecoin mint suggests accumulation or preparation for investment, while large transfers to exchanges might indicate selling pressure. Identifying ‚ÄúWhales‚Äù: The term ‚Äúwhale‚Äù refers to an individual or entity holding a substantial amount of cryptocurrency. Whale Alert helps track these movements, giving insights into the activities of major market players whose actions can significantly influence prices. Early Warning System: For astute traders and analysts, Whale Alert reports can act as an early warning system. For instance, a series of large stablecoin mints might suggest an impending rally, while large transfers of volatile assets to exchanges could signal a potential sell-off. In this specific case, Whale Alert‚Äôs report of the 250 million USDC mint immediately brought this significant event to the attention of millions, sparking discussions and analysis across crypto news outlets and social media. It underscores the value of on-chain data in providing a clearer picture of market dynamics beyond just price charts. What Does This Mean for the Broader Digital Currency Ecosystem? The minting of 250 million USDC is not an isolated event; it has ripple effects across the entire digital currency ecosystem. Its implications extend beyond just market prices, touching on liquidity, innovation, and even regulatory landscapes. Benefits of Increased Stablecoin Supply: Enhanced Trading Opportunities: More USDC means more pairs available for trading, and potentially tighter spreads on exchanges. Fueling DeFi Innovation: Developers and protocols can build more robust and complex financial instruments when there‚Äôs ample stablecoin liquidity. This can lead to new lending platforms, decentralized exchanges, and yield-generating opportunities. Institutional Adoption: Large mints often originate from institutional players. This signifies growing confidence from traditional finance in using stablecoins as a gateway into digital assets, paving the way for broader institutional adoption. Cross-Border Payments: USDC facilitates faster, cheaper, and more efficient cross-border transactions compared to traditional banking systems, contributing to global financial inclusivity. Challenges and Considerations: Centralization Concerns: While USDC is transparent, it is centrally issued by Circle. This raises questions about censorship resistance and potential regulatory pressures on the issuer. Regulatory Scrutiny: The growth of stablecoins has attracted significant attention from regulators worldwide. Large movements like this mint could further highlight the need for clear regulatory frameworks, which can be both a benefit (for clarity) and a challenge (if overly restrictive). Market Volatility: While stablecoins are designed to be stable, the influx of capital they represent can contribute to volatility in other crypto assets if deployed rapidly. This substantial USDC mint reinforces the stablecoin‚Äôs critical role as a liquidity backbone for the crypto industry. It signals continued growth and maturity of the digital asset space, attracting both retail and institutional participants looking to leverage the efficiency and innovation offered by blockchain technology. Actionable Insights for the Savvy Investor For those navigating the dynamic world of cryptocurrencies, understanding events like the 250 million USDC minted report offers valuable insights. Here are some actionable takeaways: Monitor Stablecoin Flows: Keep an eye on Whale Alert and similar trackers for significant stablecoin mints and burns. These can be leading indicators of market sentiment and potential price movements. A sustained increase in stablecoin supply often precedes market rallies. Assess Market Liquidity: Increased stablecoin supply typically translates to higher market liquidity. This can mean less slippage on trades and more efficient execution, especially for larger positions. Diversify Your Portfolio: While stablecoins are crucial for liquidity, they don‚Äôt offer capital appreciation. Consider how the influx of stablecoins might be deployed into other assets and adjust your portfolio strategy accordingly. This could involve looking at major cryptocurrencies or promising altcoins that might benefit from new capital. Stay Informed on DeFi Trends: Given USDC‚Äôs prominence in DeFi, an increased supply could indicate a boom in decentralized applications. Explore new yield farming opportunities, lending protocols, and DEXs that might benefit from enhanced liquidity. By staying informed and understanding the underlying mechanics of these large transactions, investors can make more informed decisions and potentially capitalize on emerging trends within the crypto market. Conclusion: A Clear Signal of Continued Growth The recent report of 250 million USDC minted at the USDC Treasury is more than just a headline; it‚Äôs a powerful indicator of the sustained and growing interest in the digital asset space. This substantial increase in stablecoin supply signals enhanced liquidity, potential for significant buying pressure, and a vibrant future for the crypto market trends . As Whale Alert continues to highlight these large movements, it provides invaluable transparency into the actions of major players, offering crucial insights into the evolving landscape of digital currency . Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned investor or new to the space, understanding these fundamental shifts in stablecoin dynamics is key to navigating the opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. This event underscores the increasing maturity and integration of stablecoins as a foundational element of the global financial system, bridging traditional finance with the innovative world of blockchain. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‚Äúminting USDC‚Äù actually mean? A1: Minting USDC means creating new USDC tokens. This occurs when an authorized entity, like Circle, receives an equivalent amount of fiat currency (USD) from a customer. For every US dollar received, one USDC is created and put into circulation, ensuring it remains pegged 1:1 to the dollar. Q2: Why is a large USDC mint considered a bullish sign for the crypto market? A2: A large USDC mint is often seen as bullish because it indicates that a significant amount of traditional capital (USD) is entering the crypto ecosystem. This new capital is typically used to buy other cryptocurrencies, increasing liquidity and potentially leading to upward price pressure on assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Q3: How does Whale Alert track these transactions? A3: Whale Alert monitors public blockchain ledgers. Since all cryptocurrency transactions are recorded on a public blockchain, Whale Alert uses sophisticated algorithms to identify and report unusually large transfers between wallets, exchanges, and treasuries in real-time. Q4: Is USDC truly decentralized? A4: USDC is a centralized stablecoin, meaning it is issued and managed by a specific entity (Circle and Coinbase). While it operates on decentralized blockchains, its issuance and redemption processes are controlled by a central authority, distinguishing it from decentralized stablecoins like DAI. Q5: What are the risks associated with a large stablecoin supply? A5: While a large stablecoin supply generally indicates liquidity, potential risks include increased regulatory scrutiny on issuers, concerns about the transparency and auditability of reserves, and the potential for market volatility if a large portion of the stablecoin supply is suddenly converted into volatile assets or redeemed for fiat. Q6: How can I monitor stablecoin movements myself? A6: You can monitor stablecoin movements by following blockchain explorers for networks like Ethereum (where USDC primarily operates), subscribing to services like Whale Alert, or using crypto market data platforms that track stablecoin market capitalization and on-chain flows.

However, the company faces major risks that can disrupt its business and undermine the future growth of its share price. Circle is SELL for us right now. Circle Internet Group ( CRCL ) has experienced an explosive rally since its IPO in June, soaring by triple-digit percentages in just a few weeks. While the potential implementation of the GENIUS Act and a growing enthusiasm for stablecoins have fueled the rally, we believe the market has misinterpreted Circle‚Äôs business model and overestimated the longevity of its revenue stream. Currently, Circle‚Äôs business model is interest rate-sensitive and is centered around the reserve income from its flagship USDC stablecoin, which carries major risks in our opinion. In addition, the company‚Äôs most important distribution partner, Coinbase, claims a disproportionate share of that income, which greatly limits Circle‚Äôs upside. With a forward non-GAAP P/E of 147x , Circle is also greatly overvalued and is an extremely risky investment right now. For all of those reasons, we decided to rate Circle as a SELL. The Upside Just Isn‚Äôt There Circle‚Äôs business model is tied to interest rate cycles. The company generates more than 95% of its revenue from interest on reserves backed by its USDC stablecoin. This may sound like a fintech version of the traditional banking model, but it lacks key features that banks use to manage interest rate risks. Those features include lending spreads, hedging instruments, or fee diversification mechanisms. Considering that the latest version of the GENIUS Act requires reserves to be held in the form of short-term, liquid US Treasury bills or cash, its full passage in Congress could prevent Circle from hedging its yield risk with longer-term instruments. As a result, the company is extremely vulnerable to lower rates. According to Circle‚Äôs own prospectus , a 100 basis point drop in rates could reduce revenue by more than $400 million, which is roughly 25% of its revenue for fiscal 2024. This could become a major issue later this year since we are likely going to see the start of another round of interest rate cuts by at least 0.5% in September and December under the base case scenario. As such, it‚Äôs safe to say that Circle‚Äôs core profitability is at risk if rates decrease. At the same time, this is not just our speculation on the matter. The company itself has indicated that this could become an issue in its IPO prospectus. Circle IPO prospectus (company investor relations) Also, it‚Äôs worth considering Circle‚Äôs business relationship with Coinbase. At first glance, Circle‚Äôs partnership with Coinbase may seem like a strategic opportunity to grow the business. However, if we look closely at the details of their partnership, it becomes clear that it could be considered an economic liability for Circle. After all, Coinbase receives up to 60% of the reserve revenue, depending on how much USDC is stored on its platform. This revenue-sharing arrangement effectively caps Circle‚Äôs gross profit, and as Coinbase‚Äôs share of USDC circulation grows, the squeeze only gets worse over time. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not a surprise to see that in 2024, Circle generated $1.66 billion and paid out over $907 million to Coinbase alone. This severely limits Circle‚Äôs ability to reinvest in new growth verticals or weather macroeconomic headwinds. What‚Äôs worse is that as Circle adds more distributors to expand USDC adoption, its overall payout obligations are expected to grow even further. This one-sided economic situation highlights a serious structural problem. Circle is trying to build a long-term infrastructure business on top of short-term rentals, but it is also paying a lot for access. This makes us believe that the upside for Circle just isn‚Äôt there. The Intrinsic Value of a Circle Our valuation model shows that Circle‚Äôs intrinsic value is only $131.13 per share. With interest rate and other risks highlighted above on the rise, we believe that a ~40% depreciation of its shares is viable at this point. The math behind our intrinsic value calculation can be seen below. The perpetual growth rate in the model is 3%, which we use all the time when valuing US companies . The model was created when Circle was trading at $233.20 per share. The balance sheet data has been taken from the latest report. The discount rate in the model is 11.11%. We calculated it by figuring out Circle‚Äôs cost of equity and cost of debt. To calculate the cost of debt, we used its TTM numbers . To calculate the cost of equity, we used the CAPM model, using a risk-free rate of 4.30% and a market return rate of 7.77%. Due to the recency of Circle‚Äôs IPO, there is currently no reliable beta available for the company. The stock has experienced extreme price volatility since listing, with short-term price action reflecting speculative sentiment rather than true systemic risk. That‚Äôs why we assumed the beta to be 2, which reflects the elevated risk profile associated with Circle‚Äôs business model. Circle‚Äôs valuation model (Bears of Wall Street) Our revenue and EBIT forecasts for Circle are broadly aligned with the consensus expectation . Using these assumptions, our model calculates Circle‚Äôs enterprise value at $6.47 billion. By adding cash and cash equivalents and deducting total outstanding debt, we arrive at an equity value of $7.27 billion. After that, we divided the company‚Äôs equity value by the number of its outstanding shares and figured out that Circle‚Äôs intrinsic value is $131.13 per share, which is around 44% below the current market price. Considering the high valuation and all the risks described above, we decided to rate Circle as a SELL. Circle‚Äôs valuation model (Bears of Wall Street) Risks To Our Bearish Thesis While we remain firmly bearish about Circle at current levels, there are several possible scenarios that could challenge our view on this company. Firstly, broader adoption of USDC in real-world commerce, particularly through integration with platforms like Shopify, Stripe, or Coinbase‚Äôs Base Layer-2 network, could accelerate reserve growth beyond current expectations. If Circle can scale USDC as a de facto digital dollar for mainstream transactions, the revenue base could expand even if interest rates fall. Secondly, the potential restructuring of the revenue-sharing agreement with Coinbase would be a significant positive. If Circle can renegotiate more favorable terms or diversify its distribution network to reduce its reliance on any partner, then the margin pressure could ease. Thirdly, international expansion and institutional partnership with companies like Visa and Mastercard could open up new non-yield revenue streams and would offer a greater growth potential over time. Also, if interest rates remain higher for longer than forecasted, then Circle could continue to generate increased yield-based income in the foreseeable future. Final Thoughts Circle may be one of the pioneers of the stablecoin space, but its current valuation ignores critical risks like the rate sensitivity, over-distribution of revenue, and increased competition. Because of that, it makes the most sense to rate its stock as a SELL right now.",CRCL,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|EXCHANGE|USDC|FIAT,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-18 14:00:00

However, the token price started to slide soon after the launch, based on selling from whale buyers and even the developer wallet. The Pump.fun ICO became the third largest in history, after raising $500M for a $6B valuation for the meme platform. Pump.fun lines up behind TON and EOS, who raised billions. Now, the meme platform is facing skepticism that its high-profile event would not lead to growth. Based on Chainalysis data, Pump.fun still managed to hold an event outperforming some of the top projects from the 2017 ICO era. üìäChart of the Week üìä https://t.co/XWHZjKIU8E ‚Äôs recent ICO became the third largest in history, raising approximately $600 million in under ‚åöÔ∏è15 minutes.

The Pump.fun ICO was also comparable to this year‚Äôs crypto IPOs, as it closed in on Circle‚Äôs valuation of around $8B based on the initial IPO price. The Pump.fun token sale also angered the community, as there was no airdrop or reward for long-term traders and meme creators. The Pump.fun team has hinted at an airdrop multiple times, but still showed whales were a priority in distributing PUMP. PUMP crashes despite buyback attempt Just two days after the token launch, PUMP erased 20% from its presale price. The token still relies on decentralized pairs with volatile liquidity, easily leading to a slump to the $0.004 range. Previously, PUMP managed to climb above $0.006, though still facing pressure from whales and short sellers. The short-term rally coincided with a buyback attempt from the Pump.fun team. The PUMP ICO was distributed between whales and retail wallets, with around 55% of participants participating with less than $1,000. A total of 202 wallets spent over $1M on the ICO. Most of the recipients of PUMP moved their tokens, with around 20% sending their allocation directly to exchanges. | Source: Dune Analytics In the first days after the sale, a total of 1,850 wallets held their original allocation. 2,937 wallets sent their PUMP allocation immediately to exchanges, while another 5,044 wallets moved the tokens, with no clear sign of intentions to sell. Pump.fun token activity tanks with increased competition PUMP underperformed despite the positive performance of the entire crypto market. The ICO happened during peak trading times, but the market had little appetite for new assets while BTC was making new records. PUMP also faces pressure from the slowing activity and fee generation on Pump.fun. The platform only had 77 tokens graduate in the past 24 hours, with 288 new memes coming from LetsBonk. The new platform also produced its first token valued at over $10M after graduation. The setback for Pump.fun may be temporary, as the meme launchpad has previously seen slower periods. However, having a new venue for the trenches may displace Pump.fun from the top. LetsBonk daily fees also expanded to a record of $1.69M, while Pump.fun is down to $550K in 24 hours. Some of the losses on the meme launchpad coincided with upturn in revenue for PumpSwap DEX, which still achieves $1.66M in daily fees. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

A significant transaction, specifically the USDC minting of 250 million tokens at the USDC Treasury , has sent ripples across the market. This isn‚Äôt just a large number; it‚Äôs a potential indicator of shifting demand, increased crypto liquidity , and evolving dynamics within the broader stablecoin market . What does such a substantial minting event truly signify for the future of digital currency and the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem? Understanding USDC Minting: Why Does it Matter? To grasp the full impact of this 250 million USDC minting, it‚Äôs crucial to understand what USDC is and why its creation, or ‚Äòminting,‚Äô is a noteworthy event. USDC, or USD Coin, is a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the US dollar. It‚Äôs managed by Centre, a consortium founded by Circle and Coinbase, and is designed to provide stability in the volatile crypto space. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, USDC aims to maintain a constant value, making it ideal for: Trading: Facilitating quick and stable transfers between different cryptocurrencies without converting back to fiat. DeFi: Serving as a primary collateral asset and medium of exchange in decentralized applications, lending protocols, and liquidity pools. Payments: Offering a fast and low-cost alternative for international remittances and online transactions. Hedging: Providing a safe haven for crypto investors during periods of high market volatility. When new USDC is minted, it means that new US dollar reserves have been deposited by institutional clients or large entities into the USDC Treasury , backing these newly created digital tokens. This process is a direct response to demand, signaling that significant capital is looking to enter or move within the crypto ecosystem via a stable, dollar-backed asset. The Power of 250 Million: What Does it Mean for Crypto Liquidity? A quarter of a billion dollars is a substantial sum in any financial market, and its introduction into the crypto space through USDC minting has immediate implications for crypto liquidity . Increased liquidity is generally a positive sign for market health, as it means: Easier Trading: Larger orders can be filled with less slippage, making it more attractive for institutional investors and large traders. Reduced Volatility: A deeper market with more participants can absorb large buy or sell orders more effectively, potentially leading to less drastic price swings. Enhanced DeFi Functionality: More USDC means more capital available for lending, borrowing, and providing liquidity in decentralized exchanges, boosting the overall utility and efficiency of DeFi protocols. This fresh injection of USDC could be earmarked for various purposes: funding new investments, providing liquidity to decentralized exchanges, facilitating over-the-counter (OTC) trades, or even preparing for upcoming institutional crypto product launches. It underscores a growing confidence in stablecoins as a fundamental building block of the evolving financial landscape. Whale Alert and the Stablecoin Market: A Transparent Glimpse The report originated from Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracker that monitors large cryptocurrency transactions. Their role is crucial in providing transparency to a market that operates 24/7. When Whale Alert flags a massive USDC minting event, it‚Äôs not just news; it‚Äôs a real-time signal that sophisticated players are making significant moves. This transparency helps market participants gauge potential shifts in sentiment and capital flow. The stablecoin market , dominated by giants like Tether (USDT) and USDC, is a critical barometer for the health and direction of the broader crypto economy. Minting events like this one directly impact the supply dynamics of these crucial assets. An increase in USDC supply often suggests: Aspect Potential Impact of USDC Minting Market Capitalization Increases the total market cap of USDC, strengthening its position. Arbitrage Opportunities Can create temporary arbitrage opportunities between exchanges as liquidity adjusts. Institutional Interest Signals sustained or growing institutional demand for stable, regulated crypto assets. DeFi Growth Fuels further expansion and innovation within the decentralized finance sector. This particular minting at the USDC Treasury indicates robust demand for dollar-backed digital assets, which is a positive sign for the continued integration of traditional finance with the crypto world. Digital Currency: Paving the Way for Mainstream Adoption? The consistent growth and increasing utility of stablecoins like USDC are pivotal in bridging the gap between traditional finance and the nascent world of digital currency . As more institutions, businesses, and even governments explore the potential of blockchain technology, stablecoins offer a familiar and reliable entry point. This 250 million USDC minting event is not an isolated incident but rather part of a larger trend where digital dollars are becoming an indispensable tool for global commerce and investment. They offer advantages such as: Speed: Near-instantaneous transactions across borders. Cost-Efficiency: Lower fees compared to traditional banking wires. Accessibility: 24/7 access to financial services without geographical limitations. Programmability: The ability to embed logic into transactions for smart contracts and automated payments. As central banks worldwide research and develop Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs), the success and infrastructure built by stablecoins like USDC provide valuable insights and a potential blueprint for future financial systems. The minting of such large sums reinforces the idea that digital, programmable money is not just a futuristic concept but a present-day reality rapidly gaining traction. Visual representation of digital currency flowing into the crypto market, highlighting the impact of large stablecoin minting events. Challenges and Considerations: What Should Investors Watch For? While the large-scale USDC minting event is largely positive, it‚Äôs also important to consider potential challenges and implications: Centralization Concerns: USDC, while transparently backed, is a centralized stablecoin. This means its issuance and redemption are controlled by Centre. Regulatory pressure or policy changes could impact its operation. Regulatory Scrutiny: As stablecoins grow, so does the attention from regulators. Future regulations could impose stricter requirements on reserves, auditing, and operational procedures. Market Saturation: While demand is high, an oversupply of stablecoins could, in theory, lead to competitive pressures or shifts in preferred stablecoin usage. For investors, understanding these nuances is key. It‚Äôs not just about the numbers; it‚Äôs about the underlying mechanisms and the broader regulatory environment that shapes the future of the stablecoin market . Actionable Insights for Navigating the New Wave How can you leverage insights from this significant USDC minting event? Here are a few actionable points: Monitor Liquidity: Keep an eye on USDC liquidity across exchanges and DeFi protocols. Increased liquidity can indicate opportunities for larger trades or better yields in lending. Diversify Stablecoin Holdings: While USDC is strong, consider diversifying a portion of your stablecoin holdings across other reputable stablecoins like USDT or DAI to mitigate single-point risks. Explore DeFi Opportunities: With more USDC entering the ecosystem, look for new or enhanced opportunities in decentralized finance, such as staking, yield farming, or providing liquidity to new pools. Stay Informed on Regulations: Follow news regarding stablecoin regulations. Future policies could significantly impact how these assets are used and managed. Understand the Macro Picture: This minting reflects broader demand for digital currency . Consider how this trend aligns with your long-term investment strategy in the crypto space. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Crypto‚Äôs Evolving Landscape The 250 million USDC minting event at the USDC Treasury , as reported by Whale Alert, is more than just a transaction; it‚Äôs a powerful signal. It highlights robust demand for dollar-backed digital currency , reinforcing the critical role stablecoins play in driving crypto liquidity and facilitating growth within the decentralized finance sector. This event underscores the increasing maturity of the stablecoin market and its undeniable influence on the broader crypto economy. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, stablecoins like USDC will remain at the forefront, bridging traditional finance with the innovative possibilities of blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when USDC is ‚Äòminted‚Äô? When USDC is ‚Äòminted,‚Äô it means that new USDC tokens are created and added to the circulating supply. This process is initiated when users or institutions deposit an equivalent amount of US dollars into the reserves managed by Centre (Circle and Coinbase), ensuring that each USDC token is backed 1:1 by real-world assets. Q2: Why is a 250 million USDC minting event significant? A 250 million USDC minting event is significant because it represents a substantial influx of capital into the crypto ecosystem. It indicates strong demand for dollar-backed stablecoins, suggesting increased interest from large investors or institutions looking to engage in crypto trading, DeFi activities, or other blockchain-based transactions, thereby boosting overall crypto liquidity. Q3: How does USDC minting affect the stablecoin market? USDC minting directly increases the supply of USDC within the stablecoin market. This can lead to increased competition among stablecoins, potentially driving down transaction costs or creating more opportunities for arbitrage. More broadly, it signals growth and confidence in the utility of stablecoins as a foundational element of digital finance. Q4: What is the role of the USDC Treasury in this process? The USDC Treasury acts as the central reserve where the US dollar backing for USDC is held. When new USDC is minted, it is done from this treasury, ensuring that every newly created USDC token is collateralized by an equivalent amount of fiat currency, maintaining its 1:1 peg to the US dollar. Q5: Is USDC a truly decentralized digital currency? While USDC operates on decentralized blockchains (like Ethereum), it is considered a centralized stablecoin because its issuance, redemption, and backing are managed by a centralized entity (Centre consortium, comprising Circle and Coinbase). Its reserves are regularly audited for transparency. Did you find this analysis helpful?

Reacting to a post by Arrington Capital founder Michael Arrington, who wrote, ‚ÄúXRP is just showing off at this point,‚Äù Deaton replied: ‚ÄúAfter being held down for 4 years, on behalf of 75K XRP holders, it‚Äôs about time!‚Äù Deaton‚Äôs comment isn‚Äôt just a passing remark; it echoes years of legal struggle, retail frustration, and the fight for fair treatment under U.S. securities law. A Four-Year Battle Comes to Fruition The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Ripple Labs in December 2020, alleging that the company conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP. The lawsuit immediately triggered massive losses for retail investors, as XRP was delisted from major exchanges and its price crashed. After being held down for 4 years ‚Äì on behalf of 75K XRP holders ‚Äì it‚Äôs about time! https://t.co/poHkmj2f6M ‚Äî John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) July 18, 2025 In response, John Deaton, founder of CryptoLaw, filed an amicus brief on behalf of more than 75,000 XRP holders from over 140 countries, a legal action that became a central pillar in Ripple‚Äôs defense. Deaton argued that the SEC failed to distinguish between Ripple‚Äôs institutional sales and the secondary market activity of everyday XRP holders. The legal tide turned in July 2023 when Judge Analisa Torres ruled that XRP, when sold on public exchanges, does not constitute a security, a decision widely seen as a landmark victory for the crypto community. While Ripple was still found liable for some institutional sales, the verdict delivered long-sought clarity for retail users. XRP Price Breaks Free After years of legal uncertainty, XRP is finally surging. As of July 18, 2025, XRP is trading at approximately $3.60, representing a 20% increase in 24 hours. The token is nearing its all-time high of $3.84 recorded in early 2018, though some analysts and Ripple‚Äôs CTO have clarified that the figure was largely illiquid. Open interest in XRP futures has exceeded $10 billion, indicating strong institutional and speculative demand. Analysts forecast an imminent rally toward $4.00, with bullish sentiment targeting $4.47 in the medium term. Some projections even place XRP between $5 and $10 by early 2026, depending on institutional adoption and broader market trends. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Institutional Confidence and ETF Breakthrough The XRP market is further bolstered by recent developments in financial infrastructure. Most notably, the launch of a ProShares XRP ETF has opened the doors for institutional investors to gain regulated exposure to XRP. Deaton highlighted the ETF approval as a direct result of the legal clarity that 75,000 XRP holders fought to establish. This ETF debut is more than symbolic; it signals Wall Street‚Äôs increasing comfort with XRP and further legitimizes it as a long-term digital asset. A Symbolic Victory for the XRP Army For Deaton and the tens of thousands of XRP holders he represented, this moment is deeply meaningful. It validates the years-long campaign against regulatory overreach and highlights the power of organized retail advocacy. ‚ÄúAfter being held down for 4 years, on behalf of 75K XRP holders, it‚Äôs about time,‚Äù Deaton wrote. And indeed, with XRP finally unshackled, surging in price, and gaining institutional legitimacy, it seems that the time has arrived.

Its pump came shortly after Coinbase listed it with an Experimental label. The Major Increase The cryptocurrency market has been booming in the last several days, with Ripple (XRP) , Ethereum (ETH), Stellar (XLM), and many more posting serious price jumps . However, the lesser-known altcoin Caldera (ERA) outperformed all top 100 coins in terms of daily gains, spiking by nearly 75%. ERA Price, Source: CoinGecko Despite its surge, the asset remains far from crypto‚Äôs elite, with a market capitalization of approximately $217 million. The impressive performance was likely fueled by Coinbase‚Äôs decision to add the token to its iOS & Android applications with the ‚ÄúExperimental‚Äù label. ‚ÄúCoinbase customers can log in to buy, sell, convert, send, receive, or store these assets,‚Äù the announcement reads. The disclosure comes a few hours after the exchange revealed it will add support for ERA on the Ethereum network. It also warned users against sending the asset via other networks, as this could result in the loss of funds. Cryptocurrencies included in the Experimental label section are either newly added to the platform or have relatively low trading volume. Coinbase has previously advised people to pay extra attention to such coins, as they come with certain risks, such as increased price volatility. The firm‚Äôs backing typically has a positive influence on the price of the involved cryptocurrencies, due to factors like increased liquidity, improved accessibility, and a reputational boost. Earlier this year, the meme coin Toshi (TOSHI) validated that thesis with a price surge of over 110% shortly after being added to Coinbase‚Äôs roadmap. When Coinbase Says Goodbye The price reaction of the cryptocurrencies that are delisted from the exchange is usually much different. Two months ago, Coinbase disclosed that it will terminate all trading services with Helium Mobile (MOBILE), Render (RNDR), Ribbon Finance (RBN), & Synapse (SYN). Some of the affected plunged by around 15% after the news. Similar things are observed when other crypto behemoths remove assets from their platforms.

That‚Äôs exactly how far he said he is willing to go to finish his four-year term, no matter what pressure Donald Trump threw at him. The statement is detailed in Trillion Dollar Triage by Nick Timiraos, who reported Powell‚Äôs private refusal to walk away even under threat. Powell told people behind the scenes: ‚ÄúYou will not see me getting in the lifeboat. I will never, ever, ever leave this job voluntarily until my term ends under any circumstances. None, whatsoever. It doesn‚Äôt occur to me in the slightest that there would be any situation in which I would not complete my term other than dying.‚Äù Powell‚Äôs resistance was tested publicly in 2019, when Trump was loudly criticizing Powell‚Äôs handling of interest rates . At a hearing held by the House Financial Services Committee, chaired by California Democrat Maxine Waters, Powell was asked directly how he‚Äôd respond if Trump called to fire him. ‚ÄúMr. Chairman, if you got a call from the president today or tomorrow, and he said, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm firing you. Pack up, it‚Äôs time to go,‚Äô what would you do?‚Äù Waters asked. Powell said, ‚ÄúWell, of course I would not do that.‚Äù When Waters said she couldn‚Äôt hear him, Powell repeated himself: ‚ÄúMy answer would be ‚Äòno.‚Äô‚Äù She followed up again: ‚ÄúAnd you would not pack up and you would not leave?‚Äù Powell answered, ‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù When asked if that was because he believed the president lacked the authority, he said, ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôve said is that the law clearly gives me a four-year term, and I fully intend to serve it.‚Äù Powell faces criminal referral over renovation testimony Now in 2025, Powell is facing heat again, this time not just from Trump, but from the entire Capitol Hill. On Thursday, Chairman of the Board of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Bill Pulte, posted on X that Powell could be criminally referred to the Justice Department for alleged perjury. ‚ÄúI am told by very reliable Congressional sources that there may be a criminal referral coming from one or more Congress members to the DOJ for Jay Powell‚Äôs alleged perjury about the $2.5BN building,‚Äù Pulte wrote. Just an hour later, Republican Representative Anna Paulina Luna did exactly that. She formally referred Powell to the DOJ, accusing him of misleading Congress about the Federal Reserve‚Äôs $2.5 billion headquarters renovation in Washington, D.C. Powell had testified during last month‚Äôs Senate Banking Committee hearing that the cost overruns were due to unavoidable construction challenges and inflation. Lawmakers weren‚Äôt buying it, with some describing the project as excessive. CNN reported that Powell had asked the Fed‚Äôs inspector general to carry out an additional review of the building project, which was originally approved by the Fed‚Äôs board in 2017 with a price tag of $1.9 billion. Construction began in 2021, but the cost rose to $2.5 billion due to what Powell described as ‚Äúunforeseen conditions.‚Äù These included ‚Äúmore asbestos than anticipated,‚Äù ‚Äútoxic contamination in soil,‚Äù and a ‚Äúhigher-than-expected water table,‚Äù as outlined on the Fed‚Äôs official website. Trump says Powell‚Äôs building scandal might justify firing During the Senate hearing, Powell told lawmakers, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no new marble. There‚Äôs no special elevators. They‚Äôre old elevators that have been there. There are no new water features. There‚Äôs no beehives and there‚Äôs no roof garden terraces.‚Äù He said the money wasn‚Äôt being wasted on luxury features and clarified that taxpayers weren‚Äôt paying for the project. ‚ÄúThe Fed is funding the renovation,‚Äù Powell said, confirming the estimated final cost at approximately $2.5 billion. Despite all the legal insulation Powell believes he has, Trump has said that the renovation saga might be enough grounds to fire Powell ‚Äúfor fraud,‚Äù though he added it was ‚Äúhighly unlikely.‚Äù Even so, the comment adds to the mounting political scrutiny Powell is now dealing with. So while Powell has never budged in the face of political threats and once claimed only death would stop him from serving his full term, Congress and Trump may both test how far that commitment really goes. But as of now, Powell hasn‚Äôt even taken the bait to clap back publicly. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

As a result, the SUI price momentum displayed in the past 25 days has led its price to surge past the $4 mark. The renewed bullishness, with technical and fundamental factors, is all signals for another potential breakout. So far, with BTC hitting a new all-time high at $123K, SUI has followed closely, benefiting from rising investor optimism and enhanced network utility. If more demand comes into the market, the rise is imminent. Institutional Demand and Record TVL Support SUI Price Trajectory A key catalyst for the current SUI price momentum is the exponential growth in its TVL, which recently hit an all-time high of $2.25 billion, per the Sui Network‚Äôs official X account. This indicates a surge in institutional participation and capital inflows into the ecosystem. Sui just crossed $2.25B TVL. It‚Äôs Sui Summer and we‚Äôre in full builder mode. pic.twitter.com/7lIn1PSn4x ‚Äî Sui (@SuiNetwork) July 17, 2025 This record TVL suggests not only increased user activity of investors and developers on the network, but also long-term confidence in the protocol‚Äôs stability and scalability can be measured from this metric. The rise in TVL reveals the SUI crypto‚Äôs expanding DeFi footprint that adds a strong fundamental base for the future appreciation. Technical Breakout Validates Bullish SUI Price Prediction From a technical standpoint, SUI recently reclaimed the $4 level, which was last seen in mid-May 2025. This level now acts as a key support zone, boosting the SUI price prediction for the near term. When writing, the sui price today, currently hovering just above the $4 threshold, reflects this growing trust in the network‚Äôs potential. Analysts have noted that the SUI price USD has broken out of a multi-month consolidation triangle, and has been confirming a bullish continuation setup. Prominent trader CryptoWolf noted in a recent post that the breakout could open up room for targets at $5.32, $6.53, and eventually $7.60, if momentum remains intact. $SUI broke out of a multi-month triangle with strong momentum!

Utility-Driven Rally Strengthened by NEAR Protocol Integration Beyond price action and adoption metrics, SUI Network‚Äôs latest integration with NEAR Protocol‚Äôs ‚ÄúIntents‚Äù adds a utility layer that could prove transformational.

It also reinforces the network‚Äôs narrative as a scalable Layer 1 blockchain, likely contributing to the positive SUI price USD momentum.

For anyone tracking the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape, understanding the pulse of traditional financial markets is paramount. Today‚Äôs positive open on Wall Street sends a clear signal of strengthening market sentiment , a factor that often ripples through various asset classes, including digital currencies. Why Are US Stock Markets Opening Higher Today? Today‚Äôs upward trajectory in the US stock market indices reflects a renewed sense of optimism among investors. As trading commenced, the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all posted gains, indicating broad-based positive momentum. Here‚Äôs a quick look at the opening figures: S&P 500: +0.26% NASDAQ: +0.23% Dow Jones: +0.19% Several factors contribute to such an encouraging start. Often, positive corporate earnings reports, favorable economic data releases, or even shifts in monetary policy expectations can fuel investor enthusiasm. A strong start like this typically suggests that investors are shrugging off immediate concerns and focusing on potential growth opportunities. This positive outlook cultivates a healthier environment for various investments. How Does This Positive Market Sentiment Influence Crypto? The correlation between traditional financial markets and the burgeoning crypto space has become increasingly evident, particularly over the past few years. When market sentiment in the stock market is positive, it often translates into increased risk appetite across the board. Cryptocurrencies, often viewed as risk-on assets, tend to benefit from this shift. Historically, the NASDAQ, with its heavy weighting towards technology stocks, has shown a notable correlation with Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies. This is because many crypto investors are also tech-savvy individuals or institutions who participate in both markets. A buoyant NASDAQ can suggest a willingness among these investors to allocate capital towards growth-oriented assets, including digital assets. This ripple effect is a crucial aspect of understanding the broader crypto market impact . What Key Economic Indicators Should Crypto Investors Watch? While the immediate gains in the US stock market are encouraging, savvy crypto investors understand that these movements are often driven by underlying economic indicators . Keeping an eye on these broader economic signals can provide foresight into future market trends: Inflation Data (CPI, PCE): High inflation can prompt central banks to raise interest rates, potentially making riskier assets like crypto less attractive. Conversely, cooling inflation might signal a more accommodative monetary policy. Interest Rate Decisions (Federal Reserve): The Fed‚Äôs stance on interest rates directly influences borrowing costs and investor liquidity. Lower rates generally favor growth assets. Employment Reports (Non-Farm Payrolls, Unemployment Rate): Strong employment figures often indicate a healthy economy, which can bolster consumer spending and corporate profits, indirectly supporting risk assets. GDP Growth: A robust Gross Domestic Product suggests economic expansion, which typically correlates with stronger equity markets and, by extension, a more confident environment for crypto investments. Monitoring these indicators helps investors gauge the overall economic health and anticipate potential shifts in investor confidence that could affect both stocks and crypto. Are There Any Challenges Amidst This Optimism? While today‚Äôs market open paints a rosy picture, it‚Äôs essential for investors to maintain a balanced perspective. Even during periods of high investor confidence , challenges can emerge. These might include: Persistent Inflation Concerns: Despite recent improvements, inflation could prove stickier than anticipated, leading to renewed hawkishness from central banks. Geopolitical Tensions: Unforeseen global events can quickly dampen market sentiment and trigger risk-off behavior, impacting both traditional and crypto markets. Regulatory Uncertainty: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies, particularly in the US, remains a significant factor that can introduce volatility and uncertainty. Corporate Earnings Volatility: While some companies may report strong earnings, others might disappoint, leading to sector-specific or broader market corrections. Understanding these potential headwinds allows investors to build more resilient portfolios and adapt their strategies as market conditions evolve, regardless of the immediate US stock market performance. What‚Äôs Next for the Crypto Market? The positive opening of the US stock market today provides a supportive backdrop for the cryptocurrency market. When traditional finance is strong, it often suggests a greater willingness for capital to flow into riskier, high-growth sectors like digital assets. This positive momentum can reinforce bullish narratives and encourage new investments. However, the crypto market is also influenced by its own unique catalysts, such as technological advancements, network upgrades (like Ethereum‚Äôs upcoming developments), institutional adoption, and specific project news. While macro trends from the US stock market provide a general directional bias, crypto‚Äôs inherent volatility and innovation cycles mean it can sometimes decouple or amplify these movements. For long-term crypto holders, today‚Äôs news is a positive reinforcement of the broader financial environment. For those looking to enter or increase their positions, it highlights the importance of observing not just crypto-specific news but also the health of global financial markets and the overall market sentiment . In conclusion, today‚Äôs strong opening for the US stock market indices ‚Äì S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones ‚Äì is a welcome sign of robust investor confidence . This positive market sentiment often serves as a tailwind for the cryptocurrency market, reinforcing the interconnectedness of global financial systems. While crypto has its own unique drivers, a healthy traditional market environment generally fosters greater risk appetite, leading to a potentially favorable crypto market impact . As investors navigate these waters, keeping an eye on key economic indicators will remain crucial for informed decision-making. The synergy between traditional and digital assets continues to evolve, making comprehensive market analysis more important than ever. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: How closely are the US stock market and cryptocurrency markets linked? A1: While not always perfectly correlated, there‚Äôs a growing linkage, especially between tech-heavy indices like the NASDAQ and major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Positive sentiment in stocks often leads to increased risk appetite, benefiting crypto, and vice-versa during downturns. Q2: What does ‚Äúinvestor confidence‚Äù mean in the context of market performance? A2: Investor confidence refers to the degree of optimism or pessimism investors feel about the state of the economy and financial markets. High confidence typically leads to more investment and higher asset prices, while low confidence can lead to selling and market declines. Q3: Can the crypto market still perform well if the US stock market is struggling? A3: Yes, it‚Äôs possible. While correlations exist, the crypto market can sometimes decouple due to unique factors like specific technological advancements, regulatory clarity, or significant institutional adoption within the crypto space itself. However, prolonged struggles in the broader economy can make sustained crypto rallies challenging. Q4: What are the primary drivers of positive market sentiment in traditional finance? A4: Key drivers include strong corporate earnings, positive economic data (e.g., low unemployment, healthy GDP growth), favorable interest rate policies from central banks, and a reduction in geopolitical tensions. These factors collectively build investor confidence. Q5: How can I use economic indicators to inform my crypto investment strategy? A5: By monitoring economic indicators like inflation rates, interest rate decisions, and employment data, you can anticipate broader market shifts. For example, if inflation is cooling, it might suggest a less aggressive stance from central banks, which could be positive for risk assets like crypto.

This move would represent an increase of around 33% from the lower end of the current price range. Support levels are at $1.96 and $1.23 in case of a pullback. The positive MACD level of 0.05157 reinforces the bullish outlook as the crypto market gears up for a potential altcoin season. Conclusion XRP and other coins show promise in the bull run, but XYZVerse‚Äôs pioneering sports memecoin aims for 20,000% growth, offering exceptional potential for early investors.

For investors tracking the digital economy, the recent performance of Coinbase stock has been nothing short of electrifying. On July 18, Coinbase (COIN) made headlines by hitting an unprecedented $435.7, marking a significant milestone for the leading crypto exchange and the broader cryptocurrency market. This surge wasn‚Äôt just a fleeting moment; it represented a remarkable 71% increase over the past month and a solid 5.97% jump from the previous trading day, according to TradingView data. But what exactly fueled this impressive climb, and what does it signify for the future of digital assets and the companies building their infrastructure? The Unprecedented Ascent of Coinbase Stock: A Deep Dive into COIN‚Äôs Record High The journey of Coinbase (COIN) to its all-time high of $435.7 on July 18 is a story of market confidence and a growing appetite for exposure to the digital economy. This isn‚Äôt just a number; it reflects strong investor belief in Coinbase‚Äôs business model and its position at the forefront of the burgeoning crypto space. When a stock reaches such a peak, it often signals a combination of robust company performance, positive market sentiment, and increasing adoption of the underlying industry. For COIN, this particular high point came after a period of significant growth. The 71% climb in just one month highlights intense buying pressure and a rapid re-evaluation of the company‚Äôs value by the market. This kind of momentum often attracts further attention, drawing in new investors eager to participate in the rally. It also solidifies Coinbase‚Äôs status as a bellwether for the crypto industry within traditional financial markets. Understanding the significance of this all-time high requires looking beyond just the daily fluctuations. It speaks to the long-term potential investors see in Coinbase as a regulated, publicly traded gateway to the world of cryptocurrencies. This sustained interest in Coinbase stock suggests that many view it not just as a speculative play, but as a fundamental infrastructure provider for the financial system of tomorrow. Unpacking the Factors Driving the COIN Price Surge: What‚Äôs Fueling the Rally? The remarkable surge in COIN price isn‚Äôt attributable to a single factor but rather a confluence of powerful forces shaping both the crypto industry and traditional financial markets. Let‚Äôs explore some of the key drivers: Broader Cryptocurrency Market Bull Run: Perhaps the most direct influence, the overall upward trend in the cryptocurrency market has provided a significant tailwind for Coinbase. When Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major digital assets experience rallies, trading volumes on platforms like Coinbase naturally increase, directly boosting the company‚Äôs revenue from transaction fees. A buoyant crypto market translates to more activity, which directly benefits a leading crypto exchange. Increasing Institutional Adoption: More and more institutional investors, from hedge funds to corporate treasuries, are allocating capital to digital assets . Coinbase, with its robust security, regulatory compliance efforts, and institutional-grade services (like Coinbase Prime), is a preferred partner for these large players. This influx of institutional money not only legitimizes the crypto space but also drives significant volume through Coinbase‚Äôs platforms. Strong Company Fundamentals and Product Expansion: Beyond market sentiment, Coinbase‚Äôs own performance plays a crucial role. The company has consistently demonstrated strong user growth, expanding product offerings (such as staking services, Coinbase Wallet, and NFT marketplace initiatives), and strategic acquisitions. These developments enhance its ecosystem and diversify its revenue streams beyond just trading fees. Anticipation of Regulatory Clarity: While the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies remains evolving, any signs of potential clarity or favorable frameworks can significantly boost investor confidence in regulated entities like Coinbase. The prospect of clearer rules can attract more traditional investors who have been hesitant due to uncertainty. Retail Investor Enthusiasm: A new wave of retail investors, often driven by social media trends and a desire to participate in disruptive technologies, has also contributed to increased trading activity. Coinbase‚Äôs user-friendly interface and brand recognition make it a go-to platform for many entering the crypto space for the first time. These interconnected factors create a powerful positive feedback loop, pushing the COIN price higher and reinforcing its position as a key player in the digital economy. How the Broader Cryptocurrency Market Influences COIN‚Äôs Trajectory Coinbase‚Äôs fortunes are intrinsically linked to the health and performance of the overall cryptocurrency market . As a primary gateway for buying, selling, and holding digital assets, Coinbase thrives when the market is active and growing. When Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), the two largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, experience significant price movements, it often creates ripple effects across the entire ecosystem. Consider a scenario where Bitcoin breaks a new all-time high. This event typically generates widespread media attention, ignites public interest, and encourages both new and existing users to engage with crypto. This engagement directly translates into higher trading volumes on exchanges like Coinbase, which in turn boosts their transaction-fee-driven revenue. Conversely, during bear markets or periods of high volatility and price drops, trading volumes can decrease, impacting Coinbase‚Äôs financial performance. Is the current cryptocurrency market sustainable? This is a question frequently asked by investors. While volatility is a hallmark of crypto, the increasing institutional adoption, technological advancements (like DeFi and NFTs), and growing recognition of digital assets as a legitimate asset class suggest a maturing market. Coinbase benefits from this maturation, as it provides the robust, regulated infrastructure needed for mainstream participation. The company‚Äôs diversified revenue streams, including subscription and services revenue, also help cushion the impact of pure trading volume fluctuations, making it more resilient than some pure-play crypto mining or asset companies. Coinbase‚Äôs Pivotal Role as a Leading Crypto Exchange: Opportunities and Challenges Coinbase is not just another company; it‚Äôs a foundational pillar of the crypto exchange landscape. Since its inception, it has aimed to make cryptocurrencies accessible to everyone, evolving from a simple Bitcoin brokerage to a comprehensive platform offering a wide array of services. Its public listing on Nasdaq was a landmark event, legitimizing the crypto industry in the eyes of many traditional investors. What makes Coinbase stand out among crypto exchanges? Regulatory Compliance Focus: Coinbase has historically prioritized working with regulators, aiming to be the most trusted and compliant platform. This approach has helped it gain credibility with institutional investors and traditional financial institutions. User Experience: Its platform is renowned for its user-friendly interface, making it easy for newcomers to buy, sell, and manage their digital assets. Security: Coinbase invests heavily in security measures, including robust cold storage solutions for the majority of customer funds, multi-factor authentication, and insurance policies. Diverse Product Offerings: Beyond spot trading, Coinbase offers advanced trading tools (Coinbase Pro), institutional services (Coinbase Prime), staking rewards, a venture arm (Coinbase Ventures), and more recently, an NFT marketplace and a self-custody wallet. However, being a leading crypto exchange also comes with its share of challenges. Competition is fierce, with numerous centralized and decentralized exchanges vying for market share. Fee compression is a constant pressure, as competitors often try to undercut each other on trading fees. Regulatory uncertainty, while potentially leading to clarity, can also pose risks if unfavorable regulations are enacted. Furthermore, the company‚Äôs profitability remains heavily tied to the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market, despite efforts to diversify revenue. The Future Landscape of Digital Assets and Coinbase‚Äôs Vision The world of digital assets is expanding rapidly beyond just cryptocurrencies. We are witnessing the emergence of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, metaverse applications, and Web3 infrastructure. These innovations are creating new paradigms for ownership, finance, and online interaction, and Coinbase is strategically positioning itself to be a central player in this evolving landscape. Coinbase‚Äôs vision extends beyond simply being a trading platform. It aims to be the primary financial services provider for the crypto economy, offering everything from secure custody and institutional trading to staking, borrowing, and even identity solutions for Web3. Their investment in new technologies and acquisitions demonstrates a commitment to staying ahead of the curve and capturing new growth opportunities within the broader digital asset ecosystem. For investors, understanding this expansive vision is key. While the immediate focus might be on Coinbase stock price movements driven by trading volumes, the long-term value proposition lies in the company‚Äôs ability to adapt, innovate, and integrate new forms of digital assets and blockchain applications into its offerings. The company‚Äôs success will increasingly depend on its ability to build infrastructure that supports the next generation of the internet, where digital ownership and decentralized applications become mainstream. Summary: Riding the Wave of Digital Transformation The surge of Coinbase stock to an all-time high of $435.7 is a powerful testament to the growing mainstream acceptance and financial significance of the cryptocurrency market. Driven by a confluence of factors including strong market sentiment, increasing institutional adoption of digital assets, and Coinbase‚Äôs own strategic growth as a leading crypto exchange, this milestone highlights the immense potential still untapped in the digital economy. While the path ahead for digital assets will undoubtedly involve volatility and regulatory evolution, Coinbase‚Äôs pivotal role and its commitment to building a comprehensive financial infrastructure position it uniquely for the future. For anyone observing the intersection of traditional finance and the decentralized world, COIN‚Äôs journey offers compelling insights into the transformative power of blockchain technology and the enduring appeal of innovation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What does it mean for a stock to hit an all-time high? When a stock hits an all-time high, it means its price has reached the highest point it has ever been since it started trading publicly. This often indicates strong investor confidence, positive market sentiment, and robust company performance, reflecting a high demand for the stock. 2. What factors typically influence Coinbase stock (COIN) price? The COIN price is primarily influenced by the overall health and sentiment of the cryptocurrency market, particularly the prices of major digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Other factors include trading volumes on Coinbase‚Äôs platform, regulatory developments in the crypto space, the company‚Äôs financial performance (earnings, user growth), and broader macroeconomic conditions. 3. Is Coinbase (COIN) a good investment? Whether Coinbase (COIN) is a good investment depends on an individual‚Äôs investment goals, risk tolerance, and market outlook. As a stock tied to the volatile cryptocurrency market, it carries inherent risks. However, its position as a leading crypto exchange and its efforts to diversify revenue streams also present significant growth opportunities. It‚Äôs crucial to conduct thorough research and consider consulting a financial advisor. 4. How does the broader cryptocurrency market affect a crypto exchange like Coinbase? The broader cryptocurrency market directly impacts crypto exchanges like Coinbase because their primary revenue often comes from transaction fees. When crypto prices rise and market activity increases, trading volumes go up, leading to higher revenues for the exchange. Conversely, a bear market or period of low volatility can reduce trading activity and negatively impact financial performance. 5. What are ‚Äòdigital assets‚Äô in the context of Coinbase‚Äôs business? ‚ÄòDigital assets‚Äô is a broad term that includes cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, but also extends to other blockchain-based assets such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stablecoins, and tokens associated with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Coinbase facilitates the buying, selling, and management of a wide range of these digital assets on its platform.

The 27-year-old son of billionaire U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick flew into Las Vegas in late May with Cantor Fitzgerald bankers to push deeper into crypto during the Bitcoin 2025 conference. Brandon showed up with a new company called Twenty One Capital , backed by Tether Holdings, SoftBank, and the family firm. The goal was direct‚Äîbuy Bitcoin in bulk and figure out how to build Cantor‚Äôs future around it. According to Bloomberg, investors didn‚Äôt waste time. Dozens pitched Cantor teams at the Venetian hotel, offering ideas for new treasury companies or asking for help funding them. These weren‚Äôt vague interest checks. They wanted Cantor to lead deals that looked like Strategy‚Äôs treasury model‚Äîpublic companies that raise money just to buy more Bitcoin. Cantor combines SPAC with BSTR for Bitcoin-focused firm By Thursday, Cantor gave them an answer. The firm merged one of its SPACs with a new Bitcoin treasury company called BSTR , which will now be led by Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream and an early figure in Bitcoin‚Äôs history. The deal was designed to make BSTR one of the biggest treasury-style crypto firms in the market. ‚ÄúI want to be sitting at the heart of crypto,‚Äù Brandon said in an interview the same day the BSTR deal was announced. ‚ÄúAs a young leader, crypto is really where I can try to drive growth in the firm.‚Äù The model isn‚Äôt new, but it‚Äôs working. Strategy, the renamed MicroStrategy, has jumped 56% this year. Bitcoin is only up 27%. Investors are paying a premium for shares in companies that hold large crypto positions, and Brandon‚Äôs betting Cantor can do the same‚Ä¶ but bigger. Twenty One Capital is already considering applying for money-transmitter licenses, a move that would allow the firm to process funds and exchange currencies legally across the U.S. People involved say the company could expand into trading, lending, asset management, and advisory services, all of it tied to crypto. Jack Mallers, the CEO of Twenty One, said, ‚ÄúWe really do feel there‚Äôs nothing we can‚Äôt do,‚Äù when asked if the firm planned to build out financial services. Washington moves help Cantor‚Äôs crypto expansion The timing lines up. Washington is starting to support crypto publicly. Lawmakers are pushing new stablecoin legislation , and regulators are cutting back pressure. Major U.S. banks are talking about building stablecoins. That‚Äôs giving institutional investors more reasons to fund crypto projects. ‚ÄúWith legislation now coming out for stablecoins, they‚Äôll all get more comfortable over time,‚Äù Brandon said, pointing to the shift in investor attitude as lawmakers begin to outline rules. Cantor, meanwhile, has been busy beyond BSTR. The firm has launched more SPACs than any other bank this year. It also launched a Bitcoin-backed lending product, made senior hires in its investment bank, and bought hedge fund O‚ÄôConnor from UBS. Inside Cantor, the crypto push is backed by Brandon‚Äôs older brother Kyle Lutnick, the firm‚Äôs executive vice chairman, along with investment bank co-CEOs Sage Kelly, Pascal Bandelier, and Christian Wall. Richard Wu, a former healthcare banker at Cantor, has also moved into the crypto unit. He‚Äôs now focused fully on the firm‚Äôs digital asset operations, including work related to Ethereum and TON, not just Bitcoin. Brandon knows he‚Äôs not replacing his father, but he doesn‚Äôt have to. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not my Dad, and there was a hole to fill,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of how this firm has been able to step up.‚Äù Your crypto news deserves attention - KEY Difference Wire puts you on 250+ top sites",News|BSTR|MSTR|Twenty one capital,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|REGULATION|FIAT|TREASURY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-07-18 14:11:29

XYZVerse is making waves and could challenge popular coins like Little Pepe and Dogecoin. Could this newcomer redefine the game? This article explores what sets XYZVerse apart and its potential to rise above the rest. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. it is going to break records in the meme coin space, targeting 50X growth upon launch. The current presale gives early investors the chance to grab $XYZ tokens at a significantly discounted price, far below the expected listing price. Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a ‚Äúmoonshot opportunity.‚Äù More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it‚Äôs working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.003333 by Stage 12, with over 70% of the $15 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that‚Äôs just the start‚Äîthere are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. The recent partnership with decentralized sportsbook bookmaker.XYZ underscores XYZVerse‚Äôs commitment to expanding its utility. It‚Äôs a big move that gives the community something to actually use. As part of the deal, $XYZ holders get a special bonus on their first bet‚Äîa nice perk that adds extra value just for being part of the ecosystem. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different‚Äîsomething with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won‚Äôt last forever‚Äîso if you‚Äôre interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity PEPE: The Frog Meme Taking Over the Crypto Pond PEPE is the new memecoin that's hopping into the spotlight. Launched on Ethereum, it's a tribute to Pepe the Frog, the internet meme created by Matt Furie that soared in popularity in the early 2000s. Embracing its meme roots, PEPE keeps things simple with a no-tax policy and openly admits it doesn't have a specific utility‚Äîit's all about the fun. In a whirlwind rise between April and May 2023, PEPE's market cap skyrocketed to $1.6 billion, turning early investors into millionaires. This surge sparked a ""memecoin season,"" with other meme-based cryptocurrencies experiencing wild rides of their own. PEPE's roadmap is ambitious, aiming for major exchange listings and what they call a ""meme takeover."" PEPE's potential lies in its strong community and the power of internet culture. By capitalizing on the success of predecessors like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, it's positioned itself as a contender in the meme coin arena. In the current market cycle, with many eyes on the upcoming Bitcoin halving and hopes for a bull run, PEPE offers an intriguing option for those drawn to high-risk, high-reward possibilities. While it doesn't boast advanced technology or utility, its deflationary nature and viral appeal keep it in the conversation. Compared to other coins, PEPE's rapid ascent highlights the influence of memes in the crypto world and suggests that community and culture can be as significant as technology in this space. Dogecoin: The Joke That Became a $50 Billion Reality Dogecoin began in 2013 as a fun and friendly alternative to traditional cryptocurrencies. Using the Shiba Inu meme as its symbol, it was created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer as a joke. Unlike Bitcoin's limited supply, Dogecoin is abundant, with 10,000 new coins mined every minute and no maximum supply. Initially seen as a ""memecoin,"" it gained serious attention in 2021. Its value skyrocketed, reaching over $50 billion, placing it among the top ten cryptocurrencies. This surge was fueled by social media buzz and support from influencers like Elon Musk, highlighting the power of online communities in shaping financial markets. Today, Dogecoin's potential lies in its strong community and widespread recognition. While it doesn't offer advanced features like some other cryptocurrencies, its simplicity makes it easy to use for tipping and small transactions. In the current market, with increased interest in digital coins, Dogecoin remains attractive to both new investors and crypto enthusiasts. Its low price per coin and high liquidity make it accessible. Compared to other coins, Dogecoin lacks technical innovation but compensates with cultural impact and loyal supporters.

This shift is a signal of bigger trends brewing in the market. Tied closely to this are three Layer 1 tokens poised for substantial growth. Find out which emerging coins could dominate the next wave in the blockchain revolution. Bitcoin Price Analysis: Momentum, Key Levels, and Trading Setups Bitcoin posted a one-month price increase of 15.17% and a six-month gain of 16.24%, with a one-week rise of 4.53%. Price fluctuations reflect steady upward movement within a clearly defined range. The gains over these periods showcase consistent growth and cautious consolidation. Recent performance highlights sustained buyer interest with moderate volatility, laying the groundwork for future upward moves without dramatic swings. The trend has been maintained over both shorter and longer durations, indicating stable investor sentiment and gradual accumulation of value. Current prices trade between approximately $100,193 and $112,335. A key support level sits near $93,218 while primary resistance is around $117,502. A secondary support near $81,076 and higher resistance near $129,644 add further context. High values for the Momentum Indicator at 11,451 and the Awesome Oscillator at 9,562 reflect strong upward force, though an RSI of 72.44 suggests overbought conditions. Bulls currently dominate, yet no clear breakout trend has been confirmed. Traders may consider long positions on small retracements toward support, with attention to a decisive move above $117,502 indicating further bullish momentum. Conversely, a breakdown below $93,218 could prompt a defensive shift. Solana Price Journey: Mixed Recent Gains and Long-Term Setbacks Past month performance SOL shows a gain of 23.08%, while over the last six months, the coin experienced a decline of 30.55%. Price action has been robust in the short term, with a 1-week increase of 10.61%, suggesting buying interest despite the longer-term downturn. These figures indicate energetic moves in recent weeks that contrast with the broader downtrend observed over the past half year. Current price levels range between $131 and $173.35, with the nearest support at $107.89 and resistance at $191.79. A secondary layer includes support at $65.94 and resistance at $233.74. Short-term indicators suggest bullish pressure, with a Relative Strength Index of 72.785. Caution is advised due to the six-month decline. The market has a mix of bullish drive and the potential for profit targets near resistance levels, along with the need for consolidation near support levels. Trading within these boundaries may present opportunities for gains if momentum is maintained. Ethereum: Monthly Surge Amid Critical Support and Resistance Levels Ethereum experienced a 43.95% increase over the last month with prices moving between $2110 and $2870, while the half-year performance registered a modest rise of 9.38%. The one-week change of 22.47% highlighted strong short-term buying and active market sentiment. Price movements indicate a burst of momentum that contrasts with steadier longer-term progress, suggesting recent trading activity has accelerated in the short run. Volatility remained as the price oscillated within this range, pointing to dynamic market forces at play without completely abandoning long-term stability. Current market conditions show Ethereum testing critical levels with pressure building on both ends. The price currently sits between nearest support at $1735.29 and nearby resistance at $3254.36, with a second resistance at $4013.88 and another support around $975.77. The high RSI of 85.53 signals overbought territory, yet the momentum indicator hints that buyers remain active. Bulls dominate in the short run, as evidenced by the weekly increase and monthly climb, while the modest change over six months suggests steady support. Traders might consider buying near $1735.29 and reducing exposure near $3254.36, with caution should a breakout above this level occur. Conclusion As Ethereum staking gains traction, attention turns to three major tokens. Bitcoin remains a stronghold for value storage. Solana offers high transaction speeds, appealing to developers and users alike. Ethereum continues to innovate with its staking model, increasing its appeal. This trio is set to lead the market, driven by unique strengths in security, speed, and adaptability. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This dramatic event is part of a larger trend, as the past 24 hours have seen a colossal $884 million in futures positions wiped out across major exchanges. For traders involved in futures trading , these figures represent significant losses and a swift end to highly leveraged positions. What exactly does this mean for the market, and why are such massive crypto liquidations occurring? What Exactly Are Crypto Liquidations and Futures Trading? To understand the impact of these figures, it‚Äôs crucial to grasp the basics of crypto futures and liquidations. Crypto futures are derivative contracts that allow traders to speculate on the future price of a cryptocurrency without owning the underlying asset. They are popular for their ability to provide leverage, meaning traders can open positions much larger than their initial capital. However, this amplified exposure comes with amplified risk. Futures Contracts: Agreements to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at a predetermined price on a specific future date. Leverage: Using borrowed capital to increase potential returns. A 10x leverage means a $1,000 investment can control a $10,000 position. Liquidation: When a trader‚Äôs leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange due to the market moving against them, and their margin balance falls below the required maintenance level. This is designed to prevent the trader‚Äôs balance from going negative. The recent surge in crypto liquidations indicates that many traders, particularly those using high leverage, were caught off guard by a sudden price movement. This rapid unwinding of positions can create a cascading effect, further exacerbating market declines. Why Such Extreme Market Volatility Triggers Mass Liquidations? The primary catalyst for mass liquidations is often sudden and significant market volatility . When prices swing sharply in an unexpected direction, traders with leveraged positions face margin calls. If they cannot add more collateral quickly, their positions are liquidated. Several factors contribute to this: Unexpected Price Movements: A sudden dump or pump in the market, triggered by macro events, whale activity, or unexpected news, can push prices beyond traders‚Äô liquidation thresholds. High Leverage: While enticing for potential gains, high leverage drastically reduces the margin for error. A small percentage move against a highly leveraged position can lead to complete loss of collateral. Market Sentiment Shifts: Rapid changes in investor sentiment, perhaps due to regulatory news or a significant economic indicator, can lead to panic selling or buying, creating the conditions for mass liquidations. The sheer scale of $101 million liquidated in an hour underscores the ferocity of the recent market movements. This isn‚Äôt just a minor correction; it‚Äôs a significant purge of over-leveraged positions, clearing the way for what might be a new phase of market behavior. Navigating the Risks of Leveraged Trading: Lessons from the Bitcoin Futures Market While the exact breakdown of liquidated assets isn‚Äôt always immediately public, historical data suggests that Bitcoin futures often account for a significant portion of these liquidations due to its large market capitalization and high trading volume. However, altcoin futures are also highly susceptible, especially those with lower liquidity. For those engaged in leveraged trading , this event serves as a critical reminder: Challenge Actionable Insight High Risk of Capital Loss Use conservative leverage (e.g., 2x-5x) and never risk more than you can afford to lose. Unpredictable Market Swings Implement strict stop-loss orders to automatically close positions at a predetermined loss level. Emotional Trading Decisions Develop a clear trading plan and stick to it, avoiding impulsive actions during volatile periods. Lack of Market Understanding Continuously educate yourself on market mechanics, technical analysis, and risk management strategies. What Can Traders Learn from This Futures Market Calamity? The recent liquidation cascade is a harsh but valuable lesson for all participants in the crypto space. It highlights the importance of robust risk management, even for experienced traders. The promise of quick riches through high leverage often blinds traders to the equally rapid potential for significant losses. Diversification, understanding market cycles, and staying informed about global economic factors are also crucial. Ultimately, while futures trading offers powerful tools for speculation and hedging, it demands respect for its inherent risks. The $101 million liquidation event serves as a powerful reminder that the crypto market, for all its innovation, remains a wild frontier where fortunes can be made and lost in the blink of an eye. Prudence and a disciplined approach are your best allies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is a crypto futures liquidation? Crypto futures liquidation occurs when a trader‚Äôs leveraged position is automatically closed by an exchange because their margin balance falls below a required threshold, typically due to the market moving against their prediction. 2. Why did $101 million worth of futures get liquidated so quickly? This rapid liquidation was likely triggered by a sudden and significant price movement in the cryptocurrency market, catching many highly leveraged traders off guard and forcing exchanges to close their positions to prevent further losses. 3. How does leverage impact liquidations? Leverage amplifies both potential gains and losses. The higher the leverage used, the smaller the adverse price movement required to trigger a liquidation, making positions much more vulnerable to market volatility. 4. Which cryptocurrencies are most affected by liquidations? While Bitcoin futures often see the largest liquidation volumes due to their size, any highly traded cryptocurrency with active futures markets can be significantly affected, including major altcoins like Ethereum and others with high open interest. 5. How can traders protect themselves from liquidations? Traders can protect themselves by using lower leverage, setting clear stop-loss orders, maintaining sufficient margin balance, and practicing disciplined risk management strategies. Avoiding over-leveraging is key. 6. What does this event mean for the broader crypto market? Mass liquidations often signal periods of high market volatility and can lead to further price swings as positions unwind. They can also ‚Äòreset‚Äô the market by flushing out excessive leverage, potentially paving the way for more stable price action in the future, though initial impact is usually negative sentiment.

If so, you know that Ethereum , the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is constantly evolving. Its journey is marked by a series of meticulously planned upgrades, each designed to enhance its scalability, security, and sustainability. Right now, all eyes are on the upcoming Fusaka upgrade and the highly anticipated Glamsterdam hard fork , which promise to bring significant shifts to the network‚Äôs architecture. Understanding these developments is crucial for anyone navigating the dynamic landscape of blockchain development. What‚Äôs Shaking Up the Fusaka Upgrade? The Fusaka upgrade has been a hot topic among Ethereum developers, and recent discussions have led to a notable adjustment. The initial plans included a specific proposal known as EIP-7907 , which aimed to introduce contract code size limits. However, in a move reflecting the iterative nature of blockchain development, developers have decided to remove EIP-7907 from the Fusaka upgrade for now. This means that for the time being, the current contract code size limits will remain unchanged. Why the Change? The decision to pull EIP-7907 from Fusaka isn‚Äôt a rejection of the idea itself, but rather a strategic deferral. Developers often prioritize stability and thorough testing, and sometimes a proposal requires more refinement or a different context to be safely implemented. This cautious approach is a hallmark of responsible blockchain development . Impact on Users: For everyday users and dApp developers, this specific change means no immediate alteration to how smart contracts are deployed or their size limitations on the network with Fusaka. It simplifies the immediate upgrade path, focusing on other critical improvements without adding new complexities at this stage. EIP-7907‚Äôs Future: Eyeing the Glamsterdam Hard Fork While EIP-7907 won‚Äôt be part of Fusaka, it‚Äôs far from being discarded. Ethereum developers are already considering a revised version of this proposal for the subsequent major network upgrade: the Glamsterdam hard fork . This approach allows for continued research and development on the proposal, ensuring that any future implementation is robust and well-integrated into the broader Ethereum roadmap. This commitment to continuous improvement underscores the foresight in the network‚Äôs evolution. What does this mean for the future of contract development on Ethereum? It signals a commitment to optimizing network resources and potentially introducing new efficiencies. The careful consideration of EIP-7907 for the Glamsterdam hard fork demonstrates the developer community‚Äôs dedication to long-term network health and performance, always balancing innovation with stability. The Ethereum Roadmap: Devnets and Testnets in Motion The journey towards these significant upgrades involves several crucial stages of testing and refinement. For the Fusaka upgrade , the next major milestone is the launch of Devnet-3, scheduled for July 23. Devnets are internal testing environments where core developers can experiment with new features and identify potential issues in a controlled setting. Following this, public testnets are slated to roll out between late August and mid-October. These public testnets are vital for broader community participation, allowing dApp developers, node operators, and researchers to test their applications and infrastructure against the new changes before they go live on the mainnet. This phased approach to blockchain development is a hallmark of the Ethereum ecosystem, ensuring that upgrades are deployed with the highest possible degree of security and stability. It reflects a cautious yet progressive mindset, prioritizing the integrity of the decentralized network and building confidence in its future. What‚Äôs Next for the Glamsterdam Hard Fork? Beyond Fusaka, the spotlight quickly shifts to the Glamsterdam hard fork . Key decisions regarding the scope and content of this next major upgrade are anticipated within the next 2‚Äì4 weeks. This period will be critical as developers finalize the list of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) that will be bundled into Glamsterdam. The decisions made during this time will significantly shape the future capabilities and performance of the Ethereum network, impacting everything from transaction throughput to new feature sets. As per a recent Binance Square post , the community eagerly awaits these announcements. The iterative nature of these upgrades, from Fusaka to Glamsterdam, showcases the continuous commitment to enhancing the foundational layers of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 applications. This strategic foresight ensures that Ethereum remains at the forefront of innovation. Understanding Hard Forks and Network Upgrades: Why Are They So Important? For those new to the intricacies of blockchain, terms like ‚Äúhard fork‚Äù and ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù can seem daunting. Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown to demystify the process and highlight their importance in blockchain development : Hard Fork: A radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and vice-versa. It requires all participants (nodes) to upgrade their software. If a portion of the network doesn‚Äôt upgrade, it creates a separate chain. Ethereum‚Äôs upgrades are generally ‚Äúnon-contentious‚Äù hard forks, meaning the community broadly agrees on the changes, and everyone upgrades, maintaining network unity. Network Upgrade: A broader term encompassing any significant change or improvement to a blockchain‚Äôs protocol. Hard forks are a type of network upgrade, often necessary to implement major feature enhancements or security patches. These planned upgrades are essential for Ethereum ‚Äòs evolution, allowing it to adapt to new technological demands, improve efficiency, and address challenges like scalability and high transaction fees (gas costs). They are the engines driving the network‚Äôs progress. Why Do These Upgrades Matter to You? Whether you‚Äôre an investor, a dApp user, a developer, or just curious about crypto, these upgrades have tangible impacts on the entire ecosystem: For Investors: Successful upgrades can boost network efficiency and utility, potentially increasing the long-term value proposition of Ethereum (ETH). Smooth transitions build confidence in the network‚Äôs future, signaling a robust and well-managed platform. For Developers: New EIPs introduce new functionalities, tools, and optimizations, enabling the creation of more sophisticated, efficient, and secure decentralized applications.

For years, the idea of including cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans seemed like a distant dream, fraught with regulatory hurdles and market volatility. However, a significant shift is underway, signaling a new era for retirement planning. Recently, U.S. SEC Chair Paul Atkins, a figure whose insights often shape the trajectory of financial markets, expressed a surprising openness to the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans. His stance, emphasizing the critical need for clear disclosure and robust risk awareness, marks a pivotal moment. This isn‚Äôt just a fleeting comment; it aligns with broader policy shifts anticipated under a potential President Trump administration and echoes recent actions by financial giants like Fidelity, who have already begun exploring expanded crypto access for retirement accounts. The Labor Department‚Äôs evolving perspective also plays a role, indicating a growing acceptance of digital assets within the established financial framework. This evolving landscape begs the question: are we on the cusp of a major transformation in how Americans save for retirement? Why is Crypto 401k Gaining Traction Now? The journey of cryptocurrencies from niche digital curiosities to potentially mainstream investment vehicles has been remarkable. For a long time, regulatory bodies, including the SEC, maintained a cautious, if not skeptical, stance on integrating highly volatile assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum into retirement portfolios. Their primary concern has always been investor protection, especially for those saving for their golden years. However, several factors are contributing to this shift: Maturing Market: The crypto market, while still volatile, has grown significantly in size, liquidity, and institutional participation. More robust infrastructure, regulated exchanges, and custody solutions are emerging, making it less of a Wild West and more of a developing frontier. Investor Demand: A growing number of individuals, particularly younger generations, are keen to include digital assets in their long-term investment strategies. They see cryptocurrencies not just as speculative plays but as legitimate asset classes with unique value propositions. Political Landscape: The political environment, particularly with the prospect of a new administration, often brings changes in regulatory philosophy. Paul Atkins‚Äô comments reflect a potential shift towards a more innovation-friendly approach, balancing consumer protection with market access. Industry Innovation: Firms like Fidelity have been proactive, launching initiatives to allow limited crypto exposure in 401(k)s, albeit with significant safeguards. These moves demonstrate that practical solutions for integrating digital assets into traditional retirement vehicles are being developed. This confluence of factors suggests that the discussion around crypto 401k is no longer theoretical but rapidly moving towards practical implementation, albeit with necessary guardrails. What Are the Potential Benefits of Retirement Investing Crypto ? For many, the allure of adding cryptocurrencies to a retirement portfolio lies in the potential for enhanced returns and portfolio diversification. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the historical growth of leading cryptocurrencies has been exponential, far outpacing traditional asset classes over certain periods. This upside potential is a significant draw for long-term investors. Let‚Äôs explore some key benefits: Portfolio Diversification: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, have historically shown a low correlation with traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This means that when traditional markets face downturns, crypto assets might behave differently, potentially reducing overall portfolio risk and volatility. Think of it as adding a new flavor to your investment mix. Inflation Hedge Potential: In an era of increasing inflation concerns, some argue that cryptocurrencies, especially those with fixed supplies like Bitcoin, could act as a hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. While this theory is still debated, it‚Äôs a compelling argument for those seeking to preserve purchasing power over decades. Exposure to a Growing Sector: The digital asset economy is not just about Bitcoin; it encompasses a vast ecosystem of blockchain technology, decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 innovations. Investing in cryptocurrencies offers a direct stake in this rapidly expanding technological frontier, which could redefine various industries in the coming decades. Accessibility and Democratization: For individual investors, integrating crypto into 401(k)s provides a structured, tax-advantaged way to gain exposure to digital assets, previously more accessible to institutional or high-net-worth investors. This democratizes access to a potentially high-growth asset class. The prospect of including retirement investing crypto could fundamentally alter the risk-reward profile of long-term savings, offering a new avenue for wealth accumulation, provided the risks are thoroughly understood and managed. Navigating the Volatility: Key Risks in Digital Assets 401k While the potential benefits are exciting, it‚Äôs crucial to approach digital assets 401k with a clear understanding of the inherent risks. Cryptocurrencies are known for their extreme price volatility, which can lead to significant swings in portfolio value. This characteristic makes them fundamentally different from the relatively stable assets typically found in retirement accounts. Here are the primary challenges and risks: Risk Factor Description Implication for 401(k)s Extreme Volatility Cryptocurrency prices can fluctuate dramatically within short periods, sometimes by 20% or more in a single day. Significant erosion of retirement savings if a downturn occurs close to retirement age. Requires a high risk tolerance. Regulatory Uncertainty Despite positive signals, the regulatory landscape for crypto is still evolving and lacks comprehensive clarity. Sudden regulatory changes could negatively impact asset values or access to funds. Custody & Security Safely storing digital assets requires specialized knowledge and robust security measures to prevent hacks or loss. Providers must ensure institutional-grade security. Loss of keys or hack could mean irreversible loss of funds. Lack of Understanding Many investors lack fundamental knowledge about blockchain technology, crypto economics, and specific digital assets. Increases the risk of making uninformed investment decisions based on hype rather than fundamentals. Fraud & Scams The crypto space is unfortunately rife with scams, Ponzi schemes, and fraudulent projects. Investors need to be highly vigilant and rely on reputable, regulated platforms. These risks underscore why the SEC and other regulatory bodies have historically been cautious. Any integration of digital assets 401k must be accompanied by stringent safeguards and comprehensive risk management strategies. Why is Crypto Investor Education Paramount? The central theme of SEC Chair Paul Atkins‚Äô statement was not just openness, but a strong emphasis on ‚Äúclear disclosure and risk awareness.‚Äù This highlights that while the door to crypto in 401(k)s might be opening, it‚Äôs not an invitation for unbridled speculation. Instead, it‚Äôs a call for informed decision-making, making crypto investor education absolutely paramount. What does comprehensive investor education entail? Understanding the Fundamentals: Investors need to grasp what blockchain technology is, how different cryptocurrencies function, and the underlying economics that drive their value (or lack thereof). This includes understanding concepts like market capitalization, circulating supply, consensus mechanisms, and use cases. Risk Profiling: Each individual has a unique risk tolerance. Education should help investors assess how much volatility they can truly withstand, especially when it comes to long-term retirement savings. It‚Äôs about understanding that a 50% drawdown in a traditional stock might be rare, but in crypto, it‚Äôs a common occurrence. Diversification Strategies: Even within a crypto allocation, diversification is key. Education should guide investors on how to spread their risk across different assets, rather than putting all their eggs in one highly volatile basket. It should also emphasize that crypto should only be a small percentage of a total retirement portfolio. Identifying Scams and Red Flags: The crypto market is a target for malicious actors. Effective education empowers investors to recognize common scam tactics, identify unregulated platforms, and avoid falling victim to fraudulent schemes. Tax Implications: Investing in cryptocurrencies, especially within a tax-advantaged account like a 401(k), has specific tax implications. Understanding these is crucial for long-term financial planning. Providers offering crypto options in 401(k)s will bear a significant responsibility to provide accessible, unbiased, and thorough educational materials. Without robust crypto investor education , the potential benefits could easily be overshadowed by significant financial losses for unprepared individuals. How Has SEC Crypto Regulation Evolved on Retirement Accounts? The journey of SEC crypto regulation concerning retirement accounts has been marked by caution, evolving alongside the digital asset market itself. For years, the Department of Labor (DOL), which oversees employer-sponsored retirement plans, issued strong warnings against including cryptocurrencies in 401(k)s. In 2022, the DOL even released guidance expressing ‚Äúserious concerns‚Äù about the prudence of fiduciaries allowing such investments, citing volatility, speculative nature, and valuation challenges. This historical stance created a significant barrier. Employers, as plan fiduciaries, faced potential legal liabilities if they offered crypto options that were later deemed imprudent. This conservative approach reflected the prevailing regulatory sentiment that digital assets were too risky for the average retirement saver. However, the landscape began to shift: Fidelity‚Äôs Bold Move: Despite the DOL‚Äôs warnings, Fidelity, one of the largest 401(k) plan administrators, announced in 2022 its intention to allow Bitcoin investments in its 401(k) plans, starting with MicroStrategy. This signaled a willingness from a major player to navigate the regulatory ambiguities. Evolving DOL Stance: While still cautious, there have been signs of a slightly more nuanced approach from the DOL, acknowledging the growing interest and the need for clear guidelines rather than outright bans. Congressional Interest: Lawmakers have also become increasingly interested in the topic, with some advocating for clearer regulatory frameworks that could pave the way for broader crypto adoption in retirement accounts. Paul Atkins‚Äô Statement: SEC Chair Paul Atkins‚Äô recent remarks are perhaps the strongest signal yet from a high-ranking financial regulator that the tide is turning. As a former SEC Commissioner and a figure often associated with a more market-friendly approach, his comments carry significant weight. They suggest that the SEC, under a potentially new administration, might adopt a more permissive stance, focusing on disclosure and education rather than outright prohibition. This evolution in SEC crypto regulation indicates a gradual, albeit careful, move towards integrating digital assets into mainstream finance. It‚Äôs a recognition of both the persistent demand from investors and the maturing infrastructure of the crypto market. Actionable Insights for Investors and Employers With the possibility of crypto in 401(k)s becoming more tangible, what should investors and employers consider? For Investors: Educate Yourself Thoroughly: Before considering any allocation to digital assets, dedicate time to understanding the technology, market dynamics, and specific risks. Don‚Äôt rely on hype or social media trends. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Be brutally honest about how much volatility you can stomach. Retirement savings are long-term, but significant drawdowns can still be emotionally taxing. Start Small: If your 401(k) offers crypto, consider allocating only a very small percentage of your portfolio ‚Äì perhaps 1-5%. This allows you to gain exposure without risking a substantial portion of your retirement nest egg. Understand the Fees: Crypto investments, especially through third-party platforms, can come with higher fees than traditional investments. Scrutinize these costs carefully. Monitor Regulatory Changes: The regulatory environment is dynamic. Stay informed about new guidance from the SEC, DOL, and other relevant bodies. For Employers: Due Diligence is Key: If considering offering crypto options, conduct extensive due diligence on potential providers. Ensure they have robust security, clear disclosures, and comprehensive educational resources. Consult Legal Counsel: Seek expert legal advice regarding fiduciary responsibilities and potential liabilities associated with offering digital assets in your 401(k) plan. Prioritize Education: Work with your plan administrator to provide accessible and unbiased educational materials to employees, emphasizing the risks alongside the potential benefits. Start Conservatively: Consider limiting the percentage of an employee‚Äôs portfolio that can be allocated to crypto to mitigate overall plan risk. The successful integration of crypto into 401(k)s will depend heavily on a cautious, informed approach from both sides. The Future Outlook: A New Era for Retirement Savings? The signal from SEC Chair Paul Atkins, coupled with industry movements and a potentially shifting political landscape, paints a picture of a future where digital assets play a more integrated role in American retirement planning. This isn‚Äôt just about adding another asset class; it‚Äôs about acknowledging the evolution of finance and technology. If more 401(k) providers follow Fidelity‚Äôs lead, and regulatory bodies adopt a more supportive, yet cautious, framework, we could see a significant influx of capital into the digital asset space from long-term investors. This could further legitimize cryptocurrencies as a viable asset class, potentially fostering greater stability and maturity in the market. However, the journey won‚Äôt be without its bumps. Challenges related to custody, valuation, regulatory clarity across different jurisdictions, and continued market volatility will persist. The emphasis on investor education will remain paramount, ensuring that individuals entering this new frontier do so with open eyes and a clear understanding of the opportunities and pitfalls. Ultimately, the move towards including crypto in 401(k)s represents a bold step into the future of finance, offering individuals more choice and potential for growth, while simultaneously demanding a higher level of financial literacy and responsibility. It‚Äôs a testament to the enduring innovation of the digital asset space and its increasing influence on traditional financial systems. Summary: The prospect of including cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans, championed by SEC Chair Paul Atkins‚Äô recent openness, marks a significant turning point for retirement investing. This shift, influenced by evolving regulatory perspectives and industry pioneers like Fidelity, promises new opportunities for diversification and potential growth. However, it equally underscores the critical importance of robust investor education to navigate the inherent volatility and risks of digital assets. While the path ahead requires careful consideration from both investors and employers, this development signifies a move towards a more inclusive and forward-thinking approach to long-term wealth building, blending traditional finance with the innovative world of crypto.

Stakeholders are criticizing the move, comparing it to China‚Äôs approach to market control. The United States government is facing backlash for investing $400 million in a domestic rare earth firm. The investment includes a price guarantee that is nearly double the market rate, raising concerns about market distortions. U.S. rare earth deal raises concerns Critics of the U.S. Department of Defense‚Äôs decision to invest $400 million in MP Materials, the country‚Äôs only rare earths mining company, claim that the move is similar to China‚Äôs style of intervention and could cause a distortion in the global market for rare earth elements. The deal was announced last week, making the Pentagon the largest shareholder in MP Materials. It also guarantees a decade-long price floor for the company‚Äôs key product NdPr oxide, at $110 per kilogram, nearly double the current market rate of about $60. The U.S. government has committed to purchasing about 7,000 tonnes of magnets per year from MP. The company will also stop selling to its former top customer, Shenghe Resources, a Chinese company that is still a minority shareholder. The Trump administration sees this intervention as a necessary step in breaking America‚Äôs dependence on Chinese rare earth supply chains and strengthening domestic production. Market distortion concerns will not go away One of the biggest concerns about this deal is the impact of the guaranteed price floor on the competition. By committing to pay $110/kg for NdPr, the Pentagon has created what some critics call an artificial market, allowing MP Materials to operate with a significant financial cushion. David Abraham, a former White House official and current affiliate professor at Boise State University, noted that the U.S. government now plays a huge role in the NdPr market, which is relatively small. He described the scale of the deal as ‚Äúpeculiar‚Äù and potentially destabilizing. Gracelin Baskaran, director of the critical minerals security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the level of government intervention mirrors the kind of price controls typical of China. She added that the price floor may allow MP to undercut competitors in the commercial market, shielding the company from real market pressures. A former Pentagon official agreed, suggesting MP Materials could ‚Äúunderbid on commercial tenders‚Äù with little financial risk. While MP Materials has not yet begun producing magnets at scale, the potential production of 7,000 tonnes for a decade has also drawn criticism. Despite the concerns, the deal is supported in Washington. Lawmakers have backed the agreement, seeing it as a step to secure domestic supply chains. Erik Raven, an adviser at Beacon Global Strategies, said the move indicates a shift in Pentagon strategy. ‚ÄúLeaders with business backgrounds are looking for new ways to get results,‚Äù he said. A Department of Defense official supported the approach, calling it a tailored solution to the challenges of building a sustainable rare earth industry. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve selected a unique model that balances national security needs with the risks of a commercially dominated market,‚Äù the official said.

One voice making waves is Michael Faulkender, the United States Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, who recently shared a compelling perspective: he believes that clear and thoughtful crypto regulation will not only benefit the digital asset space but also serve to further strengthen the US dollar as the world‚Äôs leading reserve currency . This isn‚Äôt just about control; it‚Äôs about harnessing the power of innovation while ensuring robust financial stability . But how exactly can regulating a decentralized ecosystem bolster a centralized currency? And what role do stablecoins play in this grand strategy? What Did Michael Faulkender Say About Crypto Regulation? Michael Faulkender‚Äôs statement highlights a nuanced understanding of the evolving digital economy. His core message is clear: rather than viewing cryptocurrency as a threat to traditional finance, effective regulation can integrate it in a way that reinforces the strengths of the existing system. Specifically, he emphasized that a well-regulated crypto market would: Enhance Confidence: By providing clear rules of the road, regulation reduces uncertainty and risk, making the crypto market more appealing to institutional investors and mainstream users. This increased confidence can indirectly support the broader financial ecosystem, which is anchored by the US dollar. Combat Illicit Activities: Stronger regulatory oversight helps in preventing money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities that can erode public trust in both crypto and the financial system at large. A cleaner, more transparent market benefits everyone. Foster Responsible Innovation: Regulation doesn‚Äôt have to stifle innovation. Instead, it can provide a secure framework within which new technologies and business models can flourish responsibly, without posing systemic risks. Faulkender also pointed out a crucial need for the private sector to step up and educate the public about stablecoins . This call to action underscores the importance of public understanding and adoption for the success of any regulatory framework. How Crypto Regulation Can Strengthen the US Dollar The idea that crypto regulation can bolster the US dollar ‚Äòs position as a reserve currency might seem counterintuitive to some. After all, isn‚Äôt crypto designed to be an alternative to traditional fiat? However, Faulkender‚Äôs argument rests on several key pillars: Solidifying the Dollar‚Äôs Digital Footprint As the global economy becomes increasingly digital, the way transactions occur is shifting. If digital assets, particularly stablecoins, become a significant medium of exchange, ensuring that the most widely used stablecoins are pegged to and backed by the US dollar is paramount. Regulation can ensure that these digital dollar equivalents are trustworthy and operate transparently, extending the dollar‚Äôs reach and utility into the digital realm. Reducing Systemic Risk for Greater Financial Stability Unregulated or poorly regulated crypto markets can pose risks to the broader financial stability . Volatility, potential for fraud, and lack of consumer protection could spill over into traditional markets. By implementing robust crypto regulation , governments can mitigate these risks, ensuring that the growth of the digital asset space contributes positively to, rather than detracts from, overall economic health. This strengthens the foundation upon which the US dollar ‚Äòs global standing rests. Boosting International Confidence and Adoption For the US dollar to maintain its status as the global reserve currency , it needs to be trusted and widely adopted for international trade, investment, and as a store of value. When the US provides clear, comprehensive crypto regulation , it signals to the world that it is serious about integrating digital assets responsibly. This can encourage other nations and international businesses to use dollar-pegged digital assets, further cementing the dollar‚Äôs dominance. Consider the following benefits: Benefit Area Impact of Crypto Regulation Global Trust Increases confidence in dollar-backed digital assets, making them preferred for international transactions. Market Integrity Reduces illicit finance, enhancing the reputation of the crypto market and its connection to the US dollar. Innovation Framework Provides a secure environment for blockchain innovation that aligns with existing financial laws. Systemic Risk Mitigation Prevents crypto market instability from negatively impacting the broader financial system. The Crucial Role of Stablecoins in Economic Stability Michael Faulkender specifically highlighted stablecoins as a key area requiring public education and clear guidelines. Why are stablecoins so central to this discussion? What are Stablecoins? Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, which can experience dramatic price swings, stablecoins aim to maintain a stable value, often by pegging their value to a fiat currency like the US dollar , or to a commodity like gold. They achieve this stability through various mechanisms, such as being backed by reserves (fiat-backed), crypto-backed, or algorithmic. Why are They Important for the US Dollar and Financial Stability? Stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the US dollar , act as a bridge between the traditional financial system and the burgeoning crypto economy. They offer the speed and efficiency of blockchain technology while providing the stability of fiat currency. If these dollar-pegged stablecoins are well-regulated, transparent, and fully backed, they can: Expand Dollar Utility: They allow the dollar to be used in new, innovative ways on blockchain networks, facilitating faster, cheaper, and more accessible global transactions. Enhance Financial Inclusion: By making dollar-denominated assets more accessible, stablecoins can potentially bring more people into the global financial system. Strengthen Trust: Clear regulatory frameworks for stablecoins, ensuring proper reserves and audits, will build public trust. This trust is essential for them to become a widely accepted medium of exchange, further solidifying the US dollar ‚Äòs digital presence and contributing to overall financial stability . The call for the private sector to educate the public about stablecoins is vital. A well-informed public is more likely to adopt and trust these digital assets, accelerating their integration into the global economy and, by extension, reinforcing the US dollar ‚Äòs digital dominance. Ensuring Financial Stability in a Digital Age The pursuit of financial stability in an era of rapid technological change is a complex endeavor. The advent of cryptocurrencies, while offering immense potential, also introduces new considerations for regulators and policymakers. Michael Faulkender‚Äôs comments underscore the Treasury‚Äôs proactive approach to understanding and shaping this landscape. The Balancing Act: Innovation vs. Oversight One of the primary challenges in crypto regulation is striking the right balance. Overly restrictive regulations could stifle the very innovation that makes the crypto space so promising. Conversely, a lack of oversight could lead to systemic risks, consumer harm, and undermine the integrity of the financial system. The goal is to create a framework that: Protects Consumers and Investors: Ensuring transparency, preventing fraud, and establishing clear recourse mechanisms. Manages Systemic Risk: Identifying and mitigating potential threats that could impact the broader financial system. Promotes Fair Competition: Creating a level playing field for both traditional financial institutions and new crypto ventures. Fosters Global Cooperation: Recognizing that crypto is borderless, international collaboration on regulatory standards is crucial to prevent regulatory arbitrage. The Private Sector‚Äôs Indispensable Role Faulkender‚Äôs emphasis on the private sector‚Äôs responsibility to educate the public about stablecoins is a testament to the collaborative approach needed. Government regulation alone cannot achieve widespread adoption and understanding. Industry players ‚Äì from stablecoin issuers to exchanges and educational platforms ‚Äì have a critical role in: Simplifying Complex Concepts: Breaking down the technicalities of stablecoins and blockchain for a general audience. Promoting Best Practices: Adhering to high standards of transparency, security, and compliance even before specific regulations are mandated. Building Trust: Demonstrating the utility and reliability of stablecoins through real-world applications and clear communication. This partnership between public and private sectors is essential for navigating the complexities of digital assets and ensuring that their evolution contributes positively to the strength of the US dollar and global financial stability . A Future Where Digital Assets Bolster Traditional Strengths Michael Faulkender‚Äôs insights offer a compelling vision for the future of finance: one where thoughtful crypto regulation isn‚Äôt seen as a barrier, but as a bridge. By establishing clear rules, fostering responsible innovation, and ensuring the integrity of key digital assets like stablecoins , the United States can reinforce the enduring strength of the US dollar as the global reserve currency . This proactive approach to regulation is not just about managing risk; it‚Äôs about seizing the opportunity to extend the dollar‚Äôs influence into the digital age, ensuring continued financial stability and leadership in the evolving global economy. The journey ahead will require ongoing dialogue, adaptive policies, and a shared commitment from both public and private sectors to build a secure, efficient, and inclusive financial future.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a reserve currency, and why is the US dollar considered one? A reserve currency is a foreign currency held by central banks and other major financial institutions as a significant portion of their foreign exchange reserves. It is typically used for international transactions, investments, and as a benchmark for global trade. The US dollar is considered the primary reserve currency due to the size and stability of the U.S. economy, its deep and liquid financial markets, and its widespread acceptance in international trade and finance. Q2: How can crypto regulation strengthen the US dollar? Crypto regulation can strengthen the US dollar by bringing clarity, security, and trust to the digital asset space. By ensuring dollar-pegged stablecoins are transparently backed and well-regulated, it extends the dollar‚Äôs utility into the digital realm. Regulation also reduces risks like illicit finance and market volatility, which could otherwise undermine confidence in the broader financial system, thereby reinforcing the dollar‚Äôs global standing. Q3: What are stablecoins, and why are they important for financial stability? Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to maintain a stable value, usually by being pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. They are crucial for financial stability because they offer the efficiency of blockchain technology with the predictability of traditional money. Regulated stablecoins can facilitate faster, cheaper global transactions, expand financial inclusion, and act as a reliable bridge between traditional finance and the crypto economy, reducing volatility risks. Q4: What role does the private sector play in stablecoin education? The private sector, including stablecoin issuers, crypto exchanges, and educational platforms, plays a vital role in educating the public. They are instrumental in simplifying complex technical concepts, promoting best practices for transparency and security, and demonstrating the practical utility of stablecoins. This education is essential for building public trust and accelerating the mainstream adoption of stablecoins, which in turn supports their integration into the broader financial system. Q5: Are there challenges to implementing effective crypto regulation? Yes, significant challenges exist. These include the borderless nature of cryptocurrencies, which necessitates international cooperation; the need to balance innovation with oversight; preventing regulatory arbitrage (where entities move to less regulated jurisdictions); and developing frameworks that are flexible enough to adapt to rapidly evolving technology while remaining robust against risks.

It will be the U.S. first crypto law and it is a momentous moment for an industry that has fought for over a decade for official approval. GENIUS, which regulates the issuance of stablecoins, is likely to have far-reaching implications for payments (especially cross-border), and places blockchain infrastructure at an equivalent approval level of, say, SWIFT. And it was not even the most far-reaching piece of legislation to move through Congress this week. Also Thursday, the House passed the CLARITY Act , a comprehensive framework for digital assets regulation, including the crucial question of whether an asset is a security or a commodity. CLARITY, as currently written, is not the finished article. Tim Scott, Chair of the Senate Banking Committee, called the House bill a good start and said he hoped to have a final draft by September 30. The Senate Agriculture Committee, which (strangely) oversees the CFTC, also needs to hear the bill. Meanwhile, the House also passed a bill (introduced by House Whip Tom Emmer) banning the U.S. from introducing a central bank digital currency (CBDC). The bill was championed by the Freedom Caucus and was included to allow the other bills to proceed to the floor. The bill‚Äôs prospects in the Senate are less certain. We rounded up reactions from lawmakers, industry and lobbyists here . Our D.C. reporter Jesse Hamilton covered all the angles alongside his regulatory editor Nik De. Meanwhile, markets surged. Bitcoin shot to all time highs. Ethereum jumped, on the back of several ‚Äútreasury vehicle‚Äù announcements and strong ETF flows. From below $1500 in April, ETH is now above $3500 and climbing . XRP hit record highs. Other Layer-1 stalwarts, including SUI, SEI and SOL, also had strong weeks. And memecoins decreased in importance, suggesting a return to networks with real business activity.

Recently, a significant development involving Trend Research , a firm reportedly linked to LD Capital, has captured the attention of analysts and investors alike. This move signals a potentially pivotal shift in their portfolio strategy, raising questions about the immediate future of key DeFi assets. What‚Äôs Happening with Trend Research ‚Äòs Portfolio? According to reports from AmberCN, Trend Research has executed substantial withdrawals from Binance over the past week. These aren‚Äôt minor transactions; we‚Äôre talking about millions of dollars in prominent DeFi tokens. Specifically, the firm pulled: 5.41 million UNI , valued at approximately $56.69 million . 228,000 COMP , valued at approximately $11.79 million . These large-scale movements suggest a deliberate re-evaluation of their holdings, moving assets off the exchange, which could imply a shift towards long-term holding, staking, or preparation for off-exchange transactions. Decoding the Significance of the UNI Withdrawal and COMP Withdrawal Why are these particular withdrawals so noteworthy? UNI is the native token of Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange (DEX), while COMP is the governance token for Compound, a prominent decentralized lending protocol. Both are cornerstones of the DeFi ecosystem. Large withdrawals of these assets by a major entity like Trend Research can have several implications: Reduced Selling Pressure: Moving tokens off an exchange often reduces immediate selling pressure on the market, as they are no longer readily available for quick trades. Long-Term Strategy: It could indicate a long-term bullish outlook on UNI and COMP, as institutional players often withdraw assets to cold storage for secure, prolonged holding. Staking or DeFi Participation: The assets might be moved to participate in staking, liquidity provision, or other DeFi protocols to earn yield, rather than just holding them on an exchange. OTC Deals: In some cases, large withdrawals precede over-the-counter (OTC) deals, where assets are sold directly to another party without impacting exchange order books. The sheer volume of this UNI withdrawal and COMP withdrawal demands attention, as it represents a significant chunk of these tokens changing hands or moving into a different strategic posture. The Curious Case of Halting ETH Activity Perhaps equally intriguing is the reported halt in Ethereum (ETH) transfer activity from Trend Research . While the firm has been observed to be involved in previous ETH sell-offs, there have been no ETH transfers observed in the last two days. This pause raises several questions: Strategic Pause: Is this a temporary pause in selling, perhaps waiting for more favorable market conditions or a specific price target? Accumulation Phase: Could it signal a shift from selling to a potential accumulation phase, or simply holding onto their substantial ETH reserves? Market Confidence: Holding a significant amount of ETH ‚Äì approximately 108,000 ETH valued at around $390 million ‚Äì suggests a strong belief in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term value, despite any short-term selling. The cessation of ETH transfers, especially after previous selling, marks a notable change in their recent trading patterns and warrants close observation by market participants. What Does This Institutional Crypto Activity Mean for the Broader Market? The actions of large players like Trend Research are often seen as leading indicators for the broader market. This recent spate of institutional crypto activity offers several insights: Shifting Focus: The emphasis on UNI and COMP, alongside the pause in ETH selling, might indicate a strategic pivot towards specific DeFi assets while maintaining a significant core position in Ethereum. Market Sentiment: Such large withdrawals can be interpreted as a bullish signal for the assets in question, as it suggests conviction rather than speculative trading. Liquidity Impact: While moving assets off exchanges can reduce immediate liquidity, it also signals a potential long-term commitment that could stabilize prices. Understanding these movements is crucial for retail investors looking to navigate the complex crypto landscape. It highlights that even in volatile markets, strategic, long-term plays by major entities are constantly evolving. Actionable Insights for Crypto Enthusiasts While we can‚Äôt predict the future, observing the moves of entities like Trend Research provides valuable data. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools that track large wallet movements can offer early indications of institutional intent. Understand Token Utility: Familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of tokens like UNI and COMP. Their role in the DeFi ecosystem makes their movements significant. Diversify and Research: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. Research projects thoroughly and understand the risks involved in any investment. Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Differentiate between short-term market noise and long-term strategic plays by institutional investors. The crypto market is always evolving, and staying informed about significant institutional actions is a key part of navigating its complexities. Conclusion: A Glimpse into Strategic Portfolio Rebalancing The recent actions by Trend Research , involving substantial UNI withdrawal and COMP withdrawal , coupled with a halt in ETH activity , provide a fascinating glimpse into high-level institutional crypto activity . These moves underscore a strategic rebalancing, potentially signaling long-term conviction in DeFi assets while maintaining a significant stake in Ethereum. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, the transparency of on-chain data offers invaluable insights into the strategies shaping the future of digital finance. Keeping an eye on these powerful players can help individual investors better understand market dynamics and potential future trends. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Who is Trend Research and what is their significance in the crypto market? Trend Research is a firm reportedly linked to LD Capital, a prominent investment institution. Their significance lies in their ability to execute large-scale transactions, which can influence market sentiment and liquidity for specific cryptocurrencies due to the sheer volume of their holdings and movements. Q2: What does it mean when a large amount of UNI and COMP is withdrawn from an exchange? When large amounts of tokens like UNI and COMP are withdrawn from an exchange, it typically suggests that the holder intends to move them to cold storage for security, stake them in DeFi protocols for yield, or prepare for an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction. It often indicates a long-term holding strategy rather than immediate selling pressure. Q3: Why is the halt in ETH transfers by Trend Research notable? The halt in ETH transfers is notable because Trend Research was previously observed engaging in ETH sell-offs. A pause in this activity, especially given their substantial ETH holdings ($390 million), could signal a change in strategy, such as waiting for better market conditions, accumulating more ETH, or simply holding their current large position. Q4: How does institutional crypto activity impact the average investor? Institutional crypto activity can impact average investors by influencing market sentiment, liquidity, and price movements. Large withdrawals can signal bullish conviction, while large deposits might precede selling. Observing these trends can provide insights into potential market directions, though individual investors should always conduct their own research and not solely rely on institutional moves. Q5: What are UNI and COMP, and why are they important DeFi tokens? UNI is the governance token for Uniswap, the largest decentralized exchange (DEX), allowing holders to vote on protocol changes. COMP is the governance token for Compound, a leading decentralized lending and borrowing protocol. Both are crucial for the functioning and governance of their respective DeFi platforms, making them significant assets in the decentralized finance ecosystem. Did you find this analysis insightful?

A recent statement from a key figure in the financial world has sent whispers through trading desks and investor forums alike, suggesting a significant change might be on the horizon. Austan Goolsbee, the influential president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, has indicated that we could see a substantial drop in interest rates over the coming year. This isn‚Äôt just financial jargon; it‚Äôs a potential game-changer for everything from your mortgage payments to the performance of your digital assets. Understanding the Federal Reserve‚Äôs Stance on Interest Rates The Federal Reserve, often simply called ‚Äòthe Fed,‚Äô serves as the central bank of the United States. Its primary mission is twofold: to promote maximum employment and to maintain price stability, which means keeping inflation in check. To achieve these goals, the Fed employs various tools, with the federal funds rate being one of the most powerful. This benchmark interest rate influences everything from consumer loans to business investments, acting as a crucial lever for economic activity. For the past couple of years, the global economy has grappled with elevated inflation, prompting the Fed to embark on an aggressive campaign of rate hikes. These increases were designed to cool down the economy by making borrowing more expensive, thereby reducing demand and slowing price growth. While these measures have shown some success in taming inflation, they have also raised concerns about potential economic slowdowns or even recessions. Austan Goolsbee‚Äôs recent remarks, as reported by First Squawk on X, signal a potential shift in this hawkish stance. His suggestion that rates could fall significantly over the next year implies that the Fed might be nearing a point where it believes inflation is sufficiently under control, or that the risks to economic growth outweigh the need for continued high rates. This pivot would mark a significant turning point in the current economic cycle, moving from a period of tightening to one of potential easing. Who is Austan Goolsbee and Why Does His Voice Matter? Austan Goolsbee is not just another economist; he is the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. This position places him among the twelve regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, who, along with the seven governors of the Federal Reserve System‚Äôs Board, comprise the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The FOMC is the Fed‚Äôs primary monetary policy-making body, responsible for setting the federal funds rate and determining the overall direction of U.S. monetary policy. While not every regional Fed president is a voting member of the FOMC every year (the voting roster rotates), their insights, analysis, and perspectives are always highly valued and contribute significantly to the committee‚Äôs deliberations. Goolsbee, a respected economist and former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama, brings a wealth of experience and a nuanced understanding of economic dynamics to the table. His public statements are carefully weighed by market participants, as they often provide clues about the internal discussions and potential future actions of the central bank. When a figure of Goolsbee‚Äôs stature speaks about the future trajectory of interest rates , the market listens intently. The Potential Impact of Rate Cuts on Markets The prospect of significant rate cuts carries profound implications across various financial markets. Historically, lower interest rates tend to stimulate economic activity by making borrowing cheaper for businesses and consumers. This can lead to increased investment, higher consumer spending, and potentially, a boost in corporate profits. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the likely impacts: Stock Market: Lower rates typically make equities more attractive. Companies can borrow more cheaply to expand, and future earnings are discounted at a lower rate, increasing their present value. This often translates to higher stock prices, particularly for growth-oriented companies that rely on future earnings potential. Bond Market: When the Fed cuts rates, existing bonds with higher yields become more valuable, and their prices rise. However, newly issued bonds will likely have lower yields, reducing the overall return for fixed-income investors. Real Estate: Mortgage rates tend to track the federal funds rate. Lower rates can make housing more affordable, stimulating demand and potentially driving up home prices. It also makes refinancing existing mortgages more appealing. Cryptocurrency Market: This is where it gets particularly interesting for our readers. Cryptocurrencies, often considered riskier, high-growth assets, tend to perform well in environments of lower interest rates and ample liquidity. When traditional, safer investments (like savings accounts or bonds) offer lower returns, investors are more inclined to seek higher yields in alternative assets. This ‚Äòsearch for yield‚Äô can drive capital into the crypto space, potentially boosting Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoin prices. Lower borrowing costs can also make it easier for crypto companies to raise capital and innovate, further fueling the industry‚Äôs growth. Consumer Spending: Cheaper credit card rates and personal loans can encourage consumers to spend more, boosting retail sales and overall economic growth. While the prospect of rate cuts is generally seen as positive for risk assets like crypto, it‚Äôs crucial to remember that markets are complex and influenced by a myriad of factors. The exact timing and magnitude of any cuts, along with other economic data, will dictate the ultimate market response. Navigating Future Monetary Policy Decisions The path forward for monetary policy is rarely straightforward. While Austan Goolsbee‚Äôs comments offer a glimpse into the Fed‚Äôs thinking, future decisions will be heavily data-dependent. The FOMC meticulously scrutinizes a wide array of economic indicators before making any adjustments to the federal funds rate. Key factors they will be watching include: Inflation Data: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index are paramount. The Fed needs to see sustained evidence that inflation is moving convincingly towards its 2% target before feeling comfortable with significant rate reductions. Employment Reports: Data like the non-farm payrolls, unemployment rate, and wage growth provide insights into the health of the labor market. A strong labor market might give the Fed more room to maneuver, while signs of weakness could accelerate the need for cuts. GDP Growth: Gross Domestic Product figures indicate the overall pace of economic expansion or contraction. A slowing economy might necessitate rate cuts to prevent a recession. Global Economic Conditions: International economic trends and geopolitical events can also influence the Fed‚Äôs decisions, as they impact U.S. trade, inflation, and financial stability. Financial Stability Risks: The Fed also considers potential risks to the financial system that might arise from its policies. The challenge for the Fed lies in striking a delicate balance: cutting rates too soon could reignite inflation, while waiting too long could plunge the economy into a deep recession. Investors should closely monitor these economic reports and the commentary from other Fed officials to gauge the likely timing and pace of any future rate cuts . Broader Economic Implications: Beyond Just Interest Rates The discussion around interest rates extends far beyond just market movements; it touches upon the fundamental health and direction of the entire economy. A shift towards lower rates, as hinted by Goolsbee, could signify a broader confidence in the economy‚Äôs ability to withstand less restrictive monetary conditions. This can have several significant implications: Economic Growth: Cheaper borrowing costs for businesses can stimulate capital expenditure, innovation, and job creation, leading to stronger overall economic growth. For consumers, lower loan rates can free up disposable income, boosting spending. U.S. Dollar Strength: Lower interest rates can make a country‚Äôs currency less attractive to foreign investors seeking higher returns. This could lead to a weaker U.S. dollar, which, while making imports more expensive, can make U.S. exports more competitive internationally. Government Debt: Lower rates reduce the cost of servicing the national debt, providing some fiscal relief for the government. Investor Confidence: A clear and consistent monetary policy signal, especially one that suggests an easing cycle, can bolster investor confidence, encouraging more capital allocation into various sectors of the economy. However, it is also important to consider the potential challenges. If the Fed cuts rates too aggressively or if underlying inflation proves more persistent than anticipated, it could lead to a resurgence of inflationary pressures down the line. The balancing act is intricate, and the Fed‚Äôs decisions will continue to be among the most watched economic events globally. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope for Markets Austan Goolsbee‚Äôs statement that interest rates could fall significantly over the next year offers a compelling glimpse into the potential future of U.S. monetary policy. While the Federal Reserve remains data-dependent, such commentary from a key official suggests a growing consensus for an easing cycle. For investors, particularly those in the dynamic cryptocurrency space, this could signal a more favorable environment ahead, potentially driving renewed interest and capital inflows. As always, staying informed about economic indicators and central bank communications will be paramount in navigating these evolving market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What did Austan Goolsbee say about interest rates? Austan Goolsbee, President of the Chicago Federal Reserve, stated that there‚Äôs a chance interest rates could fall significantly over the next year, as reported by First Squawk on X. 2. How do Federal Reserve interest rate changes affect the economy? Federal Reserve interest rate changes influence borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. Higher rates discourage borrowing and spending to cool inflation, while lower rates encourage borrowing and spending to stimulate economic growth. 3. What impact could lower interest rates have on cryptocurrency? Lower interest rates typically make traditional, less risky investments (like bonds or savings accounts) less attractive. This can encourage investors to seek higher returns in riskier assets, such as cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to increased demand and higher prices for digital assets. 4. When might the Federal Reserve start cutting rates? The timing of potential rate cuts is data-dependent. The Federal Reserve will closely monitor inflation trends, employment data, GDP growth, and global economic conditions before making any decisions. Goolsbee‚Äôs comments suggest a possibility within the next year, but no definitive timeline has been set. 5. What factors does the Fed consider before making rate decisions? The Fed considers a wide range of factors including inflation rates (CPI, PCE), employment figures (unemployment rate, job growth), wage growth, consumer spending, business investment, and overall economic growth (GDP). They also assess global economic conditions and financial stability risks. 6. Is a significant rate cut scenario guaranteed? No, Austan Goolsbee‚Äôs statement indicates a ‚Äòchance‚Äô or ‚Äòpossibility‚Äô of significant rate cuts, not a guarantee. The Federal Reserve‚Äôs decisions are subject to ongoing economic data and evolving market conditions. Unexpected economic shifts could alter the outlook. Did you find this analysis insightful?

After recently touching the $3,500 level, many investors are now wondering: how high can ETH actually go in this cycle? Looking at Ethereum‚Äôs chart, the last all-time high was set back in November 2021 at around $4,900. Now, ETH is once again approaching important resistance levels, especially near $3,650 and $4,000. If it breaks through these zones, analysts say a push toward the previous high, and even beyond, is very likely. Ethereum is forming what‚Äôs called an ‚Äúinverse cup and handle,‚Äù a bullish formation that has led to big price breakouts in other assets like Bitcoin and gold. If ETH follows this pattern, the breakout could eventually target $10,000 or even higher, with some ambitious predictions supporting a long-term target of $15,000 by 2026. Important resistance points ahead include $3,800, $4,000, and the previous top of $4,900‚Äì$5,000. Beyond that, if the breakout is strong, $10,000 could become a realistic goal in late 2025 or early 2026. Market conditions also look favorable. Global liquidity is increasing, interest rates are expected to fall, and Bitcoin dominance is slightly declining, all good signs for Ethereum. As altcoins usually follow Bitcoin‚Äôs lead, this could be ETH‚Äôs moment to shine. In the short term, some pullbacks or consolidation could happen near resistance levels. But overall, analysts remain bullish. Many traders are choosing to stay long on Ethereum, expecting that the best is yet to come. If ETH continues its upward trend, the road to $10K might not be so far-fetched after all.",News|Crypto news|Ethereum|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|BTC|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-18 15:55:27

However, even with the turbulence, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) keeps rising, which impresses both experienced traders and crypto-whales. Mutuum finance has reached presale stage 5 of $0.03. The phase had already sold more than 80%. Mutuum Finance has already raised a sum of more than $12.6 million and its list of investors exceeds 13600 investors. As DOGE battles it with resistance levels, Mutuum Finance is slowly changing the storyline, becoming an outlier in a market that is getting to be less bullish. Dogecoin (DOGE): Navigating Support Amid Whale-Led Churn Dogecoin trades at about $0.2126 after a volatile session between around $0.199 and $0.218 and is trading at a level that has not been seen since March, with almost $1.2‚ÄØbillion DOGE traded. The on-chain indicators depict atmospheres of institutional trading during the afternoon, and $0.207 to the 0.208 range is considered a critical support area. The technicals indicate a consolidation period: a move to close above $0.22 on volume significant strength might open up a renewed bullishness toward the $0.244-$0.25 again, and a failure to hold the $0.207 might be an invitation to a re-test of the $0.199-$0.196 base. Holders are still holding on edge as they observe the persistence of momentum or the breaking of traditional meme-coin pullbacks with traders and attention turning more and more toward Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Mutuum Presale Gains Speed as Investor Interest Soars More than 13600 investors have invested in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale that has raised over $12.6 million. There is a lot of buzz about the project. MUTM tokens are priced at $0.03 during phase 5 and will increase by 16.67% during phase 6. Investors are already impatient to buy during this phase, which has sold over 80% of its tokens. Demand is growing at an exponential rate and the fact that Mutuum Finance is a DeFi innovator is valuable in view of the fact that it will be one of the best crypto investments of 2025. Mutuum‚Äôs $50K Bug Bounty Program with CertiK Security is Mutuum Finance‚Äôs number one concern. With CertiK, the platform has finally launched its Bug Bounty Program with a combined reward pool value of $50,000 USDT. The program has four tiers of severity, namely critical, major, minor, and low, to ensure that any potential weakness would be found and rewarded accordingly. This aligns with the vision of the team in creating a secure, transparent, and high-quality DeFi protocol. $100K Giveaway to Appreciate Early Backers In appreciation of its early community, Mutuum Finance has announced a $100,000 giveaway program. Ten lucky individuals will get $10,000 in MUTM tokens each. This is a strong gesture of appreciation and a motivation to establish a strong and active user base right from the start. Over 13,600 investors have now helped Mutuum Finance (MUTM) raise more than $12.6 million, propelling its Stage 5 presale past 80% sold at the still-undervalued price of $0.03. A 16.67% price increase is imminent in Phase 6, giving current participants a rare opportunity to lock in 100% gains by launch. As Dogecoin struggles to maintain momentum, Mutuum Finance is attracting serious attention from crypto whales and retail investors alike. This is a DeFi movement with security audited by CertiK, a $50K bug bounty, and a $100K giveaway rewarding early believers. Take your position before Phase 5 ends.

This breakout marks a significant shift in market trend, opening the door for a potential rally toward higher targets around the $4,000 level. Ethereum Targets $4,000 After EMA50 Breakout The Ethereum price has delivered an explosive rally after its recent breakout above the EMA50 barrier. Given this development, crypto analyst Doctor Profit has forecasted on the X social media that ETH is gearing up for a massive surge toward $4,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Shorts Reach Record Levels, How To Stay Positioned For A Breakout Sharing a detailed chart analysis, Doctor Profit disclosed that Ethereum was finally able to close above the key moving average after weeks of resistance and failed attempts to flip it into support‚Äîa struggle clearly shown by the multiple rejection wicks marked by the green arrows. Notably, Ethereum‚Äôs breakout has triggered a strong continuation move, with its price surging over 28.17% in just one week, climbing from around $2,500 to a high near $3,226, at the time of the analysis. This price action marks a significant shift in momentum, indicating that the bulls may have regained control on the higher time frame. According to Doctor Profit, Ethereum‚Äôs current technical structure suggests that further upside could follow its EMA50 breach. The clean break and hold above the moving average have invalidated previous bearish pressure zones and opened a path toward potentially higher price targets. Based on historical price behavior after similar breakouts, the analyst expects Ethereum to rally toward $4,000 in the coming weeks. Such a move would reflect a notable 9.64% increase from its current price of approximately $3,648. In his post, Doctor Profit noted that ETH is showing no immediate signs of weakness on the chart, with price holding strong above prior resistance levels. As a result, the recent breakout appears to have solidified as a new foundation for the next leg up. ETH Upside Targets Extend Beyond $4,000 Crypto market expert Henry stated in a recent analysis on X that Ethereum has staged a comeback, surging past $3,400 for the first time in five months and breaking out of a textbook Bull Flag pattern. This bullish momentum follows weeks of price consolidation and a key fakeout, which appears to have successfully flushed out prior downside liquidity. Related Reading: Ethereum Forms ‚ÄòPure Cup And Handle‚Äô Pattern After Hitting $3,000, Analysts Set New Targets After forming two distinct consolidation zones around the $1,800-$2,000 and $2,800-$3,000 levels, ETH faked a breakdown before launching into a sharp rally. The cryptocurrency‚Äôs chart structure now shows strong bullish continuation signals, with the current trend pointing toward an immediate target of $4,000. Henry has forecasted that Ethereum‚Äôs upside targets extend far beyond $4,000, with potential milestones projected at $6,000 and even $10,000.

The recent announcement from Bitcoin Treasury Capital (BTC AB) has once again put the spotlight on the growing trend of corporate Bitcoin holdings. Imagine a company so dedicated to Bitcoin that its very name reflects its primary asset strategy. This isn‚Äôt just a fleeting interest; it‚Äôs a calculated move that speaks volumes about the evolving perception of Bitcoin in traditional finance. Understanding Bitcoin Treasury Capital‚Äôs Latest BTC Acquisition The news broke via X (formerly Twitter): Bitcoin Treasury Capital (BTC AB) has just bolstered its digital asset portfolio with an additional purchase of 4.5 BTC. While 4.5 Bitcoin might seem like a modest sum to some, it represents a strategic increment that brings their total holdings to an impressive 156 BTC. This isn‚Äôt a one-off event but part of an ongoing commitment by BTC AB to integrate Bitcoin deeply into its treasury management strategy. Their consistent accumulation underscores a strong belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term value proposition. For those unfamiliar, Bitcoin Treasury Capital is a prime example of a company specifically structured around holding Bitcoin as its primary treasury asset. Unlike traditional corporations that might allocate a small percentage to crypto, BTC AB‚Äôs core mission revolves around leveraging Bitcoin for its potential as a store of value and a hedge against macroeconomic uncertainties. This latest BTC acquisition isn‚Äôt merely a transaction; it‚Äôs a reaffirmation of their conviction and a testament to the increasing institutional comfort with the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency. This move by BTC AB reflects a broader narrative unfolding across the global financial landscape. As fiat currencies face inflationary pressures and traditional investment avenues yield diminishing returns, more and more entities are looking towards alternative assets. Bitcoin, with its decentralized nature and fixed supply, presents a compelling case. BTC AB‚Äôs actions serve as a practical demonstration of this shift, providing a real-world example of a company actively executing a dedicated digital asset strategy . Why Are Corporate Bitcoin Holdings on the Rise? The question on many minds is: why are more and more corporations, from tech giants to specialized investment firms like Bitcoin Treasury Capital, choosing to allocate significant portions of their balance sheets to Bitcoin? The reasons are multifaceted and often align with long-term strategic goals rather than short-term speculative gains. Here are some key drivers behind the surge in corporate Bitcoin holdings : Inflation Hedge: In an era of unprecedented monetary expansion and rising inflation, Bitcoin‚Äôs capped supply of 21 million coins makes it an attractive hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Companies are looking for ways to preserve purchasing power. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury offers a non-correlated asset class that can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk and enhance returns, especially during periods of market volatility in traditional assets. Store of Value: Often dubbed ‚Äúdigital gold,‚Äù Bitcoin is increasingly recognized for its properties as a secure, censorship-resistant, and globally transferable store of value, making it ideal for long-term treasury reserves. Future-Proofing: Companies are recognizing the growing importance of digital assets in the global economy. Investing in Bitcoin today can be seen as a forward-thinking move, positioning them for future financial paradigms. Investor Confidence: For publicly traded companies, holding Bitcoin can sometimes signal innovation and a progressive outlook, potentially attracting a new generation of investors interested in the digital economy. This trend isn‚Äôt isolated to a few pioneers. Companies across various sectors have begun to embrace Bitcoin. While MicroStrategy remains the most prominent example with its aggressive accumulation strategy, many others have followed suit, albeit with varying degrees of exposure. Table: Select Public Companies with Significant Bitcoin Holdings (Examples) Company Name Primary Business Approximate BTC Holdings (as of recent reports) Reason for Holding MicroStrategy Business Intelligence Software ~214,400 BTC Primary treasury reserve asset, long-term strategy Marathon Digital Holdings Bitcoin Mining ~17,800 BTC Operational holdings, treasury strategy Tesla Electric Vehicles & Clean Energy ~9,720 BTC Balance sheet diversification, strategic investment Hut 8 Mining Bitcoin Mining ~9,100 BTC Operational holdings, treasury strategy Block, Inc. (formerly Square) Financial Services & Mobile Payments ~8,027 BTC Balance sheet diversification, innovation Note: These figures are approximate and subject to change based on ongoing purchases or sales. Crafting a Robust Digital Asset Strategy For any corporation considering or already implementing a Bitcoin treasury, developing a comprehensive digital asset strategy is paramount. It‚Äôs not simply about buying Bitcoin; it involves careful planning, risk assessment, and integration into existing financial frameworks. Key considerations for a corporate digital asset strategy include: Risk Management: Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility is a known factor. Companies must establish clear risk parameters, including allocation limits, stop-loss strategies, and diversification within their digital asset portfolio if applicable. Custody Solutions: Secure storage of Bitcoin is critical. Companies often opt for institutional-grade custodians with robust security protocols, multi-signature wallets, and insurance policies. Self-custody, while offering ultimate control, comes with significant operational risks that many corporations are unwilling to bear. Accounting and Reporting: The accounting treatment for Bitcoin can be complex and varies by jurisdiction. Companies need to work with financial experts to ensure proper reporting and compliance with accounting standards (e.g., FASB‚Äôs new fair value accounting for crypto assets). Regulatory Compliance: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. Businesses must stay abreast of new regulations, tax implications, and AML/KYC requirements in all relevant jurisdictions. Internal Education: Ensuring that key stakeholders, from the board of directors to finance teams, understand the nuances of Bitcoin and blockchain technology is crucial for successful adoption and management. While the benefits are compelling, companies must also navigate potential challenges. These include market volatility, which can lead to significant swings in reported asset values; regulatory uncertainty, which can create compliance hurdles; and the need for specialized security measures to protect these valuable digital assets from cyber threats. However, for companies like Bitcoin Treasury Capital, these challenges are outweighed by the long-term strategic advantages and the belief in Bitcoin‚Äôs foundational strength. The Impact of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption on the Market The increasing trend of institutional Bitcoin adoption , exemplified by companies like Bitcoin Treasury Capital, has profound implications for the broader cryptocurrency market. When large corporations and investment funds enter the Bitcoin space, they bring with them significant capital, increased legitimacy, and often, a long-term holding perspective. This influx of institutional capital can lead to several key effects: Price Stability and Growth: While Bitcoin remains volatile, increased institutional buying can contribute to greater market depth and potentially dampen extreme price swings over time. Their demand also reduces the circulating supply available on exchanges, which can be a bullish factor for price. Legitimization of the Asset Class: When reputable companies add Bitcoin to their balance sheets, it sends a powerful signal to other traditional finance players, regulators, and the general public. It helps to normalize Bitcoin as a legitimate financial asset, moving it beyond its early reputation. Infrastructure Development: Institutional demand drives the development of more robust and secure infrastructure, including regulated exchanges, custodial services, and financial products like Bitcoin ETFs, making it easier for even more institutions to participate. Increased Liquidity: While institutional purchases can reduce circulating supply, their trading activities (when they occur) can also add liquidity to the market, improving overall market efficiency. The consistent purchases by entities like BTC AB are not just isolated events; they are part of a larger, global narrative where Bitcoin is transitioning from a niche digital currency to a recognized global macro asset. This shift is critical for Bitcoin‚Äôs continued maturation and its integration into the mainstream financial system. The more companies that follow this path, the stronger the network effect becomes, solidifying Bitcoin‚Äôs position as a cornerstone of the future digital economy. Benefits of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Inflation Protection: A hedge against fiat currency devaluation. Portfolio Diversification: Adds a non-correlated asset to traditional holdings. Potential for Appreciation: Exposure to a high-growth asset class. Innovation & Future-Proofing: Positions the company at the forefront of digital finance. Enhanced Brand Image: Signals forward-thinking and technological savviness. Challenges of Corporate Bitcoin Adoption: Price Volatility: Can lead to significant fluctuations in treasury value. Regulatory Uncertainty: Evolving legal and tax frameworks. Security Risks: Requires robust cybersecurity measures for custody. Accounting Complexities: Specific accounting treatments are still being defined. Public Perception: May face skepticism from traditional investors. Actionable Insights for Businesses: Start Small: Begin with a small allocation to understand the dynamics before scaling up. Educate Internally: Ensure your finance, legal, and executive teams are well-informed. Choose Reputable Partners: Select trusted custodians, exchanges, and legal advisors. Develop Clear Policies: Establish internal guidelines for acquisition, custody, and management. Monitor Market & Regulatory Changes: Stay updated on the rapidly evolving landscape. The strategic move by Bitcoin Treasury Capital to further increase its Bitcoin holdings to 156 BTC is more than just a headline; it‚Äôs a powerful indicator of the increasing confidence and sophisticated approach that institutions are taking towards digital assets. This ongoing BTC acquisition by a company named specifically for its Bitcoin focus highlights a clear and committed digital asset strategy . As more corporations recognize the unique value proposition of Bitcoin ‚Äì from its inflation-hedging properties to its potential for long-term growth ‚Äì we can expect to see a continued rise in corporate Bitcoin holdings . This trend is not merely about accumulating a new asset; it‚Äôs about evolving treasury management for the digital age, setting a precedent for wider institutional Bitcoin adoption , and ultimately reshaping the future of finance. The journey of Bitcoin from a niche technology to a core corporate treasury asset is a testament to its enduring strength and growing global acceptance.

Why XLM Is Poised for Growth Hilton emphasized that owning XLM now means being early to a major shift. He explained that XLM isn‚Äôt just another crypto, it‚Äôs a foundational piece of a future financial system. As more institutions seek blockchain solutions that check all regulatory boxes, XLM‚Äôs compliance status gives it a strong advantage. He also noted the rising importance of tokenized real-world assets (RWAs), another fast-growing sector in which ISO-compliant blockchains could play a critical role. In his view, assets like XLM, XRP, Algorand (ALGO), Hedera (HBAR), and XDC form a strong foundation for a diversified crypto portfolio focused on long-term institutional relevance.

Since then, XLM has rallied over 110%, confirming the indicator‚Äôs accuracy and underscoring the momentum building around the asset. ‚ÄúIf you had invested $1,000, you‚Äôd be up $1,100 in profit,‚Äù he said, encouraging viewers to consider both the fundamentals and technicals when evaluating XLM‚Äôs potential. Current Price and Market Outlook As of report time, XLM is trading at $0.4669. With a market capitalization of approximately $14.5 billion, XLM currently ranks number 12 among all cryptocurrencies. Its strong rebound aligns with a broader resurgence in digital assets, particularly those tied to financial infrastructure and compliance. The Stellar network continues to gain relevance through real-world partnerships, such as with MoneyGram and Circle, enhancing its role in cross-border payments and decentralized finance (DeFi). In conclusion, Austin Hilton‚Äôs message is clear: XLM is not just a speculative asset, it‚Äôs a strategic investment in the future of regulated blockchain finance. As institutions and governments move toward blockchain integration, ISO-compliant cryptos like XLM are likely to lead the way. For holders and potential investors alike, staying informed and understanding the bigger picture could make all the difference in the coming market cycle.

Safeguards against biorisks were introduced for o3 and o4 mini models to prevent harmful advice. The company also enhanced ChatGPT‚Äôs online shopping experience with recommendations, images, and product reviews. A new ‚Äòlibrary‚Äô section for AI-generated images was added, and OpenAI hinted at potentially adjusting safeguards if rivals release ‚Äòhigh-risk‚Äô AI without comparable protections. March 2025: Open Models and Content Policies: OpenAI announced plans to release a new ‚Äòopen‚Äô AI language model, its first since GPT-2, in the coming months. It also made a notable change to its content moderation policies, allowing ChatGPT to generate images of public figures and hateful symbols when requested, a move that sparked debate. The adoption of Anthropic‚Äôs Model Context Protocol (MCP) aims to improve AI model accuracy and enable bidirectional links with data sources.

February 2025: Simplified Offerings and Transparency: OpenAI canceled the standalone release of its o3 AI model in favor of a ‚Äòunified‚Äô next-gen release, GPT-5, integrating various technologies. The company also provided more transparency on its o3-mini model‚Äôs ‚Äòchain of thought‚Äô process, showing more reasoning steps. A significant user experience update allowed anyone to use ChatGPT web search without logging in, expanding accessibility. January 2025: Agents and User Customization: OpenAI launched Operator, a general-purpose AI agent capable of autonomously performing web browser tasks like booking travel. The company also introduced a new beta feature called ‚Äòtasks‚Äô for scheduling reminders and recurring tasks. Users gained the ability to customize ChatGPT‚Äôs personality with ‚Äòtraits‚Äô like ‚Äòchatty‚Äô or ‚ÄòGen Z‚Äô, offering a more personalized interaction experience.

Advanced uses include solving complex scientific problems and programming in various languages. The availability of a free mobile app and an API has democratized access to this powerful technology, fostering innovation across startups and established enterprises alike. ChatGPT‚Äôs Impact on Industries and the Future of Generative AI The influence of ChatGPT extends far beyond individual productivity, shaping industry dynamics and investment trends. While referrals from ChatGPT to news sites are increasing, they are often insufficient to offset declines in clicks as more users obtain news directly from AI-powered search results. This shift underscores the disruptive potential of Generative AI on traditional content consumption models. OpenAI‚Äôs ambitious vision for a more personalized ChatGPT, capable of tracking and remembering every detail of a person‚Äôs life, points towards a future of highly integrated and intuitive AI assistants. This vision, coupled with the company‚Äôs ‚ÄòOpenAI for Countries‚Äô program aimed at developing local AI infrastructure globally, signals a move towards widespread AI adoption and customization to meet diverse linguistic and regional needs.

When you buy a share of an ETF, you‚Äôre essentially buying a small piece of every asset in that fund. Many ETFs are designed to track specific indexes, such as the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ-100. Others focus on particular sectors, countries, or investment themes. What makes ETFs unique is their flexibility ‚Äî they can be bought or sold at market price throughout the trading day, unlike mutual funds, which only trade at the end of the day. What Are the Key Benefits of Investing in ETFs? ETFs come with several advantages. First, they offer built-in diversification. Instead of buying individual stocks one by one, investors gain exposure to many assets simultaneously, reducing risk across their portfolios. They also tend to have lower fees than mutual funds, especially those that are passively managed. This cost-efficiency can lead to improved long-term performance, especially for hands-off investors. ETFs are also highly liquid, meaning they can be bought or sold quickly during market hours. Finally, their structure makes them relatively tax-efficient. Thanks to how ETFs are created and redeemed, many investors can benefit from fewer capital gains distributions than traditional funds. What Are the Potential Drawbacks of ETFs? While ETFs boast a range of benefits, they‚Äôre not without downsides. For one, market risk still applies. If the overall market or the sector an ETF tracks goes down, the value of the ETF will likely follow. Diversification can help reduce risk, but it doesn‚Äôt eliminate it. Some investors may also over-diversify by holding too many ETFs, which can dilute potential gains and make portfolios harder to manage. Leveraged or inverse ETFs are another risk ‚Äî these are designed for short-term trading and can carry significantly higher volatility and complexity. Lastly, certain niche ETFs may have low trading volumes, which can affect price accuracy and liquidity when trying to buy or sell shares. What Are the Most Common Types of ETFs? There‚Äôs no one-size-fits-all ETF, since different types serve different goals. For example, index ETFs, like those tracking the S&P 500, are popular for broad market exposure. Meanwhile, sector ETFs focus on specific industries, such as technology, healthcare, or energy, offering targeted investment opportunities. Bond ETFs provide access to fixed-income assets, which can offer stability and passive income. Thematic ETFs track emerging trends or niche areas like clean energy, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. Finally, international ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to foreign markets, including developed and emerging economies. Who Should Consider Investing in ETFs? ETFs can be a solid choice for many types of investors. Those new to investing may appreciate their simplicity, lower costs, and diversification. Meanwhile, long-term investors often use them to build retirement portfolios or achieve steady, passive market exposure. They can also be helpful for people looking to invest regularly through dollar-cost averaging or automated plans. However, ETFs may not suit short-term traders hoping for quick gains, especially if they‚Äôre drawn to more volatile or specialized funds. As with any investment, you should match your ETF choices with your personal financial goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance. How To Get Started With ETFs Getting started with ETFs is relatively straightforward, especially through online brokerages and investment apps . Most platforms allow investors to search for ETFs by category, sector, or performance. Before buying, it‚Äôs important to review each fund‚Äôs expense ratio, holdings, and historical performance. Look for ETFs that align with your long-term goals rather than chasing recent trends. Pay attention to the fund‚Äôs liquidity and how closely it tracks its intended index. For those unsure where to begin, many platforms offer model portfolios or beginner-friendly tools to build a balanced foundation using a mix of ETFs. Weighing the Pros and Cons ETFs provide a practical, efficient way to build a diversified investment portfolio without high fees or complex strategies. While they‚Äôre not risk-free, they can be a valuable part of a long-term financial plan, especially for investors seeking passive exposure to a wide array of assets. Knowing the different types of ETFs, their potential downsides, and how they can fit into your broader financial goals is key. With the right approach and careful research, ETFs can serve as a flexible and accessible building block towards long-term wealth.

If so, you‚Äôve likely noticed the fascinating dance of large investors, often dubbed ‚Äòwhales,‚Äô whose movements can send ripples across the digital asset landscape. Recently, the crypto community has been buzzing about a significant ETH accumulation by an anonymous entity, signaling a potentially bullish outlook for Ethereum. This isn‚Äôt just a minor transaction; it‚Äôs a colossal series of withdrawals that hints at a powerful conviction in Ethereum‚Äôs future. What‚Äôs Behind This Massive ETH Accumulation ? The crypto analytics firm LookOnChain recently brought to light, via their X account, an extraordinary series of transactions involving a single anonymous wallet. This particular ‚Äòwhale‚Äô has been systematically withdrawing substantial amounts of Ethereum from the FalconX exchange. The latest reported withdrawal saw 19,550 ETH, valued at approximately $70.7 million, moved off the exchange. What makes this even more compelling is that this single transaction is part of a much larger pattern: over the past week alone, this whale has accumulated a staggering 122,691 ETH. When large sums of cryptocurrency are moved off exchanges, it‚Äôs typically interpreted as a strong signal of intent to hold, rather than to sell. Exchanges are where assets are readily available for trading. Moving them to private wallets, often referred to as ‚Äòcold storage,‚Äô suggests a long-term investment strategy. LookOnChain explicitly noted that the whale‚Äôs ‚Äúmassive accumulation continues,‚Äù underscoring the sustained nature of this activity. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the recent reported activity: Latest Withdrawal: 19,550 ETH (approx. $70.7 million) from FalconX. Weekly Total: 122,691 ETH accumulated over the past seven days. Purpose: Primarily for holding, indicating a long-term investment outlook. Source: FalconX exchange, suggesting liquidity was available for large purchases. This consistent pattern of withdrawals paints a clear picture: a deep-pocketed investor believes in the long-term value proposition of Ethereum and is willing to back that belief with significant capital. Who Are These Crypto Whales and Why Do They Matter? In the vast ocean of cryptocurrency, ‚Äòwhales‚Äô are the largest creatures ‚Äì individuals or entities holding substantial amounts of a particular digital asset. Their sheer volume of holdings means their buying or selling actions can significantly influence market prices and market sentiment . Think of them as the institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals of the crypto world. Why do their movements garner so much attention? Several reasons: Market Impact: A single large buy or sell order from a whale can create significant price swings, especially in less liquid markets. Trend Indicators: Their actions are often seen as leading indicators. If whales are accumulating, it can suggest they anticipate a price increase. If they are distributing (selling), it might signal an upcoming downturn. Resource Access: Whales often have access to more sophisticated market intelligence, research, or even insider information (though illegal if acted upon). Their moves might be based on deeper insights. Psychological Effect: Retail investors often look to whale movements for cues, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy effect on market trends. This particular crypto whale , with their sustained ETH accumulation , is demonstrating a high degree of confidence in Ethereum. Their actions suggest they are not just speculating on short-term price movements but are positioning themselves for significant long-term gains, potentially anticipating future network upgrades or broader adoption of the Ethereum ecosystem. How Does Whale Activity Influence Market Sentiment ? The actions of a prominent crypto whale can have a profound psychological impact on the broader market. When a large holder consistently withdraws a significant asset like Ethereum from exchanges, it often triggers a wave of optimism. This is because such moves reduce the immediate selling pressure on exchanges, as the coins are moved into cold storage for long-term holding. This reduction in available supply, coupled with continued demand, can naturally lead to upward price pressure. Here‚Äôs how whale activity shapes market sentiment : Supply Reduction: Moving ETH off exchanges decreases the liquid supply available for immediate sale, which can be bullish. Confidence Signal: Large accumulations signal conviction from deep-pocketed investors, which can instill confidence in smaller investors. FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): As others observe whale movements, a fear of missing out on potential gains can drive further buying, pushing prices higher. Narrative Building: Whale actions often become part of the market narrative, reinforcing bullish or bearish outlooks. In this case, the narrative around Ethereum is certainly leaning positive due to this sustained accumulation. For Ethereum, this ongoing accumulation by a significant whale reinforces the narrative of ETH as a strong long-term asset. It suggests that despite market volatility, major players see fundamental value and growth potential in the network, influencing how others perceive its future trajectory. Decoding the Investor Strategy of Large Holders Understanding the investor strategy behind massive movements like this ETH accumulation requires looking beyond just the transaction data. While we cannot know the exact motivations of an anonymous whale, we can infer common strategies employed by large holders: Long-Term Conviction: The primary takeaway from exchange withdrawals is a belief in the asset‚Äôs long-term value. This whale is likely not looking for a quick flip but is betting on Ethereum‚Äôs continued dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. Averaging Down/Up: Whales often employ dollar-cost averaging (DCA) or value averaging strategies, accumulating assets steadily over time, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. This particular whale‚Äôs consistent withdrawals suggest a continuous accumulation strategy. Market Timing (Potentially): While the primary goal is holding, whales may also attempt to time their entries during periods of perceived undervaluation or market dips, maximizing their accumulation at favorable prices. Security and Control: Holding large amounts of crypto on an exchange carries inherent risks (e.g., hacks, regulatory issues). Moving funds to a personal, secure wallet gives the owner full control and reduces counterparty risk. This specific whale‚Äôs strategy seems to be rooted in a deep understanding of Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem and its potential for future growth. Their actions serve as a powerful case study for how significant capital is deployed in the crypto space, often with a clear, long-term vision. Actionable Insights for Your Ethereum Portfolio While observing whale movements can be insightful, it‚Äôs crucial for individual investors to approach such information with a balanced perspective. Following a whale‚Äôs every move blindly is rarely a sound investor strategy . However, this ongoing ETH accumulation does offer some valuable takeaways for your own portfolio: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Whale actions are a data point, not a definitive buy signal. Understand the fundamentals of Ethereum, its technology, adoption, and future roadmap before making investment decisions. Consider Long-Term Holding: If major players are accumulating for the long term, it reinforces the idea that Ethereum has significant future potential. This might align with your own long-term investment goals. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Even strong signals like whale accumulation don‚Äôt guarantee future price appreciation. Diversify your portfolio. Monitor On-Chain Data: Tools like LookOnChain provide valuable insights into whale activity and broader market flows. Learning to interpret this data can enhance your understanding of market dynamics. Understand Exchange Flows: Recognizing that withdrawals from exchanges generally indicate holding, while deposits often precede selling, is a fundamental piece of crypto market analysis. This particular whale‚Äôs actions underscore a strong belief in Ethereum‚Äôs future. For those already invested in or considering Ethereum , this sustained accumulation provides an interesting piece of the puzzle, suggesting a powerful vote of confidence from a significant market participant. Challenges and Considerations When Tracking Whales While fascinating, relying solely on whale tracking for an investor strategy has its challenges: Anonymity: We don‚Äôt know who these whales are. They could be individuals, institutions, or even a group acting in concert. Their true motivations or internal information are unknown. Lagging Information: By the time whale movements are reported, the market may have already reacted. Manipulation: Sometimes, large transactions can be part of a larger market manipulation strategy, intended to mislead smaller investors. Different Goals: A whale‚Äôs financial goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon are likely vastly different from yours. What makes sense for them might not be suitable for your portfolio. Therefore, while observing a crypto whale ‚Äòs massive ETH accumulation is certainly noteworthy, it should be just one of many factors you consider in your comprehensive investment analysis. Conclusion: A Powerful Vote of Confidence for Ethereum The continuous, large-scale ETH accumulation by an anonymous crypto whale is a compelling development in the digital asset space. With over 122,000 ETH withdrawn from exchanges in just one week, this investor is sending a clear signal of strong, long-term conviction in Ethereum . This activity significantly impacts market sentiment , reducing immediate selling pressure and potentially fueling bullish narratives around ETH‚Äôs future price action. While individual investors should always conduct their own thorough research and develop an independent investor strategy , the actions of such a significant market participant provide valuable insight. It underscores the ongoing belief among major players in Ethereum‚Äôs foundational strength and its pivotal role in the evolving Web3 ecosystem. As the crypto landscape continues to mature, observing these ‚Äògiants‚Äô of the market offers a unique lens through which to understand the deeper currents driving digital asset valuations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does ‚Äòwhale accumulation‚Äô mean in crypto? A: ‚ÄòWhale accumulation‚Äô refers to a large investor or entity, known as a ‚Äòwhale‚Äô due to their substantial holdings, consistently buying and holding significant amounts of a cryptocurrency. When they move these assets off exchanges to private wallets, it signals an intent to hold for the long term, reducing circulating supply available for sale. Q2: Why is withdrawing ETH from an exchange considered a bullish sign? A: Withdrawing ETH from an exchange typically means the owner intends to hold it rather than sell it immediately. This reduces the supply of ETH available on exchanges, which, if demand remains constant or increases, can lead to upward price pressure. It also indicates strong conviction in the asset‚Äôs future value. Q3: How much ETH did this anonymous whale accumulate recently? A: According to LookOnChain, this anonymous whale has withdrawn 19,550 ETH (worth approximately $70.7 million) in a recent transaction, bringing their total withdrawals over the past week to a massive 122,691 ETH. Q4: Should I follow crypto whale movements for my investment decisions? A: While observing whale movements can provide interesting insights into market sentiment and potential trends, it is not advisable to blindly follow them. Whales have different financial goals, risk tolerances, and access to information. Always conduct your own thorough research (DYOR), understand the fundamentals of the asset, and make decisions based on your personal financial situation and investment strategy. Q5: What are the risks associated with tracking whale activity? A: Risks include relying on incomplete or lagging information, the potential for market manipulation, and the fact that a whale‚Äôs goals may not align with yours. Their actions are just one data point among many that should inform a comprehensive investment strategy.

Renowned Hyperliquid trader, James Wynn , has made a daring move, opening an astonishing 40x Bitcoin short position. This bold maneuver, reported by Onchain Lens via X, immediately grabbed headlines, sparking intense discussions about market sentiment, risk, and the inherent volatility of digital assets. For anyone deeply invested in the crypto space, understanding the implications of such a high-stakes trade is paramount. What exactly does a 40x Bitcoin short entail, and what could be the potential outcomes for both the trader and the broader market? Understanding the Audacious 40x Bitcoin Short At its core, a Bitcoin short position is a bet against the price of Bitcoin. Traders who short Bitcoin believe its value will decrease, allowing them to profit from the decline. The ‚Äú40x‚Äù part, however, is where the real drama unfolds. This refers to high-leverage trading , meaning James Wynn is using borrowed capital to amplify his potential gains (or losses). For every dollar of his own capital, he‚Äôs controlling $40 worth of Bitcoin. While this can lead to astronomical profits if the market moves in his favor, it also magnifies the risk of liquidation, where his entire position could be wiped out if Bitcoin‚Äôs price moves even slightly against him. Consider this simple example of how leverage works: Without Leverage: If you invest $1,000 and Bitcoin drops 10%, you make $100. With 40x Leverage: If you invest $1,000, you control $40,000 worth of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin drops 10%, your profit is $4,000 (40x $100). However, if Bitcoin rises just 2.5% (100% / 40x), you lose your entire $1,000 initial investment due to liquidation. Who is James Wynn and Why Hyperliquid is His Platform of Choice? James Wynn has gained a reputation within the crypto trading community for his aggressive and often high-conviction trades. His decision to open such a significant position on Hyperliquid is also noteworthy. Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange known for its high liquidity, low fees, and the ability to offer substantial leverage to its users. This platform appeals to experienced traders looking for maximum capital efficiency and fast execution, making it a natural fit for someone like Wynn who is willing to take on significant risk for potentially outsized returns. Hyperliquid‚Äôs architecture allows for: Deep Liquidity: Enabling large orders without significant price impact, crucial for large trades like a Bitcoin short . High Leverage Options: Attracting traders aiming for amplified profits, facilitating positions up to 50x or more. Decentralized Nature: Offering a permissionless trading environment, appealing to those who prefer self-custody and transparency. This combination makes Hyperliquid a powerful, albeit risky, playground for seasoned derivatives traders seeking opportunities in high-leverage trading . Navigating Crypto Market Volatility with High Stakes The decision to open a 40x short comes at a time when crypto market volatility remains a constant factor. Bitcoin‚Äôs price action has been unpredictable, influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory news, and institutional adoption trends. A trader taking such a massive short position likely has a strong conviction about an impending downward movement, perhaps based on technical analysis, on-chain data, or a bearish macro outlook. This highlights the inherent challenge and opportunity within the crypto space: rapid price swings can lead to immense gains or devastating losses, especially when leverage is involved. The market‚Äôs unpredictable nature is precisely what makes a 40x Bitcoin short a dangerous gamble. What are the Risks and Rewards of High-Leverage Trading? Engaging in high-leverage trading is a double-edged sword. While the allure of magnified profits is undeniable, the risks are equally amplified. Here‚Äôs a breakdown: Aspect Rewards Risks Profit Potential Significant gains from small price movements. Significant losses from small adverse price movements. Capital Efficiency Control a large position with a relatively small amount of capital. High risk of liquidation, losing entire collateral. Market Timing Ability to capitalize on short-term market fluctuations. Vulnerable to sudden market whipsaws and flash crashes, especially with high crypto market volatility . Psychological Impact Thrill of high-stakes trading. High stress, emotional decision-making, potential for burnout. The thin margin for error with a 40x position means that even a minor upward price correction in Bitcoin could lead to a rapid and complete loss for James Wynn ‚Äòs position. This is why such trades are often viewed as incredibly risky, even by seasoned professionals. What Does This Mean for the Broader Crypto Market Volatility? While one trader‚Äôs position, no matter how large, rarely dictates the entire market, a high-profile move like James Wynn ‚Äòs 40x Bitcoin short can certainly influence sentiment. It signals a strong bearish conviction from an influential trader, potentially leading others to re-evaluate their own long positions or consider shorting. However, the market is vast and complex, and a single position is unlikely to cause a major shift unless it triggers a cascade of liquidations or is followed by broader macroeconomic catalysts. The ongoing crypto market volatility means that such positions are always under immense scrutiny, and their outcomes are closely watched by traders globally. This event on Hyperliquid underscores the dynamic nature of crypto derivatives. Actionable Insights for Your Trading Strategy: Risk Management is Key: Never trade with leverage you don‚Äôt understand or can‚Äôt afford to lose. Start small, especially when exploring high-leverage trading . Understand Liquidation: Know your liquidation price and set stop-loss orders diligently to protect your capital. Market Analysis: Base your trades on thorough research, fundamental analysis, and technical indicators, not just on what influential traders like James Wynn are doing. Emotional Control: High-leverage trading amplifies emotions. Stick to your plan and avoid impulsive decisions, particularly during periods of high crypto market volatility . Diversify: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket, especially with high-risk assets and strategies. The bold move by James Wynn on Hyperliquid serves as a powerful reminder of the high-stakes nature of cryptocurrency derivatives. While the potential for exponential gains is enticing, the risk of equally dramatic losses is ever-present, particularly with extreme leverage. As the crypto market continues its dynamic dance, all eyes will be on how this audacious Bitcoin short position plays out, offering valuable lessons for traders navigating the turbulent waters of digital assets.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does a ‚Äú40x Bitcoin short‚Äù mean? A1: A 40x Bitcoin short means a trader is betting on Bitcoin‚Äôs price to fall, using 40 times their initial capital through borrowed funds. For every $1 of their own money, they control $40 worth of Bitcoin, amplifying both potential profits and losses. This is a form of high-leverage trading . Q2: What is Hyperliquid? A2: Hyperliquid is a decentralized perpetual exchange (DEX) that allows users to trade cryptocurrency derivatives, including perpetual futures, with high leverage. It‚Äôs known for its speed, low fees, and deep liquidity, making it a popular choice for experienced traders like James Wynn . Q3: What are the main risks of high-leverage trading? A3: The primary risk is liquidation, where a small adverse price movement can wipe out the entire collateral. Other risks include amplified losses, high volatility exposure, and the psychological stress of rapid market changes, especially given the inherent crypto market volatility . Q4: Can one trader‚Äôs position significantly impact the entire crypto market? A4: While a single large position like James Wynn ‚Äòs can influence short-term sentiment and potentially trigger liquidations, it rarely dictates the entire market. The crypto market is vast and influenced by numerous factors, so one trade typically won‚Äôt cause a sustained major shift on its own. Q5: What should beginner traders consider before using leverage? A5: Beginner traders should exercise extreme caution. It‚Äôs crucial to thoroughly understand how leverage works, the concept of liquidation, and to implement strict risk management strategies like stop-loss orders. Most experts advise against using high leverage for beginners due to the high risks involved with crypto market volatility .

48484681,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74743,1752855350,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"OpenFundNet Redefines Crypto Participation as XRP, Kaspa, and Cardano Maintain Traditional Roles",https://timestabloid.com/openfundnet-redefines-crypto-participation-as-xrp-kaspa/,"A New Era of Active Engagement Emerges As the decentralized web matures, a transformation is underway in how users engage with blockchain platforms. OpenFundNet , a newly launched crowdfunding protocol, is drawing attention for offering a model that goes beyond holding, staking, or mining. Instead, it positions users as essential contributors‚Äîvalidators, funders, and creators‚Äîwith token rewards tied directly to participation. This model stands in contrast to more established cryptocurrencies like XRP, Kaspa, and Cardano, where user roles have largely been built around network support and token economics. Traditional Platforms Centered Around Infrastructure For years, platforms such as XRP, Kaspa, and Cardano have led in building decentralized infrastructure. XRP focuses on facilitating fast, low-cost cross-border payments, particularly within the banking sector. While its consensus protocol involves selected validators, the average user‚Äôs interaction remains minimal‚Äîprimarily as a sender or holder of tokens. Kaspa, with its high-speed blockDAG structure, caters to miners who support network security and throughput, but participation is still limited to technical contribution via mining rigs and hardware operations. Cardano, known for its academic development style and layered architecture, offers more democratic features through proof-of-stake and treasury proposals. $OFNT Token Sale | Buy $OFNT Now! OpenFundNet‚Äôs Contribution-Based Ecosystem OpenFundNet introduces a framework in which user participation becomes the core engine of value creation. Instead of rewarding users for how much they hold or how long they stake, the platform distributes tokens based on what participants do. Project creators propose milestone-based initiatives, backers choose to fund projects in stages, and validators evaluate and score campaigns using both data and dialogue with the community. Unlike many decentralized platforms that rely on technical participation, such as node operation or delegation, OpenFundNet opens the door to non-technical users who still want to contribute meaningfully. Those who engage with the platform by funding credible ideas or reviewing projects transparently earn tokens not as a passive dividend, but as a reflection of involvement and trust. Tokens That Do More Than Sit in Wallets On OpenFundNet, tokens are not only financial assets‚Äîthey are tools for platform influence. Once earned, native tokens can be staked for passive rewards, but also used for governance voting and project validation. This creates a dynamic in which reputation is built through active contribution rather than sheer ownership. In contrast, XRP primarily functions as a medium of exchange. Kaspa‚Äôs mining ecosystem is deeply performance-based but lacks a flexible governance layer for casual users. Cardano offers voting on community funds and development proposals, but participation remains closely tied to ADA holdings and the ecosystem‚Äôs long proposal cycles. Building Trust Through Transparent Validation One of the most distinctive elements of OpenFundNet is its validator system, which relies on community scoring and direct engagement with project pages and chat feedback. Validators are not anonymous algorithms or passive delegates‚Äîthey are active users with a stake in the credibility of the projects they evaluate. Their input influences visibility, milestone payouts, and long-term platform health. This participatory approach addresses long-standing concerns in Web3 regarding transparency and project legitimacy, offering a new path for platforms where trust is earned through interaction. Global Access With Multi-Chain Interoperability in Sight While OpenFundNet currently operates its own native ecosystem, future plans suggest integration with major layer-1 blockchains, including XRP Ledger, Kaspa , and Cardano. This would allow backers to fund projects using familiar tokens while leveraging each coin‚Äôs unique advantages. XRP‚Äôs speed and cost efficiency could streamline global donations. Kaspa‚Äôs rapid confirmation time could support real-time milestone payouts. Cardano‚Äôs identity tools and governance structures might enhance validator transparency and trust scoring. Such integration would enable OpenFundNet to function as a value layer across several blockchains, rather than remaining siloed. Shifting the Definition of Participation in Web3 The growing interest in https://presale.openfundtoken.io/#/ points to a broader trend in the decentralized economy‚Äîa shift from speculation to contribution. In earlier stages of crypto adoption, users were mostly incentivized to buy and hold tokens, mine blocks, or passively stake coins. Now, with platforms like OpenFundNet, the definition of value creation is expanding to include time, trust, validation, and grassroots funding. This evolution suggests that in the next wave of blockchain platforms, user participation will no longer be measured only by capital input or computational power but also by community interaction, idea evaluation, and social contribution.
