48438238,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=790135,1752793206,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/48438238.jpeg,Pundit Warns XRP Investors To Not Make This Grave Mistake This Cycle,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-investors-grave-mistake/,"A powerful message has emerged from a recent episode of the Good Evening Crypto YouTube show that urged XRP holders to rethink their exit strategy ahead of what may be one of the most pivotal crypto cycles yet. Host Abdullah Nassif ‚ÄúAbs‚Äù issued a strong caution against selling XRP by pointing to a combination of regulatory progress and tokenization of real-world assets as signs that the current cycle may just be getting started for the XRP price. The One Rule XRP Holders Must Remember Abs amplified a sentiment shared by a speaker who stressed that XRP holders should not sell, especially not during the coming price spikes. ‚ÄúHold a minimum of 10,000 units in a cold storage,‚Äù the speaker said. ‚ÄúSelling is the worst possible thing you can do to an XRP. If you sell your XRP when the price bumps, you‚Äôre going to cause a problem.‚Äù Related Reading: Prepare For ATHs: ‚ÄòXRP Train Has Left The Station ‚Äì Analyst This advice is based on the outlook that XRP is set to benefit from the coming wave of real-world asset tokenization. Abs argued that trillions of dollars are on the verge of flowing into blockchain ecosystems through tokenized assets, with the XRP Ledger expected to capture a significant portion of that activity. ‚ÄúFrom just a few billion today, tokenization is forecasted to grow to $19 trillion by 2030,‚Äù he said. That growth, coupled with XRP‚Äôs central role in facilitating this future, means current holders are sitting on what could become generational wealth if they resist the urge to exit too soon. Throughout the episode, the host and his co-host, ‚ÄúJohnny Crypto,‚Äù outlined a series of catalysts they believe will push the XRP price into a new era. Among them is the ‚ÄúBig Beautiful Bill,‚Äù a $1.6 trillion economic stimulus package that could flood markets with liquidity. According to Abs, this money will drive regular investors into risk-on assets like XRP. He also touched on legal developments, noting the SEC may be nearing a decision to drop its appeal in the ongoing Ripple case. Another positive catalyst is the possible approval of 19 different XRP ETFs that are set to launch around October 18. According to him, when XRP starts registering daily closings above $3.25, the price chart is going to move in ways never seen before. As such, there‚Äôs also the possibility of XRP reaching the double-digit threshold above $10 in 2025. Still, XRP investors should not make the mistake of selling. The Case For Holding Long-Term Interestingly, co-host Johnny Crypto also noted that the most positive catalyst of all is if Fed Chair Jed Powell gets booted and a new Fed Chair comes in that lowers interest rates. ‚ÄúThat means all bets are on for risk-on assets, and crypto will probably be the number one beneficiary,‚Äù he said. Related Reading: XRP Wave 3 Could Repeat 600% Surge From Nov 2025, Target Set For $15 Johnny Crypto also added a personal layer to the discussion by sharing a painful lesson from his past. In 1997, he sold a large amount of Amazon stock he owned far too early, a decision that cost him $52 million in missed gains. This time, he said, the strategy is different. Although he might sell about 30% of his holdings, selling the entire stash is not an option. He mentioned that he‚Äôs considering placing his XRP in a trust or even borrowing against it to maintain long-term exposure. Johnny also issued a broader warning, noting that banks may attempt to take control of crypto assets like XRP from retail holders in the near future. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not that far away,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúProbably in the next one year, we‚Äôll hear about banks costing crypto.‚Äù At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $3.26.

The company‚Äôs hybrid model‚Äîbitcoin mining, energy sales, and AI-ready modular data pods‚Äîoffers multiple revenue streams, not just future promises. DGXX stock valuation is stretched, with negative margins and high volatility due to retail-heavy ownership, making this a high-risk, high-reward momentum play. Despite big red flags like ongoing losses and crypto dependency, DGXX could explode if it delivers; I‚Äôd treat it like a speculative call option. Introduction The July 17th move in Digi Power X Inc. ( DGXX ) wasn‚Äôt just another microcap spike on vague promises. This time, the company placed an actual purchase order with Super Micro Computer ( SMCI ) for Nvidia (NVDA) B200 (Blackwell) systems, which will power their new AI platform called NeoCloud. The stock exploded over 30% in premarket and held on to a solid 7.5% gain by market close. And I think that reaction makes sense, because it‚Äôs not a future promise; it‚Äôs an actual, active move in the right direction. About Digi Power X DGXX is easy to dismiss because it sounds like a buzzword smoothie. It‚Äôs a small-cap stock with crypto exposure, modular pods, energy, and AI. But take a second look, and it starts to get more interesting. They are mining bitcoin, but it‚Äôs not as straightforward as you might think. They‚Äôre setting up Tier 3-level, AI-ready data infrastructure. Portable modular pods (ARMS 200s) that can be deployed without needing to build a hyperscale facility from scratch. That‚Äôs the idea behind their NeoCloud platform. And even before all this AI talk, DGXX was already running a business. They‚Äôve got about 100MW of active capacity spread across three locations, with plans to scale up to 200MW or more. They‚Äôre mining bitcoin, hosting third-party miners, reselling energy, stacking solar credits in New York, and considering battery storage in Buffalo (maybe they are doing more, but this is what I have found). They even have some cash flow from it. Revenue (Seeking Alpha) Super Micro Deal The first time you could hear about Super Micro and Digi Power X relations was back in May, something about their subsidiary working on a GPU rack deployment. At the time, the stock jumped 15% premarket on the news, but it wasn‚Äôt as important because this time it was a definitive order. Nvidia B200s are being installed into their modular pods, and we will most likely see the rollout already in the fourth quarter. This is what changes things. For the first time, it feels like this company is determined to work hard and achieve its goals. The main goal, as you will see in the quote below, is to bring in Tier 3 AI compute. Besides, it‚Äôs a good sign they ordered the best to make it work‚ÄîBlackwell B200s. With Supermicro‚Äôs advanced B200 systems, we are now taking the steps to transition from infrastructure buildout to revenue generation. Our goal is to deliver Tier 3 AI-ready capacity equipped with the world‚Äôs most powerful GPUs for the generative AI era. Crypto and Energy Most of the money comes from crypto and energy. In May, DGXX brought in around $4.3 million from bitcoin mining and energy sales. They mined 35 BTC that month. By the end of June, the total crypto and cash balance jumped 45% in a month to $13.5 million. Q2 energy revenue hit $2.3 million, and they‚Äôre stacking extra value from side projects like a solar site in New York and potential battery integration. These are things most people aren‚Äôt looking at when they glance at the stock, but it‚Äôs good because it means they‚Äôre not depending entirely on one future launch. They‚Äôve already got multiple revenue streams, which, hopefully, will only grow over time. Valuation Look, I‚Äôm not going to sugarcoat this; the valuation is way ahead of the fundamentals. P/B close to 5x, P/S around 3x, no earnings, negative margins‚Äîif you‚Äôre looking for a safe entry, this isn‚Äôt it. But sometimes valuation doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story, especially with early-stage companies chasing multiple fast-growing markets. Valuation (Seeking Alpha) The Super Micro deal makes it more interesting because there is an actual deployment scheduled. And there‚Äôs already revenue from bitcoin and from energy. Besides the valuation, I noticed that ownership is mostly in the hands of individual investors (about 67% + almost 14% by individuals/insiders). That kind of ownership structure creates a very specific type of market behavior, like we saw today. Volatility on any sentiment and headline, and not necessarily on fundamentals. Ownership (Seeking Alpha) If you‚Äôve followed enough smallcaps before, you know how this works. When a company with a retail-heavy float announces something big (very much like a deal with Super Micro) or anything with Nvidia‚Äôs name in it, the stock doesn‚Äôt just go up 2‚Äì3%; it can fly 30%. Hello, DGXX, today on the premarket. But it works both ways. That same setup makes the stock fragile. If the company delays a product launch, misses a target, or if the investors get nervous for whatever reason, you‚Äôll see DGXX fall just as fast as it climbed, if not faster. There‚Äôs no cushion of long-term institutional holders who‚Äôd be expected to keep holding. It‚Äôs a news-driven, momentum stock, and that kind of ownership base is like jet fuel when things go right and a wrecking ball when they don‚Äôt. That said, I also looked at their balance sheet , and while it‚Äôs far from perfect, they‚Äôre not buried under debt. There‚Äôs some cash to support near-term operations, and they‚Äôre clearly trying to keep the dilution risk low for now. All of this makes DGXX the kind of stock you have to watch like a hawk, not something you set and forget. But if they deliver a few more solid updates, the upside could be explosive. You just have to know what you're getting into. Capital Structure (Seeking Alpha) Biggest Red Flags They‚Äôre still losing a lot of money, and gross margins are low. Almost every profitability metric is in the red. That‚Äôs not unusual for early-stage data infrastructure or mining companies, but it‚Äôs still a problem. If revenue doesn‚Äôt scale up quickly, they‚Äôll need to raise more cash. And that would almost certainly mean dilution. Profitability (Seeking Alpha) Also, the bitcoin (BTC-USD) side of the business, which is one of the main revenue drivers, depends heavily on BTC prices. If crypto has a rough few quarters, its cash will disappear very fast. Conclusion DGXX is messy. But it‚Äôs the kind of messy that might become something really interesting. The AI dream is on the way, which, I must say, is great. The company has already gone further than most microcap stocks in this space. The crypto and energy business is carrying the company while that happens. And for a company this small, it looks like a solid setup. Now pay attention; it‚Äôs solid, but that does not guarantee the success of any kind. If it makes this whole hybrid AI-crypto-energy thing work, this stock won‚Äôt stay at these levels for long, and as I already said, it has the potential to fly sky-high. So, at this point, the decision is all yours, but if I were investing in it, I would treat it as a call option. Either it surges and makes you rich, or forget about all the money you have put in. Most likely, you won‚Äôt get it back.",SMCI|SMCI:CA|NVDA|NVDA:CA|BTC-USD|DGXX|DGX:CA,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BTC|MINING|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-07-17 23:00:37

As the opening bell rang, investors observed a subtle yet significant divergence across major indices, signaling a day of careful navigation. For those deeply entrenched in the cryptocurrency space, understanding these traditional market movements is more crucial than ever, as they often provide a broader context for investor sentiment and capital flows. Understanding Today‚Äôs Market Performance The term ‚Äòmixed opening‚Äô might sound vague, but it precisely describes a scenario where different segments of the market are moving in opposite directions. This isn‚Äôt just a random fluctuation; it often reflects underlying economic currents, sector-specific news, or shifts in investor confidence. Today, the slight variations across the benchmark indices paint a nuanced picture of the current investment landscape. Here‚Äôs a snapshot of the initial Market Performance : S&P 500: -0.02% ‚Äì This broad market index, representing 500 of the largest U.S. publicly traded companies, saw a marginal dip. A slight decline here suggests a cautious mood across a wide range of industries, indicating that investors might be taking a wait-and-see approach. NASDAQ: +0.1% ‚Äì In contrast, the technology-heavy NASDAQ Index registered a modest gain. This uptick often points to continued confidence in growth-oriented sectors, particularly tech and innovation, which have been resilient even amidst broader economic uncertainties. Dow: -0.11% ‚Äì The Dow Jones Industrial Average, comprising 30 significant U.S. companies, experienced the largest percentage drop among the three. As a barometer for traditional industrial and financial giants, its decline could suggest concerns about conventional economic sectors or a rotation of capital away from ‚Äòold economy‚Äô stocks. This subtle divergence highlights the varying investor appetite for different asset classes and sectors. While some are pulling back from established industrial names, others are finding opportunities in the tech realm. What‚Äôs Driving This Nuanced Market Performance? A mixed opening is rarely a random event. Several factors could be at play, influencing how different indices respond. These include: Economic Data Releases: Upcoming or recently released economic indicators, such as inflation reports, employment figures, or manufacturing data, can significantly sway market sentiment. Positive data might boost growth stocks, while concerns about inflation could weigh on others. Corporate Earnings: The earnings season often brings volatility. Strong performance from a few major tech companies could buoy the NASDAQ, while weaker outlooks from industrial giants might drag down the Dow. Federal Reserve Policy Expectations: Investors are constantly parsing signals from the Federal Reserve regarding interest rates and monetary policy. Any hint of a hawkish or dovish stance can impact borrowing costs and corporate profitability, influencing sector performance. Geopolitical Developments: Global events, from trade tensions to international conflicts, can introduce uncertainty, causing investors to seek safety or reallocate funds based on perceived risks. Sector Rotation: Sometimes, a mixed market indicates a ‚Äòsector rotation,‚Äô where investors move capital from one industry to another based on changing economic forecasts or perceived value. For instance, a move from consumer staples to technology, or vice-versa. The current environment suggests a careful balancing act, with investors weighing the potential for continued economic growth against persistent inflationary pressures and geopolitical risks. The slight gain in the NASDAQ Index , for example, might reflect optimism about AI and technological advancements, while the Dow Jones ‚Äòs dip could signal caution regarding traditional industrial output. How Does This Affect the Broader Investment Landscape? For the average investor, and especially those active in the cryptocurrency markets, understanding these traditional market movements is paramount. While crypto often marches to its own drum, it is not entirely decoupled from the broader financial ecosystem. A cautious or negative sentiment in the traditional US Stock Market can sometimes spill over into riskier assets like cryptocurrencies, as investors might de-risk across their entire portfolio. Navigating Volatility: Actionable Insights for Investors In a mixed market, a well-thought-out strategy becomes even more important. Here are some actionable insights: Diversification is Key: Don‚Äôt put all your eggs in one basket. A diversified portfolio, including a mix of traditional stocks, bonds, and even a measured allocation to cryptocurrencies, can help mitigate risks during periods of uncertainty. Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on economic news, corporate earnings reports, and central bank announcements. These can provide early indicators of market shifts. Long-Term Perspective: Short-term fluctuations are normal. For long-term investors, today‚Äôs minor movements in the S&P 500 or Dow Jones are often just noise. Focus on your long-term financial goals rather than reacting to daily swings. Re-evaluate Risk Tolerance: A mixed market is a good time to reassess your personal risk tolerance. Are you comfortable with the current level of volatility in your portfolio? Adjust as necessary. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging: For those investing regularly, dollar-cost averaging can be an effective strategy. This involves investing a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market highs or lows, which can help average out your purchase price over time. The Interplay: Traditional Markets and Crypto While the NASDAQ Index , S&P 500 , and Dow Jones represent the backbone of traditional finance, their performance often sets the stage for broader investor confidence. When traditional markets show resilience, or even subtle gains in growth sectors like tech (as seen with the NASDAQ today), it can foster a more risk-on environment, potentially benefiting cryptocurrencies. Conversely, significant downturns or sustained uncertainty in traditional markets can lead to capital flight from more speculative assets. For crypto enthusiasts, observing the subtle shifts in the US Stock Market provides valuable context. It helps in understanding macro-economic headwinds or tailwinds that might indirectly influence the digital asset space. The correlation isn‚Äôt always direct, but the underlying investor psychology and capital availability are undeniably linked. Looking Ahead: What to Watch For The mixed opening today serves as a reminder that markets are dynamic and constantly adjusting. Investors should closely monitor several key areas in the coming days and weeks: Inflation Data: Any new inflation readings will be critical, as they directly influence central bank policy decisions. Employment Figures: Strong or weak job reports can indicate the health of the economy and consumer spending. Corporate Guidance: Pay attention to forward-looking statements from major companies, as they offer insights into future business conditions. Global Events: Geopolitical stability or instability can quickly shift market sentiment across all asset classes. Conclusion: Navigating the Nuances Today‚Äôs mixed opening in the US Stock Market is a testament to the complex forces at play in the global economy. While the S&P 500 and Dow Jones showed slight declines, the NASDAQ Index managed a modest gain, highlighting a divergence in investor sentiment across different sectors. This nuanced Market Performance underscores the importance of a well-informed and diversified investment strategy. For both traditional and crypto investors, understanding these subtle shifts provides crucial insights into the broader financial landscape, enabling more strategic decision-making in an ever-evolving market.

Imagine a publicly traded company, a titan like Enlightify Inc., making a direct, substantial commitment to a specific crypto asset. This isn‚Äôt just a hypothetical scenario; it‚Äôs the groundbreaking reality announced by the Cyber Foundation (CYBER), revealing Enlightify‚Äôs strategic decision to acquire up to $20 million worth of CYBER tokens over the next year. This bold move isn‚Äôt just news; it‚Äôs a powerful statement about the evolving landscape of digital finance. Unpacking the Significance of the CYBER Token Before delving deeper into the investment, it‚Äôs essential to understand what makes the CYBER token a compelling asset. CYBER is the native token of Cyber, a decentralized social graph protocol that aims to empower users with true ownership of their digital identities and content. In an increasingly digital world, where platforms often control user data, Cyber offers a decentralized alternative, giving power back to the individual. This focus on user-centricity and data ownership resonates deeply with the core principles of Web3. The protocol facilitates the creation of a universal identity layer, allowing users to move their social connections and content across different decentralized applications seamlessly. This utility positions CYBER not just as a speculative asset, but as a foundational component for a more open and equitable internet. Enlightify‚Äôs interest likely stems from this long-term vision and the practical application of the Cyber protocol in the burgeoning decentralized ecosystem. The Landmark Enlightify Investment: What It Means Enlightify Inc. (NYSE: ENFY), a publicly traded entity, has announced its intention to acquire up to $20 million worth of CYBER tokens over the next 12 months. This is a monumental development for several reasons: First-of-its-Kind Commitment: This marks the first time a publicly traded company has explicitly committed a significant portion of its treasury funds directly to CYBER. It sets a precedent for how traditional corporations might engage with specialized crypto assets. Strategic Alignment: The investment follows Enlightify‚Äôs strategic realignment of its subsidiary, Antaeus Tech, to focus specifically on blockchain initiatives. This isn‚Äôt a speculative gamble but a calculated move aligning with their broader technological vision. Long-Term Confidence: The 12-month acquisition window indicates a long-term perspective rather than a short-term trade. It suggests Enlightify sees sustained value and growth potential in the Cyber ecosystem. This Enlightify investment is not merely a financial transaction; it‚Äôs a vote of confidence from the traditional financial world in the utility and future of decentralized protocols. Rising Tide: The Era of Institutional Crypto Adoption For years, cryptocurrency was largely seen as a retail-driven phenomenon, often viewed with skepticism by large financial institutions. However, that narrative has been steadily changing. We are now witnessing a clear and accelerating trend of institutional crypto adoption . This shift is driven by several factors: Maturing Market Infrastructure: The development of regulated custody solutions, derivatives markets, and clearer regulatory frameworks has made crypto more accessible and less risky for institutions. Inflationary Hedges and Diversification: In an era of economic uncertainty, institutions are exploring alternative assets that can offer diversification and potential hedges against traditional market volatility. Technological Innovation: Beyond just Bitcoin, institutions are recognizing the transformative potential of blockchain technology across various sectors, from finance to supply chain management and digital identity. Enlightify‚Äôs move with CYBER is a powerful testament to this growing institutional comfort and strategic engagement with digital assets, moving beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum to more specialized tokens. Why Specialized Blockchain Networks Are Gaining Traction While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain cornerstones of the crypto market, a new wave of interest is focusing on specialized blockchain networks . These networks are designed for specific purposes, offering optimized performance, scalability, and unique functionalities tailored to particular use cases. Cyber, as a decentralized social graph protocol, is a prime example of such a specialized network. Its focus on digital identity and social connections addresses a specific need in the Web3 landscape. Institutions like Enlightify are increasingly looking beyond general-purpose blockchains to invest in protocols that solve real-world problems and have clear application layers. This strategic focus allows them to tap into niche but rapidly growing markets, potentially yielding higher returns and aligning with their core business objectives. Corporate Strategy: Leveraging Crypto Treasury Funds The decision by Enlightify to allocate up to $20 million of its crypto treasury funds to CYBER tokens signifies a major evolution in corporate finance. Traditionally, corporate treasuries are managed conservatively, primarily holding cash, short-term bonds, or other highly liquid assets. However, a growing number of forward-thinking companies are beginning to explore digital assets as part of their treasury management strategy. This can serve multiple purposes: Strategic Investment: Investing in assets that align with the company‚Äôs long-term technological vision or industry focus. Inflation Hedge: Protecting corporate capital from the eroding effects of inflation. Balance Sheet Optimization: Potentially enhancing returns on idle cash reserves. Signaling Innovation: Demonstrating a commitment to cutting-edge technology and future trends. Enlightify‚Äôs move could inspire other publicly traded companies to consider similar allocations, further legitimizing crypto assets within mainstream corporate finance. Benefits and Implications This significant investment carries a multitude of benefits and implications for all stakeholders: For CYBER: Enhanced liquidity, increased market visibility, validation of its underlying technology, and potential for further development and adoption. The capital infusion can fuel innovation within the Cyber ecosystem. For Enlightify: A strategic position in the burgeoning Web3 social identity space, potential for significant returns on investment, and a strengthened reputation as a forward-thinking technology company. For the Crypto Market: Further validation of institutional interest beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, paving the way for more diverse corporate investments in altcoins and specialized protocols. It signals a maturation of the market. For Users: Increased development and adoption of decentralized social graph protocols, potentially leading to better, more private, and user-owned digital experiences. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the news is overwhelmingly positive, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that the crypto market, including specialized tokens like CYBER, remains volatile. Factors such as broader market sentiment, regulatory developments, and project-specific execution risks can influence token performance. Enlightify‚Äôs 12-month acquisition strategy mitigates some of this risk by dollar-cost averaging, but the inherent volatility of digital assets remains a consideration for any institutional or retail investor. Actionable Insights for Investors and Enthusiasts What does Enlightify‚Äôs bold move mean for you? Research is Key: This highlights the importance of researching projects with strong fundamentals and clear utility, not just following hype. CYBER‚Äôs focus on decentralized identity is a compelling use case. Long-Term Vision: Institutional players often have a longer investment horizon. This encourages a similar approach for retail investors looking at projects with significant long-term potential. Diversification: While large-cap cryptos are important, this event underscores the potential in specialized blockchain networks addressing specific industry needs. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on further institutional announcements and how traditional companies integrate blockchain into their core strategies. This development is a strong indicator that the lines between traditional finance and the decentralized world are blurring, creating new opportunities for growth and innovation. Conclusion Enlightify Inc.‚Äôs commitment of $20 million to acquire CYBER tokens is more than just an investment; it‚Äôs a powerful symbol of the accelerating institutional adoption of digital assets and specialized blockchain networks. This landmark move underscores the growing confidence in decentralized technologies and their potential to reshape various industries. As more publicly traded companies follow Enlightify‚Äôs lead, we can expect to see an even greater integration of crypto into mainstream finance, paving the way for a more decentralized and interconnected future.

They will also include introductory guides designed for first-time crypto investors. Shinhan Bank: Crypto Services Debut While the new functions will not yet allow Shinhan customers to buy or sell crypto directly via the SOL app, the move is a significant bullish step for the financial behemoth. Shinhan Financial Group share prices over the past three months. (Source: Naver Finance) No other domestic bank has yet launched a similar service, although some are thought to be working on crypto-related projects. Currently, only five domestic crypto exchanges have obtained the necessary permits to offer KRW-crypto pairings. Banks are not yet allowed to offer crypto exchange services. However, some (including Shinhan) have previously explored the possibility of launching crypto custody services. The new SOL crypto resources include a real-time crypto price monitoring tool, introductory guides and quizzes for beginner investors, and a professional crypto-related reporting and news service. SOL Bank is Shinhan‚Äôs smart banking, financial services, and investment platform. Shinhan launched the app in 2018 when it discontinued several of its standalone apps and announced SOL would be its new unified platform. Inside a branch of Shinhan Bank in Seoul, South Korea. (Source: Choi Gwang-mo [CC BY-SA 4.0]) Stepping up Customer Protection Is Key ‚Äì Shinhan The bank said that its new resources would help boost financial consumer protection and help customers better understand how cryptoassets work. Shinhan added that it wants to help customers make information-based investments. It said it hopes to provide easy-to-understand materials for customers who are not familiar with the crypto scene, while also ‚Äúprotecting consumers.‚Äù But the bank has already indicated that it is prepared to go a step further in the near future, by integrating some functions with its crypto exchange partner Korbit. These will eventually allow customers to buy and sell coins on Korbit via the SOL app. Traders will also be able to check their crypto wallet balances from the SOL platform. Stablecoin Progress The media outlet added that Shinhan Bank launched a dedicated digital asset taskforce at the beginning of this year. The taskforce has been charged with developing and launching a range of asset-related businesses. Thus far, it has begun conduction stablecoin-based overseas remittance pilots. It has also been working on a token-powered, cross-border payment settlement project. And Shinhan has also joined the South Korean stablecoin craze , by registering a won-pegged stablecoin trademark application for the KRWSH brand. In May, meanwhile, Korbit announced that it had begun promoting corporate transaction services in conjunction with Shinhan Bank. While South Korean corporations are still not allowed to use their balance sheets to buy crypto, that is set to change later this year. The Financial Services Commission has unveiled a roadmap that will eventually allow bigger South Korean companies to invest in Bitcoin (BTC) and other tokens.

48439639,https://timestabloid.com/?p=74696,1752795045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Analyst Forecasts Shiba Inu (SHIB) 130% Surge,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-forecasts-shiba-inu-shib-130-surge/,"Shiba Inu (SHIB), the second-largest meme-based cryptocurrency by market capitalization, is showing signs of renewed strength following a prolonged period of underperformance. During its recent price recovery, a prominent analyst, known as GehavianGoals, has outlined a bullish outlook for the asset, projecting a potential rally of over 130% from its current value. Market Performance and Recent Recovery Since reaching a high of $0.0000334 in December 2024, Shiba Inu has declined significantly, dropping as low as $0.00001004 by June 2025, a correction of approximately 69%. This decline occurred even as Bitcoin recorded multiple all-time highs, underscoring a divergence in momentum between the two assets during the same timeframe. However, SHIB has recently begun reversing its downward trend. The token has appreciated by 14.51% over the past week and gained an additional 1.67% in the last 24 hours, suggesting that investor sentiment is beginning to shift. Despite these gains, SHIB remains 31% below its price at the start of the year. Technical Outlook and Support Levels In his recent analysis, GehavianGoals noted that Shiba Inu is showing signs of maintaining its upward trajectory. He identified key support levels where the asset has repeatedly rebounded, describing these areas as strong demand zones. SHIB has tested this zone several times throughout 2024 and 2025, with each test resulting in price rejections and a move higher. The most recent retests of the $0.000011 support zone occurred on February 3, March 11, April 7, and June 22. These consistent rejections of lower price levels reinforce the area‚Äôs importance as a base for potential rallies. Historically, Shiba Inu has surged significantly from this level, most notably in early 2024 when it climbed to a high of $0.00004567 before facing resistance and pulling back. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Entry Points and Price Targets The analyst shared specific buy zones to consider, with the first identified at $0.00001092, a level that SHIB has already surpassed. Another entry point is projected around $0.0000188, which is approximately 31% above the current price level. GehavianGoals has set a target of $0.00003352, representing a 130% increase from current market prices. If calculated from his initial entry at $0.00001092, the potential upside rises to 206%. While he did not offer a specific timeframe for reaching this target, he emphasized that he is prepared to hold his position for up to two years if necessary. The analyst‚Äôs bullish stance aligns with broader market sentiment within the SHIB community. Several observers believe that Shiba Inu could revisit higher price ranges if it overcomes resistance levels tied to high-volume trading clusters. A recent study also supported the view that SHIB could reclaim the $0.000035 price region under favourable technical conditions. Despite past volatility, analysts and investors are increasingly optimistic about Shiba Inu‚Äôs medium to long-term prospects , and recent technical signals suggest momentum may be returning to the asset.

If so, then the latest announcement from Binance Alpha should definitely grab your attention! This innovative platform, a key component within the broader Binance ecosystem, has just added Caldera (ERA) to its exclusive roster of early-stage crypto projects. This move isn‚Äôt just another listing; it signals a significant step in making cutting-edge blockchain innovation more accessible to a wider audience, directly through the powerful Binance Wallet. What is Binance Alpha and Why Does It Matter? Binance Alpha serves as a curated launchpad for promising, nascent cryptocurrency projects. Think of it as a specialized incubator within the massive Binance universe, designed to spotlight tokens that are still in their foundational stages but show immense potential. The platform‚Äôs selection process is rigorous, focusing heavily on two critical factors: robust community engagement and alignment with emerging market trends. This strategic approach ensures that only projects with genuine traction and relevance are showcased, offering users a unique opportunity to get involved early. For projects, being featured on Binance Alpha means unparalleled exposure and access to Binance‚Äôs vast user base. For users, it provides a vetted gateway to discover and participate in groundbreaking innovations before they hit mainstream exchanges. It‚Äôs a win-win, fostering growth for new ventures while offering exciting investment avenues for the community. Unpacking Caldera ERA : The New Kid on the Block The latest addition to the Binance Alpha family is Caldera ERA . While specific details about Caldera (ERA)‚Äôs underlying technology and use cases are still emerging, its listing on such a selective platform speaks volumes about its perceived value and potential impact. Typically, projects selected by Binance Alpha are at the forefront of innovation, addressing critical needs within the blockchain space, whether it‚Äôs enhancing scalability, improving decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure, or pioneering new applications in areas like gaming or NFTs. The inclusion of Caldera (ERA) suggests that it has demonstrated strong fundamentals, a dedicated community, and a clear vision for its role in the evolving crypto landscape. As with all early-stage projects, due diligence is paramount, but the Binance Alpha stamp of approval offers a level of confidence that can be hard to find elsewhere in the often-volatile world of new token launches. The Power of Early-Stage Crypto : Opportunities and Risks Investing in early-stage crypto projects can be incredibly exciting, offering the potential for exponential returns that are rarely seen in traditional markets. Imagine getting in on Bitcoin or Ethereum when they were just starting out! Binance Alpha aims to replicate this opportunity by identifying projects with similar transformative potential. However, it‚Äôs crucial to approach these opportunities with a clear understanding of the inherent risks. High Growth Potential: Early-stage projects can experience rapid appreciation if their technology gains adoption or their community expands significantly. Lower Entry Barriers: Often, initial investments can be relatively small, allowing more participants to get involved. Direct Impact: Users can often contribute to the project‚Äôs development or governance, feeling more connected to its success. On the flip side, early-stage ventures are inherently more volatile and carry higher risks. Project failure, technological setbacks, market manipulation, or regulatory changes can all lead to substantial losses. Therefore, a balanced approach that includes thorough research and risk management is always advisable. How Binance Wallet Facilitates Seamless Trading? One of the most significant advantages of Binance Alpha‚Äôs integration is its direct link with the Binance Wallet and the broader Binance Exchange. This seamless integration simplifies the entire process of acquiring and managing these early-stage tokens. For many new projects, accessing their tokens can involve navigating complex decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or obscure trading pairs. Binance Alpha removes these barriers, making it as straightforward as possible for users to participate. The Binance Wallet offers a secure and user-friendly interface for managing your digital assets. Its integration with Alpha means you can discover, trade, and hold new tokens like Caldera (ERA) within an environment you‚Äôre already familiar with and trust. This reduces the technical hurdles for new users and enhances the overall user experience, making participation in promising projects more accessible than ever before. Navigating On-Chain Trading : What You Need to Know The announcement specifically highlights that Binance Alpha facilitates on-chain trading . This is a crucial distinction from traditional centralized exchange trading. On-chain trading means that transactions are executed directly on the blockchain network, recorded transparently and immutably. This method offers several benefits: Transparency: All transactions are verifiable on the public ledger, increasing trust and accountability. Decentralization: While facilitated by Binance, the underlying trades are processed on the blockchain, reducing reliance on a single intermediary for execution. Direct Ownership: When you engage in on-chain trading, you typically have direct control over your assets in your wallet, rather than them being held by the exchange. By integrating on-chain trading directly into the Binance Wallet and Exchange, Binance Alpha is bridging the gap between centralized convenience and decentralized principles. This hybrid approach offers users the best of both worlds: the ease of use and liquidity of a major exchange, combined with the transparency and self-custody aspects of blockchain technology. It empowers users to engage with new projects like Caldera (ERA) in a way that aligns with the core ethos of Web3. The Synergistic Impact and Future Outlook The addition of Caldera (ERA) to Binance Alpha, with its deep integration into the Binance Wallet and emphasis on on-chain trading, creates a powerful synergy. It reinforces Binance‚Äôs commitment to fostering innovation and supporting the next generation of blockchain projects. For crypto enthusiasts, this means a new avenue for discovery and participation in what could become significant players in the market. This development underscores a broader trend in the crypto space: the increasing demand for streamlined access to promising new projects. As the ecosystem matures, platforms like Binance Alpha will play a pivotal role in democratizing access to early-stage investment opportunities, making the journey from nascent idea to widespread adoption smoother for innovative teams. Conclusion: A New Horizon for Crypto Discovery The listing of Caldera (ERA) on Binance Alpha is more than just a news item; it‚Äôs a testament to the ongoing evolution of the cryptocurrency market. It highlights Binance‚Äôs dedication to curating high-potential early-stage crypto projects and making them accessible through the robust Binance Wallet, leveraging the power of on-chain trading. For anyone looking to stay ahead of the curve in the fast-paced world of digital assets, keeping a close eye on Binance Alpha‚Äôs listings, and understanding the implications of on-chain trading, will be crucial.

Elizabeth Warren has called for more scrutiny of the booming private-credit market. On Thursday, she sent letters to S&P Global Ratings, Moody‚Äôs Ratings, and Fitch Ratings, asking for information about how they score the riskiness of private-credit products. In her letter to the ratings agencies, Warren said that overly optimistic credit ratings contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. She asked the companies for details on how they manage potential conflicts of interest and whether their methodology for assessing private-credit products differs from how they assess other products. Warren reaches out to the Treasury Secretary The Trump administration will likely give the industry more fuel by making it easier for regular people to invest in it. For example, an executive order may help make private assets more accessible to 401(k) retirement plans. Warren also wrote a different letter on Thursday asking Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to look into the size of the private credit market and how it could affect the financial stability of the US economy. Sen. Warren is pressing for clarity on the private credit market. Asking Treasury Sec. Bessent to assess its size and stability risks, while also requesting S&P, Moody‚Äôs, and Fitch explain how they rate private-credit product risk. pic.twitter.com/8VM3AXERaF ‚Äî StockStorm (@StockStormX) July 17, 2025 She said a government assessment from last year talked about the possible vulnerabilities in the private-credit market, such as its lack of transparency and developing ties to banks and other institutions. JPMorgan says private-credit is risky The private-credit market is growing quickly, which is hurting banks‚Äô more regulated lending businesses. The amount of money obtained to lend to private-equity-backed enterprises. It makes up the largest market component, and has gone up more than 100 times since 2006, reaching about $700 billion in 2024. JPMorgan and some of its competitors have lost revenue as their new, unregulated competitors have grown. Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, has said that the private-credit market is similar to the mortgage market before the 2008 financial crisis. ‚ÄúParts of direct lending are good,‚Äù Dimon said at the event. ‚ÄúBut not everyone does a great job, and that‚Äôs what causes problems with financial products.‚Äù So far, Dimon has dedicated $50 billion in the investment bank‚Äôs capital towards providing debt financing for clients doing acquisitions and other deals, effectively starting a private credit operation inside JPMorgan. In addition, some investors have voiced concerns about how private-credit products are rated, observing that the firms that package loans to back securities like collateralized debt obligations can choose their rating provider. However, according to Paul Atkins, SEC chairman, Private funds have grown dramatically in the last decade to $30.8 trillion from $11.6 trillion. ‚ÄúAllowing this option could increase investment opportunities for retail investors seeking to diversify their investment allocation in line with their investment time horizon and risk tolerance,‚Äù he said at the conference in Washington. A new strategy of extending credit originated independently The Big Guys in the private credit industry, like Apollo, Ares, and KKR, are using a very unique strategy. They give out credit that they create themselves. It is frequently backed by high-earning assets like rail carriages and data centers, which keep debtors locked in for many years. In exchange for tying up that money for nearly a decade, the borrowers are willing to pay a lot more in interest than if they had to get the money from a network bank. This is because of the long, expensive syndication process that required securing ratings from S&P and Fitch, facing tough covenants, and oftentimes enduring long waits for the funding. Also, those loans, based on their credit quality, are the equivalent of investment grade bonds, because of the ‚Äúilliquidity premium,‚Äù they merit higher rates.

One such groundbreaking announcement comes from BTC Digital (NASDAQ: BTCT), a name previously synonymous with Bitcoin. The company has now declared a monumental Ethereum shift , signaling a profound strategic reorientation that will see it move away from its Bitcoin-centric operations to fully embrace the vibrant and versatile Ethereum ecosystem. The Strategic Rationale: Why This Revolutionary Ethereum Shift? BTC Digital ‚Äòs decision to undergo a complete Ethereum shift is far more than a simple asset reallocation; it‚Äôs a fundamental re-alignment of its core business strategy. For years, Bitcoin has been celebrated as ‚Äòdigital gold,‚Äô a premier store of value and a foundational cryptocurrency. However, the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, the rapidly expanding landscape of real-world assets (RWA) on-chain, and the lucrative potential of staking demand a more versatile, programmable blockchain. Ethereum, with its robust smart contract capabilities, extensive developer community, and the recent transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), offers precisely that. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily functions as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system and a store of value, Ethereum is a global, open-source platform for decentralized applications (dApps). This distinction is crucial for a company like BTC Digital, which seeks to engage actively in complex financial protocols and asset tokenization rather than just holding a digital commodity. Ethereum‚Äôs programmability allows for the creation of intricate financial instruments, automated agreements, and new forms of digital ownership, making it the ideal foundation for their ambitious new ventures. Furthermore, Ethereum‚Äôs PoS consensus mechanism, implemented with ‚ÄòThe Merge,‚Äô has paved the way for attractive staking yields, offering a new, sustainable revenue stream that was not inherently available with Bitcoin‚Äôs Proof-of-Work (PoW) model without significant energy consumption for mining. This economic incentive, combined with Ethereum‚Äôs network effects and ongoing scalability improvements (like Layer 2 solutions), makes it a compelling choice for forward-thinking crypto enterprises. BTC Digital‚Äôs Ambitious Vision: From BTC to ETH Dominance This bold move by BTC Digital involves a complete conversion of its existing Bitcoin holdings into Ethereum. As reported by Stock Titan, the company aims to significantly grow its ETH reserves, targeting tens of millions of dollars by year-end. This substantial financial commitment, backed by $6 million in recent funding, underscores the seriousness and scale of their strategic reorientation. It‚Äôs a clear statement of confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs long-term potential and its central role in the future of decentralized finance. The transition signifies a shift from a capital-intensive mining operation, which often faces volatile energy costs and hardware depreciation, to an asset management and yield-generation model. By holding and deploying significant amounts of ETH, BTC Digital positions itself to participate directly in the network‚Äôs security and economic activity, rather than merely validating transactions through mining rigs. This pivot also implies a more diversified approach to revenue generation, moving beyond block rewards to encompass staking yields, DeFi protocol fees, and potential earnings from RWA initiatives. To better illustrate this profound transformation, consider the following comparison: Aspect Previous Strategy (Bitcoin-centric) New Strategy (Ethereum-driven) Primary Asset Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Core Activity Mining Operations Staking, DeFi, RWA Initiatives Ecosystem Focus Store of Value, Transaction Processing Programmable Money, Smart Contracts, Decentralized Applications Revenue Streams Block Rewards, Transaction Fees (from mining) Staking Yields, DeFi Protocol Fees, RWA Tokenization & Yields Operational Overhead High (energy, hardware, maintenance) Lower (primarily digital asset management) Harnessing Passive Income: The Power of ETH Staking A cornerstone of BTC Digital ‚Äòs new strategy is a deep dive into ETH staking . With Ethereum‚Äôs successful transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), staking has become a crucial mechanism for securing the network while simultaneously offering participants a passive income stream. By staking their substantial ETH holdings, BTC Digital aims to generate consistent yields, thereby diversifying its revenue streams beyond traditional mining operations. Staking involves locking up ETH to support the network‚Äôs operations, including validating transactions and proposing new blocks. In return, stakers receive rewards in ETH. This mechanism not only contributes to the security and decentralization of the Ethereum blockchain but also provides an attractive yield for institutional holders. For BTC Digital, this means: Consistent Yield Generation: Unlike the unpredictable nature of mining rewards, staking offers a more predictable, ongoing return on their ETH holdings. Participation in Network Security: By staking, BTC Digital directly contributes to the robustness and integrity of the Ethereum network, aligning its financial interests with the health of the ecosystem. Capital Efficiency: Staking allows the company to earn revenue on its assets without needing to sell them, preserving their underlying value and potential for appreciation. Flexibility: While direct solo staking requires 32 ETH per validator and technical expertise, options like liquid staking protocols (e.g., Lido, Rocket Pool) or centralized exchange staking services offer more flexibility and liquidity, which BTC Digital could leverage for managing their large ETH reserves. The move into ETH staking signifies a mature approach to crypto asset management, focusing on sustainable, yield-bearing strategies that leverage the fundamental economics of the underlying blockchain. Exploring the Frontier: BTC Digital‚Äôs Foray into DeFi Crypto Beyond staking, BTC Digital is poised to become a significant player in the broader DeFi crypto ecosystem. Decentralized Finance represents a paradigm shift in financial services, offering permissionless access to a wide array of tools from lending and borrowing to decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and yield farming. It‚Äôs an open, transparent, and globally accessible financial system built on blockchain technology, primarily Ethereum. The company‚Äôs focus on DeFi initiatives will likely involve strategically deploying their ETH into various protocols to maximize returns and contribute to the liquidity of the decentralized economy. This could include: Lending and Borrowing Protocols: Providing ETH as collateral to earn interest or borrowing against their assets to maintain liquidity for other operations (e.g., Aave, Compound). Liquidity Provision on DEXs: Supplying ETH and other tokens to decentralized exchanges (e.g., Uniswap, Curve) to earn trading fees, thereby facilitating decentralized trading. Yield Farming: Participating in complex strategies that involve moving assets between different DeFi protocols to maximize returns, often through the accumulation of governance tokens. Engaging with DeFi, however, comes with its own set of risks, including smart contract vulnerabilities, impermanent loss in liquidity pools, and significant market volatility. BTC Digital will need robust risk management frameworks and a deep understanding of the protocols they interact with to navigate this innovative yet complex landscape successfully. Bridging Worlds: Unlocking Value with Real-World Assets (RWA) on Ethereum Perhaps the most forward-looking and potentially transformative aspect of BTC Digital ‚Äòs new direction is its foray into real-world assets (RWA). RWA tokenization involves bringing tangible and intangible assets from the traditional financial world onto the blockchain, transforming them into digital tokens that can be traded, lent, or used as collateral in DeFi protocols. This represents a monumental step in bridging the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). Imagine the possibilities: Tokenized Real Estate: Fractional ownership of properties, making real estate investment more accessible and liquid. Commodities: Digital representations of gold, silver, or agricultural products. Financial Instruments: Tokenized bonds, equities, or even carbon credits, allowing for their seamless integration into blockchain-based financial systems. Intellectual Property: Tokenizing patents, copyrights, or music royalties for new forms of ownership and distribution. By focusing on RWA, BTC Digital is positioning itself at the forefront of a movement that could unlock vast new markets and investment opportunities. This initiative requires navigating complex legal and regulatory frameworks to ensure the enforceability and legitimacy of the tokenized assets. Success in this area could significantly expand the utility and reach of the Ethereum ecosystem, attracting traditional investors and capital into the decentralized space. Challenges and Considerations for This Bold Move While BTC Digital ‚Äòs strategic pivot presents immense opportunities, it also comes with its share of challenges. The crypto market remains highly volatile, and Ethereum, despite its robust ecosystem, is not immune to price fluctuations. A significant downturn in ETH‚Äôs value could impact the company‚Äôs reserves and the profitability of its staking and DeFi activities. Regulatory clarity around DeFi and RWA is still evolving globally. Different jurisdictions have varying stances on digital assets, and new regulations could emerge that impact how companies like BTC Digital operate. Compliance and legal adherence will be critical to their long-term success. Furthermore, engaging with DeFi protocols carries inherent technical risks, such as smart contract bugs, hacks, and flash loan attacks. While the Ethereum network itself is highly secure, individual dApps and protocols can have vulnerabilities. BTC Digital will need to implement stringent security measures and conduct thorough due diligence on any platforms they integrate with. Finally, the execution of such a large-scale strategic shift, including the conversion of tens of millions of dollars from BTC to ETH, requires careful planning and flawless execution to minimize market impact and ensure asset security. Broader Implications for the Crypto Industry BTC Digital ‚Äòs bold Ethereum shift is more than just a company‚Äôs change of heart; it could set a powerful precedent for the broader cryptocurrency industry. This move signals a growing recognition among institutional players of Ethereum‚Äôs unparalleled utility as a platform for innovation, beyond just a digital currency. It validates the increasing importance of programmable blockchains for advanced financial applications and could encourage other Bitcoin-centric companies or traditional financial institutions to explore similar multi-asset or Ethereum-focused strategies. As more capital and talent flow into the Ethereum ecosystem, it reinforces its position as the leading smart contract platform, accelerating the maturation and mainstream adoption of decentralized finance and tokenized real-world assets . This strategic pivot highlights the evolving landscape of digital asset investment, moving beyond simple asset accumulation to active participation in decentralized economies and the creation of new financial paradigms. Conclusion BTC Digital ‚Äòs comprehensive Ethereum shift marks a significant moment in the institutional adoption of blockchain technology. By fully embracing ETH staking , diving into the innovative world of DeFi crypto , and pioneering in real-world assets , the company is not just changing its portfolio; it‚Äôs redefining its very identity and role within the digital economy. This bold move could serve as a blueprint for other crypto-native companies looking to evolve beyond single-asset strategies and tap into the multifaceted potential of programmable blockchains. The journey ahead will undoubtedly have its complexities, but BTC Digital‚Äôs vision positions it as a key player in shaping the future of decentralized finance and beyond.

Prepare for a major one: BSTR Holdings has just completed a monumental merger agreement with Cantor Equity Partners I (CEPO), a move poised to reshape the institutional crypto investment space. This isn‚Äôt just another corporate handshake; it‚Äôs the birth of a formidable new player, set to become one of the largest public holders of Bitcoin globally. What Does the BSTR Merger Mean for the Crypto World? The finalization of the merger agreement between BSTR Holdings and Cantor Equity Partners I (CEPO) marks a pivotal moment for both entities and the broader digital asset ecosystem. This strategic alliance isn‚Äôt merely a corporate restructuring; it‚Äôs a bold declaration of intent from traditional finance to deeply engage with the cryptocurrency market. The newly combined company, set to trade under the ticker ‚ÄúBSTR,‚Äù is designed to leverage the strengths of both parties: BSTR‚Äôs vision for Bitcoin-native financial products and Cantor Equity Partners‚Äô extensive experience in capital markets and institutional reach. For years, the crypto space has yearned for greater institutional adoption. This merger serves as a powerful testament to that growing trend. It signifies that major players in traditional finance are not just observing but actively participating in shaping the future of digital assets. The combined entity aims to bridge the gap between conventional investment vehicles and the innovative potential of Bitcoin, paving the way for more sophisticated financial products and broader market access. How Will BSTR‚Äôs Bitcoin Treasury Impact the Market? One of the most striking aspects of this merger is the immediate establishment of BSTR as a significant holder of Bitcoin. With a formidable 30,021 Bitcoin (BTC) in its treasury, BSTR is poised to become the fourth-largest public Bitcoin treasury globally. This is a staggering amount that places it in an elite league alongside established names like MicroStrategy. But what does this mean for the market? Increased Institutional Demand: A large, publicly traded company holding such a substantial amount of BTC signals strong institutional confidence in Bitcoin as a long-term store of value and a strategic asset. This could encourage other corporations and institutional investors to follow suit, potentially driving further demand. Market Stability: Large, stable holders like BSTR can contribute to market stability by reducing the available supply in circulation, which might lessen volatility compared to speculative trading. Benchmarking: BSTR‚Äôs performance and strategic decisions regarding its Bitcoin treasury will likely be closely watched by analysts and investors, potentially setting new benchmarks for corporate Bitcoin adoption strategies. This substantial Bitcoin treasury is not just a static holding; it forms the very foundation upon which BSTR plans to build its future endeavors, particularly its ambitious plans for crypto investment products. The Strategic Alliance: Why Cantor Equity Partners is a Game Changer The involvement of Cantor Equity Partners I (CEPO) is a critical component of this merger‚Äôs significance. Cantor Fitzgerald, its parent company, is a venerable name in financial services, with a history spanning nearly a century. Their expertise in investment banking, prime brokerage, and capital markets brings a level of legitimacy and operational sophistication that is invaluable for a crypto-focused entity. This alliance offers several key advantages: Credibility and Trust: Cantor‚Äôs established reputation can help instill greater confidence among institutional investors who might still be hesitant about the nascent crypto market. Access to Capital: Their network and experience are crucial for facilitating the massive PIPE financing BSTR is undertaking, ensuring the capital needed for growth and further Bitcoin acquisition. Regulatory Navigation: Traditional finance firms often possess a deeper understanding of complex regulatory landscapes, which is vital for navigating the evolving rules governing digital assets. Product Development Expertise: Cantor‚Äôs experience in developing and distributing a wide range of financial products will be instrumental in BSTR‚Äôs creation of BTC-native capital market offerings. This partnership exemplifies a growing trend where traditional financial giants are not just observing the crypto space but actively integrating it into their core strategies, acknowledging Bitcoin‚Äôs enduring presence and potential. Unlocking Growth: The Power of $1.5 Billion in PIPE Financing Beyond its initial Bitcoin holdings, BSTR‚Äôs strategy includes raising up to $1.5 billion in Private Investment in Public Equity (PIPE) financing. This substantial capital injection is designed to serve two primary purposes, both critical to BSTR‚Äôs long-term vision: Acquiring More BTC: A significant portion of the PIPE financing will be allocated towards acquiring additional Bitcoin. This commitment underscores BSTR‚Äôs belief in Bitcoin as a core asset and its strategy to continually expand its treasury. Such ongoing accumulation could have a sustained positive impact on Bitcoin‚Äôs market dynamics by absorbing supply. Building BTC-Native Capital-Market Products: This is perhaps the most forward-looking aspect of BSTR‚Äôs plan. The financing will fuel the development of innovative financial products built directly on or around Bitcoin. This moves beyond simply holding Bitcoin to actively creating a sophisticated ecosystem for its utilization in capital markets. PIPE financing is a common method for public companies to raise capital quickly from institutional investors. Its scale here demonstrates significant investor confidence in BSTR‚Äôs business model and its potential to become a leader in the institutional crypto space. This financial backing provides BSTR with immense flexibility and firepower to execute its ambitious growth plans. Beyond Holdings: BSTR‚Äôs Vision for Crypto Investment Products The promise of building ‚ÄúBTC-native capital-market products‚Äù is where BSTR truly aims to innovate and distinguish itself. This phrase suggests a move beyond simple spot trading or custodial services, delving into more complex financial instruments that leverage Bitcoin‚Äôs unique properties. While specific products are yet to be detailed, we can speculate on potential offerings that could revolutionize crypto investment: Bitcoin-Backed Lending and Borrowing: Creating platforms where institutions can lend out their BTC for yield or borrow against their holdings, increasing capital efficiency. Structured Products: Developing complex financial instruments that offer tailored risk-reward profiles based on Bitcoin‚Äôs price movements, potentially attracting a wider range of institutional investors. Derivatives and Hedging Tools: Offering sophisticated futures, options, or other derivatives that allow institutions to hedge their Bitcoin exposure or speculate on its price in a regulated environment. Yield-Generating Strategies: Exploring ways to generate returns on Bitcoin holdings beyond simple appreciation, such as through staking (if applicable to future BTC upgrades) or other DeFi-like mechanisms adapted for institutional use. These types of products could significantly deepen the institutional liquidity and sophistication of the Bitcoin market. By creating these tools, BSTR aims to make Bitcoin a more versatile and accessible asset for large-scale investors, moving it further into the mainstream of global finance. The Road Ahead for BSTR The merger of BSTR Holdings and Cantor Equity Partners I is more than just a headline; it‚Äôs a blueprint for the future of institutional crypto investment. With a massive Bitcoin treasury, substantial PIPE financing, and the strategic backing of a traditional finance giant, BSTR is uniquely positioned to become a dominant force. While challenges such as market volatility and evolving regulations persist, the commitment to building BTC-native capital market products signals a long-term vision for integrating Bitcoin into the fabric of global finance. This development is a clear indicator that the lines between traditional finance and the crypto world are blurring rapidly. As BSTR begins trading under its new ticker, the financial world will be watching closely to see how this ambitious venture unfolds and what new opportunities it unlocks for investors and the broader digital asset landscape.

According to Squire, investors selling their XRP holdings today may be prematurely exiting a position with significant future upside, similar to those who sold Apple stock just before its transformation into a global tech giant. Squire‚Äôs remarks come at a time of growing optimism around XRP. The token has recently rebounded strongly, climbing back above the critical $3 resistance level twice in the past week. XRP is also up 49% in the last month, indicating a possible shift in market momentum. While some traders may see this as an opportunity to secure short-term profits, others are advocating for a longer-term investment approach. Historical Context: Apple‚Äôs Growth After the iPhone To support his comparison, Squire refers to Apple‚Äôs performance after its landmark product launch. The iPhone was officially introduced in January 2007, marking a pivotal point for the company. Before this, Apple‚Äôs stock had moved slowly over the years, trading between $0.06 and $1 from 1981 through the late 1990s, and reaching around $3 by 2007. Selling $XRP now is like selling Apple before the iPhone. ‚Äî John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) July 16, 2025 However, in the years following the iPhone‚Äôs debut, Apple‚Äôs stock saw exponential growth. By December 2024, it had reached a peak of $260. At its current value of approximately $210, the stock has appreciated by over 6,800% from its pre-iPhone level of $3. When compared to the 2024 peak, the increase is even more dramatic, amounting to roughly 8,566%. Could XRP Experience a Similar Upsurge? Squire and other XRP supporters suggest the token may now be in a similar position to Apple in the early 2000s. If XRP were to replicate Apple‚Äôs growth pattern from the $3 level, it could hypothetically rise to prices exceeding $200. While such projections are speculative, they reflect the high expectations held by a significant portion of the community. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Several developments are fueling this sentiment. These include growing speculation around the approval of multiple spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs), as well as discussions about XRP‚Äôs potential role in national digital asset strategies. Some analysts have also suggested that companies may adopt XRP as a treasury reserve, akin to how certain firms have adopted Bitcoin. Adding to the bullish narrative, the resolution of Ripple‚Äôs legal battle with the SEC has eliminated a major source of uncertainty. With regulatory clarity improving and utility-focused adoption on the rise, proponents believe XRP‚Äôs long-term value proposition is becoming more compelling. Although critics caution against overly optimistic forecasts, especially regarding extreme price targets, the overall shift in market tone suggests that many are now reassessing the long-term potential of XRP.

A recent report from K33 sheds crucial light on these shifting dynamics, revealing a significant surge in Bitcoin treasuries held by public companies and a remarkable expansion in the overall stablecoin supply . This isn‚Äôt just a fleeting trend; it signals a profound evolution in how institutions and individuals perceive and utilize digital assets. Why Are Corporate Bitcoin Treasuries Exploding? According to the K33 report, public companies made a colossal move in H1 2025, adding nearly 245,000 BTC to their balance sheets. This isn‚Äôt merely an increase in volume; the number of firms embracing Bitcoin as a treasury asset nearly doubled, soaring from 70 to 134 across 27 countries. The United States, predictably, leads this charge, demonstrating a growing conviction among corporate giants in the long-term value proposition of the world‚Äôs leading cryptocurrency. But why are companies making such a bold shift? Several factors are at play: Inflation Hedge: In an era of persistent inflationary concerns, Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a digital gold, offering a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies. Balance Sheet Diversification: Forward-thinking companies are looking beyond traditional assets to diversify their treasury holdings, recognizing Bitcoin‚Äôs uncorrelated nature to conventional markets. Institutional Adoption: As more large institutions, payment processors, and investment funds embrace Bitcoin, the perceived risk decreases, making it more palatable for corporate treasuries. Future-Proofing: Holding Bitcoin can be seen as a strategic move to align with the future of finance, positioning companies at the forefront of digital innovation. This surge in Bitcoin treasuries underscores a maturing market where institutional confidence is not just a buzzword, but a tangible reality shaping corporate financial strategies globally. The Stablecoin Supply Surge: A Pillar of Crypto Stability? While Bitcoin‚Äôs institutional embrace captures headlines, the quiet but relentless growth of the stablecoin supply is equally significant. The K33 report highlights an impressive $38 billion increase in stablecoin supply during H1 2025. These digital assets, pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, play a pivotal role in the broader crypto ecosystem. Stablecoins serve multiple critical functions: Trading Pairs: They are the primary trading pairs for most cryptocurrencies, facilitating seamless and efficient transactions across exchanges without the need to convert back to fiat. Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Stablecoins are the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, enabling lending, borrowing, and yield farming activities with reduced volatility risk. Remittances and Payments: Their stability and speed make them attractive for cross-border payments and remittances, offering a cheaper and faster alternative to traditional banking rails. Safe Haven: During periods of market volatility, traders often convert their volatile crypto assets into stablecoins, using them as a temporary safe haven. The consistent expansion of the stablecoin supply signals robust activity within the crypto economy, reflecting increased liquidity and utility across various applications. It suggests a growing comfort level with digital dollars as a medium of exchange and value storage. Altcoin Performance: A Clear Sign of Crypto Market Dominance In stark contrast to the bullish narratives surrounding Bitcoin and stablecoins, the K33 report reveals a challenging period for most altcoins. Out of the top 50 alternative cryptocurrencies, a mere nine managed to post gains in H1 2025. This divergence paints a clear picture of the prevailing crypto market dominance by Bitcoin and the increasing preference for stable, liquid assets. This performance disparity highlights a ‚Äòflight to quality‚Äô phenomenon. When market sentiment becomes cautious, or when major catalysts like institutional adoption are in play, capital tends to consolidate into Bitcoin, perceived as the most secure and established digital asset. Many altcoins, often lacking the same level of liquidity, institutional backing, or proven use cases, struggle to attract investment in such an environment. For investors, this trend underscores the importance of understanding market cycles and the varying risk profiles within the crypto space. While altcoins can offer explosive growth potential, they also carry significantly higher risk, especially when Bitcoin asserts its dominance. What Lies Ahead? The H2 Bitcoin Outlook Despite the mixed performance across the board, the K33 report offers an optimistic perspective on the Bitcoin outlook for the second half of 2025. Historically, H2 has often proven stronger for Bitcoin, and several potential catalysts could fuel further growth: Spot ETF Approvals: Continued progress and potential approvals of new Bitcoin spot ETFs in various jurisdictions could unlock massive institutional capital, providing a fresh wave of demand. Regulatory Clarity: As governments worldwide work towards establishing clearer regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies, this increased certainty can attract more traditional investors and corporations. Post-Halving Dynamics: While the halving occurred in 2024, its full impact on supply shock and price discovery often plays out in the subsequent year, influencing the H2 Bitcoin outlook . Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic shifts, interest rate policies, and geopolitical events can continue to drive demand for decentralized, scarce assets like Bitcoin. The report suggests that the groundwork laid in H1 2025, particularly with the surge in Bitcoin treasuries , sets a strong foundation for what could be a compelling second half of the year for the flagship cryptocurrency. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Evolving Crypto Landscape The K33 report provides valuable insights for anyone involved in the crypto market. Here are some actionable takeaways: Focus on Fundamentals: The institutional adoption of Bitcoin and the utility of stablecoins highlight the importance of fundamental strength and real-world use cases. Diversify Wisely: While Bitcoin and stablecoins dominate, a diversified portfolio can still include carefully selected altcoins with strong technology and active communities, but with a clear understanding of their higher risk profile. Stay Informed on Regulation: Regulatory developments will continue to be a major market driver. Keeping abreast of these changes is crucial for anticipating market shifts. Consider Long-Term Holdings: The increasing corporate adoption of Bitcoin suggests a long-term bullish sentiment that individual investors might consider mirroring for a portion of their portfolio. Conclusion: A Maturing Market Led by Bitcoin and Stability The first half of 2025 has unequivocally demonstrated Bitcoin‚Äôs strengthening position as a legitimate treasury asset for public companies and the indispensable role of stablecoins in facilitating the broader crypto economy. While altcoin performance lagged, this period has solidified Bitcoin‚Äôs crypto market dominance , hinting at a more mature and discerning market. With a promising H2 Bitcoin outlook driven by potential ETF approvals and regulatory clarity, the stage is set for continued evolution and potential growth in the digital asset space. The trends of H1 2025 serve as a powerful reminder of where institutional and individual capital is flowing, shaping the future of finance one digital asset at a time.

Uniswap Eyes $9.20 & Aptos Finds Support,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-expands-rapidly-with-major-sports-team-partnerships-uniswap-eyes-9-20-aptos-finds-support/,"Recent activity across the crypto market is drawing attention as Uniswap (UNI) and Aptos (APT) hold steady amid buyer interest. Uniswap (UNI) price prediction indicates a potential upward push, with the $9.20 mark now in focus after the coin maintained strong support near $8.00. At the same time, Aptos (APT) price today is stabilizing above the $5.00 mark, setting $4.96 as a reliable support zone following active trading sessions. Meanwhile, BlockDAG (BDAG) is heading in a direction that goes beyond chart movements. By forming high-profile partnerships with sports teams like the Seattle Seawolves and Orcas, the project is embedding itself in everyday use cases. This step aims to take blockchain technology into real-world spaces, especially among North American fans, by integrating on-chain ticketing, digital rewards, and NFT functionalities. With more than $341 million already raised and over 24 billion coins sold, BlockDAG is being talked about as one of the best cryptos to buy. Coins in batch 29 are now offered at $0.0016 until August 11, showing how their visibility and real-world use are fueling demand. Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction Focuses on $9.20 Breakout Uniswap (UNI) continues to build momentum following recent upward movement. Market watchers expect the Uniswap (UNI) price prediction to approach the $10 mark, assuming the bullish pressure holds. Current data reflects firm support just above $8.00, while analysts are watching $9.20 closely as a near-term resistance. Previous trading action showed UNI moving from around $7.00 to just above $9.00 before facing a minor pullback. These moves, paired with patterns of higher highs and higher lows on the hourly chart, suggest ongoing buyer interest. Uniswap (UNI) price prediction also factors in a rise in futures open interest, indicating that more traders are willing to bet on future price moves. Still, if prices begin to dip while open interest remains elevated, the market could face forced liquidations. As such, watching these levels closely could provide insight into whether UNI continues this upward trend or faces a stall. Aptos (APT) Price Today Steadies Above Key $4.96 Level Aptos (APT) price today recorded a 4.5% rise over the last 24 hours, buoyed by a volume spike that peaked around 01:00 UTC with trades reaching 1.64 million units, about 29% above the norm. During that hour, prices climbed quickly from $4.97 to $5.06, helping set $4.96 as a new foundation. The coin‚Äôs bullish behavior continued with a surge to a peak of $5.20 by early morning hours. At the time of analysis, Aptos (APT) was hovering near $5.13, reflecting a 3.2% increase and aligning with the broader crypto market‚Äôs 3.6% uptrend. Buyers appear to have held ground near the $5.09 mark, and activity in the $4.91 to $5.20 range showed around 6% volatility, an indicator of a relatively stable short-term structure. BlockDAG Drives Adoption Through Major Sports Team Partnerships BlockDAG has rolled out partnerships with the Seattle Seawolves from Major League Rugby and the Orcas cricket team, aiming to deliver blockchain features in areas where fans can directly benefit. These deals plan to introduce tools like NFT collectibles, digital ticketing, and fan rewards on-chain, bridging blockchain with real-world fan engagement. Unlike general sponsorships, this approach offers fans perks that can be used in practice, helping grow awareness and interaction. With North America being a key market, BlockDAG intends to move beyond just technical hype by demonstrating how blockchain can become part of everyday experiences. These developments are also growing the project‚Äôs active user base and boosting its network utility, potentially improving system robustness and engagement. The presale has already raised over $341 million, with more than 24 billion BDAG coins sold across 29 batches. Early buyers have already seen 2,660% growth in their funds since batch 1. Currently, the price for batch 29 coins is fixed at $0.0016, available until August 11 as part of the GLOBAL LAUNCH release campaign. Since the official launch price is set at $0.05, this limited-time entry point hints at a potential ROI of up to 3,025%. For those evaluating the best crypto to buy , BlockDAG‚Äôs clear focus on real adoption and expanding use cases sets it apart. Final Call! While Uniswap (UNI) price prediction remains on track for a possible climb toward $9.20, backed by $8.00 support and active futures positioning, Aptos (APT) price today maintains a strong base above $5.00, with $4.96 firmly holding as a foundation amid high-volume trades. But beyond these price shifts, BlockDAG brings a different approach by locking in real-world relevance through its sports partnerships. Features like ticketing and rewards backed by blockchain offer more than speculative value. With $341 million raised and BDAG coins priced at $0.0016 until August 11, BlockDAG is proving its plan with measurable progress.

Then you‚Äôll want to pay attention to the latest significant move by Numerai, the innovative AI-driven hedge fund. Numerai NMR has just announced a major initiative: a $1 million token buy-back from the public market. This isn‚Äôt just a simple transaction; it‚Äôs a strategic maneuver that speaks volumes about the project‚Äôs confidence and its future trajectory within the dynamic crypto space. What Exactly is the Numerai NMR Token Buy-Back and Why Does it Matter? At its core, a token buy-back is when a company or project repurchases its own tokens from the open market. In this instance, Numerai is committing to buy back $1 million worth of its native NMR token . This action has several potential implications for the token‚Äôs value and the ecosystem at large. Think of it like a traditional stock buyback, but in the decentralized world. Why would Numerai initiate an NMR token buy-back? The reasons behind such a move are often multi-faceted and strategic. Here are some key benefits and motivations: Reducing Circulating Supply: By removing tokens from circulation, the total supply decreases. If demand remains constant or increases, this scarcity can lead to an increase in the token‚Äôs price per unit. Signaling Confidence: A buy-back is a strong signal from the project‚Äôs leadership that they believe their token is undervalued. It demonstrates a commitment to the token‚Äôs long-term value and the health of the ecosystem. This can instill greater trust among existing holders and attract new investors. Returning Value to Holders: While not a direct dividend, a buy-back effectively returns value to token holders by potentially increasing the price of their existing holdings. Supporting Liquidity: In some cases, buy-backs can be used to manage liquidity on exchanges, ensuring a healthy trading environment for the token. Ecosystem Health: For a platform like Numerai, which relies on its token for staking and incentives, a stronger token value can lead to greater participation and a more robust network. The $1 million NMR token buy-back is a substantial amount, especially in the context of Numerai‚Äôs current market capitalization, indicating a significant commitment from the fund. Numerai: The Pioneer AI Hedge Fund Changing the Game To truly appreciate the significance of this buy-back, it‚Äôs essential to understand what Numerai is and how it operates. Numerai isn‚Äôt your typical crypto project; it‚Äôs an American AI hedge fund that uniquely blends data science, artificial intelligence, and cryptocurrency. Its core innovation lies in crowdsourcing financial predictions. How does Numerai work? Numerai provides encrypted financial data to a global community of data scientists. These scientists then build machine learning models to predict stock market movements. Crucially, they stake NMR tokens on the accuracy of their predictions. If their models are correct, they earn more NMR; if they‚Äôre wrong, their staked NMR is burned. This mechanism, known as ‚Äòstaking and burning,‚Äô aligns incentives and ensures that only the best models contribute to the hedge fund‚Äôs strategy. Data Anonymity: Data is encrypted, ensuring privacy and preventing data scientists from seeing the underlying assets, which helps prevent insider trading. Collective Intelligence: The fund aggregates predictions from thousands of models, creating a ‚Äòmeta-model‚Äô that is more robust and accurate than any single model. NMR as the Core: The NMR token is integral to this system, serving as the collateral for staking, the reward for accurate predictions, and the penalty for incorrect ones. It powers the entire decentralized data science competition. This innovative approach positions Numerai at the forefront of financial technology, demonstrating a practical, real-world application of blockchain and AI beyond speculative trading. The buy-back reinforces their belief in the value proposition of their unique AI hedge fund model. How This Crypto Buyback Signals Broader Confidence in the Market While the NMR token buy-back directly benefits Numerai and its token holders, its implications extend beyond the project itself. It serves as a positive signal for the broader cryptocurrency market news landscape, especially concerning institutional participation and the maturation of the crypto space. What does it mean for the wider crypto market? Institutional Validation: When an established entity like an AI-driven hedge fund actively invests in its own token through a buy-back, it lends credibility to the underlying asset class. It suggests that even sophisticated financial players see long-term value in digital assets. Precedent for Other Projects: A successful and well-communicated buy-back by Numerai could inspire other legitimate projects to consider similar strategies, particularly those with strong fundamentals and clear utility for their tokens. This could lead to a healthier market overall. Shifting Narrative: Actions like these help shift the narrative around cryptocurrencies from purely speculative ventures to assets with intrinsic value and strategic financial backing. It highlights the utility and economic models underpinning certain tokens. Market Sentiment Boost: In a market often driven by sentiment, news of a significant crypto buyback from a reputable project can foster a more positive outlook, potentially attracting new capital and reducing volatility. This move by Numerai contributes to the ongoing institutionalization of the crypto market, showcasing how traditional financial strategies are being adapted and applied within the digital asset ecosystem. Navigating the Crypto Buyback Landscape: What‚Äôs Next for NMR Holders? For current and prospective Numerai NMR holders, this buy-back announcement presents a moment for reflection and strategic consideration. While buy-backs are generally positive, it‚Äôs important to understand the potential future implications. Actionable Insights for Investors: Monitor Execution: Keep an eye on how the buy-back is executed. Is it a one-time event, or will it be phased? Transparency in the process is key. Long-Term Vision: Consider Numerai‚Äôs long-term roadmap. Does the buy-back align with continued development, user growth, and expansion of their data science competitions? Market Dynamics: While a buy-back can provide upward pressure, the overall cryptocurrency market news and broader economic conditions will still influence NMR‚Äôs price action. Diversification and risk management remain crucial. Community Engagement: Stay informed through Numerai‚Äôs official channels and community discussions to understand ongoing sentiment and future plans. This crypto buyback could be a significant catalyst for NMR, potentially leading to increased investor interest and a stronger foundation for the token‚Äôs value. It underscores Numerai‚Äôs commitment to its community and its unique position in the convergence of AI and finance. A Bold Step Towards a Smarter Future Numerai‚Äôs announcement of a $1 million NMR token buy-back is more than just a financial transaction; it‚Äôs a powerful statement. It signals profound confidence from an innovative AI hedge fund in its own token and its unique decentralized data science model. This strategic move aims to enhance token value, reward its community, and reinforce Numerai‚Äôs position as a leader in the evolving digital asset landscape. As the cryptocurrency market news continues to unfold, actions like these highlight the growing maturity and strategic depth within the space, offering a compelling glimpse into the future of finance where AI and blockchain converge to create unprecedented opportunities.

Binance, the world‚Äôs leading blockchain ecosystem, has just announced a significant expansion of support for Caldera (ERA) , a move set to revolutionize how users interact with this promising digital asset. This isn‚Äôt just another listing; it‚Äôs a comprehensive integration across multiple core services, designed to empower users with more flexibility and opportunities than ever before. What Does This Binance ERA Expansion Mean for You? Binance‚Äôs commitment to enhancing user experience and broadening its asset offerings continues with this strategic integration of Caldera (ERA). Starting July 17 at 15:30 UTC, ERA will be accessible through several key Binance products, making it easier for both new and experienced users to engage with the token. This expansion signifies increased liquidity, visibility, and utility for Caldera, potentially paving the way for wider adoption. Let‚Äôs break down the exciting new avenues for ERA: Binance Simple Earn: ERA Flexible Products Buy Crypto: Direct purchase options for ERA Convert: Seamless ERA swaps Margin: Opportunities for leveraged trading Futures: Advanced trading strategies for ERA Unlock Passive Income with Binance Earn for Caldera Crypto One of the most anticipated additions is the availability of ERA Flexible Products on Binance Simple Earn. For those looking to grow their holdings passively, this is a game-changer. Binance Simple Earn allows users to deposit their cryptocurrencies and earn interest over time. Flexible Products mean you can subscribe and redeem your ERA holdings at any time, offering unparalleled liquidity while still generating rewards. Imagine earning a steady yield on your Caldera Crypto without locking it up for extended periods. This feature is perfect for long-term holders who want their assets to work for them. How to Get Started with ERA Flexible Products: Log in to your Binance account. Navigate to the ‚ÄòEarn‚Äô section. Search for ‚ÄòERA‚Äô under Simple Earn Flexible Products. Subscribe your desired amount of ERA and start earning interest. Seamless Access: Buying and Converting Your Caldera Crypto Binance is making it incredibly simple to acquire Caldera (ERA). With its inclusion in the ‚ÄòBuy Crypto‚Äô section, users will soon be able to purchase ERA directly using various fiat currencies or other cryptocurrencies, depending on regional availability. This lowers the barrier to entry for newcomers and simplifies the process for existing users looking to expand their ERA portfolio. Furthermore, the ‚ÄòConvert‚Äô feature will allow for instant, low-fee swaps between ERA and other supported cryptocurrencies. This means you can quickly and efficiently convert your existing crypto assets into ERA or vice versa, taking advantage of market movements without the complexities of traditional trading interfaces. Embrace Advanced Strategies with Crypto Futures and Margin Trading For the more seasoned traders, the inclusion of ERA in Binance‚Äôs Margin and Futures offerings opens up a world of advanced trading strategies. Margin trading allows users to borrow funds to amplify their trading positions, potentially leading to higher returns (though also higher risks). It‚Äôs a tool for those confident in their market analysis and risk management. The introduction of Crypto Futures for ERA is particularly significant. Futures contracts allow traders to speculate on the future price of ERA without actually owning the underlying asset. This enables both long (betting on price increase) and short (betting on price decrease) positions, providing powerful tools for hedging portfolios or profiting from market volatility. This strategic expansion into derivatives markets signals strong confidence in Caldera‚Äôs potential and caters to a broader spectrum of trading styles. Key Considerations for Margin and Futures Trading: Leverage: Magnifies both gains and losses. Risk Management: Essential to prevent significant losses. Market Volatility: Be prepared for rapid price swings. Education: Understand the mechanisms before engaging. The Broader Impact: A Strategic Digital Asset Expansion This comprehensive integration by Binance is more than just adding a new token; it‚Äôs a strategic Digital Asset Expansion that benefits the entire Caldera ecosystem. Increased accessibility through Binance‚Äôs massive user base can lead to enhanced liquidity, reduced price volatility, and greater overall market awareness for ERA. For Binance users, it means a wider array of choices for earning, trading, and managing their digital assets, all within the trusted and secure environment of the world‚Äôs largest exchange. The move underscores Binance‚Äôs continuous efforts to diversify its offerings and respond to the growing demand for various digital assets. By providing multiple avenues for interaction with ERA, Binance is not only supporting the Caldera project but also empowering its users with more tools to navigate the dynamic crypto landscape. Concluding Thoughts: What‚Äôs Next for Caldera and Binance Users? Binance‚Äôs expanded support for Caldera (ERA) is a clear indicator of the platform‚Äôs dedication to providing a robust and versatile crypto experience. Whether you‚Äôre interested in earning passive income, making quick conversions, or engaging in advanced trading strategies, the new ERA offerings cater to a wide range of needs. This momentous integration solidifies Caldera‚Äôs position within the broader crypto market and provides Binance users with exciting new opportunities to diversify and grow their digital portfolios.

Speaking at a press briefing on Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Canada ‚Äúa pretty difficult partner‚Äù in ongoing negotiations. Leavitt said the trade team remained engaged in conversations with Canada, but described the northern neighbor as difficult to deal with . Her remarks include new tariffs on Canadian goods set to take effect in just over a month. Canada and the US have had one of the most reliable trade relationships for decades, but recent events indicate this could change. According to the US Trade Representative, bilateral trade between the two countries amounted to over $762 billion last year. Canada sends more than 75% of its exports to the United States. And the Trump administration is indicating that the relationship will be tested. Trump hits Canada with new tariffs Earlier this month, President Donald Trump announced a 35% tariff on their northern neighbors, which surprised business leaders and government officials on both sides of the border. The new tariff is part of a sweep of a broader trade policy that has seen the Trump administration slap new levies on dozens of countries. Trump has already levied a 30% tariff on goods from Mexico and from all 27 of the European Union countries earlier this month. They follow a 50% tariff slapped on Brazilian copper products and penalties on more than 20 other countries. White House officials say the tariffs are essential to safeguard US workers and industries from what they describe as unfair trade practices. Leavitt added that the tariffs aimed to put American jobs and companies first, emphasizing that the administration was not afraid to take a stand defending its position. Trump has begun notifying key trading partners, including Canada, of impending tariff hikes set to take effect on August 1. Canada is among roughly two dozen countries, including the European Union, Japan, and South Korea, that have received formal letters outlining the new tariff rates they will face. Europe looks for talks as Canada stands ground Canada may fight against the Trump administration‚Äôs trade calculus, but others seek compromise. Leavitt praised the European Union for its willingness to find common ground, saying the bloc was actively looking at reducing both tariff and non-tariff barriers‚Äîmeasures that, she noted, the US had long argued were harmful to American workers and companies. Ursula von der Leyen , the president of the European Commission, has so far managed to refrain from immediate retaliation. She has yet to announce any countermeasures, a step many view as an indication of a willingness to negotiate. Canada, however, has taken a less ambiguous position. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has not commented publicly on Leavitt‚Äôs remarks so far, but trade officials in Ottawa have described the new US tariffs as ‚Äúunjustified‚Äù and ‚Äúeconomically damaging‚Äù. Leavitt said the US position was clear, stating that all the letters sent to other countries represented the deals on offer. She added that if other nations wanted legitimate conversations on anything further, the administration and the president‚Äôs trade team were ready‚Äîbut emphasized that the US was not backing down. The trade relationship between the United States and Canada is at a turning point. With an August 1 deadline quickly approaching, companies on both sides are bracing for what could be a seismic shift. The new tariffs will likely impact auto parts, agricultural products, lumber, and aluminum. Economists say that trade disruptions could cause consumer prices to rise, job losses, and slower growth, particularly in border areas where supply chains are highly integrated. Analysts from both countries noted that the US and Canada have very closely connected economies, warning that a trade war could cause real harm, especially when inflation and global instability are already putting pressure on markets.

(Update ‚Äì On Wednesday, the GOP-led US House navigated crucial procedural checkpoints for crypto reform, just a day after President Donald Trump stepped in to keep the effort alive‚Äîclearing the path for America‚Äôs inaugural federal digital-asset statute. Those approvals came on the heels of more than nine hours of behind‚Äëclosed‚Äëdoors negotiations, as party leaders courted skeptics uneasy about the bill‚Äôs design.) US President Donald Trump said he expects these bills to land on his desk after Senate votes. Representative Andy Harris noted that the House Freedom Caucus plans to meet soon to add CBDC language into the CLARITY draft. Large parts of the market are watching closely.

48442347,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=179255,1752798634,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/48442347.jpeg,Smarter Web Company‚Äôs Ambitious ¬£15M Share Placing Ignites Growth Potential,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/smarter-web-company-placing/,"BitcoinWorld Smarter Web Company‚Äôs Ambitious ¬£15M Share Placing Ignites Growth Potential In a significant move poised to reshape its future, The Smarter Web Company (SWC), a prominent UK-based web development firm, has announced an ambitious accelerated bookbuild to raise a minimum of ¬£15 million. This strategic capital injection is set to propel the company into its next phase of expansion, signaling robust confidence from institutional investors in the burgeoning digital landscape. For anyone tracking the pulse of tech innovation and strategic financing, this development offers a compelling case study. Understanding the Strategic Share Placing UK Initiative What exactly does it mean for a company like SWC to launch a ¬£15 million share placing, and why is this method chosen? A share placing, particularly an accelerated bookbuild, is a rapid process designed to raise capital by issuing new shares directly to a select group of investors, typically large institutional entities. Unlike a public offering, this method allows companies to secure significant funds quickly and efficiently, often at a discount to the prevailing market price. Speed and Efficiency: Accelerated bookbuilds bypass lengthy regulatory processes associated with public offerings. Targeted Investors: Shares are placed with a pre-identified pool of institutional investors, ensuring a high probability of success. Capital for Growth: The funds raised are typically earmarked for strategic initiatives such as expansion, product development, or acquisitions. For The Smarter Web Company, this ¬£15 million represents a powerful vote of confidence from the financial markets, highlighting their strong position within the competitive Share Placing UK market and the broader digital economy. Decoding the Accelerated Bookbuild : A Closer Look The announcement, initially made on X (formerly Twitter), specified that new ordinary shares would be priced at ¬£2.95 each. This pricing, along with the involvement of Tennyson Securities and Peterhouse Capital Limited, sheds light on the mechanics of this high-stakes financial maneuver. What is an Accelerated Bookbuild? An accelerated bookbuild involves investment banks (in this case, Tennyson Securities and Peterhouse Capital Limited) acting as bookrunners. They quickly gauge demand from institutional investors for a block of shares, often over a period of 24-48 hours. This swift process minimizes market risk and allows the company to capitalize on favorable market conditions. Key Players in the Transaction: Entity Role Significance The Smarter Web Company (SWC) Issuer Seeking capital for growth and expansion. Tennyson Securities Joint Bookrunner Facilitates the placing by identifying and securing institutional investors. Peterhouse Capital Limited Joint Bookrunner Collaborates in managing the bookbuild process and investor outreach. Institutional Investors Subscribers Provide the capital in exchange for new ordinary shares. The ¬£2.95 per share price indicates a specific valuation point that has been agreed upon, reflecting the company‚Äôs current market standing and future potential as perceived by sophisticated investors participating in this Accelerated Bookbuild . The Promise of Web Development Investment : Why SWC is Attractive The decision by institutional investors to commit significant capital to The Smarter Web Company underscores the robust opportunities present within the Web Development Investment sector. In an increasingly digitized world, the demand for sophisticated, user-centric web solutions continues to soar. Why is Web Development a Hot Investment Area? Digital Transformation: Businesses across all sectors are investing heavily in online presence and digital services. E-commerce Boom: The continuous growth of online retail necessitates robust and scalable web platforms. Emerging Technologies: Integration of AI, blockchain, and IoT into web applications creates new avenues for innovation. Global Reach: Web development services can cater to a global client base, offering significant scalability. SWC‚Äôs ability to attract ¬£15 million suggests a strong track record and a compelling vision for future growth, positioning it as a leader in the UK‚Äôs dynamic web development scene. This capital infusion will likely be channeled into expanding their service offerings, enhancing technological capabilities, and potentially acquiring complementary businesses, further solidifying their market position and making them a prime target for future Web Development Investment . The Role of Institutional Investors : Fueling Growth The fact that this share placing is directed towards Institutional Investors is crucial. These are not individual retail investors but large organizations such as pension funds, mutual funds, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds. Their involvement brings not only capital but also a stamp of credibility and long-term strategic alignment. What Do Institutional Investors Look For? Strong Management Team: Confidence in leadership to execute growth strategies. Clear Growth Strategy: A well-defined plan for how the capital will be used to generate returns. Market Opportunity: A large and growing market for the company‚Äôs products or services. Financial Performance: A history of solid financial results or strong projections. Governance and Transparency: Adherence to high standards of corporate governance.

If you‚Äôve been active on the Ethereum network lately, you‚Äôve likely noticed a significant spike in what‚Äôs known as Ethereum gas fees . This surge wasn‚Äôt just a random fluctuation; it was directly tied to a major event that sent ripples through the crypto market : the highly anticipated ERA airdrop. What Just Happened to Ethereum Gas Fees? The digital air was thick with anticipation as the ERA airdrop began opening its claims. For many in the crypto community, airdrops are exciting opportunities to receive free tokens, but they often come with a hidden cost: network congestion. Pseudonymous analyst @ai_9684xtpa took to X (formerly Twitter) to report the immediate aftermath. As claims for the ERA airdrop commenced, Ethereum gas fees skyrocketed to an astonishing 36.7 Gwei. To put that into perspective, this isn‚Äôt just a minor bump; it represents a significant increase in the cost of executing transactions on the blockchain. The report further highlighted the sheer volume of activity, with a staggering 30.73 ETH, equivalent to approximately $105,000, burned in just one hour. This rapid burn rate is a clear indicator of intense network demand and the direct consequence of a sudden influx of users rushing to claim their airdropped tokens. Understanding Gas: Why Do We Pay for It on the Ethereum Network? Before diving deeper into the ERA airdrop‚Äôs impact, let‚Äôs quickly demystify gas fees. Think of gas as the fuel for the Ethereum network . Every operation on Ethereum, from sending tokens to interacting with a decentralized application (dApp) or claiming an airdrop, requires computational effort. This effort isn‚Äôt free; it consumes ‚Äògas‚Äô. What is Gas? It‚Äôs a unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations on the Ethereum blockchain. Why Do We Pay? Gas fees compensate miners (or validators, post-Merge) for securing the network and processing transactions. It also acts as a spam prevention mechanism, deterring malicious actors from overloading the network with trivial transactions. How is it Measured? Gas is typically measured in Gwei (Gigawei), which is a small denomination of Ether (1 Gwei = 0.000000001 ETH). How is the Fee Calculated? Your total transaction fee is determined by multiplying the ‚Äògas limit‚Äô (the maximum amount of gas you‚Äôre willing to spend) by the ‚Äògas price‚Äô (how much Gwei you‚Äôre willing to pay per unit of gas). With EIP-1559, this includes a ‚Äòbase fee‚Äô (burned) and a ‚Äòpriority fee‚Äô (paid to validators). When demand for network space is high, like during a popular airdrop, users bid higher gas prices to ensure their transactions are processed quickly, leading to an overall increase in Ethereum gas fees . The ERA Airdrop Phenomenon: A Catalyst for High Gas Fees Airdrops are a common marketing strategy in the crypto space, designed to distribute new tokens to a wide audience, often to incentivize adoption or reward early supporters. The ERA airdrop , in particular, generated significant buzz, leading to a massive rush of users attempting to claim their tokens simultaneously. This created a bottleneck on the Ethereum network , akin to a digital traffic jam. When thousands of users try to execute transactions at the same time, the demand for block space skyrockets. This intense competition drives up the gas price, as users are willing to pay more to have their transactions included in the next block. The result? Sky-high transaction costs for everyone, not just those claiming the airdrop. What is the Impact of High Gas Fees on the Crypto Market? The ripple effects of high gas fees extend far beyond just individual transaction costs. They have a profound impact on the broader crypto market and its participants: Deterring Small Transactions: For users wanting to move small amounts of ETH or interact with low-value dApps, high gas fees can make these activities economically unfeasible. A $5 transaction costing $20 in gas is simply not practical. Impacting DeFi and NFTs: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols and Non-Fungible Token (NFT) marketplaces, which heavily rely on the Ethereum network, become less accessible and more expensive to use. This can stifle innovation and adoption in these sectors. Driving Users to Layer 2s and Alternative Blockchains: Faced with exorbitant fees, users and developers are increasingly migrating to Layer 2 scaling solutions (like Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync) or entirely different blockchains (like Solana, Avalanche, Polygon) that offer lower transaction costs. While this can be seen as a challenge for Ethereum‚Äôs dominance, it also highlights the network‚Äôs need for scalability. Centralization Concerns: If only those with deep pockets can afford to transact, it raises concerns about the decentralization ethos of the blockchain, potentially limiting participation to a select few. Navigating High Transaction Costs: Actionable Insights for Users So, what can you do when high gas fees strike? While you can‚Äôt control the market, you can adopt strategies to mitigate the impact of rising transaction costs : Monitor Gas Prices: Websites like Etherscan Gas Tracker or GasNow provide real-time updates on current gas prices. Timing your transactions during off-peak hours (e.g., late night UTC, weekends) can significantly reduce costs. Utilize Layer 2 Solutions: For many applications, especially DeFi and NFTs, using Layer 2 scaling solutions built on top of Ethereum can offer dramatically lower fees and faster transaction times. Familiarize yourself with bridges to move assets to these networks. Batch Transactions: If you have multiple transactions to make, consider if they can be combined or batched. Some wallets and protocols offer features to do this, saving on individual gas fees. Adjust Gas Limits (Carefully): While not recommended for beginners, advanced users can sometimes set custom gas limits. However, setting it too low can result in a failed transaction, costing you the gas fee anyway. Consider Alternatives for Small Transactions: For very small transfers or interactions, explore if an alternative blockchain or a centralized exchange might be a more cost-effective option, depending on your needs. The Future of the Ethereum Network and Gas Fees The challenges posed by high gas fees are not new to the Ethereum network . Developers have been actively working on long-term solutions to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs . The implementation of EIP-1559 (which introduced the base fee and burning mechanism) was a significant step, aiming to make gas fees more predictable. However, the ultimate solution lies in Ethereum‚Äôs ongoing roadmap towards greater scalability. The Merge and Beyond: While The Merge transitioned Ethereum to Proof-of-Stake, it primarily focused on energy efficiency and security. The next major phase, often referred to as ‚ÄòThe Surge‚Äô (with Sharding), aims to drastically increase transaction throughput. Rollups (Layer 2s): These technologies are already playing a crucial role, bundling many transactions off-chain into a single transaction on the mainnet, significantly reducing gas usage. They are seen as Ethereum‚Äôs primary scaling solution in the short to medium term. Proto-Danksharding and Danksharding: Future upgrades like these will further enhance the capacity for rollups by providing more data space on the mainnet, making Layer 2 transactions even cheaper. While events like the ERA airdrop highlight the current limitations, they also underscore the urgent need for these scalability solutions to be fully implemented, ensuring Ethereum remains the leading smart contract platform for the global crypto market . A Glimpse into Ethereum‚Äôs Dynamic Landscape The recent surge in Ethereum gas fees , triggered by the ERA airdrop , serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic and sometimes volatile nature of the crypto market . It underscores the fundamental economic principles of supply and demand at play on the Ethereum network . While high gas fees can be frustrating for users, they also highlight the immense demand for Ethereum‚Äôs decentralized infrastructure. As the network continues its journey towards greater scalability and efficiency, events like these provide valuable lessons and reinforce the importance of ongoing development and user adaptation. Staying informed and adopting smart strategies will be key to navigating the exciting, yet challenging, world of decentralized finance.

On Thursday, Powell formally responded to a letter from Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), who accused Powell of wasteful spending and mismanagement of the project. Vought had issued Powell a deadline of seven days to answer a series of questions about the renovation, which had exceeded its original budget. The letter was highly unusual and personal, underscoring increasing tensions between the Federal Reserve and allies of President Donald J. Trump. But instead of piling on in kind, Powell‚Äôs response was measured. He also pointed Vought to a new section of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs website, which offers an expanded description of the project, its budgets, schedules, and design choices. ‚ÄúThe Board believes it is of the utmost importance to provide transparency for our decisions and to be accountable to the public,‚Äù Powell wrote. He did not respond to Vought‚Äôs political jabs, including accusing Powell of ‚Äúgrossly mismanaging the Fed‚Äù or having misled Congress in testimony last month. Fed denies ‚Äòluxury upgrades‚Äô claims Among the more sensational claims in Vought‚Äôs complaint was the accusation that the renovation had decked out the building with such luxury amenities as private elevators, exclusive dining rooms, and a rooftop garden. Powell strongly denied these claims . A Federal Reserve official stated that the renovation plans do not include private elevators or VIP lunchrooms. The official also clarified that the roof space would not be used as a garden or for outdoor entertainment, but would house essential mechanical equipment. Powell said the renovation responds to aging infrastructure and bona fide safety issues. Some buildings from the early 20th century need seismic reinforcements, modern electrical and plumbing systems, and augmented cybersecurity defenses. He added that the renovation is intended to conform to federal environmental standards and enhance accessibility under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Powell‚Äôs necessary and fiscally prudent spending would guarantee that the headquarters will remain safe, functional, and operational for many years. He also said that the Federal Reserve is not usually beholden to the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) ‚Äì the entity that reviews major public developments in D.C. However, Powell said the Fed willingly worked with the NCPC to ensure the renovation complied with high design and planning standards. Trump allies question Powell‚Äôs leadership Even with Powell‚Äôs modulated response, the blowback from Trump allies will likely escalate. Vought said Thursday that he plans to visit the office in person to review the project. The building is several blocks from the White House. That same day, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) said she planned to urge the US Department of Justice to investigate whether Powell had provided false or misleading information to a congressional committee regarding the scope and status of the renovation project. The criticism is part of a larger bid to undercut Powell‚Äôs leadership. Trump, who nominated Powell only to lash out at him later, has often hammered the Fed Chair for monetary policy. Trump has criticized Powell for the US central bank‚Äôs refusal to cut rates despite inflation having remained tame. In his letter , Vought stated that the President had grown increasingly concerned that Powell was unwilling to support his public statements with concrete actions . He also accused Powell of moving forward with an expensive renovation project rather than focusing on the nation‚Äôs economic challenges. On the other hand, Powell made it plain that the renovation is not a luxury but a long-deferred investment in infrastructure that underpins the Fed‚Äôs core operations, including monetary policy, financial oversight, and payment systems. Powell‚Äôs reply, however, won‚Äôt settle the controversy. It could signal the start of a broader effort to pressure him and steer the Fed in a different direction in the coming months.

Imagine nearly a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, a staggering 7,880 BTC, suddenly shifting from one of the most recognized exchanges, Coinbase, into an anonymous digital abyss. This isn‚Äôt just a routine transaction; it‚Äôs a headline-grabbing event that raises numerous questions and keeps market watchers on edge. What does such a massive BTC movement signify for the broader crypto landscape? Decoding the Unprecedented Bitcoin Transfer The news broke courtesy of Whale Alert, a popular blockchain tracking service renowned for monitoring large cryptocurrency transactions. Their report highlighted the movement of 7,880 BTC from a known Coinbase wallet to an entirely new, previously unseen address. At the time of the transaction, this colossal sum was valued at approximately $934 million. To put that into perspective, it‚Äôs enough to buy a small fleet of private jets or fund significant development projects. Such a substantial Bitcoin transfer immediately signals the involvement of a major player, commonly referred to as a ‚Äòcrypto whale‚Äô. These are entities or individuals holding vast amounts of cryptocurrency, and their movements often precede or influence market trends. The sheer size of this particular transfer makes it a focal point for analysis, as it could have profound implications for market liquidity, sentiment, and even future price action. Who is the Mysterious Crypto Whale Behind This Move? When a transaction of this magnitude occurs, the immediate question on everyone‚Äôs mind is: who is behind it? While the blockchain transaction itself is transparent and publicly verifiable, the identity of the wallet owner remains shrouded in anonymity. This is the inherent design of many cryptocurrencies ‚Äì transactions are public, but identities are private unless voluntarily disclosed or linked through external means. So, who could this crypto whale be? Several theories are circulating: Institutional Investor: A large institution, such as a hedge fund, an asset management firm, or even a corporation adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet, might be accumulating a significant position. Moving funds off an exchange to cold storage is a common practice for long-term holding. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Deal: The transfer could be part of a large OTC trade, where a buyer and seller execute a transaction directly, often facilitated by a broker, to avoid impacting exchange order books with such a large volume. The funds are then moved to the buyer‚Äôs private wallet. Exchange Rebalancing: Less likely for a move to an ‚Äòunknown new wallet‚Äô, but sometimes exchanges move funds between their own cold and hot wallets for security or operational reasons. However, the ‚Äòunknown new wallet‚Äô aspect points away from this being an internal Coinbase move. High-Net-Worth Individual: A very wealthy individual could be consolidating their holdings or preparing for a major private transaction. Preparation for Custody Solution: The funds might be moving to a specialized crypto custody provider, which offers enhanced security features for institutional-grade holdings. The fact that the funds moved from Coinbase , a regulated and prominent exchange, suggests a degree of legitimacy and potentially a US-based or compliant entity, although this is not definitive proof. Why Coinbase and BTC Movement Matter So Much The choice of Coinbase as the origin point for such a massive BTC movement is significant. Coinbase is one of the largest and most regulated cryptocurrency exchanges globally, particularly in the Western world. When large sums of Bitcoin leave an exchange, it typically has a few potential interpretations: Reduced Selling Pressure: If Bitcoin is moved off an exchange into a private wallet, it‚Äôs often interpreted as a sign that the holder intends to HODL (hold on for dear life) rather than sell in the immediate future. This can reduce the available supply on exchanges, potentially leading to upward price pressure if demand remains constant or increases. Long-Term Accumulation: Large withdrawals often indicate accumulation by long-term investors or institutions who prefer to self-custody their assets rather than leaving them on an exchange, which carries counterparty risk. Preparation for Private Sale: As mentioned, it could be a precursor to an OTC deal, where the buyer receives the BTC directly into their private wallet. Conversely, large inflows of Bitcoin to exchanges often signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing selling pressure. Therefore, this particular outflow is generally seen as a bullish or neutral signal, indicating long-term conviction rather than immediate liquidation. Understanding the Blockchain Transaction: Transparency and Anonymity The beauty and complexity of a blockchain transaction lie in its paradoxical nature: it‚Äôs both incredibly transparent and profoundly anonymous. Every single Bitcoin transaction, including this monumental 7,880 BTC transfer, is recorded on the public Bitcoin blockchain. This means anyone can view the transaction details: the sending address, the receiving address, the amount, and the timestamp. However, these addresses are strings of alphanumeric characters, not names or identities. Unless an address is publicly associated with an entity (like a known exchange wallet or a publicly declared fund), the owner remains anonymous. This is why services like Whale Alert are so crucial; they track known entity wallets (like exchanges) and flag large movements, even if the destination remains ‚Äòunknown‚Äô. For analysts, tracking these large blockchain transaction movements provides invaluable insights into market dynamics. They use sophisticated tools and heuristics to try and identify patterns, cluster addresses belonging to the same entity, and infer the intentions behind these massive shifts in capital. This particular transaction is a prime example of how on-chain data can spark market discussions and fuel speculation, even without knowing the identity of the transactor. What‚Äôs Next for This Unknown Wallet? The biggest mystery now revolves around the newly created, unknown wallet that received the 7,880 BTC. Will these funds remain dormant, signaling long-term cold storage? Will they be moved again to another address, perhaps a known institutional custodian? Or will we see portions of this massive sum being distributed to various other wallets, potentially indicating an upcoming distribution or a series of smaller private deals? Market observers will be closely monitoring this address for any subsequent activity. A prolonged period of inactivity would suggest a strong HODL conviction, while further movements could signal different strategies. The future actions of this mysterious crypto whale could certainly influence short-term market sentiment, although Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term trajectory is driven by broader macroeconomic factors and adoption trends. Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Whale‚Äôs World The 7,880 BTC transfer from Coinbase to an unknown wallet is more than just a large sum of money changing hands; it‚Äôs a fascinating peek into the opaque world of crypto whales and their market-moving actions. It underscores the immense value now flowing through the decentralized rails of Bitcoin and highlights the constant interplay between transparency (on-chain data) and anonymity (wallet ownership). While the identity of this particular crypto whale remains a secret, the event serves as a powerful reminder of the significant capital flows within the cryptocurrency ecosystem and the potential impact of such large-scale Bitcoin transfer events. As the market continues to evolve, tracking these monumental BTC movement s and understanding the underlying mechanics of a blockchain transaction will remain crucial for anyone looking to navigate the volatile yet exciting world of digital assets.

Nasdaq, a titan in the financial exchange industry, has submitted a groundbreaking proposal to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to add staking capabilities to the iShares Ethereum Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). This isn‚Äôt just another filing; it‚Äôs a bold move that signals a growing convergence between traditional finance and the innovative realm of blockchain, particularly impacting the future of Ethereum ETF products. What is the Nasdaq Proposal and Why Does it Matter for the Ethereum ETF Landscape? At its core, the Nasdaq proposal seeks to enable the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF, managed by BlackRock, to engage in crypto staking activities. Currently, many proposed spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs focus solely on holding the underlying asset. However, this new filing introduces a layer of yield generation, allowing the ETF to earn rewards by participating in the Ethereum network‚Äôs proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. This is a monumental shift because it could potentially offer investors not just exposure to Ethereum‚Äôs price movements, but also an additional income stream, mirroring how traditional financial instruments like bonds or dividend stocks provide returns. The proposal outlines how the Trust would utilize one or more trusted staking providers, such as Coinbase Custody, to facilitate the staking process. The rewards generated from staking would then accrue to the Trust, potentially enhancing its overall performance. This innovative approach aims to make the ETF more attractive by leveraging the native yield capabilities of the Ethereum blockchain, a feature previously accessible primarily to direct holders of Ether (ETH). Demystifying Crypto Staking: How Does it Work for iShares Ethereum Trust? For those new to the concept, crypto staking is a fundamental process in proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum. Instead of relying on energy-intensive mining (as Bitcoin does), Ethereum validators lock up a certain amount of their Ether as collateral to help secure the network and validate transactions. In return for this service, they receive rewards in the form of newly minted Ether and transaction fees. Here‚Äôs a simplified breakdown of how staking works and its relevance to the iShares Ethereum Trust proposal: Proof-of-Stake (PoS): Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to PoS with the ‚ÄòMerge‚Äô in September 2022. This change made staking possible. Validators: Individuals or entities who ‚Äòstake‚Äô their ETH to participate in block validation. A full validator requires 32 ETH. Staking Rewards: Validators earn ETH rewards for successfully proposing and attesting to blocks. These rewards incentivize network security and participation. Slashing: A penalty mechanism where a portion of a validator‚Äôs staked ETH is forfeited if they act maliciously or fail to perform their duties correctly. This risk is a key consideration for institutional staking. The Nasdaq proposal addresses these intricacies by suggesting the use of reputable third-party staking providers. These providers handle the technical complexities, manage validator operations, and mitigate risks like slashing, making it feasible for a regulated financial product like an ETF to engage in staking. Why is Nasdaq Pushing for Staking? Unlocking New Investor Opportunities The inclusion of staking in an Ethereum ETF is a game-changer for several reasons. It addresses a key limitation of previous crypto ETF proposals, which often left out the inherent yield generation capability of PoS assets. For investors, particularly institutions, this means: Enhanced Returns: Staking rewards can provide an additional layer of return beyond just price appreciation. This makes the ETF potentially more competitive and appealing compared to simply holding Ether directly or through other non-staking vehicles. Simplified Access: Investing in an ETF through traditional brokerage accounts is far simpler than setting up and managing a personal staking operation. This lowers the barrier to entry for a broader range of investors, including those who are not comfortable with self-custody or the technicalities of staking. The ETF handles all the complexities, from selecting staking providers to managing rewards and risks. Institutional-Grade Security: By leveraging established custodians and staking providers, the ETF can offer a level of security and compliance that individual investors might find challenging to replicate. This institutional wrapper is crucial for attracting large asset managers, pension funds, and wealth advisors. Diversification of Investment Strategies: For portfolio managers, an Ethereum ETF with staking could serve as a unique asset class that offers both growth potential and yield, fitting into various investment mandates. It provides a regulated pathway to gain exposure to the burgeoning decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem without direct participation. The Regulatory Hurdle: Will the SEC Approval Come? The path to SEC Approval for any crypto-related product, especially one involving staking, is notoriously challenging. The SEC has historically been cautious, citing concerns around investor protection, market manipulation, and the classification of cryptocurrencies. Here are some key considerations for the SEC: Security Classification: A primary concern for the SEC is whether staked ETH or the staking service itself constitutes a security. If deemed a security, it would fall under a different regulatory framework. Investor Protection: The SEC will scrutinize how the ETF plans to protect investors from risks associated with staking, such as slashing, smart contract vulnerabilities, and the solvency of staking providers. Market Manipulation: Concerns about potential manipulation in the underlying Ether market remain, though the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs has set a precedent for commodity-based crypto assets. Liquidity and Redemption: The SEC will examine how the ETF manages the lock-up periods associated with staked ETH and ensures timely redemptions for investors. The recent approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs provides a glimmer of hope, demonstrating a potential shift in the SEC‚Äôs stance on commodity-based crypto assets. However, staking introduces new complexities that the SEC will undoubtedly examine thoroughly. The Nasdaq Proposal is meticulously drafted to address these concerns, outlining robust operational procedures and risk management frameworks. Potential Impact and the Road Ahead for iShares Ethereum Trust If the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF with staking capabilities receives SEC approval, the implications could be profound: Accelerated Institutional Adoption: It would pave the way for a broader range of institutions to gain exposure to Ethereum, not just as a speculative asset, but as a yield-generating investment. This could unlock significant capital inflows into the Ethereum ecosystem. Setting a Precedent: Approval could set a crucial precedent for other crypto assets that utilize proof-of-stake mechanisms, potentially leading to a new wave of innovative ETF products in the future. Increased Market Maturity: The entry of regulated products like this signifies a maturation of the crypto market, integrating it further into the traditional financial system. This can lead to increased liquidity, stability, and credibility for digital assets. Competition and Innovation: Other asset managers would likely follow suit, leading to increased competition and further innovation in crypto-native financial products. The timeline for SEC approval is uncertain, often taking months or even longer. The commission will review public comments, engage in dialogue with Nasdaq and BlackRock, and ultimately make a decision based on its mandate to protect investors and ensure fair and orderly markets. The industry watches with bated breath, as this decision could truly be a pivotal moment for the integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Navigating the Challenges: What are the Risks for Staked Ethereum ETFs? While the benefits are compelling, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge the challenges and risks inherent in a staked Ethereum ETF : Risk Category Description Mitigation Strategies (as proposed by ETFs) Slashing Risk Validators can lose a portion of their staked ETH if they fail to perform duties or act maliciously. Using reputable, audited staking providers with strong track records and insurance policies. Diversifying staking providers. Liquidity Risk Staked ETH is locked up and cannot be immediately withdrawn. This could impact the ETF‚Äôs ability to meet redemptions. Maintaining a portion of ETH un-staked for liquidity. Utilizing liquid staking derivatives if regulatory approved. Smart Contract Risk Vulnerabilities in the smart contracts governing staking could lead to loss of funds. Relying on extensively audited and battle-tested smart contracts; working with providers who have robust security practices. Regulatory Uncertainty Evolving regulations could impact the legality or operational aspects of staking activities. Close collaboration with legal counsel and regulators; adapting to new guidelines. Centralization Risk Reliance on a few large staking providers could introduce centralization concerns for the Ethereum network. ETF managers could diversify across multiple staking providers to mitigate this risk. These risks are not trivial, and the success of the Nasdaq Proposal hinges on the SEC‚Äôs satisfaction with the proposed mitigation strategies. BlackRock and Nasdaq have a vested interest in presenting a robust, secure, and compliant product that can withstand regulatory scrutiny. A Glimpse into the Future: Institutional Adoption and Crypto Staking The move by Nasdaq and BlackRock is indicative of a broader trend: the increasing institutionalization of digital assets. What started with Bitcoin gaining acceptance as ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô is now expanding to Ethereum, recognized for its programmable blockchain capabilities and its role as the backbone of DeFi and NFTs. The inclusion of staking is a natural progression, as institutions seek to maximize returns from their digital asset holdings. This development is not just about a single ETF; it‚Äôs about validating a new financial paradigm. It signals that traditional finance is not just observing but actively seeking ways to integrate the native functionalities of blockchain technology into regulated investment products. The success of this Nasdaq Proposal could unlock a torrent of innovation, leading to more sophisticated crypto investment vehicles that truly leverage the unique attributes of digital assets. In conclusion, Nasdaq‚Äôs filing to add staking to the iShares Ethereum Trust ETF represents a truly transformative step for the digital asset industry. It underscores the growing maturity of the Ethereum ecosystem and the increasing appetite from institutional players to engage with cryptocurrencies in more sophisticated ways. While the path to SEC Approval is fraught with regulatory complexities, the sheer potential for enhanced investor returns and simplified access makes this proposal a landmark event. Its outcome will not only shape the future of Ethereum ETF products but also significantly influence the trajectory of institutional adoption within the broader crypto market. This pivotal move by Nasdaq could indeed unlock unprecedented opportunities for investors and further cement Ethereum‚Äôs role as a cornerstone of the digital economy.

At its current price of $0.03 MUTM is flying fast during presale stage. Mutuum Finance is in presale stage 5 of which 75% has been sold out as investors pile in. The token is at its lowest possible price of $0.03. A 16.7% jump will follow as phase 6 sets in. Over $12.5 million has been raised to date, and over 13500 investors have entered the presale. As Cardano navigates regulatory and technical headwinds, Mutuum‚Äôs lending-first protocol is making noise across crypto circles for its unique blend of real-world asset integration, non-custodial architecture, and capital-efficient design. Cardano‚Äôs Mid‚Äë2025 Balance: Resilient Momentum Amid Evolving Metrics Cardano (ADA) recently rallied approximately 30% from mid‚ÄëJune lows, climbing above its 200‚Äëday EMA and testing resistance near $0.75‚Äì$0.77, key indicators of renewed technical momentum. Institutional activity has notably ramped up, with around $73 million in inflows so far this year and Grayscale allocating nearly 18.5% of its smart contract fund to ADA. Meanwhile, the on‚Äëchain ecosystem remains steady. Roughly 60% of circulating ADA is staked, supporting network decentralization, and Catalyst funding rounds continue to drive community innovation. However, active daily addresses remain relatively modest, suggesting room for broader user adoption. With critical resistance holding, medium‚Äëterm price forecasts hover toward $0.90‚Äì$1.00, though macro sentiment and user growth may cap upside. In this context, emerging DeFi names like Mutuum Finance are quietly gaining attention on the horizon. Investor Interest Drives Mutuum Finance Presale Beyond $12.5M Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as one of the most promising DeFi tokens in 2025. With over $12.5 million raised and over 13500 investors already in, the presale is gaining real traction. During phase five, the token is priced at $0.03. The next stage will see the price increase to $0.035, and with an already set official launch price of $0.06, early investors are already on a 100% profit. MUTM could skyrocket 9900% to $3 before 2025 ends. Reshaping Finance Through Decentralized Lending Mutuum Finance offers a non-custodial liquidity protocol where users own complete control of assets throughout decentralized lending. The project follows a double-model approach that incorporates Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending in an attempt to achieve greater flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system utilizes smart contracts to establish automatic lending with no human interference and rather, the smart contracts respond to the market by giving dynamic interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and gives direct access between the borrowers and the lenders. The model is highly preferred by users for volatile assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance Strengthens Security with $50K Bounty & Giveaway Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is hosting a $100,000 giveaway . 10 people will each receive $10,000 MUTM tokens. The project has also launched a new leaderboard where top 50 token holders will be rewarded with bonus tokens for maintaining their ranks. To improve security, Mutuum Finance has initiated a $50,000 Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. Every vulnerability will be rewarded, with the bounty focusing on four key levels: critical, major, minor, and level four will be low. Mutuum Finance is rapidly gaining ground as one of the top DeFi coins of 2025, raising over $12.5 million from more than 13,500 investors as its presale accelerates. At a price of $0.03 and with Stage 5 nearly complete, the project is drawing serious attention for its real-world lending utility, capital-efficient design, and advanced smart contract models. As Cardano continues its steady rise, Mutuum is positioning itself to potentially outpace ADA in growth by year-end. A built-in $100,000 giveaway, a $50,000 CertiK security bounty, and a rising leaderboard reward system are helping fuel community momentum. Buy Mutuum Finance today.

A significant shift in the landscape of US crypto policy is on the horizon. Eleanor Terrett, the insightful host of the Crypto in America podcast, recently broke news via X that the White House is making final preparations for the passage of a truly groundbreaking piece of legislation today: the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins of 2025 Act, more commonly known as the Genius Act . This isn‚Äôt just another bill; it‚Äôs a pivotal moment, underscored by the scheduling of a high-profile signing ceremony for industry leaders and lawmakers tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. (EST). What does this mean for your digital assets and the broader crypto market? Let‚Äôs dive in. Understanding the Genius Act and its Impact on Stablecoin Regulation The very name, Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins, tells you a lot. The Genius Act aims to provide a clear, comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins within the United States. For years, the crypto industry has operated under a patchwork of existing laws, often ill-suited for the unique nature of digital assets . This lack of clarity has been a significant barrier to mainstream adoption and institutional investment. By passing this act, the U.S. government is signaling a strong intent to bring structure and certainty to a crucial segment of the crypto economy. What are Stablecoins? At their core, stablecoins are cryptocurrencies designed to minimize price volatility, typically by being pegged to a ‚Äòstable‚Äô asset like the U.S. dollar, gold, or even other cryptocurrencies. They act as a vital bridge between the volatile world of traditional cryptocurrencies and the stability of fiat currencies. Why Regulate Them? Stablecoins facilitate trillions of dollars in transactions annually, powering everything from decentralized finance (DeFi) to international remittances. Without proper oversight, concerns about consumer protection, financial stability, and illicit finance risks loom large. Why is the White House Crypto Focus Crucial Now? The White House‚Äôs active involvement in pushing for the Genius Act highlights a growing recognition of cryptocurrencies‚Äô importance, particularly stablecoins, in the global financial system. After years of debate and various legislative proposals, this concerted effort suggests a bipartisan consensus on the need for action. The U.S. aims to cement its position as a leader in financial innovation, rather than lagging behind other jurisdictions that have already begun to implement clearer rules for digital assets . This push comes at a time when global competition in the digital finance space is intensifying. Countries and economic blocs worldwide are exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) and comprehensive crypto regulations. For the U.S., a robust framework for stablecoins could: Foster Innovation: Provide legal certainty for developers and businesses to build new applications and services on top of regulated stablecoins. Protect Consumers: Establish clear requirements for reserves, audits, and redemption mechanisms, safeguarding users‚Äô funds. Enhance Financial Stability: Integrate stablecoins into the broader financial system in a controlled manner, mitigating systemic risks. Combat Illicit Activities: Create tools and frameworks to prevent stablecoins from being used for money laundering or terrorist financing. Navigating the Future of US Crypto Policy : What‚Äôs Next? The passage and signing of the Genius Act are just the beginning. While the ceremony marks a significant milestone, the real work of implementation will follow. Regulatory bodies like the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and potentially others, will be tasked with drafting detailed rules and guidelines based on the Act‚Äôs provisions. This process will involve extensive public comment periods and collaboration with the industry. Key questions that will emerge during this phase include: How will existing stablecoins adapt to the new regulatory requirements? What will be the specific capital and reserve requirements for issuers? How will the Act differentiate between various types of stablecoins (e.g., fiat-backed, crypto-backed, algorithmic)? What impact will this have on decentralized stablecoins, if any? The clarity provided by the Genius Act is expected to attract more traditional financial institutions into the crypto space, viewing regulated stablecoins as a safer and more predictable entry point into digital assets . This could unlock significant capital and talent, further accelerating the growth and integration of crypto into the mainstream economy. Actionable Insights for the Crypto Community For anyone involved in the crypto space, from individual investors to large enterprises, the passage of the Genius Act necessitates attention and adaptation. Here are a few actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from regulatory bodies and industry experts as the implementation details emerge. Assess Your Holdings: Understand how the new regulations might affect the stablecoins you hold or use, especially concerning their backing and issuer compliance. Prepare for Compliance: If you are a business dealing with stablecoins, begin preparing for potential new reporting, licensing, or operational requirements. Engage and Advocate: Participate in public comment periods or support industry associations that advocate for balanced and innovation-friendly regulations. A New Era for Digital Assets in America? The impending passage of the Genius Act marks a watershed moment for stablecoin regulation and the broader crypto landscape in the United States. It signifies a clear commitment from the highest levels of government to bring structure, legitimacy, and innovation to digital assets . While challenges in implementation will undoubtedly arise, the path towards a more regulated, secure, and integrated crypto economy in America appears clearer than ever. This move could very well set a precedent for global regulatory efforts, shaping the future of finance for years to come.

Daniel Yan Sounds Alarm On SBET,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-boom-or-bust-daniel-sounds-alarm-sbet/,"Daniel Yan, the founder and CIO of Kryptanium Capital, a managing partner at Matrixport Ventures, and previously an executive at Bitmain and Merrill Lynch, writes today via X: ‚ÄúEveryone is comparing SBET to MSTR and thus concludes super-bullishly for both ETH and SBET. Together with the ETF massive flow, the logic seems impeccable‚Ä¶ I think SBET differs massively from MSTR on two fronts‚Ä¶ All the above point to a maximization of short-term interest.‚Äù The comparison of SharpLink Gaming (SBET) to MicroStrategy (MSTR) has become a fixture of crypto-equity chatter as Ether rallies to 16-month highs on the back of record US spot-ETF inflows. But in a post published this morning, venture investor Daniel Yan argues that the two ‚Äúproxy‚Äù trades share less DNA than the market assumes. SBET Isn‚Äôt MicroStrategy‚ÄîWhat It Means For Ethereum Price SharpLink‚Äôs metamorphosis from an i-gaming software vendor into the world‚Äôs largest corporate Ether holder has been dizzyingly fast. Since the firm announced its treasury pivot on 2 June, it has amassed 280,706 ETH (‚âà $925 million) and staked nearly all of it, earning 415 ETH in rewards. To fund the spree, SharpLink sold 24.6 million shares for $413 million via an at-the-market (ATM) facility between 7 and 11 July. The company still has $257 million of authorised capital it has yet to commit to the market. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Shoot Above $4,000 This Week, Predicts Analyst Management insists dilution is offset by growing ‚ÄúETH Concentration‚Äù (ETH √∑ 1,000 assumed diluted shares), which has risen from 2.00 to 2.46 ETH in just five weeks. Nevertheless, Yan warns that the very mechanism powering SharpLink‚Äôs accumulation‚Äîconstant equity issuance‚Äîis also a pressure point: ‚ÄúThis method creates a massive dilution effect on the ETH-per-share metric, which makes SBET price more vulnerable to negative shocks.‚Äù MicroStrategy‚Äôs Bitcoin strategy is held together by cheap, long-dated leverage. Since mid-2020 the firm has floated $8.2 billion of convertible notes‚Äîall funnelled into BTC‚Äîand only secondarily tapped its own ATM shelf. Because converts embed an equity option, they dilute only if MSTR‚Äôs share price leaps, effectively synchronising new issuance with bullish sentiment. Yan calls this a ‚Äúflywheel‚Äù that SBET lacks. Indeed, five of MicroStrategy‚Äôs six convert issues are already deep in the money as MSTR flirts with all-time highs, turning the debt into quasi-equity on highly favourable terms. By contrast, SharpLink relies almost exclusively on equity sales; every fresh tranche increases the denominator immediately, regardless of where SBET trades. Yan also highlights governance asymmetry: SharpLink was recapitalised by ‚Äúone of the largest consortium of ETH holders,‚Äù whose own SBET shares unlock in roughly five months. He frames the arrangement as a ‚Äúmulti-party prisoner‚Äôs dilemma,‚Äù implying insiders may be incentivised to monetise quickly rather than steward a decades-long treasury strategy. No comparable unlocking event hangs over MicroStrategy, whose executive chairman Michael Saylor owns the bulk of the voting stock and has repeatedly pledged never to sell. Related Reading: SharpLink Gaming Buys Another $19.5M In Ethereum: Institutional Accumulation Yan‚Äôs comments land just as Ether ETFs smash records. US spot funds absorbed $726.6 million in net inflows on Wednesday, their best day since launch, lifting cumulative holdings above 5 million ETH. Bulls argue that such flows will continue to buoy both Ether and any equity that warehouses it. Even Yan concedes ‚Äúthere is merit in this for the short term.‚Äù But his analysis underscores that the path-dependency of SharpLink‚Äôs model‚Äîequity issuance first, crypto purchases later‚Äîcarries different risks from MicroStrategy‚Äôs debt-driven lever. The key divergence is simple: MicroStrategy‚Äôs converts dilute only if the bet is already winning; SharpLink‚Äôs ATM dilutes so the bet can be placed. Yan is not forecasting an imminent crash‚Äîhe explicitly disavows any short position in Ether‚Äîbut he urges investors caught up in ‚Äúthe euphoric period‚Äù to scrutinise capital-structure mechanics. If SharpLink‚Äôs insiders do treat the company as a short-term vehicle and ETF momentum cools, the ATM-powered ‚Äúflywheel‚Äù could spin the opposite way: more shares, lower ETH-per-share, weaker SBET. Conversely, if Ether keeps climbing and the firm times its issuance astutely, shareholders could still enjoy MicroStrategy-style convexity. The difference, as Yan makes clear, is that SharpLink‚Äôs leverage is worn on the cap table, not tucked inside a convertible note. At press time, ETH traded at $3,412.

Recent reports indicate a significant bipartisan push, with a notable number of Democratic lawmakers signaling their intent to support key legislative initiatives aimed at providing much-needed clarity for the digital asset space. This development could mark a turning point, moving the U.S. closer to a comprehensive regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Why is This Democratic Support for Crypto Regulation a Game Changer? The cryptocurrency industry has long clamored for clear rules of engagement in the United States. The current regulatory patchwork has led to uncertainty, stifling innovation, and, at times, pushing businesses offshore. The news, reported by Eleanor Terrett, host of the Crypto in America podcast, via X, suggests a breakthrough in this gridlock. According to an unnamed House Democrat source, approximately 35 Democratic lawmakers are expected to cast their votes in favor of the Digital Asset Market Structure Act , commonly known as the CLARITY Act . This level of cross-party support is crucial for any meaningful legislation to pass in a divided Congress. This anticipated vote, scheduled for a plenary session at 4 p.m. (EST), highlights a growing recognition among lawmakers of the importance and inevitability of integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system. It underscores a shift from skepticism to a more pragmatic approach towards managing this rapidly evolving sector. Understanding the Digital Asset Market Structure Act (CLARITY Act) The CLARITY Act , officially titled the Digital Asset Market Structure Act, is a comprehensive piece of legislation designed to establish a clear regulatory framework for digital assets in the United States. Its primary goal is to provide certainty for market participants, protect consumers, and foster innovation within the crypto ecosystem. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its core objectives: Defining Jurisdictions: One of the biggest challenges in crypto has been determining whether a digital asset falls under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a security or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as a commodity. The CLARITY Act aims to provide clear definitions and delineate the roles of these regulatory bodies. Consumer Protection: The bill seeks to implement robust consumer protection measures, ensuring that investors are safeguarded against fraud, manipulation, and other illicit activities within the digital asset markets. Market Integrity: By establishing clear rules for exchanges, brokers, and other intermediaries, the act intends to enhance market integrity and reduce systemic risks. Innovation: A well-defined regulatory environment can encourage innovation by providing businesses with the confidence to build and operate within the U.S. without fear of arbitrary enforcement actions. The support from Democrats for this bill signals a bipartisan desire to bring order to what has often been described as the ‚ÄòWild West‚Äô of finance. It‚Äôs a move that could significantly bolster the U.S.‚Äôs position as a leader in financial technology. The Push for a Stablecoin Bill : What is the GENIUS Act ? Beyond the broader digital asset framework, there‚Äôs also significant movement on stablecoin regulation. The same source cited by Eleanor Terrett indicated that an even larger contingent of Democratic lawmakers ‚Äì between 70 and 80 ‚Äì are expected to vote in favor of the stablecoin bill , known as the GENIUS Act . Stablecoins, digital assets pegged to the value of traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar, have become a cornerstone of the crypto economy, facilitating trades and offering a bridge between fiat and digital currencies. The importance of regulating stablecoins cannot be overstated. Their stability is crucial for the broader crypto market, and their potential use in mainstream payments and remittances necessitates a robust regulatory framework. The GENIUS Act is expected to address key aspects such as: Issuance Requirements: Establishing clear rules for who can issue stablecoins and what reserves they must hold to back their value. Redemption Rights: Ensuring that stablecoin holders have clear and reliable mechanisms to redeem their tokens for the underlying fiat currency. Oversight: Designating which regulatory bodies will oversee stablecoin issuers and ensuring compliance with financial regulations. The strong bipartisan support for the GENIUS Act suggests a consensus on the need to manage the risks associated with stablecoins while harnessing their potential benefits for the financial system. What are the Implications of Enhanced Crypto Regulation US ? The potential passage of the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act carries profound implications for the entire crypto ecosystem, both domestically and globally. Here are some key areas that could see significant impact: Area of Impact Potential Benefits Potential Challenges Investor Confidence Increased trust, attracting traditional investors. Initial market volatility as new rules are absorbed. Industry Innovation Clear guidelines foster responsible development and growth. Compliance costs for smaller startups. U.S. Competitiveness Positions U.S. as a leader in digital asset innovation. Risk of over-regulation stifling growth if not balanced. Market Stability Reduced risk of major market disruptions, especially from stablecoins. Adapting to new operational standards. The push for these bills reflects a growing consensus that the U.S. needs to establish itself as a leader in the digital asset space, rather than lagging behind other jurisdictions that have already implemented clearer frameworks. The Path Forward for the CLARITY Act and US Digital Assets While the reported Democratic support is a significant step, the legislative process is complex and often unpredictable. The CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act still need to navigate potential amendments, debates, and votes in both the House and the Senate before reaching the President‚Äôs desk. However, the indication of bipartisan momentum is a strong positive signal for the crypto industry. This development suggests that lawmakers are increasingly recognizing the economic potential of digital assets, alongside the imperative to manage their associated risks. It‚Äôs a testament to the persistent advocacy from the crypto community and a growing understanding among policymakers of the technology‚Äôs transformative power. What Does This Mean for You? Actionable Insights Stay Informed: Follow legislative developments closely. The passage of these bills could significantly alter how you interact with digital assets. Understand the Bills: Familiarize yourself with the key provisions of the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act to anticipate their impact on your investments or business. Engage with Policymakers: If you‚Äôre passionate about crypto, consider reaching out to your representatives to voice your support for thoughtful regulation. The anticipated votes represent more than just legislative action; they symbolize a maturing conversation around digital assets in Washington. It‚Äôs a move towards a future where innovation and regulation can coexist, providing a stable foundation for the next generation of financial technology. Conclusion: A New Era for Crypto in America? The impending votes on the CLARITY Act and the GENIUS Act, backed by a significant number of Democratic lawmakers, mark a potentially transformative moment for crypto regulation US . This bipartisan momentum signals a collective desire to move beyond uncertainty and establish a robust, clear framework for digital assets and stablecoins. If successful, these legislative efforts could unlock unprecedented innovation, enhance investor protection, and solidify the United States‚Äô position as a global leader in the digital economy. The path ahead remains challenging, but the current signals suggest a promising trajectory towards a more regulated and mature crypto market in America.

According to sources familiar with the matter, both experts will join Meta‚Äôs Superintelligence Labs team. Lee has already started his new role, while Gunter is set to begin in the coming days. The tech giant‚Äôs action demonstrates a growing trend in the tech ecosystem involving stiff competition for AI talent. Additionally, it has been very proactive in its staff recruitment. Meta increases its workforce with AI experts from Apple Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has demonstrated a strong commitment to artificial intelligence, motivated by its surging global demand. His dedication is evident in the company‚Äôs heavy investments in AI, the recruitment of top AI talent , and a substantial boost in spending on data centers. With this, the company aims to cement its position as the leader in AI, beating up its rivals such as OpenAI and Google. Following the tech firm‚Äôs hiring move, the company recruited Ruoming Pang, former head of Apple‚Äôs Foundation Models team, early in the month. The tech company offered him a significant salary package of $200 million to win Pang, effective for several years. Coincidentally, Pang teamed up with Gunter and Lee at Apple, who have also left the company for Zuckerberg‚Äôs company. In addition, the two were the longest-serving members in Pang‚Äôs team. Lee was his first worker at Apple. On the other hand, Gunter was a reputable engineer in the firm. After departing from Apple, Gunter accepted a job offer from another AI company but stepped down from that role following Meta‚Äôs offer. Meta‚Äôs recent hires demonstrate an ongoing disorder in the Apple Foundation Models (AFM) team. The team is responsible for creating an effective technology useful in generative AI. The AFM team is also facing uncertainties due to the company‚Äôs AI executives‚Äô decision to initiate external models into their operations as a solution to improve its Siri voice assistant, among other Apple Intelligence features. AI Senior Vice President John Giannandrea is among the AI executives at Apple. Under the research leader Daphne Luong, the team is weighing some strategic changes with Mike Rockwell and Craig Federighi, software leaders currently overseeing Siri. Neither Meta‚Äôs spokesperson nor Apple replied to a request for comment. Meta offers Apple‚Äôs employees significant salary packages Apple is developing parallel versions of its voice assistant using in-house AI models and third-party technologies to deliver long-promised enhancements to Siri , such as leveraging personal data to fulfill user queries. However, before its launch next spring, the company must decide which software backbone will power the revamped assistant. Meta has seized on Apple‚Äôs internal indecision by aggressively recruiting its AI talent with highly lucrative job offers. In many instances, Meta offers several times higher salaries than Apple‚Äôs compensation for engineers in its Apple Foundation Models group. In response, Apple has begun issuing raises to select members of the roughly 100-person team to retain the talent. Yet, those counteroffers pale compared to what Meta compared to the table. One high-profile defector, Gunter, is among several AI specialists receiving multiyear compensation packages exceeding $100 million. Mark Zuckerberg underscored Meta‚Äôs ambitions earlier this week, posting on Threads that the company plans to ‚Äúinvest hundreds of billions of dollars into computers to build superintelligence‚Äù‚Äîa nod to AI that surpasses human capabilities. At Meta‚Äôs Menlo Park headquarters, some of its top AI recruits have been strategically seated near Zuckerberg to enable close collaboration on the company‚Äôs most critical AI initiatives.

This pivotal moment, reported by Infinity Hedge via Telegram, marks a substantial stride towards clarity and regulation in the burgeoning digital asset space. What does this mean for the future of digital finance? What is the US Stablecoin Bill? At its core, the US Stablecoin Bill aims to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins, a critical component of the digital asset ecosystem. These cryptocurrencies are designed to maintain a stable value relative to a specific fiat currency, like the U.S. dollar, or a basket of assets. The Genius Act seeks to provide much-needed clarity for issuers, users, and regulators alike, moving away from the current patchwork of state and federal interpretations. Defining Stablecoins: The bill aims to create a clear legal definition for stablecoins, differentiating them from other cryptocurrencies. Issuance Requirements: It proposes standards for stablecoin issuers, potentially requiring them to hold reserves in safe, liquid assets to back the stablecoins in circulation. Consumer Protection: A key focus is on safeguarding consumers by ensuring transparency and stability within the stablecoin market. Why is Crypto Regulation Crucial Now? The rapid growth of the crypto market, coupled with past incidents of instability and fraud, has underscored the urgent need for robust crypto regulation . Without clear guidelines, innovation can be stifled, and consumer protection remains a significant concern. This bill represents an effort to balance fostering innovation with safeguarding financial stability and preventing illicit activities. For years, the industry has called for a clear rulebook, and this legislation is a direct response to that demand. Benefits of Clear Crypto Regulation: Increased Investor Confidence: A regulated environment can attract more traditional investors and institutions, viewing crypto as a safer asset class. Market Stability: Rules around reserves and issuance can help prevent ‚Äòruns‚Äô on stablecoins, similar to bank runs. Innovation with Guardrails: While regulation can be perceived as restrictive, clear rules can actually provide a stable foundation for legitimate businesses to innovate and grow. Impact on Digital Asset Legislation and the Market The passage of this bill is a landmark event for digital asset legislation . It signals a growing recognition within the U.S. government of the permanence and potential of cryptocurrencies. For the market, this could mean increased institutional adoption, greater liquidity, and a more predictable environment for businesses operating with stablecoins. It could also set a precedent for how other digital assets might be regulated in the future. Potential Market Implications: Aspect Before Genius Act After Genius Act (Potential) Regulatory Clarity Fragmented, uncertain Defined, predictable framework Investor Trust Variable, subject to perception Increased due to oversight Institutional Adoption Cautious, limited Potentially accelerated The Genius Act: A Closer Look at its Provisions What exactly does the Genius Act entail? While full details are still emerging, early reports suggest it addresses key areas to ensure the stability and integrity of stablecoins. It is designed to prevent scenarios where stablecoins might de-peg from their intended value, protecting both individual users and the broader financial system. Issuance Standards: Mandating that stablecoin issuers hold reserves in safe, liquid assets, akin to traditional financial institutions. This could include U.S. Treasury bills, cash, or highly liquid government securities. Redemption Rights: Ensuring that stablecoin holders have a clear, enforceable right to redeem their stablecoins for fiat currency at par (1:1). This is fundamental to maintaining trust. Supervisory Oversight: Granting specific regulatory bodies, potentially the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), or state banking regulators, clear oversight powers over stablecoin issuers and activities. Interoperability: Potentially promoting standards that allow different stablecoins to work together seamlessly, fostering a more efficient and integrated digital economy. What‚Äôs Next for US House Crypto Efforts? With the US House Crypto efforts yielding this significant bill, what comes next? The bill now moves to the Senate, where it will face further scrutiny and potential amendments. The legislative journey is far from over, but this House passage sets a strong precedent and indicates a bipartisan willingness to engage with digital asset policy. There may be debates over specific provisions, but the momentum for federal stablecoin regulation is clear. Challenges Ahead: Senate Approval: The Senate has its own priorities and perspectives on crypto regulation, and the bill may undergo significant changes. Inter-Agency Coordination: Ensuring that different regulatory bodies (e.g., SEC, CFTC, Treasury) are aligned on their approach to digital assets. Global Context: The U.S. approach will also be watched closely by other nations developing their own crypto frameworks, potentially influencing global standards. The passage of the Genius Act in the U.S. House of Representatives marks a watershed moment for stablecoins and the broader cryptocurrency landscape. It represents a significant step towards bringing regulatory clarity to a rapidly evolving industry, potentially unlocking new avenues for innovation and adoption while safeguarding consumers. While the path ahead remains dynamic, this legislative breakthrough signals a maturing dialogue around digital assets in the halls of power, paving the way for a more integrated and secure digital financial future.

The core inflation figure excludes fresh food, which fluctuates more due to weather and supply conditions. The most recent figures, published on Friday by Japan‚Äôs Internal Affairs Ministry, were generally in line with the forecasts of economists polled by Reuters. The headline inflation rate covers all categories and was down to 3.3% in June from 3.5% in May. Nonetheless, it is the 39th straight month that inflation has exceeded the Bank of Japan‚Äôs (BOJ) 2% goal. A broader measure, the so-called ‚Äúcore-core‚Äù rate of inflation, which excludes not only fresh food but also energy prices, rose to 3.4% from 3.3% the previous month. It‚Äôs regarded as the benchmark for underlying inflation trends and is closely monitored by the BOJ. While inflation has slowed, prices are still high compared with previous years, and the public continues to bear an increasing cost of living. Rice prices begin to stabilize A key driver of recent Japanese inflation has been rice, a staple in virtually every household. In May, rice prices had surged more than 101.7% year-on-year, the steepest jump in over 50 years. But that rate slowed a bit in June. The 100.2% year-on-year jump in the price of rice was the first indication of a let-up in months. The relaxation came after the government released rice stockpiles earlier this year to cool prices. The intervention helped shore up supply and dampen speculation in the market. However, prices are still high, and officials warn that the ripples of that bad harvest in 2023 are still being felt. The 2023 harvest season was affected by abnormal weather, including typhoons and record heat that cut output in the main rice regions. Although the current trend is promising, according to experts, a return to stable rice prices will depend on the 2025 harvest, which is still unknown. Trump‚Äôs tariffs threaten Japan‚Äôs economic recovery The confidence data comes from Japan‚Äôs economy, which is increasingly clouded by external economic uncertainties . A big one is US trade policy. US President Donald Trump says he is not ready to strike a trade deal with Japan. That has stoked fears of additional tariffs that would damage Japanese exports, particularly of cars, the largest product that Japan ships to the United States. A 25% tariff on a broad swath of Japanese goods will go into effect on August 1, while a 25% levy on cars will remain in place. The introduction of these tariffs would come at a particularly challenging time for the Japanese economy. Japan has announced its GDP fell 0.2% in the first three months of 2025 compared to the previous quarter. It was the first contraction in a year, driven primarily by a steep export fall. The financial pressure is shaping up to be a significant issue ahead of next summer‚Äôs upper house elections, in which voters remain angered by the creeping prices but stagnant wages. The persisting inflation growth has some market participants speculating about the need for interest rate increases by the Bank of Japan. After all, the headline inflation rate has been above the 2% target for over three years. But the central bank remains wary. Bank of America analysts have said the BOJ will unlikely raise rates before January 2026. They say BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda targets inflation expectations, which remain below 2%. These expectations ‚Äî what businesses and households expect as future inflation ‚Äî are an important signal of whether inflation is genuinely embedded in the economy.

This development marks a pivotal moment for the crypto market, signaling a serious move towards establishing concrete regulatory guidelines for digital assets in the United States. For years, the industry has grappled with uncertainty, operating in a patchwork of regulations or, often, a regulatory vacuum. This legislation aims to change that, potentially reshaping how cryptocurrencies are traded, held, and developed. What Exactly is the Clarity Act? Unpacking the Core of US Crypto Law According to reports, including one from Unfolded on Telegram, the Clarity Act is designed to bring much-needed structure to the burgeoning crypto market. But what does that truly mean? While the specifics of the bill‚Äôs final text will define its full impact, its core objective is to provide a clear framework for digital assets, defining their legal status and establishing guidelines for market participants. This could involve: Defining Digital Asset Categories: Clarifying whether a specific cryptocurrency or token is a security, a commodity, or a new asset class entirely. This distinction is crucial as it determines which regulatory body (e.g., SEC or CFTC) has jurisdiction. Market Structure Guidelines: Establishing rules for crypto exchanges, custodians, and other service providers, potentially addressing issues like consumer protection, market manipulation, and operational resilience. Investor Protection: Implementing measures to safeguard investors from fraud and mismanagement, fostering greater trust in the digital asset ecosystem. The absence of clear US crypto law has long been a point of contention, leading to legal battles, compliance headaches, and a chilling effect on innovation. This act, therefore, represents a significant legislative attempt to address these long-standing issues. Why is Crypto Market Regulation So Important Right Now? The call for robust crypto market regulation has grown louder with the increasing mainstream adoption of digital assets. While the decentralized nature of crypto is a core tenet, it also presents unique challenges for oversight. Here‚Äôs why regulation is becoming indispensable: Investor Confidence: A regulated environment provides a sense of security for both retail and institutional investors. Clear rules can help prevent scams and provide recourse in case of malpractices, encouraging broader participation. Institutional Adoption: Major financial institutions often shy away from markets lacking clear regulatory frameworks due to compliance risks. Defined regulations can pave the way for more traditional finance players to enter the crypto space, bringing significant capital and liquidity. Combating Illicit Activities: Regulation can help in monitoring and preventing the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illegal activities, enhancing the legitimacy of the overall market. Market Stability: Clear rules around market conduct, liquidity, and capital requirements can contribute to a more stable and predictable market environment, reducing volatility caused by speculative bubbles or systemic risks. The passage of the Clarity Act by the House underscores a growing consensus that the benefits of a regulated crypto market outweigh the risks of inaction. How Will the Clarity Act Shape Digital Asset Legislation? The Clarity Act is not an isolated event; it‚Äôs part of a larger, evolving narrative around digital asset legislation in the U.S. For years, various bills and proposals have been put forth, often with differing approaches to classifying and regulating cryptocurrencies. This act could serve as a foundational piece, influencing future legislative efforts and potentially harmonizing the fragmented regulatory landscape. Historically, the debate has often centered on whether digital assets fall under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as securities or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as commodities. The Clarity Act aims to provide a more definitive answer, which could reduce regulatory arbitrage and provide clarity for projects seeking to launch or operate in the U.S. This clarity is crucial for innovators, as it allows them to design their projects with a clear understanding of the legal requirements from the outset. Furthermore, this legislation could set a precedent for how other countries approach crypto regulation, potentially influencing global standards and fostering greater interoperability in the international digital asset ecosystem. What Does This Mean for the Future of Cryptocurrency Policy in the US? The passing of the Clarity Act by the House is a significant milestone, but it‚Äôs just one step in the complex legislative process. For it to become law, it must also pass the Senate and be signed by the President. This journey can be fraught with challenges, including potential amendments, differing opinions in the Senate, and the possibility of a presidential veto. However, the House‚Äôs action sends a strong signal regarding the direction of cryptocurrency policy in the U.S. It indicates a growing recognition among lawmakers of the need to move beyond enforcement actions and towards a comprehensive regulatory framework. This proactive approach, if successful, could: Foster Innovation: By providing clear rules, the U.S. could become a more attractive hub for blockchain and crypto innovation, as companies will have a better understanding of the legal landscape. Enhance Competitiveness: A well-defined regulatory environment can help the U.S. maintain its leadership in financial innovation globally, preventing companies from moving offshore due to regulatory uncertainty. Strengthen National Security: Clear rules can also help in integrating digital assets into existing financial crime prevention frameworks, enhancing national security efforts. The debate surrounding cryptocurrency policy is far from over, but the Clarity Act represents a tangible step towards a more structured and predictable future for digital assets in the U.S. Actionable Insights: Navigating the New Regulatory Landscape For individuals and entities involved in the crypto space, the passing of the Clarity Act by the House necessitates attention and preparation. While the final law is yet to be enacted, understanding its potential implications is key: For Crypto Businesses and Startups: Begin assessing how your operations might align with potential new classifications of digital assets. Proactive engagement with legal counsel specializing in crypto law will be crucial to ensure future compliance. This could involve re-evaluating token structures, exchange listings, and marketing practices. For Investors: Stay informed about the legislative process and how potential regulations might affect the assets you hold. Increased regulation could bring more stability and legitimacy to certain assets, while others might face stricter compliance burdens. Diversification and thorough due diligence remain paramount. For Developers and Innovators: While regulations might seem restrictive, they can also provide a stable foundation for building. Clear rules can unlock new avenues for institutional partnerships and mainstream adoption, allowing for more robust and compliant decentralized applications (dApps). The landscape is shifting, and adaptability will be key. This is an opportune time to engage with industry associations and policy discussions to ensure your voice is heard as these crucial regulations take shape. Conclusion: A New Chapter for the Crypto Market The U.S. House‚Äôs passage of the Clarity Act marks a significant turning point for the crypto market. It signifies a decisive move towards bringing order and predictability to an industry that has long operated in the shadows of regulatory ambiguity. While the journey to becoming law is still ahead, this legislation underscores a growing governmental recognition of digital assets‚Äô importance and the urgent need for a clear, comprehensive cryptocurrency policy . This act has the potential to unlock new levels of institutional investment, enhance investor protection, and solidify the U.S.‚Äôs position as a leader in financial innovation. The future of crypto in the U.S. is poised for a new chapter, one that promises greater clarity, stability, and growth. Staying informed and adaptable will be crucial as this landmark legislation continues its path through the halls of power.

Even if your primary focus is on digital assets, understanding the broader economic landscape, particularly the U.S. Stock Market , is absolutely vital. Today‚Äôs news brings a wave of optimism from Wall Street, with all three major U.S. stock market indices closing higher. This positive movement isn‚Äôt just a win for traditional investors; it carries significant implications for the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. Let‚Äôs dive into what these gains mean and how they might ripple through the crypto space. U.S. Stock Market Surges: A Closer Look at Key Market Indices The latest closing bell brought smiles to investors as the major U.S. Stock Market indices registered impressive gains. This broad-based rally signals a strong appetite for risk and potentially a brighter outlook on the economy. Here‚Äôs a quick snapshot of how the key Market Indices performed: Index Performance S&P 500 +0.59% Nasdaq Composite +0.74% Dow Jones Industrial Average +0.52% These figures represent a collective sigh of relief and renewed enthusiasm among investors. The S&P 500, often seen as the broadest measure of U.S. stock market health, showed solid growth. The Dow Jones, home to 30 large, publicly-traded companies, also contributed positively, indicating strength in established industries. But it was the Nasdaq Performance that particularly caught the eye, leading the pack with its robust gains. Why Are These Market Indices Rising Now? Understanding the catalysts behind these gains is crucial. Several factors typically contribute to a positive day on Wall Street, and today was no exception. Often, such upticks are driven by a combination of: Positive Economic Data: Favorable inflation reports, strong employment figures, or better-than-expected GDP growth can signal a healthy economy, boosting corporate earnings prospects. Strong Corporate Earnings: When major companies report profits that exceed analyst expectations, it instills confidence in their future performance and the broader market. Optimistic Central Bank Outlook: Hints from the Federal Reserve about potential interest rate cuts or a less aggressive tightening policy can make borrowing cheaper and stimulate economic activity. Geopolitical Stability: A reduction in global tensions or uncertainty can lead investors to take on more risk, moving capital into equities. While the exact combination of factors can vary daily, the general sentiment indicates that investors are finding reasons to be optimistic about the economic trajectory, which directly influences the performance of these major Market Indices . How Does This Boost Investor Confidence? When the stock market performs well, it naturally cultivates a stronger sense of Investor Confidence . This isn‚Äôt just about financial gains; it‚Äôs about the psychological impact on market participants. Here‚Äôs why rising markets are so powerful: Positive Feedback Loop: Gains encourage more investment, which can lead to further gains, creating a virtuous cycle. Wealth Effect: As portfolios grow, individuals often feel wealthier and more inclined to spend, which can stimulate the economy. Reduced Fear: A rising market can alleviate fears of recession or economic downturns, making investors more willing to take on riskier assets. This heightened Investor Confidence isn‚Äôt confined to traditional equities. It can create a ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô environment where capital flows into various asset classes, including those perceived as higher risk, such as cryptocurrencies. Nasdaq Performance: A Bellwether for Tech and Growth The Nasdaq Performance , in particular, often serves as a crucial indicator for growth-oriented assets. Comprising a large number of technology and innovative companies, the Nasdaq Composite‚Äôs strong showing suggests that investors are increasingly comfortable with risk and are willing to bet on future growth potential. For crypto enthusiasts, the Nasdaq‚Äôs movements are especially relevant: Correlation with Tech Stocks: Many cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, have historically shown some correlation with tech stocks, as both are often seen as ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô assets. Innovation Driver: A strong Nasdaq implies a healthy environment for innovation and technological advancement, themes that resonate deeply within the crypto space. Institutional Interest: Tech companies and the institutions that invest in them are increasingly exploring blockchain and digital assets. A confident tech sector might signal more institutional capital flowing into crypto. Observing the Nasdaq Performance can therefore offer valuable clues about the broader appetite for speculative and growth-oriented investments, which directly impacts the digital asset landscape. The Crucial Crypto Market Impact: What Does This Mean for Your Digital Assets? Now for the million-dollar question: what is the direct Crypto Market Impact of this positive traditional market performance? While the relationship isn‚Äôt always straightforward, there are several ways the rising U.S. Stock Market could influence your crypto portfolio: Potential Positive Correlations: Risk-On Sentiment: When traditional markets are booming, investors often feel more comfortable taking on risk. This ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô sentiment can lead to capital flowing from safer assets into higher-volatility assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Liquidity Inflow: Increased wealth in the stock market can mean more disposable income for investors, some of which might be allocated to crypto. Macroeconomic Optimism: A positive economic outlook that boosts stocks also tends to benefit all growth assets, including digital currencies. Considerations and Nuances: Decoupling Potential: While correlations exist, the crypto market also has its own unique drivers, such as regulatory news, technological advancements (e.g., Ethereum upgrades, new dApps), and specific adoption trends. There are times when crypto can decouple from traditional markets. Flight to Safety: Conversely, in times of extreme traditional market downturns, some investors might view Bitcoin as a ‚Äòdigital gold‚Äô or safe haven, leading to an inverse correlation. However, this has been less consistent in recent years. Regulatory Environment: The evolving regulatory landscape for crypto, particularly in the U.S., plays a significant role independent of stock market performance. In essence, a rising tide lifts all boats, and a strong U.S. Stock Market often creates a more favorable environment for speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. It signals a broader comfort with risk and an optimistic economic outlook, which are generally bullish indicators for digital assets. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Given the positive signals from the traditional markets, what should crypto investors consider? Monitor Macro Trends: Don‚Äôt just focus on crypto charts. Keep an eye on inflation data, interest rate decisions, and major economic reports. These can significantly influence both traditional and crypto markets. Diversify Wisely: While a rising tide can lift all boats, not all digital assets will perform equally. Consider diversifying your crypto portfolio and balancing it with other asset classes if appropriate for your risk tolerance. Stay Informed on Nasdaq Performance: As a bellwether for tech and growth, the Nasdaq‚Äôs movements can often provide early signals for broader risk appetite that could spill into crypto. Long-Term Vision: Remember that both stock and crypto markets are subject to volatility. Focus on long-term investment strategies rather than short-term fluctuations. Concluding Thoughts: Riding the Wave of Renewed Confidence The strong close of the U.S. Stock Market indices‚ÄîS&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow‚Äîmarks a significant moment of renewed Investor Confidence . This positive momentum, particularly highlighted by the robust Nasdaq Performance , sends a powerful signal across the financial landscape. While the Crypto Market Impact is multifaceted and not always directly proportional, a healthy traditional market environment generally fosters a ‚Äòrisk-on‚Äô sentiment that can benefit digital assets. As investors, staying attuned to these broader market movements is key to navigating the interconnected world of finance and making informed decisions in your crypto journey. The current climate suggests a fertile ground for growth, but vigilance remains paramount.

In a truly remarkable turn of events, Bitcoin price has not just broken a new barrier but has absolutely soared, crossing the monumental $120,000 mark . This isn‚Äôt just another incremental gain; it‚Äôs a significant milestone that has captured the attention of investors, analysts, and enthusiasts worldwide. According to real-time market monitoring from Bitcoin World, and confirmed by trading data on the Binance USDT market where BTC is currently trading at $120,000 , this ascent signals a powerful shift in the market‚Äôs dynamics. What exactly is fueling this incredible climb, and what does it mean for the future of the cryptocurrency market ? The Unprecedented Rise: What Propelled Bitcoin Price Beyond $120,000? For weeks, anticipation has been building, and now, the Bitcoin price has delivered a stunning performance. This wasn‚Äôt a sudden spike out of nowhere; it‚Äôs the culmination of several converging factors that have created a perfect storm for growth. Understanding these catalysts is key to grasping the magnitude of this achievement. Institutional Adoption and ETF Inflows: The approval and subsequent launch of spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) in major markets have opened the floodgates for institutional capital. These vehicles provide a regulated and accessible way for large funds and traditional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin, significantly increasing demand. Halving Narrative: With the Bitcoin halving event on the horizon, the inherent scarcity mechanism of Bitcoin is becoming more pronounced. Historically, halvings have preceded significant bull runs, as the rate of new Bitcoin entering circulation is cut in half, reducing supply against potentially rising demand. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation concerns and geopolitical tensions, often drive investors towards alternative assets. Bitcoin, increasingly seen as a ‚Äòdigital gold,‚Äô benefits from this flight to safety and a hedge against traditional financial instability. Growing Retail Interest: Beyond institutions, a resurgence in retail investor interest is evident. Social media trends, mainstream media coverage, and the ‚Äòfear of missing out‚Äô (FOMO) phenomenon are bringing new participants into the market, adding to the buying pressure. Technological Advancements: Continuous development within the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as improvements in scalability solutions and broader utility, also contribute to its long-term appeal and perceived value. Understanding the Mechanics of This Monumental BTC Rally A BTC rally of this scale is not merely about price; it‚Äôs about the underlying market mechanics and the psychological shifts that accompany such rapid growth. The move past $120,000 reflects robust buying pressure and a strong belief among participants in Bitcoin‚Äôs continued appreciation. Market dynamics at play include: Supply-Demand Imbalance: The available supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has been steadily decreasing, indicating that holders are opting to HODL (hold on for dear life) rather than sell. Coupled with increased demand from ETFs and retail investors, this creates a classic supply-demand imbalance pushing prices higher. Liquidity and Market Depth: The market has demonstrated impressive depth, absorbing large buy orders without significant price resistance, suggesting strong underlying liquidity and confidence. Positive Feedback Loop: As prices rise, more positive news emerges, attracting even more investors, which in turn fuels further price increases. This creates a powerful positive feedback loop. Let‚Äôs consider some key factors driving the current BTC rally : Factor Description Impact on Price Spot Bitcoin ETFs Regulated investment vehicles allowing traditional investors easy access to BTC. Significant capital inflow, increased legitimacy. Bitcoin Halving Event reducing the supply of new Bitcoin by half every four years. Creates scarcity, historically bullish. Global Macro Trends Inflation, interest rates, geopolitical stability. Bitcoin as a hedge against economic uncertainty. Network Development Ongoing improvements to Bitcoin‚Äôs infrastructure and utility. Enhances long-term value proposition. Wider Implications for the Cryptocurrency Market Bitcoin‚Äôs performance rarely stays isolated. This significant Bitcoin surge has ripple effects across the entire cryptocurrency market . When Bitcoin rallies, it often pulls the rest of the market with it, albeit with varying degrees of intensity. This phenomenon is often referred to as the ‚Äòaltcoin season‚Äô if Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance stabilizes or slightly recedes after its initial surge, allowing capital to flow into other digital assets. Is This the Dawn of a New Crypto Bull Cycle? Many analysts believe that Bitcoin breaking through key resistance levels and establishing new all-time highs could signal the beginning of a sustained bull market. This isn‚Äôt just about price; it‚Äôs about renewed confidence, increased development activity, and a broader acceptance of digital assets in the global financial landscape. Regulatory bodies are also paying closer attention, which, while sometimes leading to challenges, also indicates a growing recognition of crypto‚Äôs permanence. Navigating the Bitcoin Surge: Opportunities and Risks While the excitement around the Bitcoin surge is palpable, it‚Äôs crucial for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. Every significant price movement presents both opportunities for gains and inherent risks that must be managed. Opportunities: Potential for Further Gains: If the current momentum continues and underlying fundamentals remain strong, there could be further upside for Bitcoin. Portfolio Diversification: For traditional investors, Bitcoin can offer a non-correlated asset class that can help diversify a portfolio, potentially reducing overall risk. Innovation and Ecosystem Growth: A rising Bitcoin price often fuels innovation within the broader crypto ecosystem, leading to new projects, applications, and technological advancements. Risks: Volatility: Bitcoin is notorious for its price swings. While the trend is currently upward, sharp corrections can occur rapidly, leading to significant paper losses for those not prepared. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving. New laws or restrictions in major economies could impact market sentiment and price. Market Corrections: No asset moves up in a straight line forever. A correction after such a significant surge is a natural part of market cycles. What Should Investors Do Amidst This Bitcoin Surge? For both seasoned and new investors, a few actionable insights can help navigate these exciting times: Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on hype. Understand Bitcoin‚Äôs technology, use cases, and market dynamics. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, consider investing a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of volatility. Risk Management: Only invest what you can afford to lose. Set stop-loss orders or have a clear exit strategy to protect your capital. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of the latest crypto news , market analysis, and regulatory developments. Knowledge is power in this fast-moving space. Beyond the Headlines: What Does This Crypto News Really Mean? The latest crypto news of Bitcoin hitting $120,000 is more than just a number; it‚Äôs a testament to the digital asset‚Äôs growing maturity and its undeniable presence in the global financial conversation. This milestone reflects a broader acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate store of value and a viable investment asset, moving beyond its early days as a niche technology. Looking ahead, the long-term outlook for Bitcoin remains robust. As global economies continue to digitize and demand for decentralized, permissionless financial systems grows, Bitcoin‚Äôs foundational role is likely to strengthen. The journey to $120,000 has been exhilarating, and it sets the stage for what could be an even more transformative period for digital assets. In conclusion, Bitcoin‚Äôs ascent past $120,000 is a landmark achievement, driven by a confluence of institutional adoption, scarcity narratives, and shifting macroeconomic tides. While the excitement is warranted, investors should remain vigilant, understanding both the immense opportunities and the inherent risks. This milestone solidifies Bitcoin‚Äôs position at the forefront of financial innovation and signals a potentially thrilling new chapter for the entire cryptocurrency market.

Renowned crypto analyst and trader, Ali Martinez, recently shared insights on X, highlighting the formation of a ‚Äògolden cross‚Äô on one of XRP‚Äôs most crucial on-chain metrics: the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) indicator. This development has captivated investors, especially given historical precedents that suggest an extraordinary surge could be on the horizon for the digital asset. Understanding the MVRV Indicator and the Golden Cross Phenomenon To truly grasp the significance of this development, it‚Äôs essential to understand the tools at play. The MVRV indicator is a powerful on-chain metric that provides deep insights into the profitability status of investors. It achieves this by comparing the current market capitalization of an asset with its ‚Äòrealized capitalization,‚Äô which essentially represents the average price at which all coins in circulation were last moved. In simpler terms, it shows whether the market as a whole is in profit or loss. Market Value (MV): This is the current market capitalization of the asset, calculated by multiplying the current price by the total circulating supply. Realized Value (RV): This represents the aggregate cost basis of all coins in circulation. It‚Äôs the sum of the prices at which each coin last moved on the blockchain. MVRV Ratio: The ratio of Market Value to Realized Value. A ratio above 1 suggests that the market is, on average, in profit, while a ratio below 1 indicates an average loss. Now, what about the ‚Äògolden cross‚Äô? In technical analysis, a golden cross is a chart pattern that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, typically signaling a definitive uptrend. While often applied to price charts, its appearance on an on-chain indicator like MVRV is particularly potent, as it reflects underlying investor behavior and profitability trends rather than just speculative price movements. For XRP , this specific MVRV golden cross suggests a fundamental shift in investor sentiment and profitability from a bearish to a bullish outlook. Ali Martinez‚Äôs Insights: The Historical Precedent for XRP Price Action The analyst Ali Martinez‚Äôs observation is not just about the current formation; it‚Äôs about the historical context that gives this signal its weight. Martinez pointed out that when this exact MVRV golden cross pattern appeared in the past for XRP, the results were nothing short of spectacular. Historically, such formations have preceded significant upward movements, with one notable instance seeing the XRP price surge by an astounding 630%. This historical performance naturally fuels optimism and raises questions about whether history is set to repeat itself. The MVRV indicator‚Äôs ability to gauge the overall profitability of the XRP holder base makes it a strong predictor of potential market moves. When the MVRV ratio starts to trend upwards, especially with a golden cross formation, it implies that more investors are moving into profit, reducing the likelihood of widespread selling and increasing the potential for further price appreciation as confidence builds. What Does This Bullish Signal Mean for XRP Holders? For current and prospective XRP holders, the emergence of this bullish signal is a cause for considerable excitement. It suggests that the underlying fundamentals, as reflected by on-chain investor behavior, are aligning for a positive price trajectory. At the time of this report, XRP was trading at $3.43, having already seen an impressive 11.76% increase, according to CoinMarketCap. This immediate positive reaction to the news underscores the market‚Äôs responsiveness to such strong technical indicators. A golden cross on the MVRV indicator implies that the aggregate cost basis of XRP holders is now significantly below the current market price, meaning a vast majority are in profit. This creates a psychological environment where holders are less likely to panic sell and more likely to hold for further gains, or even accumulate more, contributing to upward price pressure. This strong profitability signal often precedes periods of significant growth, acting as a self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent. Navigating the Market: Actionable Insights for Crypto Analysis While the bullish signal is undeniably exciting, it‚Äôs crucial for investors to approach the market with a balanced perspective. No indicator guarantees future performance, and the crypto market remains volatile. However, the MVRV golden cross provides a strong analytical foundation for considering potential moves. Monitor Volume: A sustained increase in trading volume alongside the price surge would further validate the strength of this bullish signal. Watch for Resistance Levels: Identify key resistance levels from previous price highs. Breaking these levels with conviction would confirm the uptrend. Diversification: Even with strong signals, it‚Äôs always prudent to maintain a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks. Stay Informed: Keep an eye on broader market sentiment and any news regarding Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal battles, which can significantly impact XRP‚Äôs trajectory. This deep dive into on-chain metrics, specifically the MVRV indicator, offers a powerful lens through which to perform effective crypto analysis . It moves beyond simple price charts to reveal the underlying health and sentiment of the investor base. Is a 630% Surge for XRP Realistic? The prospect of a 630% surge for XRP is, understandably, the most tantalizing aspect of Ali Martinez‚Äôs analysis. While past performance is not indicative of future results, the historical correlation provides a compelling narrative. Such a surge would propel XRP into unprecedented price territories, potentially reaching over $20 from its current levels. Achieving this would require sustained buying pressure, positive market sentiment, and perhaps favorable regulatory developments. It‚Äôs important to remember that the crypto market is influenced by a myriad of factors, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory news, technological advancements, and overall market sentiment. However, the MVRV golden cross provides a strong technical and on-chain foundation for such an optimistic outlook, suggesting that the underlying investor base is positioned for significant profitability. This is a moment where technical analysis, combined with on-chain data, offers a rare glimpse into potentially explosive growth. Conclusion: A Golden Opportunity for XRP? The appearance of a golden cross on XRP‚Äôs MVRV indicator, as highlighted by Ali Martinez, represents a truly significant development for the digital asset. With historical data pointing to massive surges following similar patterns, the potential for XRP price appreciation is undeniably high. While the crypto market always carries inherent risks, the confluence of a strong on-chain signal and historical precedent creates a compelling narrative for a potentially monumental rally. Investors and enthusiasts alike will be watching closely to see if XRP can indeed replicate its past performance and deliver the explosive growth many are now anticipating.

Trump is expected to sign an executive order as early as this week that would allow 401(k) plans to include a broader set of alternative assets, the Financial Times reported Friday. This order would instruct US regulatory agencies to study and remove any remaining barriers preventing professionally managed retirement funds from offering exposure to asset classes beyond traditional stocks and bonds. These would include digital assets, precious metals, corporate debt, infrastructure funds and private equity vehicles. FT Exclusive: The US president is expected to sign an executive order that would open up 401k plans to alternative investments beyond traditional stocks and bonds, according to people briefed on Trump's plans. https://t.co/M4RCM0Vq7t pic.twitter.com/mY3w0ZiHyG ‚Äî Financial Times (@FT) July 17, 2025 Trump Seeks to Modernize 401(k)s by Expanding Beyond Stocks and Bonds The shift marks a pivotal moment for US retirement policy. Currently, 401(k) plans allow workers to invest part of their salaries in tax-advantaged public securities, but most options remain limited to conventional stock and bond mutual funds. By broadening this scope, the Trump administration aims to align retirement planning with evolving market dynamics. This latest move also accelerates the president‚Äôs ongoing campaign to legitimize crypto within mainstream financial systems. Trump has positioned himself as a pro-crypto leader, campaigning on deregulating digital assets and publicly crediting the industry for helping deliver his 2024 election win. Wave Of Trump-Supported Crypto Bills Signals Push To Ease Rules This week, the House of Representatives passed three crypto-related bills strongly backed by the Trump administration. The votes followed a late-night meeting between Trump and lawmakers that helped resolve a procedural gridlock just two days prior. Together, the legislation reflects a broader effort to support digital finance and remove regulatory roadblocks. The administration has already taken early steps toward integrating crypto with retirement savings. In May, the Department of Labor rescinded a Biden-era policy that discouraged 401(k) plan administrators from offering crypto options . Trump‚Äôs executive order would take that effort further by encouraging regulatory clarity and legal protections. Wall Street Firms Prepare for Wave of Retirement-Fueled Capital For the private capital industry, the proposed changes could prove transformative. The order is expected to instruct the Labor Department to explore ‚Äúsafe harbor‚Äù provisions for retirement plan administrators, shielding them from liability when offering more complex, less liquid investments like private equity and infrastructure funds. Firms such as Blackstone, Apollo and BlackRock have already signaled strong interest in expanding access to the retirement market. With hundreds of billions of dollars potentially flowing into alternative investments, many of these firms have started forming alliances with major asset managers to prepare for a shift in retail capital. If implemented, the order could reshape the financial landscape by giving average Americans exposure to asset classes once reserved for institutions and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. However, critics caution that such investments often carry higher fees and are harder to value, making consumer protections and oversight critical. Still, the Trump administration sees this as a long-overdue update to a retirement system built for a different era.

Prices jumped past $123,000 this week. Now, new figures show that fresh money is flowing into the market again. That‚Äôs a sharp change after months of muted retail interest. Related Reading: Avalanche Shatters Record With 20M Transactions‚ÄîIs Real-World Use Finally Here? Fresh Capital Flooding In According to on‚Äëchain data from Glassnode, first‚Äëtime buyers picked up an extra 140,000‚ÄØBTC over the past two weeks. Their holdings climbed from 4.77‚ÄØmillion to nearly 5 million BTC‚Äîa 2.86% rise. That influx of fresh coins helped push Bitcoin past its latest high. It also shows that new investors are gaining confidence in the world‚Äôs biggest cryptocurrency. Over the past two weeks, the supply held by first-time $BTC buyers rose by +2.86%, climbing from 4.77M to 4.91M #BTC. Fresh capital continues to enter the market, supporting the latest price breakout. pic.twitter.com/W95HSAMaHI ‚Äî glassnode (@glassnode) July 17, 2025 Short‚ÄëTerm Holders Hit A New Cost Base Newer players aren‚Äôt the only ones getting active. Based on reports, entities that bought Bitcoin within the last six months now sit on a cost basis above $100,000 for the first time. They‚Äôve held on through price swings and have not yet sold at a loss. That suggests many expect the rally to continue. At the same time, holding on tight could create pressure if prices dip below their average buy‚Äëin point. Dip Buyers Act Fast Glassnode‚Äôs cost‚Äëbasis heatmap revealed that buyers moved quickly when Bitcoin dipped below $116,000 earlier this week. About 196,600‚ÄØBTC changed hands between $116,000 and $118,000. That buying spree added over $23 million in value near what looks like a local top. It‚Äôs a sign of strong resolve from those backing the market at lower levels. Altcoin Chat Outpaces Bitcoin Searches While whales and newer buyers are busy, the crowd on Google seems less thrilled. Search activity for ‚ÄúBitcoin‚Äù ticked up modestly in the last fortnight, but it‚Äôs well below the highs seen when BTC first broke $100,000 this year. At the same time, data from Santiment indicate chatter has shifted toward altcoins. With Ethereum grabbing the spotlight, many retail investors appear more excited by tokens promising bigger short‚Äëterm moves.

Riding this momentum, Bittensor (TAO) is gaining traction as experts forecast a sharp climb toward $779 by 2025, powered by its AI-based model. BONK is also heating up, with strong trading activity and record-setting launchpad revenue placing it back in the spotlight. At the same time, BlockDAG has launched a NO VESTING PASS that unlocks 100% of purchased coins at launch, only 8 days remain.This comes with a discounted price of $0.0016 and has already pushed BlockDAG past the $340.5 million funding mark. Early batches have seen 2,660% returns, positioning BDAG as a top crypto coin to buy now. Bittensor Price Prediction: $779 Forecast as AI Demand Rises Bittensor (TAO) is in the spotlight again, especially after attracting $17.5 million in backing from major firms since June 2025. The current price is near $437, but analysts predict it could climb to $779 in 2025 and possibly soar to $5,915 by 2030. This outlook stems from TAO‚Äôs innovative model, where daily rewards go directly to subnet builders creating AI applications inside its system. As AI adoption grows, Bittensor‚Äôs real-world use cases keep expanding. While there are still some risks from regulatory issues or market volatility, many believe the project has room to grow. Its AI-linked structure gives it staying power, with continued attention from crypto followers focused on long-term growth. BONK Price Forecast: $507M Activity Pushes New Targets BONK has been on an upward trend, gaining nearly 20% in the past week and trading around $0.000027. Market watchers are closely monitoring its rise as BONK‚Äôs launchpad posted $7.97 million in revenue in just one week, more than all other Solana launchpads combined. Its open interest has now topped $507 million, showing growing momentum and rising trader confidence. Looking ahead, analysts believe $0.000034 is the next resistance level. Technical indicators such as RSI and MACD remain bullish, though the overbought reading may signal a small correction before another move upward. Still, BONK‚Äôs volume and community backing make it one of the more active memecoins right now. BlockDAG‚Äôs Limited-time NO VESTING PASS Deal Adds Urgency to $340.5M Surge As Bitcoin reaches new highs, BlockDAG‚Äôs move to introduce a 10-day NO VESTING PASS is hitting the market at just the right moment. This unique offer lets buyers unlock 100% of the BDAG coins they purchase during this short window. While bonus coins remain locked, all regular purchases are fully accessible at launch, no delays, no partial unlocks. That‚Äôs a major shift in a space where most launches include long lock-up periods. This clear structure is helping BlockDAG attract attention fast. It has already raised over $340.5 million in presale and sold 23.9 billion coins. Buyers in earlier batches have seen gains of up to 2,660%, measured against the current Batch 29 price of $0.0276. Now, with BDAG priced at just $0.0016 until August 11, there‚Äôs a final shot to secure a steep discount before the price rises to the official $0.05 launch rate. That difference could mean a possible 3,025% return if targets are met. This short window, paired with full access, is rare in the crypto space. As interest builds and more coins get locked in daily, BlockDAG is shaping up to be a must-watch project. For anyone tracking the top crypto coins to buy now, BDAG is emerging as a serious contender. Summing It Up The crypto market is showing real movement again. Bittensor (TAO) is riding the AI wave with projections hitting $779, while BONK is gaining fast thanks to strong launchpad returns and a $507 million open interest. But it‚Äôs BlockDAG that‚Äôs creating the biggest shake-up. The 10-day NO VESTING PASS, the $0.0016 entry point, and its $340.5 million milestone make it hard to ignore. With 23.9 billion coins already sold and full access guaranteed at launch, the project offers a rare edge. If the question is which crypto coins to buy now, TAO, BONK, and BlockDAG each bring a powerful angle, but BDAG‚Äôs offer makes it the most immediate play.

On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $3,630 level. The next key resistance is near the $3,650 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,720 level. A clear move above the $3,720 resistance might send the price toward the $3,800 resistance. An upside break above the $3,800 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,880 resistance zone or even $4,000 in the near term. Are Downsides Limited In ETH?

A popular analyst who recently predicted the price surge said this is just the beginning. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView XRP‚Äôs all-time high is somewhat a controversial topic within the community, as different exchanges and data aggregators provide contrasting numbers. However, on most exchanges we could check, XRP blasted past the previous peak, which, according to CoinGecko, was set at $3.4. Data from CG now shows that the new record is at over $3.6, something that Coinbase, Binance, and Bitstamp concur. The XRP Army is also enjoying the moment, with big celebrations on X with multiple ‚ÄúI told you sos‚Äù and further massive price predictions. The market capitalization has also set a new record, somewhat expectedly, at beyond $210 billion. Ali Martinez, who indicated last week when XRP struggled at $2.2 that the asset is about to rip and most traders will miss it, also weighed in on the matter. The analyst with roughly $140,000 followers on X praised the move and outlined a certain metric that suggests further gains are around the corner. Previously, he noted that if XRP manages to close above $3 and break its all-time high, it could shoot up to $4.8. $XRP just hit a new all-time high and it‚Äôs just getting started! https://t.co/oPBcTCx4hV ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) July 17, 2025 The post XRP Skyrockets to New All-Time High and Analysts Believe It‚Äôs Just Getting Started appeared first on CryptoPotato .",Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Ripple (XRP) Price,EN,0,0,XRP|EXCHANGE|TRADING|BNB|BTC,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-07-18 03:23:21

The bill is set to bring clear rules for digital assets and will now head to Donald Trump for final approval. XRP price has officially broken past its previous all-time high of $3.40, hitting a new peak at $3.65 after a 20% rise. Now that XRP has broken above $3.40, a stronger rally could follow, with price targets at $3.80, $4.33, and even $4.72 in the coming weeks. On the downside, any rejection could pull XRP back toward the $2.90‚Äì$3.00 support zone. However, as long as XRP holds above this level, the bullish trend remains intact.

Why XRP Is Running Hard Liquidity Surge: Crypto markets have seen over $500B in capital return over the past two weeks, pushing Bitcoin to $123K and Ethereum to $3.4K. Lawsuit Settled: The Ripple vs. SEC case is largely behind us, with both sides having agreed to terms. ETF Speculation: Hopes for a U.S.-approved XRP ETF are growing, with odds over 85% by year-end. Institutional Buying: Big money is moving in‚Äîadoption of Ripple‚Äôs technology is increasing behind the scenes. Retail Buying Spree: Small investors are piling in, accelerating gains further with classic bull cycle behavior. Short-Term Outlook With XRP already at $3.62, a push to $5 by the end of July is no longer far-fetched. However, some profit-taking could cool the rally briefly, especially if XRP hits $3.80 .",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,XRP|TRADING|MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-18 03:39:48

Currently trading at $117,847, the asset has recorded nearly a 10% gain over the past week. The dip from peak levels, approximately a 4.1% decline, has not dampened broader investor sentiment, with several on-chain indicators suggesting renewed buying interest and reduced selling pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Retail Demand Rebounds ‚Äì $0‚Äì$10K Transfer Volume Turns Positive Bitcoin Whale Withdrawals Decline, While Stablecoins Flow In In a recent analysis posted to CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform, analyst Amr Taha shared insights pointing to a strategic change in behavior among key Bitcoin holders and investors. The report, titled ‚ÄúStablecoin Flood and Whale Retreat: Binance Moves Foreshadow Risk-On Sentiment‚Äù, outlined significant trends in whale activity and stablecoin flows that may support continued bullish momentum in the near term. Taha‚Äôs research highlighted a steep reduction in whale-level Bitcoin deposits on Binance. Over the past 30 days, these deposits have dropped from $6.75 billion to $4.5 billion, a $2.25 billion decline. Historically, large deposits from whales to centralized exchanges often signal an intention to sell, so the recent drop may imply a reduction in immediate sell-side pressure. This could stabilize Bitcoin‚Äôs price in the short term, especially if whales continue to hold or move assets to cold storage instead of preparing them for sale. At the same time, stablecoin flows have increased dramatically across major exchanges. On July 16, Binance and HTX saw combined stablecoin inflows exceeding $1.7 billion. Taha interpreted this as an indication that large entities, possibly institutions or whales, are preparing to accumulate digital assets. Large stablecoin deposits often precede significant buying activity, suggesting that the market could be gearing up for another leg higher, particularly if paired with reduced sell-side movements. Macroeconomic Developments and Miner Sentiment Add Context This on-chain activity is unfolding amid broader economic and political developments. Taha‚Äôs report also pointed to speculation around President Donald Trump‚Äôs comments during a private meeting, in which he reportedly considered replacing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Though later denied, the remark sparked reactions in traditional markets, including a weaker dollar and rising bond yields. These shifts signaled a rotation into risk assets, potentially benefiting crypto markets as investors reallocate capital in anticipation of a more accommodative monetary stance. Related Reading: This Bitcoin Thesis ‚ÄòWill Retire Your Bloodline,‚Äô Says Expert Separately, CryptoQuant analyst Arab Chain analyzed Bitcoin‚Äôs miner profitability using the Puell Multiple indicator. The data shows that while miners are currently making solid profits, the level has not reached historical peaks seen during prior market tops. In the 2017 and 2021 cycles, extreme miner profitability (indicated by Puell readings exceeding 2.0‚Äì3.0) often preceded sharp price corrections. At current levels, Arab Chain believes the market is not in a euphoric state, reducing the likelihood of imminent volatility due to miner-driven selloffs.

The company eyes a 6,000 BTC allocation and 1% of the total supply to become a major corporate Bitcoin holder. ‚ÄúFlywheel‚Äù strategy includes BTC accumulation, synthetic mining, and DeFi-linked revenue generation. Canadian Firm Plans Major Bitcoin Purchase Matador Technologies, a public company based in Canada, says it plans to grow its Bitcoin holdings to 6,000 BTC by 2027. The firm has also set a near-term goal of owning 1,000 BTC by 2026. The announcement marks a shift in pace for its crypto strategy. $MATA Board just green-lit our long-term #Bitcoin treasury strategy! 1,000 BTC by 2026‚ÄÉ|‚ÄÉ6,000 BTC by 2027 Goal: own ~1 % of Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply Current stash ‚âà 77.4 BTC BTC-denominated products ‚Üí more BTC on the balance sheet Matador Technologies ‚Äî shaping‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Matador Technologies (@buymatador) July 16, 2025 At present, Matador holds 77.4 BTC, which is worth roughly $9 million at today‚Äôs prices. Its long-term goal is to hold 1% of Bitcoin‚Äôs total supply. If reached, this would place the company among the top 20 corporate Bitcoin holders worldwide. CEO Deven Soni said the company is built around Bitcoin. ‚ÄúOur business is structured around Bitcoin as a core asset,‚Äù he stated. New Filing Supports Treasury Growth To support its plans, Matador filed a CA$900 million shelf prospectus on July 14. The filing will let the company raise funds over the next 25 months. Capital may come from equity offerings, convertible deals, asset sales, Bitcoin-backed loans, or new partnerships. Earlier this month, Matador received final approval from the TSX Venture Exchange to operate as a hybrid ‚Äútechnology/investment issuer.‚Äù This change gives the company more room to develop a Bitcoin-focused strategy while still working on blockchain-related projects. Strategy Focused on BTC Accumulation The company has described its approach as a ‚Äúcompounding flywheel‚Äù strategy. It includes growing its Bitcoin holdings, increasing BTC-per-share value, and using market volatility and synthetic mining to build yield. The plan also includes creating BTC-based revenue streams and working with DeFi and crypto infrastructure firms. Mark Moss, the company‚Äôs chief visionary officer, said the approach is aimed at long-term strength. ‚ÄúOur future plans to accumulate Bitcoin are designed to establish long-term stability on our balance sheet while reducing exposure to inflationary risk,‚Äù he said. Matador‚Äôs plans come during a rise in corporate Bitcoin ownership. Public and private companies now hold an estimated 1.15 million BTC. That total is around 6% of the current supply. Meanwhile, Strategy continues to lead with the largest BTC treasury, now worth more than $73 billion. Despite the announcement, Matador‚Äôs stock fell 4.65%, per Google Finance . Still, its shares remain up 37% since the beginning of the year.

In a market where volatility reigns supreme, meme tokens continue to flip narratives overnight. Some spike. Some fizzle. But the ones with real structure and community roots are quietly setting up for something much bigger. Over the last 24 hours, Brett saw a sharp 16.98% jump, reaching $0.06386 amid bullish trading. Popcat, another breakout meme contender, climbed 15.78% to settle at $0.4250 as investors cheered on strong support levels and a rise in volume. Amid this momentum, Troller Cat is carving out its own viral moment, without relying on short-term pumps. With over $350,000 raised, 1581.2% ROI already achieved, and a 15% price hike due within days, Troller Cat is fast becoming the best crypto to explode in 2025. Troller Cat ($TCAT): Viral Lore Meets Strategic Expansion Troller Cat is more than just a meme‚Äîit‚Äôs a storytelling ecosystem wrapped in a 26-stage presale. Each stage reflects an iconic troll moment in history, and Stage 13, known as ‚ÄúThe Friday Phenomenon,‚Äù embodies the transformation of ridicule into unstoppable virality. At the current Troller Cat presale price of $0.00008406, the coin has attracted over 1,300 holders and raised over $350,000 in presale funding alone. With a projected launch price of $0.0005309, anyone joining at Stage 13 stands to gain over 531.57% from today‚Äôs price. If a user invests $35,000 now, they could receive nearly 416 million $TCAT‚Äîpotentially worth $221,593 at launch. That doesn‚Äôt include staking rewards or referral bonuses, making the upside even greater for early participants. What really sets Troller Cat apart are its future plans and layered roadmap. Post-launch, Troller Cat will deploy its full Play-to-Earn Game Center, where ad revenue funds monthly token buybacks and burns. Future phases include NFT integration, governance voting for holders, and even cross-chain expansion. The roadmap ends with a tongue-in-cheek Phase 6: interstellar trolling. But behind the memes is a very real strategy aimed at long-term ecosystem value. This is what makes Troller Cat more than just a meme‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement engineered for growth. With phases mapped out to 2026 and beyond, it‚Äôs earning a spot as the best crypto to explode in 2025 by combining humor with robust infrastructure. Liquidity Lock and Transparency Trust is key in meme coin territory, and Troller Cat nails it on both fronts. Its liquidity will be locked for two full years upon launch, ensuring there‚Äôs no room for manipulation or sudden withdrawals. This lock gives holders confidence that their investment is backed by a stable pool with real protections in place. Transparency also takes center stage. Troller Cat offers a referral dashboard, real-time presale data, and transparent documentation on its audit and team verification processes. With a meme coin space often filled with red flags, $TCAT‚Äôs approach to clarity and safety gives it a serious edge for long-term believers. Brett ($BRETT): Riding a 17% Daily Pump With Eyes on Utility Brett is having a strong 24-hour run, up 16.98% to hit $0.06386. The momentum comes amid renewed interest from its growing community and speculation about upcoming ecosystem updates. Trading volume has spiked, suggesting that new participants are joining, while existing holders double down on the recent strength. The coin is gaining attention for its simplicity and branding, drawing on viral Twitter exposure and a growing list of meme partnerships. Unlike many other meme coins that disappear after an initial spike, Brett‚Äôs team appears committed to building utility around the brand, including tools and governance elements. Still, Brett‚Äôs biggest asset remains its community. On-chain engagement has been climbing, and if the momentum holds, the coin could break into the top meme coin rankings. The challenge ahead lies in maintaining utility updates to match the hype‚Äîotherwise, short-term traders could start taking profit fast. Popcat ($POPCAT): Clawing Toward Resistance With a 15% Spike Popcat has proven once again that it can move fast. In the last 24 hours, it surged 15.78% to hit $0.4250, thanks to a clean bounce off support and an uptick in volume. The Solana-based meme token continues to benefit from fast transaction speeds and low gas costs, which has helped draw in a steady stream of short-term traders. Technically, Popcat is approaching a resistance level around $0.44. If it breaks through, the path to $0.50 could open quickly. Analysts credit the recent spike to both increased volume and steady Twitter engagement. Unlike more volatile meme coins, Popcat has built a decent floor and continues to trend upward despite broader market chop. Still, Popcat‚Äôs future hinges on delivering something beyond the meme. With a loyal fanbase and consistent support, its next breakout may depend on more than just community hype. But for now, it‚Äôs showing signs of continued upward momentum‚Äîjust not yet a threat to ecosystem giants. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, Troller Cat stands tall as the best crypto to explode in 2025. While Brett pumped 17% and Popcat rose over 15% in the last 24 hours, neither combines narrative, utility, transparency, and long-term ecosystem vision like $TCAT. With Stage 13 ending soon and a 15% price hike imminent, now is the time to secure your spot. A $35,000 investment could yield over $220,000 by launch. Plus, with Troller Cat‚Äôs referral rewards, burning system, and future roadmap phases, this is more than a meme‚Äîit‚Äôs a blueprint for market domination. Join the presale. Unlock your referral link. Watch the Game Center go live. And ride with the coin that trolls its way to the top.

48453668,https://cryptonews.com/?p=384172,1752813533,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/48453668.jpeg,XRP Hits All Time High Above $3.60 as Major Crypto Bills Clear House,https://cryptonews.com/news/xrp-price-all-time-high-crypto-bills-clear-house/,"XRP surged past a historic milestone on Friday, trading above $3.60 for the first time, after a wave of bullish developments reshaped the regulatory and market landscape for the Ripple-linked asset. The token peaked at $3.64, up nearly 68% over the past month, according to market data, as investors responded to a flurry of major catalysts. Chief among them was three key crypto bills passing in the US House of Representatives, including the long-awaited GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act, which aim to bring legal clarity to digital assets. XRP Gets Institutional Boost With ETF Debut Adding fuel to the rally, ProShares is set to launch the first XRP futures ETF in the US on the same day. As a result, this move opens the door for broader institutional participation in the XRP market, which until now has been largely out of reach for many traditional investors. Further, the momentum has attracted heavyweight interest. Eleven major asset managers, including Franklin Templeton, Grayscale, 21Shares and Bitwise, have already filed applications linked to XRP investment products. Together, these filings signal growing confidence in the asset‚Äôs long-term potential. 2023 XRP Court Win Could Soon Be Final On the regulatory front, traders are watching closely for a possible breakthrough . Market chatter suggests the US SEC may soon drop its appeal in the high-profile Ripple case . If that happens, it would cement a 2023 court ruling that found XRP sales to retail investors do not constitute securities offerings under US law. Prediction markets seem to agree. For instance, Polymarket now assigns an 88% probability that a spot XRP ETF will be approved by Dec. 2025. In the near term, traders are closely watching two key dates: July 21 and July 25. On these days, leveraged ETF proposals could be finalized. If that happens, it may trigger broader adoption of XRP-based ETFs. XRP Open Interest Soars 25% to $4.6B in 24 Hours Meanwhile, derivatives market activity has surged. Coinalyze data shows XRP open interest jumped 25% in the past 24 hours, reaching $4.6b. Nearly all of that is concentrated in perpetual contracts. Notably, Binance and Bybit dominate the market, holding $1.8b and $1.6b in open interest, respectively. Additionally, CoinGlass data reinforces the trend. In the past 24 hours, XRP liquidations reached $88.54m. This figure is higher than Bitcoin‚Äôs $79.67m and second only to Ethereum‚Äôs $206.65m. Notably, the liquidations were heavily skewed toward short positions. This suggests many traders were caught off guard by the sudden price jump. Overall, the crypto market saw widespread liquidations. More than 153,000 traders were wiped out in a single day. In total, $577m in positions were lost. XRP played a major role in driving this volatility. The rally‚Äôs strength appears to be gaining solid support. Rising institutional interest and whale accumulation are driving momentum. As a result, analysts now view a breakout toward $4 as a realistic short-term target. XRP‚Äôs rise marks a sharp turnaround for the token. For much of the past three years, it was weighed down by regulatory uncertainty. Now, things have changed. With fresh legislative clarity, ETF momentum and strong market support, XRP seems to be entering a new era of legitimacy.

Expectations currently are that the Ethereum price rally will trigger the next altcoin season and possibly lead to a push toward new all-time highs for ETH. One analyst in particular has compared this breakout to what was seen back in May 2025, something that could mean that higher levels are in store for the altcoin. Ethereum Is Mirroring Its Move From May May 2025 has remained one of the most bullish for the Ethereum price so far this year, rallying by more than 40% in a 30-day period. The price had gone from a low of around $1,770 to a high of $2,650 before retracing. But the most important thing was the trend and how the price moved before finally reaching its high. There was an initial surge, then some sideways movement, before the final upsurge to $2,600, and then the eventual top. Related Reading: Bitcoin Dominance Just Got Rejected From TSDT Resistance That Triggered Last Altcoin Season ‚Äî Details According to crypto analyst CryptosBatman on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), the Ethereum price is once again mirroring this price movement that led to its 40% surge.¬†The post highlights the fact that¬†Ethereum has already seen an initial breakout and has begun to move sideways.¬†However, this sideways move is not expected to last long and is actually part of the overall move. As the crypto analyst explained, the same triangle pattern that formed in May 2025 is now forming after the Ethereum price crossed the $3,000 range. Hence, the sideways movement is expected as investors take profit. Once the sideways accumulation is done and the triangle pattern is broken, then Ethereum is expected to begin rallying once again. The next target from here is above $3,600. Factors Driving The ETH Bullish Momentum Other than the fact that the Ethereum price has formed a similar triangle pattern to what was seen back in May, there are also notable developments in terms of accumulation that are also driving the price. For one, Spot Ethereum ETF inflows have continued to ramp up. Related Reading: XRP Becomes Top 3 Crypto After ProShares ETF Approval, Can It Flip ETH? Data from the Farside website shows that Ethereum ETFs have recorded positive net flows for almost two weeks straight now. The likes of BlackRock and Fidelity are leading the charge with tens of thousands of ETH being bought up daily. Ethereum treasury companies are now the rave of the moment as the likes of SharpLink and BitMine begin accumulating hundreds of millions of dollars in ETH. This rise in institutional adoption has become one of the major pushes for Ethereum as investors clamor for new highs.

How High Can the ETH Price Go?,https://coinpedia.org/news/why-ethereum-is-going-up-how-high-can-the-eth-price-go/,"The post Why Ethereum is Going Up? How High Can the ETH Price Go? appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Ethereum has skyrocketed over 70% since July 1, adding $150 billion to its market cap. This historic rally was driven by a massive short squeeze, institutional buying from BlackRock and Trump‚Äôs financial group, and upcoming U.S. regulatory reforms. With a $9 trillion retirement market on the horizon, Ethereum‚Äôs bullish momentum may just be getting started. Why Did Ethereum Surge 70% in July 2025? Ethereum is making crypto history with one of the largest short squeezes ever recorded. Since July 1, ETH has gained over 70%, recovering from a period of extreme bearish sentiment and liquidating billions in short positions. The rally was sparked when net short exposure on Ethereum hit record highs, 25% higher than the February 2025 peak, triggering a wave of forced liquidations as ETH began to rise. According to The Kobeissi Letter, a further 10% ETH price increase could result in another $1 billion in short liquidations, pushing prices even higher. Who‚Äôs Buying Ethereum? Trump and BlackRock Lead the Pack The timing of major institutional purchases suggests the smart money moved first. World Liberty Financial , linked to President Trump, bought $5 million worth of ETH just a day before Kobeissi‚Äôs post went viral. BlackRock‚Äôs Ethereum ETF has been accumulating ETH for 29 out of the past 30 days‚Äîwell ahead of the retail crowd. These actions indicate that institutional players may have anticipated the short squeeze before it fully unfolded. What Does This Mean for Bitcoin and Other Altcoins? While Ethereum stole the spotlight, Bitcoin quietly reclaimed the $120,000 level, recovering nearly $900 billion in market cap since April. XRP is also seeing bullish momentum , reflecting a broader capital rotation into altcoins. ‚ÄúEthereum could hit $15,000 to $20,000 in this cycle,‚Äù says Colin Talks Crypto . Could a $9 Trillion Retirement Market Push ETH Even Higher? The most explosive catalyst might still be ahead. President Trump is expected to sign an executive order allowing 401(k) retirement plans, worth $8.7 trillion, to invest in cryptocurrencies. If passed, this could unlock more than double the capital of the current global crypto market. This would mark the first time regulated retirement funds could directly allocate to crypto assets like Ethereum and Bitcoin. What Role Are U.S. Crypto Laws Playing in This Rally? Ethereum‚Äôs rally is not just technical‚Äîit‚Äôs political and structural. In July, the U.S. House passed : The Clarity Act ‚Äì Defines digital asset classifications The Genius Act ‚Äì Regulates stablecoins The Anti-CBDC Act ‚Äì Limits the Federal Reserve‚Äôs digital currency authority With bipartisan support now behind these bills, the U.S. crypto market is entering a more mature and regulated phase, creating confidence for long-term institutional involvement. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Breaking: Ripple‚Äôs XRP Hits New ATH Following Successful Crypto Week , How High Can Ethereum Go in 2025? Ethereum previously peaked at $4,800 in 2021. If Colin Talks Crypto‚Äôs forecast of $15,000‚Äì$20,000 holds, ETH could 3x to 4x from its prior all-time high. With bullish technicals, growing ETF demand, favorable regulations, and massive capital inflows expected, Ethereum could outpace Bitcoin‚Äôs rally in the coming months . Is This Just the Beginning for Ethereum? Yes, Ethereum‚Äôs breakout isn‚Äôt just a squeeze. It signals a larger shift in crypto‚Äôs evolution: from retail-driven hype to institution-led growth, backed by regulation and massive capital readiness. With crypto now entering the retirement market conversation, Ethereum‚Äôs path to $15,000 no longer seems like a moonshot; it may be a matter of time. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump is expected to sign the GENIUS Act and may also issue an executive order allowing 401(k) retirement plans to invest in cryptocurrencies and other alternative assets. In addition to this, Trump recently nominated Eric Tung, a lawyer with extensive crypto industry ties, to the influential Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. House Passes Three Crypto Bills The US House of Representatives passed three key pieces of cryptocurrency legislation after delays caused by Republican debates over central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). In a session that was held Thursday, lawmakers approved the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act with a 294-134 vote, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act with a 308-122 vote, and the Anti-CBDC Surveillance State Act by a narrower margin of 219-210. Voting in the CLARITY Act (Source: US House of Representatives ) The passage of these bills is a massive legislative milestone in the US digital asset landscape. Almost 80 Democrats voted in favor of the CLARITY Act, while more than 100 supported the GENIUS Act. The support from both parties for two of the three bills suggests that there is growing bipartisan momentum for crypto regulation, though the Anti-CBDC legislation is still deeply divisive. Republicans strongly rallied behind the legislative package as part of their self-declared ‚Äúcrypto week.‚Äù However, the legislative process was delayed on Wednesday as some Republicans demanded a clearer stance against the development of a US CBDC. Industry stakeholders mostly welcomed the House‚Äôs approval of the bills. Summer Mersinger, former commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and current CEO of the Blockchain Association, praised the Anti-CBDC measure as a defense of individual financial freedom and market competition. Despite this optimism, the opposition was also quite vocal. Representative Maxine Waters of California condemned the bills during a press conference she branded as ‚Äúanti-crypto corruption week,‚Äù and warned that the proposed legislation could weaken federal financial safeguards and open the door to systemic risks similar to the 2008 financial crisis. Truth Social post from President Donald Trump President Trump is reportedly ready to sign the GENIUS Act by Friday, assuming it remains unchanged after passing the Senate in June. Meanwhile, the CLARITY and Anti-CBDC bills will proceed to the Senate for further consideration. This means that they could be amended before returning to the House or reaching the president‚Äôs desk. Trump Eyes Crypto in 401(k) Plans President Donald Trump is also reportedly preparing to sign an executive order that could open the door for American 401(k) retirement plans to invest in alternative assets beyond traditional stocks and bonds, including cryptocurrencies. According to a report by the Financial Times , the executive order may be signed as early as this week and would direct regulatory agencies in Washington to explore how 401(k) plans could incorporate digital assets, metals, and funds related to infrastructure projects, corporate acquisitions, and private lending. President Donald Trump The initiative could cause a big shift in the investment options available to American workers saving for retirement. While the Financial Times cited anonymous sources familiar with the matter, White House spokesman Kush Desai warned that no decision should be considered final unless confirmed by President Trump himself. This potential move follows the US Labor Department‚Äôs May decision to rescind restrictions imposed during the Biden administration that limited the inclusion of cryptocurrencies in 401(k) plans. The regulatory rollback may also pave the way for more institutional involvement in digital assets. Meanwhile, private firms have already started moving in this direction. In April, financial services giant Fidelity, which manages $5.9 trillion in assets, launched a new crypto-enabled retirement account for American investors. The broader 401(k) market consisted of over 715,000 plans that held $8.9 trillion in assets in September of 2024. Fidelity crypto offering At the state level, North Carolina lawmakers introduced legislation in March that would allow up to 5% of various public retirement funds to be allocated to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Internationally, pension funds in the United Kingdom and Japan also explored crypto allocations. In November, UK-based Cartwright reported that an undisclosed pension scheme committed 3% of its assets to Bitcoin, while Japan‚Äôs Government Pension Investment Fund was weighing the digital asset as a diversification strategy. If enacted, Trump‚Äôs executive order could be a historic development in the intersection of digital assets and retirement savings. Trump Picks Crypto Ally for Appeals Court Eric Tung, a corporate lawyer who is well known for representing major players in the crypto space, has been nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as a judge on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The nomination was sent to the Senate on Tuesday, but Tung‚Äôs potential appointment drew a lot of attention due to his deep ties to the digital asset industry. If confirmed, he will preside over appeals from nine western states, including California, a hub for tech and crypto companies. Trump nominations Tung is currently a partner at law firm Jones Day, and previously represented high-profile crypto clients like the Blockchain Association in its legal challenge against the US Treasury Department over sanctions on Tornado Cash. He also served as counsel in a case against BitMEX‚Äôs parent company and defended stablecoin issuers by arguing that some sales do not constitute securities offerings. Watchdog group Accountable.US criticized the nomination, and warned that Tung‚Äôs record suggests he may support deregulating the crypto sector as part of the Trump administration‚Äôs pro-crypto agenda. The group specifically mentioned his history of challenging regulatory oversight of smart contracts and stablecoins.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|MARKET|ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-07-18 05:30:00

This unexpected milestone has sparked curiosity about other tokens in the Solana ecosystem that may follow suit. Discover which three Solana tokens are poised for significant growth and why they stand out in the crowded crypto market. Bonk Surge: Short-Term Rally, Steady Long-Term Outlook Bonk saw a 96.59% increase over the past month, with a 27.01% spike in just one week, pushing its price quickly higher. Over the past six months, the coin experienced a slight decline of 0.79%, showing that its recent surge is more a product of short-term market activity than a long-term trend shift. The price movements reveal a burst of buyer interest that has driven recent gains, contrasting with a relatively flat performance in the broader timeline. At present, Bonk trades between key levels that set the stage for tactical moves. The nearest support is positioned at $0.00001 while immediate resistance comes in around $0.00002, with a further hurdle at $0.00003. These levels suggest that bulls are in control on a short-term basis as reflected by notable weekly gains. However, the high RSI reading of 76.97 introduces caution, implying that the asset might be overbought. Traders might consider buying on dips near the $0.00001 support and taking profits near the $0.00002 resistance. Jupiter Coin: Resilience Amid Shifting Market Trends Over the past month, JUP moved into positive territory with a gain of nearly 18%, showing signs of recovery. However, it suffered a drop of over 40% in the last six months, indicating a struggle to maintain upward momentum. The shifts in performance reflect periods of volatility, highlighting the asset's challenges. The weekly rebound of just over 11% suggests potential for short-term gains, even amid a longer-term decline. Data indicates that the coin has been testing its price boundaries repeatedly during this period, resulting in a mix of setbacks and brief recoveries as market dynamics shifted. Current price action centers around a tight range between approximately $0.34 and $0.57, with the nearest support level at $0.21 and resistance at $0.69. Bulls may push the price higher if they break through the $0.69 barrier, while bears could test the support at $0.21 if selling pressure rises. The lack of a clear trend prompts traders to watch for breakout or breakdown moves from these levels. A trading strategy might involve buying on dips within the range and placing tight stops near support to limit risk while aiming for the $0.69 level. Despite signals slightly favoring buyers, caution prevails as traders await confirmation of a broader trend before committing to larger positions. Raydium Battles a Rally Amid Long-Term Bearish Pressure Raydium surged by nearly 35% over the past month, showing strong short-term recovery despite a challenging six-month period marked by more than a 50% decline. The one-month gain of 34.91% and a weekly jump close to 29% highlight transient investor optimism that helped push prices higher temporarily. Historical trends reveal that while Raydium can experience rapid upward moves in shorter terms, its longer-term performance over six months has been notably subdued, indicating that market pressures have outweighed sustained momentum during prolonged correction phases. Raydium currently trades within a range of $1.70 to $2.59, with key technical levels in focus. Immediate resistance is near $3.05, while a second ceiling at $3.94 may challenge further bullish advances. Support is established around $1.27, with deeper interest near $0.39. The Awesome Oscillator at 0.54 and the Momentum Indicator at 0.68 indicate moderate positive momentum, although the RSI reading of nearly 67 suggests caution. Bulls control the market for now, generating a rally in momentum, but no clear trend has firmly taken shape. Trading ideas include buying retracements near $1.27 support and targeting profits close to $3.05 resistance while managing risks with stop losses. Conclusion Pump.fun's impressive valuation shows strong market interest even with its token's recent drop. BONK , with its unique appeal, JUP as an infrastructure enhancer, and RAY providing liquidity solutions, could see significant growth within the Solana ecosystem. Their roles and potential mean they are well-placed for future gains. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

33767162,[object Object],1752816630,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,France Wants to Mine Bitcoin With Wasted Energy‚ÄîHere‚Äôs What That Means,https://bitcoinist.com/france-wants-to-mine-bitcoin-with-wasted-energy/,"French lawmakers have introduced a proposal to launch a five-year trial program that would allow the use of surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining. The initiative, formally submitted on July 11, is intended to optimize the country‚Äôs energy grid while exploring new avenues for economic development through the crypto asset ecosystem. The proposal emphasizes that mining operations could play a constructive role in stabilizing the national grid, especially during periods of energy overproduction. Turning Surplus Power into Economic Utility At the core of the bill is a focus on utilizing controllable and carbon-free electricity from nuclear and renewable sources. Lawmakers argue that surplus energy often goes to waste due to inadequate storage infrastructure and existing regulations that require nuclear plants to reduce output when renewable generation peaks. They contend that repurposing this unused energy for Bitcoin mining could help reduce financial losses for producers while minimizing stress on nuclear facilities caused by frequent modulation of power output. The bill outlines plans to create data centers close to power generation sites, such as decommissioned factories or industrial zones, to efficiently harness surplus electricity for mining operations. Lawmakers suggest this decentralized infrastructure would help keep mining demand localized and manageable, avoiding strain on the broader energy grid. They further claim that such facilities would not compete with existing energy consumption demands, but rather act as a flexible energy sink that activates only when there is excess supply. Citing data from the Association for the Development of Digital Assets (ADAN), the proposal estimates that allocating just one gigawatt of power to mining could generate between $100 million and $150 million annually. This revenue would provide energy producers with a new monetization path and potentially position France as a competitive player in the broader crypto sector. Moreover, the bill notes that the waste heat generated by mining hardware could be captured through heat exchangers and redirected for practical use, such as heating residential buildings, greenhouses, or supporting industrial processes. Energy Efficiency Modeled on Nordic Examples The proposal highlights that similar energy-reuse strategies are already being implemented in countries like Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, where mining operations use geothermal or hydroelectric power and redirect excess heat to local infrastructure. French lawmakers argue that replicating such models could align with the nation‚Äôs environmental and economic goals. By localizing mining near energy hubs and repurposing waste heat, France could maximize energy efficiency while supporting technological advancement . While the proposal has not yet been passed into law, it reflects a broader shift in how countries are beginning to view Bitcoin mining, not merely as a high-energy process, but as a potential tool for grid management and economic development. If adopted, France‚Äôs pilot could provide a data-driven case study for how surplus energy might be integrated into blockchain infrastructure without disrupting conventional power needs . Further developments are expected as the proposal moves through the legislative process.

Ranked just behind Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, PEPE‚Äôs explosive rise‚Äîboasting gains of over +116290941.86% from its all-time low‚Äîhas captured investor attention globally.

However, this will require an increase in trading volume and support from the broader market. On the other hand, if the bulls fail to maintain the $0.00001100 level, a retest of $0.00000760 or even $0.00000610 is likely. Falling below $0.00000610 would put PEPE at risk of reaching new lows. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Pepecoin Price Forecast July 2025 0.00000610 0.00001050 0.00001688 PEPE Price Analysis (H1) Pepe Coin is showing potential for growth in 2025. Initially seen as a joke, meme coins like PEPE, Dogecoin, and SHIB have found their place in the market, driven by social media excitement. In the first half of 2025, the PEPE price dropped by 65%. Despite a rally in Q2 that peaked at $0.00001610 by mid-May, the overall trend remained down, and it fell 40% from the mid-May peak to the third week in June. However, Bitcoin and other altcoins rallied due to a ceasefire in the ongoing conflict, triggering a rally that even benefited PEPE. From H1‚Äôs final week to the third week of July, PEPE crypto‚Äôs technical chart shows signs of life. Currently, PEPE price has broken out from the Q2 decline, forming a falling wedge pattern. As a result, in the past 25 days, it has surged over 60%. PEPE Price Targets July 2025 Interestingly, the price action in Q2 shows a stark similarity with Elliott Wave theory. After five impulsive waves and three corrective waves, the recent wave 3 has ended. This indicates that the current ongoing rise could be the start of a new series of fresh impulsive waves, and we are experiencing Wave 1 in July. In the short term, the 20-day and 50-day EMA bands are flipped, and in the most recent week, PEPE has successfully flipped the 200-day EMA. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reached 71, indicating some cooling down before regaining strength in continuing Wave 1. On the other hand, if the bulls fail to maintain above the 200-day EMA, then a retest of the $0.00001100 level is likely, with a possibility of declining to $0.00000760. Month Potential Low ($) Potential Average ($) Potential High ($) Pepecoin Price Forecast July 2025 0.00000610 0.00001050 0.00001688 PEPE Price Projection 2025 (H2) The price action suggests that PEPE‚Äôs first impulse wave could possibly encounter a hurdle near $0.00001600. After a small Wave 2 correction, a much stronger Wave 3 rally could be on the horizon. This means that Q3 could see another series of new impulsive waves, from 1 to 5, as selling pressure appears to have diminished. If all the momentum continues throughout Q3 and Q4, it could potentially push PEPE to $0.00002837 by late 2025. However, for a bullish outlook, breaking the Fibonacci 0.5 level is still very essential. Failing to surpass $0.00001688 could trigger a trend reversal and lead to a price pullback.

Data this week showed U.S. retail sales climbed more than analysts had forecast in June, while new claims for unemployment benefits fell to their lowest level in three months. Those results reinforced the belief that the Fed can hold rates steady for longer before considering a reduction, according to a Reuters report. As of 00:38‚ÄØGMT, the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six leading currencies, was unchanged at 98.456. That kept it on course for a 0.64% gain this week, following a 0.91% jump in the previous seven days. On Thursday, the index even peaked at 98.951, its highest level since June 23. A recent report showed that U.S. consumer prices rose in June by the most in five months. This suggests that recent tariff hikes may be starting to push up inflation. Investors now expect slightly less easing, just under 0.5% in rate cuts by December, down from about 0.5% forecast earlier this week. Despite this week‚Äôs strength, the dollar remains 9.3% below its level at the beginning of the year. In March and April, fears of unpredictable U.S. trade policies led to a big sell‚Äëoff that hurt confidence in U.S. assets, including the dollar, Treasury yields, and stocks. Markets reacted to Trump firing Powell rumor Concerns about the U.S. budget have shaken investors. Lawmakers‚Äô large spending and tax plans have raised doubts about fiscal stability. At the same time, President Trump has repeatedly scolded Fed Chair Powell for not cutting rates faster. Analysts at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia warned that the dollar ‚Äúremains vulnerable to the downside if concerns about U.S. policymaking further undermine investor confidence in USD assets.‚Äù They pointed to this week‚Äôs sudden dip, triggered by rumors that Trump planned to fire Powell, as proof of that risk. Bitcoin hovered just below $120,000 after briefly hitting $123,153.22, and the market got a boost when Congress passed rules for dollar‚Äëpegged stablecoins. Dollar strong against yen while euro and pound made modest moves Meanwhile Japan‚Äôs yen weakened as Sunday‚Äôs upper‚Äëhouse elections approached, with polls showing the ruling party could lose its majority. A change in power could make monetary policy less predictable. It can slow down tariff talks with Washington. On foreign exchange markets, the dollar was trading around ¬•148.60, not far from Wednesday‚Äôs three‚Äëand‚Äëa‚Äëhalf‚Äëmonth peak of ¬•149.19. Japan‚Äôs lead trade envoy, Ryosei Akazawa, held talks on Thursday with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in an eleventh‚Äëhour bid to block a 25% tariff scheduled to apply once August‚ÄØ1 has passed. Elsewhere, the euro climbed 0.25% to $1.1626, bouncing back from its Thursday trough near $1.1556, though it still finished the week 0.59% lower. The British pound rose about 0.13% to $1.344, cutting its weekly loss to 0.41%.

The Indonesian crypto market is experiencing significant growth in transaction volume and user numbers, driven by a tech-savvy population and increasing interest in digital assets. Indonesia has legalized the trading of crypto but has reasonably regulated it with strict regulations. Table of contents Crypto regulations in Indonesia 2025 What is the Indonesian Government Saying About Crypto? Crypto License in Indonesia 2025 Crypto Tax in Indonesia 2025 Crypto Adoption in Indonesia Conclusion FAQs Crypto regulations in Indonesia 2025 July 2025 ‚Äì OJK Regulations The new OJK regulations, after transferring regulatory oversight from Bappebti to OJK, have set a deadline of July 2025 for crypto companies to fully comply. The regulations include licensing, governance, data protection, and consumer protection, which all crypto-related companies must follow. April 10, 2025 ‚Äì Deadline of Crypto Asset List Under Article 132 of POJK 27/2024, crypto exchanges must finalize their crypto list within the deadline. Trading organizers are prohibited from trading any crypto asset that was not included in their crypto listings. March 2025- OJK issued licenses for Digital Financial Assets (DFA) Traders OJK issued 19 DFA traders‚Äô licenses , and they were processing 11 other licenses at the time. This initiative was part of a broader framework that includes a license for DFA exchanges, clearing, guarantee, settlement institutions, and custodians for digital assets under OJK supervision. January 10, 2025- Government Regulation No. 49 of 2024 and OJK Regulation No. 27 of 2024 The supervision of crypto assets officially transitioned from the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti) to the Financial Services Authority (OJK). The new OJK regulation outlines minimum paid-up capital and equity requirements and includes detailed guidelines for onboarding customers. It also implemented a new tax regime for crypto as it became subject to both income tax and value-added tax. The OJK also implemented Digital Financial Asset Trading, Including Crypto Assets, which outlines licensing, transition of applications, updates the crypto asset whitelist, and the adjustment period. January 1-6, 2025- Crypto Tax (PMK No. 131/2024 and PMK No. 81/2024) The value-added tax (VAT) was increased to 0.11% of transaction value, and for unregistered exchange platforms, the VAT rate doubles to 0.22% . While crypto tax is very low in the country, it is not totally free as it subjects mining to tax up to 0.1%. What is the Indonesian Government Saying About Crypto? In 2025, the Indonesian government is actively working on enhancing consumer protection facilities to foster a more secure and stable environment for crypto trading. The implementation of OJK supervision aims to help the public better understand the opportunities and risks involved in crypto investments. The initiative also indicates a move towards treating them as financial instruments alongside traditional assets. This integration aims to bring greater clarity and stability to the crypto market. With stricter regulation under OJK, indonesia is aiming to boost transparency and fraud prevention, which could help mitigate risks in the crypto space. The OJK also introduced a regulatory sandbox, a testing environment for new financial technologies, including crypto. With this measure, the Indonesian government is aiming to embrace innovation. Crypto License in Indonesia 2025 OJK reclassified crypto assets as digital financial assets under new terms to regulate licensing. It also changed Bappebti‚Äôs authority to issue the list of crypto assets that could be traded on crypto platforms and gave the authority to the DFA. DFA issued its first list in April 2025, which contained 1,444 crypto assets, marking an increase from Bappebti‚Äôs listing of 851. Licensing: Companies previously licensed under Bappebti will automatically be recognized as licensed Digital Financial Asset Trading Providers. However, a reapplication is necessary after which the DFA traders can provide the whitelist of crypto assets. A grace period till July 2025 is given to fully comply with new requirements. Requirement for DFA Traders: The minimum paid-up capital of 100 billion rupiah (US$6 million) and minimum equity of 50 billion rupiah (US$3 million) requirement is retained from Bappebti‚Äôs authority, while four new key changes are introduced under OJK: Fit and Proper Test for board members, shareholders, and controlling shareholders is introduced. DFA traders are to store transaction data and financial records for at least ten consecutive years. Requirements for data protection measures are to be followed. Stricter restrictions for DFA members‚Äì cannot hold positions as members of the BOC or BOD. If the regulations are abused, OJK has the authority to revoke the licenses.

The country was one of the largest markets for crypto as the popularity of Bitcoin and Ethereum grew among the citizens. As the demand for crypto grew, China tightened its rules and regulations to maintain stability and protection. As of 2025, China has implemented one significant law that changed the entire landscape of crypto. Table of contents Crypto Regulations in China Crypto Tax in China Crypto License in China Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Conclusion FAQs Crypto Regulations in China July 10, 2025 ‚Äì Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission Debate on Digital Assets The agencies held a meeting to discuss strategic responses to stablecoins and digital currencies. The rapid evolution of digital assets was discussed, and experts who joined the meeting indicated that it can result in softening China‚Äôs strict position on crypto. May 30, 2025- Comprehensive Ownership Ban The People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) issued a ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership. The crypto ban decree became effective from June 1, 2025, states the suspension of crypto transactions, asset seizure measures, enforcement, and penalties.

By implementing the recent ban on cryptocurrency, the Chinese government is reaffirming its commitment to centralizing financial control and promoting the use of its state-backed digital currency, the yuan . Its current focus is on: Outlawing private ownership of crypto Accelerating the adoption of central bank digital currency (CBDC) Mitigating financial risks related to crypto Reasserts its financial hegemony by banning decentralized crypto Crypto Tax in China As China implemented a ban on crypto trading, mining, and ownership, any crypto tax is irrelevant. It has ceased all crypto activity, while focusing on blockchain innovations with its digital yuan. The government is not focusing on crypto tax as long as the crypto ban stays. Crypto License in China China does not have any crypto license, as Beijing has expanded its crypto ban. Since no one will be able to hold crypto or other digital assets (except its own digital yuan), a license implementation is not necessary. Crypto Adoption in China 2025 Before China enforced the crypto ban in 2025, the adoption rate was fluctuating, and the market was unstable. Since Chinese crypto policies are too strict and have made the market sentiment rigid, it has influenced users to use VPNs to access foreign exchanges. This raised some concerns regarding crypto, and eventually, the government banned it. Conclusion When crypto was regulated in China, the government had a comprehensive anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-financial terrorism (CFT) framework. However, after its historical changes of banning private ownership of crypto, China is focusing on centralizing the political power and encouraging the country‚Äôs own digital currency. Despite the restrictions, use of crypto for illicit activity remains a concern for the Chinese government. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; text-align:left; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; width: 20px; margin: 0; display: inline-block; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

No, as of June 1, 2025, China has implemented a comprehensive ban on all crypto activities, including trading, mining, and individual ownership, making it illegal to hold or transact in crypto. Why did China ban cryptocurrency? China banned cryptocurrency to centralize financial control, accelerate the adoption of its state-backed digital yuan (CBDC), mitigate financial risks, and reassert its financial hegemony by outlawing decentralized crypto. How has crypto adoption been affected by China‚Äôs regulations? Before the 2025 ban, China‚Äôs strict policies led to fluctuating adoption and market instability, pushing users to access foreign exchanges via VPNs. The complete ban aims to eliminate private crypto use. Will China unban crypto in the future? It‚Äôs highly unlikely China will fully unban private crypto ownership in the near future. Their ban reinforces financial control and promotes the digital yuan, with no current signs of reversal for decentralized digital assets.",Cryptocurrency Regulation|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,ASIA|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BTC,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-07-18 05:52:13

What the Nigerian Government is Saying About Crypto? While ISA 2025 officially recognizes digital assets and cryptocurrencies as securities, replacing the 2007 law, bringing them under the Nigerian SEC, national banks still retain the ability to disagree and restrict transactions. By aligning the cryptocurrency framework with the SEC, Nigeria is aiming at: Innovation with Security: Nigeria is accelerating its innovation with fintech laws and crypto regulations, and NFTs, while also maintaining the protection measures for investors. Nigeria also focuses on talent development and blockchain development to increase innovation in the nation. Alignment with Global Standards: With the Companies and Allied Matters Act (2020), Nigeria is actively working to retain credibility in international markets. With new crypto and fintech laws, Nigeria is encouraging the use, adoption, and integration of blockchain technology across various sectors to enhance economic prosperity, efficiency, innovation, transparency, security, and trust.

This move has created a prime opportunity for investors to accumulate assets. With the second half of July approaching, key altcoins are poised for growth. Discover which digital currencies are expected to surge and make strategic investment choices. Ethereum Market Surge Amid Mixed Long-Term Trends Over the last month, Ethereum recorded a solid gain of 17.34%, but the past six months indicated a decline of 13.95%. A recent weekly growth of 16.85% shows a rebound, signaling renewed investor interest after a correction period. Price fluctuations have been characterized by significant volatility and shifting market sentiment. Current performance suggests a market that reacts to both short-term catalysts and longer-term adjustments, reflecting a mix of recovered momentum and residual downward pressure from previous trends. The trading range currently sits between $2110.94 and $2870.47, with bulls momentarily in control due to the impressive weekly and monthly gains. Key support levels are at $1735.29 and $975.76, while the nearest resistance is at $3254.35, with a second resistance at $4013.88. Indicators like the Relative Strength Index near 69 and positive readings on the Awesome Oscillator indicate upward pressure. Trading strategies might involve entering near lower support levels and planning exits around resistance markers. Traders should monitor breakout signs and momentum shifts to manage risk effectively. Solana Price Action: Mixed Past Trends, Bullish Levels, and Tactful Entries During the past month, Solana has shown promising gains with a 10.77% increase as traders began to see renewed interest and short-term momentum, evidenced by a recent 7.69% rise in just one week. Over the more extended six-month period, price performance was less robust, dropping 22.14%. Such fluctuations underline an asset that experiences significant volatility, with past price behavior marked by a balance of positive weekly moves and a longer-term downward pressure. The charts indicate a technical journey where rapid short-term gains contrast with broader declines, setting the stage for potential recovery or further correction under shifting market conditions. Current pricing rests in a range between $131 and $173.35, with notable support at $107.89 and resistance at $191.79. Bulls appear to be making inroads as indicated by the rise to 7.69% in the last week and reinforced by technical measures like a Relative Strength Index near 57. However, the lack of a clear trend demands cautious optimism. Levels beyond, such as second resistance at $233.74 and second support at $65.94, shape a trading corridor. Solid support zones could provide buying opportunities, while approaching resistance levels may trigger profit booking. A balanced trading approach, looking for entries around support and exits near resistance, seems prudent in capturing potential gains in the current market. ADA Market Update: Weekly Surge Amid Long-Term Pullback Cardano recorded a 25.52% gain over the past week and a 16.29% increase in the last month. The last six months showed a decline of 32.47%, pointing to a challenging long-term correction. Prices have moved within a range of $0.48 to $0.70, highlighting both quick rebounds and sustained pressure. These price shifts reflect mixed market sentiments and trading dynamics in both short and long terms. At present, ADA trades within the $0.48 to $0.70 range, with key support at $0.38 and resistance at $0.83. A second resistance exists at $1.05, while deeper support lies around $0.163. Technical indicators show an RSI at 68.96 and a moving average recommendation leaning positive. Bulls dominate the weekly outlook, though the six-month decline signals caution. Traders might consider entries near support levels and aim for exits at resistance zones, as the market currently shows short-term strength but an unclear long-term trend. Conclusion The recent sale of Bitcoin by an ancient whale has created a prime opportunity for investors. ETH , SOL , and ADA are poised to benefit from this shift. This period could see significant price increases for these coins as they attract more interest. ETH remains strong due to its versatile platform, SOL is noted for its fast transactions, and ADA is gaining attention with its continuous development. Savvy investors might find this an ideal moment to consider these options. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With the price currently hovering around $3,420, Ethereum has registered a daily gain of 7.7% and a weekly surge of more than 23%. The momentum follows a decisive breakout above the $3,000 level earlier this week, sparking renewed optimism across the derivatives and spot markets. The latest insights from the on-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant provide context for Ethereum‚Äôs price action, suggesting that activity on Binance is a major catalyst. Related Reading: Ethereum Could Shoot Above $4,000 This Week, Predicts Analyst Ethereum Short Liquidations Shift Market Dynamics CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost notes that the recent uptick coincides with a structural shift in the derivatives market, particularly around short liquidations. A deeper analysis of exchange flows and taker behavior further supports the case for sustained upward movement, with indicators suggesting that Ethereum may be positioning itself to revisit previous highs. According to Darkfost, Ethereum‚Äôs current rally follows a prolonged five-month correction phase that began in December 2024. During this period, the market experienced a flush of long positions, especially on Binance, contributing to what he describes as a necessary ‚Äúcleanup‚Äù in the derivatives space. This recalibration helped reset speculative positioning and laid the groundwork for the recovery observed since late April. Now, the pattern has reversed. ‚ÄúShort liquidations are now dominating on Binance,‚Äù Darkfost observed, emphasizing how forced exits of bearish positions are reinforcing Ethereum‚Äôs upward price momentum. Liquidation data shows multiple short squeezes in recent weeks, with volumes reaching $32 million and $35 million, respectively. This trend suggests that many traders are positioned counter to the prevailing market movement, adding fuel to the rally as they‚Äôre forced to close out positions. Darkfost also highlighted that, if this pace of short liquidations continues, Ethereum may be poised to test its all-time high. He added that ongoing inflows into spot Ethereum ETFs and increasing adoption by institutions viewing ETH as a long-term asset could further support this potential breakout. Taker Volume on Binance Hints at Bullish Continuation In a separate post, CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk pointed to taker-side activity on Binance as another critical signal. The ETH Taker Buy/Sell Ratio (7-day moving average) recently crossed the 1.00 threshold, signaling stronger buy-side pressure from market participants. This shift was accompanied by a spike in price volatility, which reached 261.5, mirroring Ethereum‚Äôs latest price surge beyond $3,434. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breaks Out: Smashes $3,400 Mark in Bullish Run Crazzyblockk noted that this pattern, rising buy-side taker volume aligned with surging volatility, has historically preceded extended price rallies. The divergence between taker long and short volumes further underlines dominant bullish sentiment. The analyst emphasized that tracking taker momentum on Binance may offer early signals for future market direction, as the Ethereum price appears highly responsive to activity on the platform.

Two heavyweights, Solana and Cardano, just flashed fresh buy signals that hint at a mid‚Äësummer rotation into ‚Äúhigh‚Äëgrowth crypto‚Äù plays. Yet the loudest chatter on X isn‚Äôt about Layer‚Äë1 breakouts; it‚Äôs about Remittix , a DeFi project many early movers see as the next big crypto launch thanks to its real‚Äëworld payment rails and live presale bonus. Here‚Äôs how the technical and fundamental picture stacks up for all three. Solana: Coiling for a Breakout A base near‚ÄØ$160 and rising on‚Äëchain volume have put Solana (SOL) back on radar for traders hunting the next 100x crypto. Chart watchers compare the current structure to Bitcoin‚Äôs coil before its spring squeeze, noting that a daily close above the twin moving‚Äëaverage cap around‚ÄØ$169 could ignite a run to the $190‚Äì$200 zone. Source: Tradingview The network continues to post the highest daily transactions of any major L1, proving that a low gas fee crypto can still dominate throughput even in choppy markets. If that breakout materializes, analysts eye the inverse head‚Äëand‚Äëshoulders target at‚ÄØ$219. Cardano: Regulatory Tailwinds in Waiting While SOL wrestles with resistance, Cardano (ADA) is catching speculative bids on the back of Washington‚Äôs proposed Clarity Act. Because more than 80‚ÄØ% of ADA is staked across thousands of pools, Cardano‚Äôs Ouroboros design ticks the ‚Äúsufficiently decentralized‚Äù box regulators crave. Should the bill pass, ADA could move from undervalued crypto project to regulatory darling, particularly for investors chasing yield through crypto staking. Source: Tradingview Why Remittix Is the Real Headliner Early‚Äëstage capital isn‚Äôt pouring into SOL or ADA right now, it‚Äôs flowing toward Remittix , a PayFi newcomer many are calling ‚ÄúXRP‚ÄØ2.0.‚Äù Reasons Remittix Is Gaining Traction: Cross‚ÄëBorder Utility: Direct crypto‚Äëto‚Äëbank transfers in 30+ countries Non‚ÄëCustodial & Private: No IP tracking; supports ETH, BTC, SOL, XRP with low gas fees Explosive Presale Stats: $16.3M+ raised so far in what reviewers label the best crypto presale‚ÄØ2025 Deflationary Tokenomics: Every transfer burns RTX, aligning scarcity with adoption Big Bonus Window: 50‚ÄØ% extra tokens still live for those who want to buy RTX token before listings. Analysts peg a 50x upside if Remittix captures even a sliver of the $19‚ÄØT remittance sector, an opportunity few other top crypto under‚ÄØ$1 can claim. Little wonder whales diversifying out of centralized exchanges have started flagging RTX as a new altcoin to watch in Q3. Exit Velocity: Charts vs. Cash Flow SOL and ADA both flash convincing buy signals: Solana on pure momentum, Cardano on potential legislative clarity. Yet the biggest buzz is swirling around Remittix , a PayFi rail that could convert meme‚Äëera enthusiasm into sustainable volume. For traders balancing technical setups with ‚Äúwho actually pays the bills,‚Äù RTX may offer the best blend of narrative and revenue among upcoming crypto projects.
