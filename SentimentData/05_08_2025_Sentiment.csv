It is unusual for such events to occur when the markets are booming, but it is sometimes inevitable. Toning Down for Sustainability One of the co-founders of the Ethereum staking protocol, Lido, Vasiliy Shapovalov, shared the unfortunate announcement on the social media platform X earlier today. Several people have already commented and offered to help those who have lost their jobs. ‚ÄúThis decision was about costs ‚Äî not performance,‚Äù he noted. The liquid staking smart contract was founded in 2020 by Shapovalov and two other entrepreneurs, marking the first-ever personnel cutback. The Lido DAO operates the protocol, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that provides staking infrastructure for multiple blockchain networks, most notably Ethereum. The DAO is quite secure, as it is regularly audited by third-party companies to detect and remove vulnerabilities.¬†Users who stake their ETH on the protocol receive stETH (Lido staked ETH) tokens, which represent the overall amount held and determine the size of the rewards from the incentive. The native currency, LDO, serves as a governance token for the DAO. Holders can participate in administration proposals and vote on key decisions such as board adjustments, integrations, and platform updates. There has been a recent change to the governance model, with Dual Governance being approved, which gives stETH holders the ability to oppose proposals by delaying them for up to 45 days, a pioneering move not seen in other similar protocols, adding additional security and decentralization to the organization. Dominating, At First Glance Shapovalov further stated in his post that: While it may seem counterintuitive amid a market upswing, the move reflects a deliberate commitment to sustainable growth, operational focus, and alignment with the priorities of LDO tokenholders. Indeed, if we examine key metrics for the protocol and native token, the sentiment leans more towards expansion than contraction. According to data collected at the time of printing from DefiLlama, Lido currently has no opposition in terms of the Total Value Locked (TVL), which exceeds $31 billion. To compare it with the protocol in second place, Binance Staked ETH has $10.4 billion in TVL. They also lead in Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), holding 8.9 million in staked Ether, compared to the 2.9 million held by the Binance protocol. Additionally, Lido has over 60% of the market share of these tokens. Source: DefiLlama The governance token, LDO, has also increased by almost 30% over the past month, according to current data from CoinMarketCap.

Three weeks ago today it posted a new all-time high of $122,838‚Äîa move that reignited bullish momentum among traders. Although it has since dipped by approximately 6.9%, market sentiment remains strongly positive, with many analysts forecasting another breakout, as BTC continues to hover near its peak price territory. This impressive upswing has also invigorated a range of major altcoins and some of the very best meme coins . Over the last 12 months, cryptocurrencies like XRP, TRON, Solana, Sui Network, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have recorded fresh all-time highs‚Äîdemonstrating strong investor confidence in the market‚Äôs broader uptrend. There are also sign that the US government is going to make good on its word to regulate crypto. At the end of last week, the SEC announced ‚Äú Project Crypto ‚Äú, a series of initiatives to update American securities laws to hopefully give the industry the clarity it has long called for. As anticipation builds for a prolonged bull run, attention is increasingly shifting toward digital assets that may be poised to surpass their previous records. Ripple (XRP): Cross-Border Payment Crypto Experiences Impressive Price Movement in 2025 Ripple‚Äôs XRP reached a new pinnacle on July 18, hitting $3.65, surpassing its previous 2018 high of $3.40. Although it‚Äôs now trading at about $2.99, this represents a 17.7% retreat from its ATH and includes a sprightly 5% gain in the last 24 hours, indicating a healthy phase of recovery. Thanks to its rapid transaction speeds, negligible fees, and efficient global remittance capabilities without intermediaries, XRP has become a preferred option for institutional use. It has even garnered support from entities like the United Nations, bolstering its legitimacy. A pivotal moment came in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that XRP‚Äôs retail sales did not qualify as securities, clearing the regulatory fog and paving the way for renewed investor confidence by 2025. XRP has risen by over 449% in the last 365 days, greatly outperforming Bitcoin‚Äôs 88% gain during the same timeframe. Technically, momentum could be picking back up as XRP‚Äôs relative strength index (RSI) is uptrending at 56, indicating more buying momentum than selling. This could indicate that bulls are angling to go a leg higher, following a 35% surge in the last 30 days compared to meagre BTC‚Äôs 6% gain. XRP diverged drastically from its 30-day moving average over the month of July as a result of heavy bull activity. The two lines have now converged and any downside risk seems contained, with firm support located just south of the previous resistance level of $3. A bullish flag pattern that formed between late 2024 and April 2025 could be pointing toward a possible push to $4 in the coming months. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Dogecoin Rival With Crypto Utility Targets Potential 3X to 9X Price Surge Launched in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has cemented its position as the second-largest meme coin, boasting a market capitalization above $7.2 billion. SHIB has risen slightly overnight, adding 0.4% in the last 24 hours as the rest of the market, echoing a 0.9% rise across the crypto market, which now holds a combined value of $3.8 trillion. The token is currently trading near $0.00001225. Technical chart patterns suggest further upside may be ahead. Over the past year, SHIB has displayed two strong bullish indicators: a descending wedge from November to March, and a bullish flag developing since mid-May. If SHIB can break through its main resistance at $0.000022 amid broader market optimism, analysts believe it could rally toward $0.00003 before summer concludes. In a full-scale bull environment, estimates project a price range of $0.00006 to $0.00009 by year-end. Unlike most meme tokens, SHIB offers real-world utility via Shibarium, its Layer-2 solution built on Ethereum that enhances scalability, lowers fees, and improves transaction speed. Pepe ($PEPE): Viral Meme Coin and Famous Crypto Frog Anticipates Price Rebound Pepe ($PEPE) launched in April 2023 and quickly ascended into the top three meme coins by market cap, powered by the cultural appeal of the internet-famous frog from Matt Furie‚Äôs artwork. Its remarkable ascent has inspired numerous imitators, though none have matched its momentum. With a market cap of around $4.4 billion and even a brief cameo as Elon Musk‚Äôs profile picture on X, PEPE has solidified itself as a prominent meme asset. Currently priced around $0.00001045, it has gained 7% in the last 30 days but remains 63% below its late-2024 all-time high of $0.00002803. A falling wedge pattern suggests a bullish reversal could be forming. The RSI has cooled to 38, hinting that recent selling pressure may be easing as the asset descends towards the oversold level of 30. This could set the stage for a rapid rebound by the weekend, providing a compelling buy-in level for bullish investors. Overall, the meme coin sector‚Äôs total crypto market cap has risen 5.6% overnight to stand at $70.8 billion, and although Pepe remains virtually unchanged in the last 24 hours, a sustained meme coin rebound will drive bulls to take up Pepe positions. With favorable macroeconomic indicators and potential for renewed market momentum, Pepe supporters are eyeing a potential late-summer price surge. Snorter ($SNORT): Explosive Presale Interest in New Meme Coin with Built-In Trading Tools For those seeking early exposure to the next major meme coin breakout, Snorter ($SNORT) offers a compelling combination of humor and functionality. Built on the Solana blockchain, the project merges meme culture with practical crypto trading tools via a built-in bot.

In a statement from August 4, Coinbase‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, argued that the BSA, designed for a paper-based financial system, is outdated for today‚Äôs digital economy. ZKPs are a tech-forward solution for modern finance that can prove compliance, reduce transmission and exposure risk for sensitive consumer data, and streamline transaction monitoring. It‚Äôs past time for Congress to modernize the BSA. 2/3 ‚Äî paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) August 4, 2025 Why does Coinbase want to modernize the BSA? As far as Paul Grewal is concerned, the BSA is an obvious area that needs improvement. He described it as a critical tool for ‚Äúfinding bad actors and combating illicit finance.‚Äù Grewal highlighted how the BSA‚Äôs Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements force the collection of vast amounts of personal data, which are typically stored in centralized databases that are vulnerable to cyberattacks and frequently go unused, creating unnecessary privacy risks. Despite Congress‚Äô recent activity, the BSA is still hampered by decades-old requirements that reflect paper-based compliance protocols and a financial system that sees funds moved over days rather than seconds. Grewal noted that policymakers are now pointing to the speed at which money can move as an issue, but he says it would be better for them to focus on using technology for solutions rather than demonizing it for creating problems. As a solution, he proposed ZKPs, which would allow users to verify specific details‚Äîlike identity or age‚Äîwithout disclosing sensitive underlying data, a move that could enhance not just privacy but also security. ZKPs make this possible by using cryptography to enable one party (called the prover) to convince another party (called the verifier) that a certain statement is true without revealing any information beyond what is strictly necessary for that verification. For example, ZKPs could allow an individual to open an account with Coinbase by proving they are not on sanctions lists or are not a minor, and they would not have to share extensive personal information in the process. Now that the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts have been signed, Grewal has called upon Congress to pivot to BSA reforms. He also says the Treasury needs to establish a public-private partnership to identify areas where existing processes built on the antiquated systems need to be adjusted to function properly in a ZKP-based system. Coinbase is enduring a recent stock decline Grewal‚Äôs statement comes days after shares of Coinbase fell 12% in pre-market trading Friday (August 1), a knee-jerk reaction to the crypto exchange missing Wall Street expectations for second-quarter revenue. The company‚Äôs revenue grew by 3.3% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, but it fell short of the $1.59 billion estimate and was down from $2 billion in the previous quarter. Spot trading volumes also declined globally and in the US, with average market capitalization roughly flat during the period, but net income surged to US$1.43 billion, thanks mostly to unrealized gains on its crypto holdings and investments. Analysts believe this dip is a great opportunity for investors with a longer investment horizon who still want to get in on the company‚Äôs stock as Coinbase remains well-positioned for future growth, despite the performance.

Joining the growing list of cryptocurrency companies that are launching public listings, Figure Technology has submitted a draft registration statement with the U.S. SEC and expects to make its debut in 2025. Figure Technology joins the crypto IPO wave Figure Technology Solutions, Inc. (‚ÄúFTS‚Äù), a company founded and led by SoFi‚Äôs co-founder and former CEO Mike Cagney, confirmed today that it has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement on Form‚ÄØS‚Äë1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, starting the process for a proposed initial public offering of equity securities expected this year. Figure is the latest crypto-related entrant into public markets. Other companies, such as BitGo, Circle , Grayscale and Gemini, have also filed or launched IPO activity. The crypto sector is currently valued at roughly $4T and the industry‚Äôs growth is supported by the favorable regulatory environment in the U.S. Figure was founded in 2018 by Mike‚ÄØCagney and builds blockchain‚Äëbased financial infrastructure and offers mortgage lending via home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), along with operating a cryptocurrency exchange and securitization platform. The company has experienced notable growth, increasing its lending volume by roughly 50‚ÄØ% in a recent year to over $5B in HELOC originations, supported by partnerships with Credit Karma, Guaranteed Rate and others The market is primed for crypto expansion The confidential S‚Äë1 submission benefits from an SEC policy update effective in March 2025, which increased the scope of eligibility for nonpublic draft registration review, allowing companies to begin the process earlier and without initial underwriter disclosures. Many crypto firms paused their IPO plans earlier in 2025 due to market turbulence at the time. That slump cooled enthusiasm for public listings, but according to executive commentary, some companies may be waiting for volatility to recede before launching listings. FTS decided to launch its listing despite the volatility to gain a first‚Äëmover advantage and a legitimization effect from going public in the sector. The company filed its S‚Äë1 in March 2024, but has not yet set an IPO date. Instead, the company has continued business restructuring and leadership adjustments in preparation for a public debut. In late 2024, it reorganized its lending entity, Figure Lending LLC, under the umbrella of the Figure Technology Solutions brand, and appointed Ronald Chillemi as Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary to support governance and regulatory readiness. The company is reportedly working with major investment banks, including Goldman‚ÄØSachs, JPMorgan and Jefferies to position the IPO, and has reportedly held discussions with institutional investors like BlackRock, SoftBank and Tiger Global.

Kaspa‚Äôs November Trend, Render‚Äôs Chart Break, and Cold Wallet‚Äôs Low-Priced Start",https://thecoinrise.com/which-crypto-looks-promising-kaspas-november-trend-renders-chart-break-and-cold-wallets-low-priced-start/,"As traders keep an eye on breakout patterns and seasonal shifts, three crypto names are getting attention for different reasons. Kaspa (KAS) stands out in price analysis with November showing stronger results than July and August. This trend has held up based on data, not just guesses. Over at Render (RNDR), the price has broken a downtrend line, opening the door to $7 if the current support level stays strong. Then there‚Äôs Cold Wallet ($CWT), which doesn‚Äôt rely on market timing. It‚Äôs working on real-world use. The referral program already pays in USDT, and the presale sits at $0.00942 in Stage 16. While KAS and RNDR may benefit from chart setups, Cold Wallet rewards actions from the start. New Numbers Point to Kaspa Strength in November Kaspa‚Äôs latest data from the Kaspa Report says November is its best month for gains, beating July and August. That changes the old belief that summer is the key season for strong moves. The numbers show November is more reliable, while summer has mixed results. Right now, Kaspa trades close to $0.10, after moving above a key zone between $0.08 and $0.09. Even though trading volume has slowed down, chart signals are steady. Some signs point to growing interest from bigger players. If history repeats, November could be a good time to watch this coin. With its current price around $0.10 and data showing strong returns in late fall, Kaspa might be one to follow more closely. Render Token Breakout Could Lead to 70% Rise Render (RNDR) has formed a pattern that often points to a breakout. It moved past a long-term downtrend line that had capped its price since late 2024. The price pulled back to retest that line, which is usually a strong sign in technical trading. Now RNDR trades near $4.13. If it stays above the old trendline, the next target is $7, a gain of about 71%. Even with the small dip after the breakout, momentum still looks solid. Staying above that trend could bring in more buyers. For traders who like setups with clear entry points and targets, RNDR‚Äôs chart might be worth watching. If you follow these kinds of patterns, this could be one of the clearer setups before a larger move. How Cold Wallet Makes Referrals Simple and Pays in USDT Most crypto referral systems make big claims but rarely follow through. Cold Wallet is taking a different approach. Right now, users can earn real USDT from referrals. There are no waitlists or tricky steps. You invite someone, they make a swap, and both of you get paid in USDT. It‚Äôs a direct process. The crypto presale 2025 adds another layer. Cold Wallet gives out bonus tokens too: 10% to the person who refers, and 5% to the person who joins. These bonuses aren‚Äôt delayed or tied to hidden terms. Every payout is on-chain, clear, and pulled from a set referral rewards pool. This setup is not a future promise. It‚Äôs already running. While other platforms use complicated multi-level plans, Cold Wallet keeps things simple. Real swaps lead to real rewards. Users are earning even before the token officially goes live. With Stage 16 pricing at just $0.00942, the barrier to entry stays low. If you‚Äôre looking to help grow a crypto network and get rewarded right away, Cold Wallet could be worth watching as 2025 gets closer. Cold Wallet Could Be the One to Watch in 2025 Kaspa (KAS) has a seasonal price pattern that could work again, and Render (RNDR) has a strong setup on the charts. But both depend on market behavior. Cold Wallet stands apart by giving rewards without needing perfect timing. Users can earn 10% in referral bonuses, get instant USDT payouts, and use a product that‚Äôs already live before its token launch. With Stage 16 pricing still at $0.00942, and no hidden rules or long lockups, Cold Wallet is rewarding early users now. For those chasing growth in 2025, the real value might not come from waiting on charts or news. It could come from using a platform that‚Äôs already delivering results. Cold Wallet might fit that shift toward real use and steady rewards.

Whether it‚Äôs NEAR Protocol‚Äôs modular growth, Binance Coin‚Äôs post-ATH recovery, or TRON‚Äôs DeFi dominance, competition is intense among the top contenders. However, one project is standing out for its perfect timing, robust tools, and explosive upside: BlockDAG. Currently in its final presale phase, BlockDAG offers early access at just $0.0016, with a confirmed listing price of $0.05 later this year, signaling a projected 3025% return. When considering the best crypto to buy now, BlockDAG (BDAG) checks all the boxes: fundamentals, timing, and an unmatched entry point. In this analysis, we compare BDAG to NEAR, BNB, and TRON to determine which token deserves your attention as we approach the final stretch of 2025‚Äôs third quarter. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Last Chance for Massive Upside Before GLOBAL LAUNCH Release BlockDAG is emerging as a serious contender in the Layer 1 race, with over $361 million raised and more than 24.7 billion BDAG coins sold before its mainnet even launches. With the current price locked at $0.0016 and a confirmed listing at $0.05 later this year, early buyers are looking at a potential 3025% return. That kind of growth is what makes BlockDAG one of the best cryptos to buy now for those eager to catch the next breakout. What sets BlockDAG apart isn‚Äôt just the impressive presale numbers but the live product. Users can already engage with a Demo Trading Platform where they can buy BDAG in real time and simulate selling. Additionally, a 10 BTC Auction Pool is underway, where every purchase grants an entry into a Bitcoin giveaway based on participation size. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11, the window for early access is closing fast. The X1 mobile miner app already has 2.5 million users, and BlockDAG‚Äôs hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work design promises real scalability and decentralization. For smart investors, this is the best crypto to buy now. 2. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Rebound Potential as Market Stabilizes NEAR Protocol is currently hovering around $2.75 after a 3% drop and a technical breakdown that ended a multi-day consolidation near $2.84. Although short-term support at $2.73 was breached, traders are now watching for a reclaim of $2.83 to confirm a potential double-bottom reversal pattern. On-chain metrics remain strong, with over 98% of NEAR‚Äôs supply in circulation and an impressive network throughput of ~12,000 transactions per second. Despite the dip, NEAR continues to attract developer interest, thanks to its modular architecture and AI-ready design. If resistance flips back into support and market sentiment improves, a rebound could be on the cards. For those seeking long-term infrastructure plays with technical efficiency, NEAR remains one of the best crypto to buy now. 3. Binance Coin (BNB): Bullish Indicators After Profit-Taking Binance Coin (BNB) is bouncing back after a brief pullback following its all-time high of $855 in late July. This correction came after strong institutional inflows, including $610 million in capital and a $1 billion token burn. BNB briefly traded above $830 before retracing to the $752‚Äì$767 range. Despite the short-term dip, bullish technical indicators remain, with BNB‚Äôs market cap surpassing $106 billion and daily volumes exceeding $2.9 billion. With support between $800 and $809 holding strong, analysts are keeping an eye on a potential breakout toward the $880 to $1,000 range. Given its regulatory stability and continued institutional momentum, BNB is a solid pick for investors looking for long-term growth. For those seeking steady, blue-chip assets, BNB remains one of the best crypto to buy now. 4. TRON (TRX): Strong Ecosystem Growth Amid Market Pressures TRON (TRX) continues to show strength despite the broader market dip. The network now hosts over 2.8 million daily active users, and its DeFi total value locked has surged, driven by strong stablecoin demand. TRON‚Äôs founder, Justin Sun, has emphasized its leadership in high-throughput USDT transfers, outperforming other Layer 1 blockchains in both speed and volume. TRON‚Äôs ecosystem is expanding with key updates improving governance and validator decentralization. This strong growth narrative positions TRON for a potential breakout back to its July highs. While TRX presents proven adoption and real-time utility, those seeking maximum upside with a low entry point may find newer projects like BlockDAG offer more immediate potential. However, for long-term investors, TRON remains one of the best crypto to buy now. Points to Remember With the market heating up again, the key question is: which token delivers the best mix of utility, timing, and upside? TRON leads with real-world usage, BNB stands strong with solid technicals and institutional support, and NEAR remains a strong player with its developer-driven infrastructure. But BlockDAG is making the most compelling case. With over $361 million raised, live trading tools already in place, and a listing price set to be 30x higher, BlockDAG offers rare pre-launch potential. For those looking for the best crypto to buy now, BlockDAG checks every box: timing, demand, and massive reward potential.

XRP MVRV Ratio Has Crossed Under Its 200-Day MA In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a crossover that has occurred in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of XRP. The ‚ÄúMVRV Ratio‚Äù refers to an on-chain indicator that tells us how the Market Cap of the asset compares against its Realized Cap. The Realized Cap is a capitalization model that calculates the cryptocurrency‚Äôs total value by assuming the ‚Äòreal‚Äô value of each token in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. This is different from the Market Cap, which takes the current spot price as the same one value for the entire supply. As the last transaction of any token is likely to denote the last point at which it changed hands, the price at its time could be considered as its current cost basis. Thus, the Realized Cap, which adds up this value for all coins, is essentially the sum of the capital that the investors have put into the asset. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Here? 6 Key Metrics Show Market Shift Since the MVRV Ratio compares the Market Cap, which can be thought of as the current value held by the investors, against this initial investment, it provides a measure of the profit-loss balance of the market. When the value of the indicator is greater than 1, it means the holders as a whole are sitting on some net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the cutoff implies the dominance of loss on the blockchain. Now, here is the chart for the XRP MVRV Ratio shared by the analyst that shows the trends in its daily value and 200-day moving average (MA) over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP MVRV Ratio has remained above the 1 mark (corresponding to 0% on the chart‚Äôs scale), suggesting the overall market has been in the green recently. There have been some fluctuations within this profitable region, however, like earlier in the year when the metric witnessed a drawdown during which it slipped below its 200-day MA. With the price surge in July, the indicator managed to recover back above the line, but after the latest decline, it has once again crossed below it. ‚ÄúThe MVRV ratio flashed a death cross for XRP, suggesting a steeper correction could be underway!‚Äù explains Martinez.

A wave of fresh capital is flowing into presale markets, where many believe the next 10x‚Äì25x coins will emerge before broader retail adoption kicks in. Recent market sentiment shows a growing appetite for high-risk, high-reward tokens‚Äîespecially after past success stories of popular memecoins like PEPE turned small investments into life-changing returns . This has sparked renewed attention on new entrants aiming to repeat that formula. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such project capturing investor attention early. The buzz around its presale is growing steadily as more traders look for high-potential investments before listings on major exchanges. Momentum continues to build around MAGACOIN FINANCE as presale allocations dwindle. The project has quickly established itself as a top contender in the current cycle, drawing comparisons to the early phases of meme coin giants. Latest analyst projections suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could yield up to 15,200% returns for early buyers ‚Äì turning even a modest $250 into nearly $38,000. With a growing community, fast sell-out rounds, and a strong narrative around utility and long-term development, many believe it‚Äôs one of the most promising altcoins in today‚Äôs presale market. Market Trends Driving the Hype Presales have historically been fertile ground for identifying undervalued coins before explosive rallies . In the current climate, investors are on the hunt for narrative-driven projects with strong branding and community support‚Äîtwo things MAGACOIN FINANCE has already shown in spades. The general altcoin landscape is also flashing signs of a potential shift, with Bitcoin dominance cooling and capital rotating toward smaller-cap assets. Early-stage tokens are beginning to outperform, suggesting that the appetite for presale speculation is back in full swing. Conclusion As crypto markets stir with new presale enthusiasm, the race is on to find the next standout performer. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly separating from the pack, with 15,200% upside potential making it one of the most talked-about opportunities among forward-looking traders.

The Peter Thiel-owned company confirmed that revenue grew 48% year-over-year to reach $1.004 billion, powered by major growth in both U.S. commercial and government deals. The company also raised its full-year guidance across all key metrics, citing continued demand for its AI software. Source: Palantir CEO Alex Karp said, ‚ÄúWe are guiding to the highest sequential quarterly revenue growth in our company‚Äôs history, representing 50% year-over-year growth. This was a phenomenal quarter. We continue to see the astonishing impact of AI leverage.‚Äù Revenue from the U.S. surged 68% compared to the same quarter last year, landing at $733 million. U.S. commercial deals pulled in $306 million, up 93%, while U.S. government contracts generated $426 million, which was 53% higher than last year. Palantir‚Äôs Rule of 40 score also hit 94% in the quarter. Palantir‚Äôs total contract value hit $2.27 billion, which is a 140% increase compared to the same time in 2024. U.S. commercial contracts made up $843 million of that total, surging 222% year-over-year. The company also reported that its remaining deal value from U.S. commercial accounts reached $2.79 billion, which is up 145% compared to last year and 20% higher than Q1. Customer count grew 43% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter, showing Palantir‚Äôs growing market footprint. The company reported GAAP income from operations of $269 million, with a margin of 27%, while adjusted operating income came in at $464 million with a 46% margin. Net income hit $327 million, which gives it a 33% margin, while adjusted net income was $404 million. Palantir also brought in $539 million in cash from operations and ended the quarter with $569 million in adjusted free cash flow. The company now holds $6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury securities. Earnings per share stood at $0.13 GAAP and $0.16 adjusted. Adjusted EBITDA hit $470 million, giving a 47% margin. Palantir raises full-year guidance as AI demand grows For the third quarter, Palantir expects revenue to fall between $1.083 billion and $1.087 billion, and adjusted income from operations to range between $493 million and $497 million. For the full year, revenue guidance has been raised to between $4.142 billion and $4.150 billion. Adjusted income from operations is now forecasted between $1.912 billion and $1.920 billion, and adjusted free cash flow is expected to come in between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion. In his shareholder letter , Alex said, ‚ÄúAll the value in the market is going to go to chips and what we call ontology.‚Äù He pointed to the rapid combination of language models, chip capacity, and Palantir‚Äôs software as the reason the company passed the $1 billion mark this quarter. He said this momentum came after years of investing in infrastructure and being dismissed by critics. ‚ÄúThe skeptics are admittedly fewer now, having been defanged and bent into a kind of submission,‚Äù he added. During the earnings call event, Alex told us that U.S. companies need to resist becoming bland compromises of global preferences. H e then warned against what he called a shallow acceptance of all opinions, referencing C.S. Lewis‚Äôs 1943 book The Abolition of Man and its warning about ‚Äúmen without chests.‚Äù ‚ÄúSuch men promise to shepherd us forward yet lack much substance,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey are little more than administrative caretakers.‚Äù Following the report and the earnings call, Palantir‚Äôs stock surged by more than 3% in extended trading, while stock futures reacted to its outstanding outperformance across major indexes.

The branch explained: ‚ÄúFraudsters pose as Central Bank staff, claiming to offer people access to digital ruble investment programs.

The speculation is backed by data showing striking historical symmetry across previous bull cycles. Now, crypto proponent JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie) has added his voice to the conversation with a new chart projecting another massive surge in the months ahead. In a recent post on X, he shared a chart showing previous cycles with massive altcoin rallies. His focus on XRP has reignited bullish sentiment in the community. THE UPCOMING BULL RUN WILL BE EPIC! #XRP pic.twitter.com/vu1Q0Okzkn ‚Äî JackTheRippler ¬©Ô∏è (@RippleXrpie) August 3, 2025 The Repeating Altcoin Cycle The chart in JackTheRippler‚Äôs post tracks altcoin total market capitalization over ten years. It highlights three pivotal dates: August 1, 2017, August 1, 2021, and now, August 1, 2025. The two previous cycles show remarkable returns of 120x and 150x, respectively, following each date. The projection now suggests a 175x return from the current market base by the next cycle peak. Analysts have predicted that the alt season is around the corner , and this timeline lines up with JackTheRippler‚Äôs analysis. This analysis relies on recurring four-year intervals, and the current cycle has just begun. The clear visual of compressed price action before previous expansions lends credibility to the proposed 2025 breakout window. Another analyst recently highlighted a bearish pattern on the Bitcoin Dominance chart and believes a drop below 65% could kickstart a massive altcoin rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Renewed Optimism for XRP Though the chart tracks the broader altcoin sector, JackTheRippler drew attention to XRP, stating that the asset will soon experience an epic bull run. XRP recently hit a new all-time high of $3.65 , and the community was excited for a continued climb throughout the rest of 2025. However, the market took a turn on August 1, with XRP falling below $3 . However, JackTheRippler‚Äôs analysis suggests the community does not need to worry, as August 1 was the date the new altcoin cycle began. XRP is currently trading at $3.07, and a 175% increase from here would send the asset to $8.44. One XRP supporter urged others to take the decline as a buying opportunity in anticipation of massive growth in Q4. This is the best time to accumulate tokens, and investors may not get another chance once the epic surge JackTheRippler predicted begins, and the altcoin market starts soaring.

It was the third-strongest month ever for these products, trailing only February and November 2024. Who owns Bitcoin? 1/ Bitcoin is mainly a US thing2/ India is the surprise number 23/ Europe is really not involved. pic.twitter.com/zhiZ21i7HQ ‚Äî Fred Krueger (@dotkrueger) August 3, 2025 Supply outside America is much smaller. India comes in second with 1 million BTC, or 5% of the supply, worth about $120 billion at the same price point. Europe follows at 900,000 BTC (4.6%), valued at $108 billion. China‚Äôs government holds roughly 194,000 BTC (1%), mostly from seizures, pegged at $23.3 billion. Together, Latin America and the rest of Asia each control about 400,000 BTC (2%), valued at $48 billion apiece. Africa and other regions combine for 300,000 BTC (1.5%). Corporate Giants Hold Big Stakes Reports have disclosed that public companies in the US are key players in the Bitcoin game. Strategy leads by a mile with 628,791 BTC on its books. Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) sits next with 50,000 BTC, while XXI Capital holds 43,514 BTC. Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company has 30,021 BTC, and Riot Platforms keeps 19,225 BTC. US President Donald Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. makes the list too, owning 18,430 BTC. That mix of companies spans from miners to financial services, showing how varied corporate interest has become. India And Europe Keep Growing Data shows India‚Äôs crypto surge continues despite a murky regulatory landscape. Most of the country‚Äôs holders are retail investors with small balances, but the sheer headcount places the country ahead of Europe. In Europe, a blend of retail and institutions drives adoption . Still, growth here has been steadier than in India‚Äôs near-100% compound annual rate (CAGR) from 2018 to 2023‚Äîversus about 8% for traditional payments. That difference highlights crypto‚Äôs unique pull among Indian users. Meanwhile, Bitbo‚Äôs recent chart also sheds light on national-level reserves . It shows over 200,000 BTC linked to the US and a similar figure for China. The UK ranks third with 61,000 BTC, Ukraine fourth at 46,000. Smaller players like Bhutan, El Salvador, and Finland hold between 5,000 and 10,000 BTC.

Related Reading: Polkadot Powers Up: Breakout Structure Signals A Bullish Week Ahead Following a brief pullback to around $0.37, buyers have stepped in, keeping the token above critical support zones. As of early August, XLM trades between $0.384 and $0.392, signaling a period of healthy consolidation rather than panic-driven selling. Technical analysis shows that XLM is approaching key resistance at $0.4007, with immediate support sitting at $0.376. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, while decreasing trading volume indicates that current moves are driven more by profit-taking than bearish sentiment.

Despite short-term volatility, analysts are optimistic about XLM‚Äôs prospects heading into Q4 2025. Projections suggest that if the current support levels hold and bullish momentum returns, the token could target $0.52 and eventually push toward $0.60 or beyond. Some bold forecasts even point to a 5x rally, potentially sending XLM as high as $1.50. A key driver behind this bullish outlook is increasing whale accumulation. On-chain data reveals a rise in wallet addresses holding over 10 million XLM, signaling strong confidence from long-term investors. Exchange inflows remain stable, further indicating that large holders are not rushing to exit positions. Institutional Interest and Long-Term Fundamentals Support XLM Institutional sentiment toward Stellar has improved significantly in 2025. Several asset managers have included XLM in their infrastructure-focused crypto portfolios, reflecting growing confidence in Stellar‚Äôs real-world utility. Key partnerships with companies like IBM, MoneyGram, and Franklin Templeton continue to bolster the network‚Äôs relevance in cross-border payments and CBDC development. Additionally, Stellar‚Äôs focus on fast, low-cost global transactions and the development of its smart contract platform, Soroban, support its position as a top-tier altcoin. If the price can hold current levels and gain momentum above $0.40, Stellar could be poised for another major leg up.

Both assets have shown resilience and strong community support, but recent developments in ADA‚Äôs ecosystem have fueled speculation that it could reclaim its all-time high and even target a $4 price tag. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains focused on scalability upgrades and growing institutional interest as it eyes the elusive $10,000 milestone. In the midst of this race, one fast-moving project gaining attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which many early investors now compare to Cardano‚Äôs early days. With strong momentum and community-driven growth, it‚Äôs already appearing on radar screens of those looking to catch the next big altcoin opportunity before major exchange listings. ADA Developments Spark $4 Price Target Speculation Cardano has seen a surge in on-chain activity, driven by new DeFi projects and upgrades to its smart contract capabilities. The Hydra scaling solution, which promises to increase throughput and lower fees, has sparked renewed interest from developers and users alike. According to analysts, if ADA can maintain this growth trajectory and break past the $1.50 resistance level, a long-term push toward $4 is within reach. Ethereum, on the other hand, continues to lead in total value locked and layer-2 adoption. However, its higher transaction fees and slower rollout of improvements have opened the door for ADA to potentially gain market share. Despite this, ETH still holds a dominant position and could be the first to hit five figures if institutional demand continues to grow. This New Altcoin‚Äôs Momentum Mirrors Early ADA Hype Crypto experts are beginning to draw strong parallels between MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs current adoption curve and Cardano‚Äôs early days. What‚Äôs getting attention is the rapid expansion of its user base and a growing list of utilities, from staking to NFT integrations. Community engagement is skyrocketing, and analysts highlight that this level of traction‚Äîbefore a centralized exchange debut‚Äîis rare. Several reports now suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver realistic 39x returns in the coming cycle for those who secure a position during the current presale window. Can ADA or ETH Win the Next Altcoin Race? Ethereum still enjoys the first-mover advantage and massive network effects, especially with its role in the booming layer-2 ecosystem. But Cardano‚Äôs focus on scalability, lower costs, and academic development might give it the edge in the long run. Investors looking for asymmetric returns are watching both closely‚Äîespecially as market conditions improve. Still, it‚Äôs the newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that could offer the kind of explosive upside not seen since the early days of ADA or ETH. Conclusion Cardano‚Äôs road to $4 and Ethereum‚Äôs path to $10K are shaping up to be two of the most-watched stories in crypto. Both face competition from newer altcoins and shifting market dynamics. But with MAGACOIN FINANCE mirroring early ADA momentum and delivering rapid ecosystem growth , many investors see it as a high-upside investments ahead of the next bull phase.

Some sellers seem to be appearing at the 4H MA 50 at a confluence with the $3,700 resistance zone. By Elior Manier The session is risk-on as market participants already seem to be moving on from the miss and downward revisions to the NFP data, and this was just Friday. Some questions remain on the current state of affairs, as safe havens have also appreciated on the session, but the rally is still way more significant in risk assets. Cryptos haven't rejected the positive mood around markets, as most digital assets are green today, and by a decent margin.

Bitcoin 4H Chart Bitcoin 4H Chart, August 4, 2025 - Source: TradingView This weekend marked some touches to the $112,000 level serving as main support, which triggered some small buying. Momentum is stalling a tidbit as the middle level of the downward ATH descending channel is approaching. Traders will need to be watchful for the reactions at the current level: Rejecting here shows a more bearish outlook (as prices would fail to breach the midline, a typical sign of buyer exhaustion), while consolidating here/breaking above would point to a test of the higher bounds of the channel around $118,500.

The effort, Crypto Sprint as it is called, announced on August 1, aims to bring spot digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP) into trading on CFTC-registered designated contract markets (DCMs). This is the first official step taken on behalf of the president‚Äôs Working Group to implement recommendations on digital assets. It highlights an increasing desire from regulators in the U.S. to set universal standards for digital asset trading throughout platforms and jurisdictions. Acting Chair Caroline D. Pham said in an official press release that the initiative laid the foundation for modernized regulatory principles in a fast-moving and competitive industry. She emphasized that transparency and accountability were essential to support market integrity, protect investors, enforce compliance, and allow innovation to thrive within a clear federal regulatory framework. Launching Crypto Sprint is an effort by the CFTC to establish a cohesive approach to digital asset trading ‚Äî specifically designed for non-security crypto tokens, and instead leverages existing regulated futures exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. New rules target margin and leverage in spot trades A key focus of the Crypto Sprint is to bring retail-focused spot trading under direct regulation‚Äîespecially trades that involve leverage or margin, which have become common features on many crypto platforms. Under the Commodity Exchange Act, such leveraged commodity trades must occur on regulated exchanges. However, many crypto platforms have operated outside these requirements due to regulatory gray zones. The CFTC now wants to close those gaps. The agency calls on exchanges, crypto projects, and the broader public to provide feedback on structuring these changes. Specifically, input is being requested on how digital commodities can comply with section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Commodity Exchange Act and Part 40 of CFTC regulations‚Äîboth of which relate to listing standards and regulatory review processes. Pham stated that the initiative was not only about bringing crypto into compliance but also about adapting existing rules in a way that respects innovation while maintaining strong regulatory oversight. Market participants have until August 18, 2025, to submit written comments. These submissions will be publicly available on the CFTC website, enhancing transparency and stakeholder engagement. Regulators team up to streamline crypto rules The Crypto Sprint is not happening in isolation. It is being coordinated closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which runs its own initiative, Project Crypto. Both efforts aim to clarify the regulatory environment for digital assets by defining jurisdictional boundaries and enhancing inter-agency cooperation. The collaboration could help resolve the long-standing turf war between the CFTC and SEC over who regulates what in the crypto space‚Äîespecially given the blurred line between what constitutes a commodity versus a security. Pham said that joint oversight will reduce regulatory duplication and give crypto businesses and investors more confidence in operating within U.S. markets. The CFTC has long argued that it is better suited to oversee crypto spot markets‚Äîparticularly for assets that are not considered securities. While the SEC continues to pursue enforcement actions against unregistered securities offerings in crypto, the CFTC‚Äôs approach leans more toward rule-setting and infrastructure building. That Crypto Sprint May Change US Digital Asset Trading for Good By greenlighting spot trading on CFTC-regulated futures exchanges, the CFTC provides a legitimate alternative to unregulated or offshore platforms that have increasingly come under fire due to some, like FTX in 2021 and Binance‚Äôs regulatory battles in the following years. The news has been met with praise from industry leaders. For institutional investors, this goes a long way to calming their nerves around the legality and parity of the framework with which cryptocurrencies are accessed.

She expressed her opinion on Monday, citing a forecast that the jobs market is weakening. Quoting from a Labor Department report out earlier this month, Daly said there were 73,000 new jobs created in July of 2025. Similarly, reinforcing those fears, officials revised the May and June job numbers to reveal that just 33,000 jobs had been created between them. For her part, Daly does not believe that the labor market is unraveling or even teetering on the precipice of an imminent crisis. However, she also observed a clear slowdown in job growth and the rest of the labor market momentum compared to that one year earlier. Daly stated that she is paying much attention to labor market measures, and the dashboard there ‚Äúlooks mostly bad.‚Äù She stated that she would view any further softening of the labor market as an unwelcome development, indicating concern about the potential negative implications of continued economic slowdown. Fed signals readiness to cut interest rates Daly supported the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision last month to keep interest rates steady in the current range of 4.25% to 4.50%. But she made it clear: holding off on cuts won‚Äôt be possible much longer. The two quarter-point interest-rate cuts that Fed policymakers back in June penciled in for this year still ‚Äúlook to be an appropriate amount of recalibration, and less important is, does it happen in September and December than does it happen at all‚Ä¶there‚Äôs all kinds of permutations to get those two cuts.‚Äù She added that every upcoming Fed meeting is now a ‚Äúlive meeting,‚Äù meaning new policy changes are possible depending on fresh economic data. Daly warned that if the labor market weakens and inflation remains subdued, more than two interest rate cuts may be necessary. She emphasized that, in her judgment, the Federal Reserve should be prepared to take further action if signs of labor market deterioration persist without any corresponding increase in inflation. Fed reconsiders policy to balance inflation and jobs For the Federal Reserve, the twin goals of price stability and full employment are now pulling in slightly different directions. Daly noted that price pressures remain contained on the inflation front, even in the face of new tariffs imposed earlier this year. While some sectors have seen price increases due to higher import costs, she emphasized that these are not feeding into broader inflation. Daly noted that there was no evidence to suggest that price increases driven by tariffs were spreading more broadly into overall inflation. She indicated this was a positive sign for the Federal Reserve, as it provided greater flexibility to ease monetary policy without the risk of triggering additional inflationary pressures. But the picture for jobs is less reassuring. Daly said the Fed is now in a ‚Äúpolicy tradeoff space,‚Äù where they must carefully balance the risks of acting too soon versus waiting too long. She warned that if the Federal Reserve waited too long‚Äîsuch as six months to a year‚Äîin pursuit of complete certainty before making a policy move, it would almost certainly be too late to respond effectively to emerging economic weaknesses. Therefore, she thinks the Fed must act in advance and not wait for a reaction. However, the downside is that it may be harder to right the ship and start growing again if it waits until unemployment spikes or consumers retrench. Daly also noted that while inflation is close to the Fed‚Äôs 2% goal, inaction on jobs could underpin efforts to spur the economy. She said the monetary policy no longer fit where the economy was going and that a review might be in order, indicating that officials will reassess their reports on the performance of the present rate track, which is currently performing well to support evolving economic conditions.

According to a recent Cointelegraph report , the push for an Ethereum ETF that allows staking has created renewed excitement, especially among fund managers seeking passive yield exposure to ETH. Several analysts say the approval of a staking-enabled Ethereum ETF could be a game-changer , accelerating demand from asset managers already familiar with Bitcoin ETFs. Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Christine Kim emphasized that ETH‚Äôs ecosystem has matured significantly since the last bull run, making it a fundamentally stronger candidate for institutional capital. With Ethereum‚Äôs staking yield offering a 4‚Äì5% annual return , traditional investors now view ETH as both a growth and yield product‚Äîa rare combination in crypto. MAGACOIN FINANCE, another emerging altcoin, has also begun attracting early capital attention as percentage-based forecasts place it in the spotlight for huge gains . XRP ETF hopes stir optimism despite regulatory uncertainty On the XRP front, ETF speculation is also mounting. Coingape reports that Grayscale has filed a spot XRP Trust with the SEC, renewing debate over whether Ripple‚Äôs partial court victory last year could open the door for regulatory greenlighting. While a decision has yet to be made, investors are watching closely ‚Äì particularly after XRP‚Äôs earlier price action showed strong upside potential when legal clarity improved. Crypto market participants believe that if a spot XRP ETF is approved, the coin‚Äôs suppressed valuation could rapidly reverse. Traders note that XRP remains one of the few top-10 assets not to retest its prior highs this cycle , leaving room for a sharp move. Whales have recently increased their holdings, adding to the speculation that a major rally could be in play. MAGACOIN FINANCE gains traction as forecasts show up to 18,600% upside As Ethereum and XRP dominate headlines, speculative capital is already rotating into earlier-stage opportunities . One project attracting that momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE, now gaining serious attention among altcoin traders. Updated market research highlights potential returns of up to 18,600% based on current valuation and community growth forecasts. The project‚Äôs consistent presale sellouts, expanding ecosystem, and viral social reach have made it a standout among low-cap altcoins. What‚Äôs drawing comparisons to early DOGE and SHIB cycles isn‚Äôt just hype ‚Äì it‚Äôs the structured utility and strategic tokenomics that analysts say could reward early participants exponentially. With whale wallets already initiating large transactions , and community metrics surging, MAGACOIN FINANCE has cemented its status as a high-upside contender for those betting on the next wave of altcoin breakouts . Which coin gets there first‚ÄîXRP or Ethereum? The race to new all-time highs between XRP and Ethereum may come down to regulatory timing. ETH has the advantage of broader institutional awareness and an ecosystem bolstered by staking. But XRP offers more ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù potential if ETF approval hits and clears the way for broader U.S. exposure. That said, for retail investors seeking asymmetric opportunities, the price discovery phase of newer assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE may offer more explosive upside . Conclusion: ETF approvals could drive surges‚Äîbut early plays may outperform Both XRP and Ethereum are positioned to benefit from potential ETF catalysts in Q3 or Q4. While their upside may depend on timing and SEC decisions, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs current valuation leaves room for up to 18,600% projected gains , making it one of the highest-potential altcoins on traders‚Äô radars.

Analyst Says ‚ÄòThis Is It‚Äô,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/has-the-crypto-market-bottomed/,"Macro analyst Alex Kr√ºger says the weekend‚Äôs sell-off has likely marked a tradable low for the crypto market, arguing that the move closely mirrors the 2024 ‚ÄúAugust crash‚Äù that bottomed on a Monday. ‚ÄúI see the current move as a smaller scale replay of last year‚Äôs August crash (which bottomed on Monday),‚Äù Kr√ºger wrote on late-Friday in a post on X, adding that he would ‚Äúbe looking to add to longs on Monday, ideally before the US cash open,‚Äù if the overnight session remained panicky. He framed the decline as a classic shakeout rather than the start of a new downtrend. Kr√ºger‚Äôs read hinges on macro first, crypto second. He notes that 2024‚Äôs August break came in a sequence‚ÄîBoJ tightening, a hawkish FOMC, then weak payrolls‚Äîand he sees the present sequence as ‚Äúsimilar.‚Äù There was no carry-trade impulse this time, he said, but markets digested a modestly hawkish Fed, mixed Big Tech earnings, a hotter-than-expected PCE inflation print, and finally a ‚Äúhorrid‚Äù US payrolls report‚Äîafter which risk assets slid in tandem and crypto tracked equities lower. The latest PCE data, released July 31, showed headline inflation accelerating to 2.6% year over year and core PCE at 2.8%, a notch above forecasts‚Äîwhat Kr√ºger summarized as ‚Äúslightly hot.‚Äù Related Reading: Crypto Hacks Surge 27% In July: $142M Stolen As 2025 Trend Continues Earnings tape-bombs reinforced the risk-off mood. Microsoft and Meta beat estimates and initially rallied, while Apple‚Äôs reception was cooler and Amazon‚Äôs results were ‚Äúvery poorly received,‚Äù with AMZN sliding about 7‚Äì8% as investors questioned AWS‚Äôs momentum. Coinbase‚Äôs report landed at the other extreme for crypto beta: revenue missed expectations and the stock fell, a backdrop Kr√ºger called ‚Äúdreadful‚Äù for sentiment. ‚ÄúEven though the aforementioned concerns emboldened bears, this week‚Äôs move has been mainly a macro story, given how crypto traded mostly in line with equity indices,‚Äù he wrote. He also flagged an unusual political and geopolitical coda to this weekend‚Äôs rout. After the weak jobs report‚Äîplus an unusually stark revision by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, May and June were revised down by a combined 258,000 jobs‚Äîmarkets lurched, and the White House‚Äôs subsequent decision to reposition two US nuclear submarines amid heated exchanges with Moscow added to stress, he said. Kremlin officials later tried to downplay escalation risk, calling the submarine moves ‚Äúroutine.‚Äù Kr√ºger called the nuclear rhetoric and presidential barbs at the Fed ‚Äúnoise‚Äù for markets, but said the combination likely helped flush leveraged positions into the close. On crypto-specific drivers, Kr√ºger listed a cluster of narratives that, in his view, amplified bearish conviction without changing the macro center of gravity: disappointing Coinbase results; debate around whether MicroStrategy could curtail its at-the-market equity issuance, limiting incremental BTC buys; questions about the sustainability of ‚ÄúDATs‚Äù (digital-asset treasury companies) tied to ETH; and, on the other side of the ledger, the SEC‚Äôs new ‚ÄúProject Crypto,‚Äù a policy push to modernize securities rules and move more market infrastructure on-chain‚Äî‚Äúan extremely bullish development that should drive inflows later in the year,‚Äù as he put it. The SEC‚Äôs chair outlined ‚ÄúAmerican Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution‚Äù last week, framing tokenization and on-chain market plumbing as a regulatory priority. Related Reading: Trump-Appointed Group Calls For Easier Crypto Regulations From Federal Authorities Kr√ºger‚Äôs base case is timing-driven: either crypto ‚Äúbottomed after today‚Äôs close, given the sheer violence of that final dump, or will be bottoming together with equities on Monday.‚Äù In his plan, the trigger to add risk was early Monday‚Äîassuming the overnight remained disorderly‚Äîon the view that the analog to August 2024 would rhyme at the turn of the week. ‚ÄúA violent shakeout,‚Äù he wrote, not a regime change. He remains constructive into the fourth quarter, citing three pillars: a still-solid US economy, the start of Fed rate cuts, and a steadily improving regulatory climate that should broaden institutional and retail participation. Policy churn could amplify that path. Kr√ºger pointed to Fed Governor Adriana Kugler‚Äôs resignation‚Äîeffective this month‚Äîas a potentially market-relevant shift because it hands the White House an earlier-than-expected Board vacancy, and to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh‚Äôs call for a new ‚ÄúTreasury‚ÄìFed accord‚Äù as a signpost for constraints on central-bank independence. On Monday he added, ‚ÄúThis will prove to be very important later on,‚Äù citing Warsh‚Äôs argument about ‚Äúlimits on the Fed‚Äôs independence to help the govt with its finances.‚Äù Whether those institutional dynamics translate into earlier or deeper rate cuts remains open, but markets have already moved to price odds to 85% for a September cut following the payrolls miss. Kr√ºger‚Äôs longer arc is unabashedly bullish but explicitly conditional on the macro. ‚ÄúI remain bullish on crypto into Q4,‚Äù he wrote, while warning that ETH-linked treasury plays could ‚Äúlose momentum dramatically‚Äù later in the year if goods inflation re-accelerates as corporates pass tariffs through. He set a one-year Bitcoin target for mid-2026 at $200,000‚Äì$250,000‚Äî‚Äúextreme, but possible‚Äù‚Äîon the premise that a more dovish Fed in 2026 would coincide with ongoing adoption. For now, he is treating last week‚Äôs cascade as an echo of 2024‚Äôs Monday bottom.

Amid this, attention is turning to Avalanche (AVAX), TRON (TRX), and the emerging altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE. SEC Increases BlackRock‚Äôs ETF Limit BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recently received a significant push as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) increased the limit on ETF options contracts from 25,000 to 250,000. According to analysts at NYDIG, this regulatory move is likely to solidify IBIT‚Äôs lead in the space. The ETF already manages $85.5 billion in assets, more than four times the amount held by its closest competitor, Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC. Last month, the SEC approved in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms for crypto ETFs. Industry commentators view the developments as key to expanding institutional access to digital assets. Avalanche (AVAX) and TRON (TRX): Next Breakout Altcoins? Amid Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum, Avalanche (AVAX) is showing signs of recovery. In a tweet, analyst ‚ÄúThePenguinXBT‚Äù described AVAX‚Äôs price action as a ‚Äúsuper clean correction‚Äù and suggested the altcoin may be preparing for a breakout. As of now, AVAX is trading at $21, having posted 5% gain over the past day. The chart accompanying ThePenguinXBT‚Äôs analysis suggests AVAX could soar to $36 before the end of this year. Likewise, analysts are also seeing bullish potential in TRON (TRX). In a tweet, crypto commentator Lau (@lourdesanchezok) noted that TRX has delivered an 864% return since July 2022 and gained 66% between February and July 2025. Lau attributes this performance to TRON‚Äôs dominance in the stablecoin sector, particularly through its integration with Tether (USDT). As of late July 2025, TRON hosts over 82.69 billion USDT, more than half of Tether‚Äôs total supply. Given the bullish fundamentals around TRON, Lau urges market participants to add some TRX to their portfolios, suggesting more promising performance lies ahead. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Underdog with 10,500% Potential? As AVAX and TRX are gearing up for possible rallies, MAGACOIN FINANCE is another altcoin gaining traction among market watchers. Market analysts are drawing comparisons to Shiba Inu‚Äôs meteoric rise, with forecasts surging up to 10,500% ROI. MAGACOIN FINANCE boasts real-world utility through DeFi features like staking, governance voting, and transparent tokenomics. It has earned a perfect 10/10 TrustScore from independent auditing platforms and passed a comprehensive CertiK audit, further boosting its credibility. It follows a fully community-owned model and aligns with U.S.-based investor narratives. Conclusion BlackRock‚Äôs ETF approval may signal a new chapter for institutional involvement in Bitcoin, but the next big wave could come from altcoins ready to break out. As analysts see bullish potential in Avalanche and TRON, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also gaining momentum and may be the most promising bet for early buyers.
