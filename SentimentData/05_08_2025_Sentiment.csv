It is unusual for such events to occur when the markets are booming, but it is sometimes inevitable. Toning Down for Sustainability One of the co-founders of the Ethereum staking protocol, Lido, Vasiliy Shapovalov, shared the unfortunate announcement on the social media platform X earlier today. Several people have already commented and offered to help those who have lost their jobs. ‚ÄúThis decision was about costs ‚Äî not performance,‚Äù he noted. The liquid staking smart contract was founded in 2020 by Shapovalov and two other entrepreneurs, marking the first-ever personnel cutback. The Lido DAO operates the protocol, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that provides staking infrastructure for multiple blockchain networks, most notably Ethereum. The DAO is quite secure, as it is regularly audited by third-party companies to detect and remove vulnerabilities.¬†Users who stake their ETH on the protocol receive stETH (Lido staked ETH) tokens, which represent the overall amount held and determine the size of the rewards from the incentive. The native currency, LDO, serves as a governance token for the DAO. Holders can participate in administration proposals and vote on key decisions such as board adjustments, integrations, and platform updates. There has been a recent change to the governance model, with Dual Governance being approved, which gives stETH holders the ability to oppose proposals by delaying them for up to 45 days, a pioneering move not seen in other similar protocols, adding additional security and decentralization to the organization. Dominating, At First Glance Shapovalov further stated in his post that: While it may seem counterintuitive amid a market upswing, the move reflects a deliberate commitment to sustainable growth, operational focus, and alignment with the priorities of LDO tokenholders. Indeed, if we examine key metrics for the protocol and native token, the sentiment leans more towards expansion than contraction. According to data collected at the time of printing from DefiLlama, Lido currently has no opposition in terms of the Total Value Locked (TVL), which exceeds $31 billion. To compare it with the protocol in second place, Binance Staked ETH has $10.4 billion in TVL. They also lead in Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), holding 8.9 million in staked Ether, compared to the 2.9 million held by the Binance protocol. Additionally, Lido has over 60% of the market share of these tokens. Source: DefiLlama The governance token, LDO, has also increased by almost 30% over the past month, according to current data from CoinMarketCap.

Three weeks ago today it posted a new all-time high of $122,838‚Äîa move that reignited bullish momentum among traders. Although it has since dipped by approximately 6.9%, market sentiment remains strongly positive, with many analysts forecasting another breakout, as BTC continues to hover near its peak price territory. This impressive upswing has also invigorated a range of major altcoins and some of the very best meme coins . Over the last 12 months, cryptocurrencies like XRP, TRON, Solana, Sui Network, Pepe, Trump, SPX6900, and FartCoin have recorded fresh all-time highs‚Äîdemonstrating strong investor confidence in the market‚Äôs broader uptrend. There are also sign that the US government is going to make good on its word to regulate crypto. At the end of last week, the SEC announced ‚Äú Project Crypto ‚Äú, a series of initiatives to update American securities laws to hopefully give the industry the clarity it has long called for. As anticipation builds for a prolonged bull run, attention is increasingly shifting toward digital assets that may be poised to surpass their previous records. Ripple (XRP): Cross-Border Payment Crypto Experiences Impressive Price Movement in 2025 Ripple‚Äôs XRP reached a new pinnacle on July 18, hitting $3.65, surpassing its previous 2018 high of $3.40. Although it‚Äôs now trading at about $2.99, this represents a 17.7% retreat from its ATH and includes a sprightly 5% gain in the last 24 hours, indicating a healthy phase of recovery. Thanks to its rapid transaction speeds, negligible fees, and efficient global remittance capabilities without intermediaries, XRP has become a preferred option for institutional use. It has even garnered support from entities like the United Nations, bolstering its legitimacy. A pivotal moment came in 2023 when a U.S. court ruled that XRP‚Äôs retail sales did not qualify as securities, clearing the regulatory fog and paving the way for renewed investor confidence by 2025. XRP has risen by over 449% in the last 365 days, greatly outperforming Bitcoin‚Äôs 88% gain during the same timeframe. Technically, momentum could be picking back up as XRP‚Äôs relative strength index (RSI) is uptrending at 56, indicating more buying momentum than selling. This could indicate that bulls are angling to go a leg higher, following a 35% surge in the last 30 days compared to meagre BTC‚Äôs 6% gain. XRP diverged drastically from its 30-day moving average over the month of July as a result of heavy bull activity. The two lines have now converged and any downside risk seems contained, with firm support located just south of the previous resistance level of $3. A bullish flag pattern that formed between late 2024 and April 2025 could be pointing toward a possible push to $4 in the coming months. Shiba Inu ($SHIB): Dogecoin Rival With Crypto Utility Targets Potential 3X to 9X Price Surge Launched in August 2020, Shiba Inu ($SHIB) has cemented its position as the second-largest meme coin, boasting a market capitalization above $7.2 billion. SHIB has risen slightly overnight, adding 0.4% in the last 24 hours as the rest of the market, echoing a 0.9% rise across the crypto market, which now holds a combined value of $3.8 trillion. The token is currently trading near $0.00001225. Technical chart patterns suggest further upside may be ahead. Over the past year, SHIB has displayed two strong bullish indicators: a descending wedge from November to March, and a bullish flag developing since mid-May. If SHIB can break through its main resistance at $0.000022 amid broader market optimism, analysts believe it could rally toward $0.00003 before summer concludes. In a full-scale bull environment, estimates project a price range of $0.00006 to $0.00009 by year-end. Unlike most meme tokens, SHIB offers real-world utility via Shibarium, its Layer-2 solution built on Ethereum that enhances scalability, lowers fees, and improves transaction speed. Pepe ($PEPE): Viral Meme Coin and Famous Crypto Frog Anticipates Price Rebound Pepe ($PEPE) launched in April 2023 and quickly ascended into the top three meme coins by market cap, powered by the cultural appeal of the internet-famous frog from Matt Furie‚Äôs artwork. Its remarkable ascent has inspired numerous imitators, though none have matched its momentum. With a market cap of around $4.4 billion and even a brief cameo as Elon Musk‚Äôs profile picture on X, PEPE has solidified itself as a prominent meme asset. Currently priced around $0.00001045, it has gained 7% in the last 30 days but remains 63% below its late-2024 all-time high of $0.00002803. A falling wedge pattern suggests a bullish reversal could be forming. The RSI has cooled to 38, hinting that recent selling pressure may be easing as the asset descends towards the oversold level of 30. This could set the stage for a rapid rebound by the weekend, providing a compelling buy-in level for bullish investors. Overall, the meme coin sector‚Äôs total crypto market cap has risen 5.6% overnight to stand at $70.8 billion, and although Pepe remains virtually unchanged in the last 24 hours, a sustained meme coin rebound will drive bulls to take up Pepe positions. With favorable macroeconomic indicators and potential for renewed market momentum, Pepe supporters are eyeing a potential late-summer price surge. Snorter ($SNORT): Explosive Presale Interest in New Meme Coin with Built-In Trading Tools For those seeking early exposure to the next major meme coin breakout, Snorter ($SNORT) offers a compelling combination of humor and functionality. Built on the Solana blockchain, the project merges meme culture with practical crypto trading tools via a built-in bot.

In a statement from August 4, Coinbase‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, argued that the BSA, designed for a paper-based financial system, is outdated for today‚Äôs digital economy. ZKPs are a tech-forward solution for modern finance that can prove compliance, reduce transmission and exposure risk for sensitive consumer data, and streamline transaction monitoring. It‚Äôs past time for Congress to modernize the BSA. 2/3 ‚Äî paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) August 4, 2025 Why does Coinbase want to modernize the BSA? As far as Paul Grewal is concerned, the BSA is an obvious area that needs improvement. He described it as a critical tool for ‚Äúfinding bad actors and combating illicit finance.‚Äù Grewal highlighted how the BSA‚Äôs Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements force the collection of vast amounts of personal data, which are typically stored in centralized databases that are vulnerable to cyberattacks and frequently go unused, creating unnecessary privacy risks. Despite Congress‚Äô recent activity, the BSA is still hampered by decades-old requirements that reflect paper-based compliance protocols and a financial system that sees funds moved over days rather than seconds. Grewal noted that policymakers are now pointing to the speed at which money can move as an issue, but he says it would be better for them to focus on using technology for solutions rather than demonizing it for creating problems. As a solution, he proposed ZKPs, which would allow users to verify specific details‚Äîlike identity or age‚Äîwithout disclosing sensitive underlying data, a move that could enhance not just privacy but also security. ZKPs make this possible by using cryptography to enable one party (called the prover) to convince another party (called the verifier) that a certain statement is true without revealing any information beyond what is strictly necessary for that verification. For example, ZKPs could allow an individual to open an account with Coinbase by proving they are not on sanctions lists or are not a minor, and they would not have to share extensive personal information in the process. Now that the GENIUS and CLARITY Acts have been signed, Grewal has called upon Congress to pivot to BSA reforms. He also says the Treasury needs to establish a public-private partnership to identify areas where existing processes built on the antiquated systems need to be adjusted to function properly in a ZKP-based system. Coinbase is enduring a recent stock decline Grewal‚Äôs statement comes days after shares of Coinbase fell 12% in pre-market trading Friday (August 1), a knee-jerk reaction to the crypto exchange missing Wall Street expectations for second-quarter revenue. The company‚Äôs revenue grew by 3.3% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, but it fell short of the $1.59 billion estimate and was down from $2 billion in the previous quarter. Spot trading volumes also declined globally and in the US, with average market capitalization roughly flat during the period, but net income surged to US$1.43 billion, thanks mostly to unrealized gains on its crypto holdings and investments. Analysts believe this dip is a great opportunity for investors with a longer investment horizon who still want to get in on the company‚Äôs stock as Coinbase remains well-positioned for future growth, despite the performance.

Joining the growing list of cryptocurrency companies that are launching public listings, Figure Technology has submitted a draft registration statement with the U.S. SEC and expects to make its debut in 2025. Figure Technology joins the crypto IPO wave Figure Technology Solutions, Inc. (‚ÄúFTS‚Äù), a company founded and led by SoFi‚Äôs co-founder and former CEO Mike Cagney, confirmed today that it has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement on Form‚ÄØS‚Äë1 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, starting the process for a proposed initial public offering of equity securities expected this year. Figure is the latest crypto-related entrant into public markets. Other companies, such as BitGo, Circle , Grayscale and Gemini, have also filed or launched IPO activity. The crypto sector is currently valued at roughly $4T and the industry‚Äôs growth is supported by the favorable regulatory environment in the U.S. Figure was founded in 2018 by Mike‚ÄØCagney and builds blockchain‚Äëbased financial infrastructure and offers mortgage lending via home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), along with operating a cryptocurrency exchange and securitization platform. The company has experienced notable growth, increasing its lending volume by roughly 50‚ÄØ% in a recent year to over $5B in HELOC originations, supported by partnerships with Credit Karma, Guaranteed Rate and others The market is primed for crypto expansion The confidential S‚Äë1 submission benefits from an SEC policy update effective in March 2025, which increased the scope of eligibility for nonpublic draft registration review, allowing companies to begin the process earlier and without initial underwriter disclosures. Many crypto firms paused their IPO plans earlier in 2025 due to market turbulence at the time. That slump cooled enthusiasm for public listings, but according to executive commentary, some companies may be waiting for volatility to recede before launching listings. FTS decided to launch its listing despite the volatility to gain a first‚Äëmover advantage and a legitimization effect from going public in the sector. The company filed its S‚Äë1 in March 2024, but has not yet set an IPO date. Instead, the company has continued business restructuring and leadership adjustments in preparation for a public debut. In late 2024, it reorganized its lending entity, Figure Lending LLC, under the umbrella of the Figure Technology Solutions brand, and appointed Ronald Chillemi as Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary to support governance and regulatory readiness. The company is reportedly working with major investment banks, including Goldman‚ÄØSachs, JPMorgan and Jefferies to position the IPO, and has reportedly held discussions with institutional investors like BlackRock, SoftBank and Tiger Global.

Kaspa‚Äôs November Trend, Render‚Äôs Chart Break, and Cold Wallet‚Äôs Low-Priced Start",https://thecoinrise.com/which-crypto-looks-promising-kaspas-november-trend-renders-chart-break-and-cold-wallets-low-priced-start/,"As traders keep an eye on breakout patterns and seasonal shifts, three crypto names are getting attention for different reasons. Kaspa (KAS) stands out in price analysis with November showing stronger results than July and August. This trend has held up based on data, not just guesses. Over at Render (RNDR), the price has broken a downtrend line, opening the door to $7 if the current support level stays strong. Then there‚Äôs Cold Wallet ($CWT), which doesn‚Äôt rely on market timing. It‚Äôs working on real-world use. The referral program already pays in USDT, and the presale sits at $0.00942 in Stage 16. While KAS and RNDR may benefit from chart setups, Cold Wallet rewards actions from the start. New Numbers Point to Kaspa Strength in November Kaspa‚Äôs latest data from the Kaspa Report says November is its best month for gains, beating July and August. That changes the old belief that summer is the key season for strong moves. The numbers show November is more reliable, while summer has mixed results. Right now, Kaspa trades close to $0.10, after moving above a key zone between $0.08 and $0.09. Even though trading volume has slowed down, chart signals are steady. Some signs point to growing interest from bigger players. If history repeats, November could be a good time to watch this coin. With its current price around $0.10 and data showing strong returns in late fall, Kaspa might be one to follow more closely. Render Token Breakout Could Lead to 70% Rise Render (RNDR) has formed a pattern that often points to a breakout. It moved past a long-term downtrend line that had capped its price since late 2024. The price pulled back to retest that line, which is usually a strong sign in technical trading. Now RNDR trades near $4.13. If it stays above the old trendline, the next target is $7, a gain of about 71%. Even with the small dip after the breakout, momentum still looks solid. Staying above that trend could bring in more buyers. For traders who like setups with clear entry points and targets, RNDR‚Äôs chart might be worth watching. If you follow these kinds of patterns, this could be one of the clearer setups before a larger move. How Cold Wallet Makes Referrals Simple and Pays in USDT Most crypto referral systems make big claims but rarely follow through. Cold Wallet is taking a different approach. Right now, users can earn real USDT from referrals. There are no waitlists or tricky steps. You invite someone, they make a swap, and both of you get paid in USDT. It‚Äôs a direct process. The crypto presale 2025 adds another layer. Cold Wallet gives out bonus tokens too: 10% to the person who refers, and 5% to the person who joins. These bonuses aren‚Äôt delayed or tied to hidden terms. Every payout is on-chain, clear, and pulled from a set referral rewards pool. This setup is not a future promise. It‚Äôs already running. While other platforms use complicated multi-level plans, Cold Wallet keeps things simple. Real swaps lead to real rewards. Users are earning even before the token officially goes live. With Stage 16 pricing at just $0.00942, the barrier to entry stays low. If you‚Äôre looking to help grow a crypto network and get rewarded right away, Cold Wallet could be worth watching as 2025 gets closer. Cold Wallet Could Be the One to Watch in 2025 Kaspa (KAS) has a seasonal price pattern that could work again, and Render (RNDR) has a strong setup on the charts. But both depend on market behavior. Cold Wallet stands apart by giving rewards without needing perfect timing. Users can earn 10% in referral bonuses, get instant USDT payouts, and use a product that‚Äôs already live before its token launch. With Stage 16 pricing still at $0.00942, and no hidden rules or long lockups, Cold Wallet is rewarding early users now. For those chasing growth in 2025, the real value might not come from waiting on charts or news. It could come from using a platform that‚Äôs already delivering results. Cold Wallet might fit that shift toward real use and steady rewards.

Whether it‚Äôs NEAR Protocol‚Äôs modular growth, Binance Coin‚Äôs post-ATH recovery, or TRON‚Äôs DeFi dominance, competition is intense among the top contenders. However, one project is standing out for its perfect timing, robust tools, and explosive upside: BlockDAG. Currently in its final presale phase, BlockDAG offers early access at just $0.0016, with a confirmed listing price of $0.05 later this year, signaling a projected 3025% return. When considering the best crypto to buy now, BlockDAG (BDAG) checks all the boxes: fundamentals, timing, and an unmatched entry point. In this analysis, we compare BDAG to NEAR, BNB, and TRON to determine which token deserves your attention as we approach the final stretch of 2025‚Äôs third quarter. 1. BlockDAG (BDAG): Last Chance for Massive Upside Before GLOBAL LAUNCH Release BlockDAG is emerging as a serious contender in the Layer 1 race, with over $361 million raised and more than 24.7 billion BDAG coins sold before its mainnet even launches. With the current price locked at $0.0016 and a confirmed listing at $0.05 later this year, early buyers are looking at a potential 3025% return. That kind of growth is what makes BlockDAG one of the best cryptos to buy now for those eager to catch the next breakout. What sets BlockDAG apart isn‚Äôt just the impressive presale numbers but the live product. Users can already engage with a Demo Trading Platform where they can buy BDAG in real time and simulate selling. Additionally, a 10 BTC Auction Pool is underway, where every purchase grants an entry into a Bitcoin giveaway based on participation size. With the GLOBAL LAUNCH release set for August 11, the window for early access is closing fast. The X1 mobile miner app already has 2.5 million users, and BlockDAG‚Äôs hybrid DAG + Proof-of-Work design promises real scalability and decentralization. For smart investors, this is the best crypto to buy now. 2. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): Rebound Potential as Market Stabilizes NEAR Protocol is currently hovering around $2.75 after a 3% drop and a technical breakdown that ended a multi-day consolidation near $2.84. Although short-term support at $2.73 was breached, traders are now watching for a reclaim of $2.83 to confirm a potential double-bottom reversal pattern. On-chain metrics remain strong, with over 98% of NEAR‚Äôs supply in circulation and an impressive network throughput of ~12,000 transactions per second. Despite the dip, NEAR continues to attract developer interest, thanks to its modular architecture and AI-ready design. If resistance flips back into support and market sentiment improves, a rebound could be on the cards. For those seeking long-term infrastructure plays with technical efficiency, NEAR remains one of the best crypto to buy now. 3. Binance Coin (BNB): Bullish Indicators After Profit-Taking Binance Coin (BNB) is bouncing back after a brief pullback following its all-time high of $855 in late July. This correction came after strong institutional inflows, including $610 million in capital and a $1 billion token burn. BNB briefly traded above $830 before retracing to the $752‚Äì$767 range. Despite the short-term dip, bullish technical indicators remain, with BNB‚Äôs market cap surpassing $106 billion and daily volumes exceeding $2.9 billion. With support between $800 and $809 holding strong, analysts are keeping an eye on a potential breakout toward the $880 to $1,000 range. Given its regulatory stability and continued institutional momentum, BNB is a solid pick for investors looking for long-term growth. For those seeking steady, blue-chip assets, BNB remains one of the best crypto to buy now. 4. TRON (TRX): Strong Ecosystem Growth Amid Market Pressures TRON (TRX) continues to show strength despite the broader market dip. The network now hosts over 2.8 million daily active users, and its DeFi total value locked has surged, driven by strong stablecoin demand. TRON‚Äôs founder, Justin Sun, has emphasized its leadership in high-throughput USDT transfers, outperforming other Layer 1 blockchains in both speed and volume. TRON‚Äôs ecosystem is expanding with key updates improving governance and validator decentralization. This strong growth narrative positions TRON for a potential breakout back to its July highs. While TRX presents proven adoption and real-time utility, those seeking maximum upside with a low entry point may find newer projects like BlockDAG offer more immediate potential. However, for long-term investors, TRON remains one of the best crypto to buy now. Points to Remember With the market heating up again, the key question is: which token delivers the best mix of utility, timing, and upside? TRON leads with real-world usage, BNB stands strong with solid technicals and institutional support, and NEAR remains a strong player with its developer-driven infrastructure. But BlockDAG is making the most compelling case. With over $361 million raised, live trading tools already in place, and a listing price set to be 30x higher, BlockDAG offers rare pre-launch potential. For those looking for the best crypto to buy now, BlockDAG checks every box: timing, demand, and massive reward potential.

XRP MVRV Ratio Has Crossed Under Its 200-Day MA In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a crossover that has occurred in the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Ratio of XRP. The ‚ÄúMVRV Ratio‚Äù refers to an on-chain indicator that tells us how the Market Cap of the asset compares against its Realized Cap. The Realized Cap is a capitalization model that calculates the cryptocurrency‚Äôs total value by assuming the ‚Äòreal‚Äô value of each token in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the blockchain. This is different from the Market Cap, which takes the current spot price as the same one value for the entire supply. As the last transaction of any token is likely to denote the last point at which it changed hands, the price at its time could be considered as its current cost basis. Thus, the Realized Cap, which adds up this value for all coins, is essentially the sum of the capital that the investors have put into the asset. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Here? 6 Key Metrics Show Market Shift Since the MVRV Ratio compares the Market Cap, which can be thought of as the current value held by the investors, against this initial investment, it provides a measure of the profit-loss balance of the market. When the value of the indicator is greater than 1, it means the holders as a whole are sitting on some net unrealized profit. On the other hand, it being under the cutoff implies the dominance of loss on the blockchain. Now, here is the chart for the XRP MVRV Ratio shared by the analyst that shows the trends in its daily value and 200-day moving average (MA) over the past year: As displayed in the above graph, the XRP MVRV Ratio has remained above the 1 mark (corresponding to 0% on the chart‚Äôs scale), suggesting the overall market has been in the green recently. There have been some fluctuations within this profitable region, however, like earlier in the year when the metric witnessed a drawdown during which it slipped below its 200-day MA. With the price surge in July, the indicator managed to recover back above the line, but after the latest decline, it has once again crossed below it. ‚ÄúThe MVRV ratio flashed a death cross for XRP, suggesting a steeper correction could be underway!‚Äù explains Martinez.

A wave of fresh capital is flowing into presale markets, where many believe the next 10x‚Äì25x coins will emerge before broader retail adoption kicks in. Recent market sentiment shows a growing appetite for high-risk, high-reward tokens‚Äîespecially after past success stories of popular memecoins like PEPE turned small investments into life-changing returns . This has sparked renewed attention on new entrants aiming to repeat that formula. MAGACOIN FINANCE is one such project capturing investor attention early. The buzz around its presale is growing steadily as more traders look for high-potential investments before listings on major exchanges. Momentum continues to build around MAGACOIN FINANCE as presale allocations dwindle. The project has quickly established itself as a top contender in the current cycle, drawing comparisons to the early phases of meme coin giants. Latest analyst projections suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could yield up to 15,200% returns for early buyers ‚Äì turning even a modest $250 into nearly $38,000. With a growing community, fast sell-out rounds, and a strong narrative around utility and long-term development, many believe it‚Äôs one of the most promising altcoins in today‚Äôs presale market. Market Trends Driving the Hype Presales have historically been fertile ground for identifying undervalued coins before explosive rallies . In the current climate, investors are on the hunt for narrative-driven projects with strong branding and community support‚Äîtwo things MAGACOIN FINANCE has already shown in spades. The general altcoin landscape is also flashing signs of a potential shift, with Bitcoin dominance cooling and capital rotating toward smaller-cap assets. Early-stage tokens are beginning to outperform, suggesting that the appetite for presale speculation is back in full swing. Conclusion As crypto markets stir with new presale enthusiasm, the race is on to find the next standout performer. MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly separating from the pack, with 15,200% upside potential making it one of the most talked-about opportunities among forward-looking traders.

The Peter Thiel-owned company confirmed that revenue grew 48% year-over-year to reach $1.004 billion, powered by major growth in both U.S. commercial and government deals. The company also raised its full-year guidance across all key metrics, citing continued demand for its AI software. Source: Palantir CEO Alex Karp said, ‚ÄúWe are guiding to the highest sequential quarterly revenue growth in our company‚Äôs history, representing 50% year-over-year growth. This was a phenomenal quarter. We continue to see the astonishing impact of AI leverage.‚Äù Revenue from the U.S. surged 68% compared to the same quarter last year, landing at $733 million. U.S. commercial deals pulled in $306 million, up 93%, while U.S. government contracts generated $426 million, which was 53% higher than last year. Palantir‚Äôs Rule of 40 score also hit 94% in the quarter. Palantir‚Äôs total contract value hit $2.27 billion, which is a 140% increase compared to the same time in 2024. U.S. commercial contracts made up $843 million of that total, surging 222% year-over-year. The company also reported that its remaining deal value from U.S. commercial accounts reached $2.79 billion, which is up 145% compared to last year and 20% higher than Q1. Customer count grew 43% year-over-year and 10% quarter-over-quarter, showing Palantir‚Äôs growing market footprint. The company reported GAAP income from operations of $269 million, with a margin of 27%, while adjusted operating income came in at $464 million with a 46% margin. Net income hit $327 million, which gives it a 33% margin, while adjusted net income was $404 million. Palantir also brought in $539 million in cash from operations and ended the quarter with $569 million in adjusted free cash flow. The company now holds $6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury securities. Earnings per share stood at $0.13 GAAP and $0.16 adjusted. Adjusted EBITDA hit $470 million, giving a 47% margin. Palantir raises full-year guidance as AI demand grows For the third quarter, Palantir expects revenue to fall between $1.083 billion and $1.087 billion, and adjusted income from operations to range between $493 million and $497 million. For the full year, revenue guidance has been raised to between $4.142 billion and $4.150 billion. Adjusted income from operations is now forecasted between $1.912 billion and $1.920 billion, and adjusted free cash flow is expected to come in between $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion. In his shareholder letter , Alex said, ‚ÄúAll the value in the market is going to go to chips and what we call ontology.‚Äù He pointed to the rapid combination of language models, chip capacity, and Palantir‚Äôs software as the reason the company passed the $1 billion mark this quarter. He said this momentum came after years of investing in infrastructure and being dismissed by critics. ‚ÄúThe skeptics are admittedly fewer now, having been defanged and bent into a kind of submission,‚Äù he added. During the earnings call event, Alex told us that U.S. companies need to resist becoming bland compromises of global preferences. H e then warned against what he called a shallow acceptance of all opinions, referencing C.S. Lewis‚Äôs 1943 book The Abolition of Man and its warning about ‚Äúmen without chests.‚Äù ‚ÄúSuch men promise to shepherd us forward yet lack much substance,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey are little more than administrative caretakers.‚Äù Following the report and the earnings call, Palantir‚Äôs stock surged by more than 3% in extended trading, while stock futures reacted to its outstanding outperformance across major indexes.

The branch explained: ‚ÄúFraudsters pose as Central Bank staff, claiming to offer people access to digital ruble investment programs.

Here‚Äôs why,https://timestabloid.com/top-crypto-proponent-says-upcoming-xrp-bull-run-will-be-epic-heres-why/,"A growing number of analysts are pointing to early August 2025 as a possible inflection point for the altcoin market. The speculation is backed by data showing striking historical symmetry across previous bull cycles. Now, crypto proponent JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie) has added his voice to the conversation with a new chart projecting another massive surge in the months ahead. In a recent post on X, he shared a chart showing previous cycles with massive altcoin rallies. His focus on XRP has reignited bullish sentiment in the community. THE UPCOMING BULL RUN WILL BE EPIC! #XRP pic.twitter.com/vu1Q0Okzkn ‚Äî JackTheRippler ¬©Ô∏è (@RippleXrpie) August 3, 2025 The Repeating Altcoin Cycle The chart in JackTheRippler‚Äôs post tracks altcoin total market capitalization over ten years. It highlights three pivotal dates: August 1, 2017, August 1, 2021, and now, August 1, 2025. The two previous cycles show remarkable returns of 120x and 150x, respectively, following each date. The projection now suggests a 175x return from the current market base by the next cycle peak. Analysts have predicted that the alt season is around the corner , and this timeline lines up with JackTheRippler‚Äôs analysis. This analysis relies on recurring four-year intervals, and the current cycle has just begun. The clear visual of compressed price action before previous expansions lends credibility to the proposed 2025 breakout window. Another analyst recently highlighted a bearish pattern on the Bitcoin Dominance chart and believes a drop below 65% could kickstart a massive altcoin rally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Renewed Optimism for XRP Though the chart tracks the broader altcoin sector, JackTheRippler drew attention to XRP, stating that the asset will soon experience an epic bull run. XRP recently hit a new all-time high of $3.65 , and the community was excited for a continued climb throughout the rest of 2025. However, the market took a turn on August 1, with XRP falling below $3 . However, JackTheRippler‚Äôs analysis suggests the community does not need to worry, as August 1 was the date the new altcoin cycle began. XRP is currently trading at $3.07, and a 175% increase from here would send the asset to $8.44. One XRP supporter urged others to take the decline as a buying opportunity in anticipation of massive growth in Q4. This is the best time to accumulate tokens, and investors may not get another chance once the epic surge JackTheRippler predicted begins, and the altcoin market starts soaring.

Related Reading: Polkadot Powers Up: Breakout Structure Signals A Bullish Week Ahead Following a brief pullback to around $0.37, buyers have stepped in, keeping the token above critical support zones. As of early August, XLM trades between $0.384 and $0.392, signaling a period of healthy consolidation rather than panic-driven selling. Technical analysis shows that XLM is approaching key resistance at $0.4007, with immediate support sitting at $0.376. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains neutral, while decreasing trading volume indicates that current moves are driven more by profit-taking than bearish sentiment.

Despite short-term volatility, analysts are optimistic about XLM‚Äôs prospects heading into Q4 2025. Projections suggest that if the current support levels hold and bullish momentum returns, the token could target $0.52 and eventually push toward $0.60 or beyond. Some bold forecasts even point to a 5x rally, potentially sending XLM as high as $1.50. A key driver behind this bullish outlook is increasing whale accumulation. On-chain data reveals a rise in wallet addresses holding over 10 million XLM, signaling strong confidence from long-term investors. Exchange inflows remain stable, further indicating that large holders are not rushing to exit positions. Institutional Interest and Long-Term Fundamentals Support XLM Institutional sentiment toward Stellar has improved significantly in 2025. Several asset managers have included XLM in their infrastructure-focused crypto portfolios, reflecting growing confidence in Stellar‚Äôs real-world utility. Key partnerships with companies like IBM, MoneyGram, and Franklin Templeton continue to bolster the network‚Äôs relevance in cross-border payments and CBDC development. Additionally, Stellar‚Äôs focus on fast, low-cost global transactions and the development of its smart contract platform, Soroban, support its position as a top-tier altcoin. If the price can hold current levels and gain momentum above $0.40, Stellar could be poised for another major leg up.

Both assets have shown resilience and strong community support, but recent developments in ADA‚Äôs ecosystem have fueled speculation that it could reclaim its all-time high and even target a $4 price tag. Meanwhile, Ethereum remains focused on scalability upgrades and growing institutional interest as it eyes the elusive $10,000 milestone. In the midst of this race, one fast-moving project gaining attention is MAGACOIN FINANCE, which many early investors now compare to Cardano‚Äôs early days. With strong momentum and community-driven growth, it‚Äôs already appearing on radar screens of those looking to catch the next big altcoin opportunity before major exchange listings. ADA Developments Spark $4 Price Target Speculation Cardano has seen a surge in on-chain activity, driven by new DeFi projects and upgrades to its smart contract capabilities. The Hydra scaling solution, which promises to increase throughput and lower fees, has sparked renewed interest from developers and users alike. According to analysts, if ADA can maintain this growth trajectory and break past the $1.50 resistance level, a long-term push toward $4 is within reach. Ethereum, on the other hand, continues to lead in total value locked and layer-2 adoption. However, its higher transaction fees and slower rollout of improvements have opened the door for ADA to potentially gain market share. Despite this, ETH still holds a dominant position and could be the first to hit five figures if institutional demand continues to grow. This New Altcoin‚Äôs Momentum Mirrors Early ADA Hype Crypto experts are beginning to draw strong parallels between MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs current adoption curve and Cardano‚Äôs early days. What‚Äôs getting attention is the rapid expansion of its user base and a growing list of utilities, from staking to NFT integrations. Community engagement is skyrocketing, and analysts highlight that this level of traction‚Äîbefore a centralized exchange debut‚Äîis rare. Several reports now suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could deliver realistic 39x returns in the coming cycle for those who secure a position during the current presale window. Can ADA or ETH Win the Next Altcoin Race? Ethereum still enjoys the first-mover advantage and massive network effects, especially with its role in the booming layer-2 ecosystem. But Cardano‚Äôs focus on scalability, lower costs, and academic development might give it the edge in the long run. Investors looking for asymmetric returns are watching both closely‚Äîespecially as market conditions improve. Still, it‚Äôs the newer projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE that could offer the kind of explosive upside not seen since the early days of ADA or ETH. Conclusion Cardano‚Äôs road to $4 and Ethereum‚Äôs path to $10K are shaping up to be two of the most-watched stories in crypto. Both face competition from newer altcoins and shifting market dynamics. But with MAGACOIN FINANCE mirroring early ADA momentum and delivering rapid ecosystem growth , many investors see it as a high-upside investments ahead of the next bull phase.

Bitcoin wicked on its support zone at 112,000 and now trades around the $115,000 level. Ethereum has rallied strongly in the session, up at one point 4.30%. Some sellers seem to be appearing at the 4H MA 50 at a confluence with the $3,700 resistance zone. By Elior Manier The session is risk-on as market participants already seem to be moving on from the miss and downward revisions to the NFP data, and this was just Friday. Some questions remain on the current state of affairs, as safe havens have also appreciated on the session, but the rally is still way more significant in risk assets. Cryptos haven't rejected the positive mood around markets, as most digital assets are green today, and by a decent margin. They were leading on the way down after starting to correct last Wednesday, and most coins are now aiming to catch up to their recent highs. Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) wicked on its support zone at 112,000 and now trades around the $115,000 level.

There has been some kind of small intraday top that has just formed though. Let's take a look at Bitcoin and Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) to see if there is some more potential to the current move. Bitcoin 4H Chart Bitcoin 4H Chart, August 4, 2025 - Source: TradingView This weekend marked some touches to the $112,000 level serving as main support, which triggered some small buying. Momentum is stalling a tidbit as the middle level of the downward ATH descending channel is approaching. Traders will need to be watchful for the reactions at the current level: Rejecting here shows a more bearish outlook (as prices would fail to breach the midline, a typical sign of buyer exhaustion), while consolidating here/breaking above would point to a test of the higher bounds of the channel around $118,500. Levels to place on your charts: Support Levels: Lower bound of descending channel $113,200 Previous ATH support: $110,000 to $112,000 $100,000 major support Resistance Levels: $116,000 to 117,000 pivot (confluence with 4H MA 50) $120,000 resistance (+/- $300) Current ATH resistance: $121,000 to $123,000 Ethereum 4H Chart Ethereum 4H Chart, August 4, 2025 - Source: TradingView Ethereum has rallied strongly in the session, up at one point 4.30%.

The effort, Crypto Sprint as it is called, announced on August 1, aims to bring spot digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Ripple (XRP) into trading on CFTC-registered designated contract markets (DCMs). This is the first official step taken on behalf of the president‚Äôs Working Group to implement recommendations on digital assets. It highlights an increasing desire from regulators in the U.S. to set universal standards for digital asset trading throughout platforms and jurisdictions. Acting Chair Caroline D. Pham said in an official press release that the initiative laid the foundation for modernized regulatory principles in a fast-moving and competitive industry. She emphasized that transparency and accountability were essential to support market integrity, protect investors, enforce compliance, and allow innovation to thrive within a clear federal regulatory framework. Launching Crypto Sprint is an effort by the CFTC to establish a cohesive approach to digital asset trading ‚Äî specifically designed for non-security crypto tokens, and instead leverages existing regulated futures exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. New rules target margin and leverage in spot trades A key focus of the Crypto Sprint is to bring retail-focused spot trading under direct regulation‚Äîespecially trades that involve leverage or margin, which have become common features on many crypto platforms. Under the Commodity Exchange Act, such leveraged commodity trades must occur on regulated exchanges. However, many crypto platforms have operated outside these requirements due to regulatory gray zones. The CFTC now wants to close those gaps. The agency calls on exchanges, crypto projects, and the broader public to provide feedback on structuring these changes. Specifically, input is being requested on how digital commodities can comply with section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Commodity Exchange Act and Part 40 of CFTC regulations‚Äîboth of which relate to listing standards and regulatory review processes. Pham stated that the initiative was not only about bringing crypto into compliance but also about adapting existing rules in a way that respects innovation while maintaining strong regulatory oversight. Market participants have until August 18, 2025, to submit written comments. These submissions will be publicly available on the CFTC website, enhancing transparency and stakeholder engagement. Regulators team up to streamline crypto rules The Crypto Sprint is not happening in isolation. It is being coordinated closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which runs its own initiative, Project Crypto. Both efforts aim to clarify the regulatory environment for digital assets by defining jurisdictional boundaries and enhancing inter-agency cooperation. The collaboration could help resolve the long-standing turf war between the CFTC and SEC over who regulates what in the crypto space‚Äîespecially given the blurred line between what constitutes a commodity versus a security. Pham said that joint oversight will reduce regulatory duplication and give crypto businesses and investors more confidence in operating within U.S. markets. The CFTC has long argued that it is better suited to oversee crypto spot markets‚Äîparticularly for assets that are not considered securities. While the SEC continues to pursue enforcement actions against unregistered securities offerings in crypto, the CFTC‚Äôs approach leans more toward rule-setting and infrastructure building. That Crypto Sprint May Change US Digital Asset Trading for Good By greenlighting spot trading on CFTC-regulated futures exchanges, the CFTC provides a legitimate alternative to unregulated or offshore platforms that have increasingly come under fire due to some, like FTX in 2021 and Binance‚Äôs regulatory battles in the following years. The news has been met with praise from industry leaders. For institutional investors, this goes a long way to calming their nerves around the legality and parity of the framework with which cryptocurrencies are accessed.

49553230,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=779311,1754355443,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/49553230.jpeg,U.S. CFTC moves to regulate spot crypto markets via futures exchanges,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/daly-says-three-rate-cuts-may-be-needed/,"San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Mary Daly suggested the U.S. economy could require more than the two interest rate cuts planned by the Fed this year. She expressed her opinion on Monday, citing a forecast that the jobs market is weakening. Quoting from a Labor Department report out earlier this month, Daly said there were 73,000 new jobs created in July of 2025. Similarly, reinforcing those fears, officials revised the May and June job numbers to reveal that just 33,000 jobs had been created between them. For her part, Daly does not believe that the labor market is unraveling or even teetering on the precipice of an imminent crisis. However, she also observed a clear slowdown in job growth and the rest of the labor market momentum compared to that one year earlier. Daly stated that she is paying much attention to labor market measures, and the dashboard there ‚Äúlooks mostly bad.‚Äù She stated that she would view any further softening of the labor market as an unwelcome development, indicating concern about the potential negative implications of continued economic slowdown. Fed signals readiness to cut interest rates Daly supported the Federal Reserve‚Äôs decision last month to keep interest rates steady in the current range of 4.25% to 4.50%. But she made it clear: holding off on cuts won‚Äôt be possible much longer. The two quarter-point interest-rate cuts that Fed policymakers back in June penciled in for this year still ‚Äúlook to be an appropriate amount of recalibration, and less important is, does it happen in September and December than does it happen at all‚Ä¶there‚Äôs all kinds of permutations to get those two cuts.‚Äù She added that every upcoming Fed meeting is now a ‚Äúlive meeting,‚Äù meaning new policy changes are possible depending on fresh economic data. Daly warned that if the labor market weakens and inflation remains subdued, more than two interest rate cuts may be necessary. She emphasized that, in her judgment, the Federal Reserve should be prepared to take further action if signs of labor market deterioration persist without any corresponding increase in inflation. Fed reconsiders policy to balance inflation and jobs For the Federal Reserve, the twin goals of price stability and full employment are now pulling in slightly different directions. Daly noted that price pressures remain contained on the inflation front, even in the face of new tariffs imposed earlier this year. While some sectors have seen price increases due to higher import costs, she emphasized that these are not feeding into broader inflation. Daly noted that there was no evidence to suggest that price increases driven by tariffs were spreading more broadly into overall inflation. She indicated this was a positive sign for the Federal Reserve, as it provided greater flexibility to ease monetary policy without the risk of triggering additional inflationary pressures. But the picture for jobs is less reassuring. Daly said the Fed is now in a ‚Äúpolicy tradeoff space,‚Äù where they must carefully balance the risks of acting too soon versus waiting too long. She warned that if the Federal Reserve waited too long‚Äîsuch as six months to a year‚Äîin pursuit of complete certainty before making a policy move, it would almost certainly be too late to respond effectively to emerging economic weaknesses. Therefore, she thinks the Fed must act in advance and not wait for a reaction. However, the downside is that it may be harder to right the ship and start growing again if it waits until unemployment spikes or consumers retrench. Daly also noted that while inflation is close to the Fed‚Äôs 2% goal, inaction on jobs could underpin efforts to spur the economy. She said the monetary policy no longer fit where the economy was going and that a review might be in order, indicating that officials will reassess their reports on the performance of the present rate track, which is currently performing well to support evolving economic conditions.

According to a recent Cointelegraph report , the push for an Ethereum ETF that allows staking has created renewed excitement, especially among fund managers seeking passive yield exposure to ETH. Several analysts say the approval of a staking-enabled Ethereum ETF could be a game-changer , accelerating demand from asset managers already familiar with Bitcoin ETFs. Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Christine Kim emphasized that ETH‚Äôs ecosystem has matured significantly since the last bull run, making it a fundamentally stronger candidate for institutional capital. With Ethereum‚Äôs staking yield offering a 4‚Äì5% annual return , traditional investors now view ETH as both a growth and yield product‚Äîa rare combination in crypto. MAGACOIN FINANCE, another emerging altcoin, has also begun attracting early capital attention as percentage-based forecasts place it in the spotlight for huge gains . XRP ETF hopes stir optimism despite regulatory uncertainty On the XRP front, ETF speculation is also mounting. Coingape reports that Grayscale has filed a spot XRP Trust with the SEC, renewing debate over whether Ripple‚Äôs partial court victory last year could open the door for regulatory greenlighting. While a decision has yet to be made, investors are watching closely ‚Äì particularly after XRP‚Äôs earlier price action showed strong upside potential when legal clarity improved. Crypto market participants believe that if a spot XRP ETF is approved, the coin‚Äôs suppressed valuation could rapidly reverse. Traders note that XRP remains one of the few top-10 assets not to retest its prior highs this cycle , leaving room for a sharp move. Whales have recently increased their holdings, adding to the speculation that a major rally could be in play. MAGACOIN FINANCE gains traction as forecasts show up to 18,600% upside As Ethereum and XRP dominate headlines, speculative capital is already rotating into earlier-stage opportunities . One project attracting that momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE, now gaining serious attention among altcoin traders. Updated market research highlights potential returns of up to 18,600% based on current valuation and community growth forecasts. The project‚Äôs consistent presale sellouts, expanding ecosystem, and viral social reach have made it a standout among low-cap altcoins. What‚Äôs drawing comparisons to early DOGE and SHIB cycles isn‚Äôt just hype ‚Äì it‚Äôs the structured utility and strategic tokenomics that analysts say could reward early participants exponentially. With whale wallets already initiating large transactions , and community metrics surging, MAGACOIN FINANCE has cemented its status as a high-upside contender for those betting on the next wave of altcoin breakouts . Which coin gets there first‚ÄîXRP or Ethereum? The race to new all-time highs between XRP and Ethereum may come down to regulatory timing. ETH has the advantage of broader institutional awareness and an ecosystem bolstered by staking. But XRP offers more ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù potential if ETF approval hits and clears the way for broader U.S. exposure. That said, for retail investors seeking asymmetric opportunities, the price discovery phase of newer assets like MAGACOIN FINANCE may offer more explosive upside . Conclusion: ETF approvals could drive surges‚Äîbut early plays may outperform Both XRP and Ethereum are positioned to benefit from potential ETF catalysts in Q3 or Q4. While their upside may depend on timing and SEC decisions, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs current valuation leaves room for up to 18,600% projected gains , making it one of the highest-potential altcoins on traders‚Äô radars.

Analyst Says ‚ÄòThis Is It‚Äô,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/has-the-crypto-market-bottomed/,"Macro analyst Alex Kr√ºger says the weekend‚Äôs sell-off has likely marked a tradable low for the crypto market, arguing that the move closely mirrors the 2024 ‚ÄúAugust crash‚Äù that bottomed on a Monday. ‚ÄúI see the current move as a smaller scale replay of last year‚Äôs August crash (which bottomed on Monday),‚Äù Kr√ºger wrote on late-Friday in a post on X, adding that he would ‚Äúbe looking to add to longs on Monday, ideally before the US cash open,‚Äù if the overnight session remained panicky. He framed the decline as a classic shakeout rather than the start of a new downtrend. Kr√ºger‚Äôs read hinges on macro first, crypto second. He notes that 2024‚Äôs August break came in a sequence‚ÄîBoJ tightening, a hawkish FOMC, then weak payrolls‚Äîand he sees the present sequence as ‚Äúsimilar.‚Äù There was no carry-trade impulse this time, he said, but markets digested a modestly hawkish Fed, mixed Big Tech earnings, a hotter-than-expected PCE inflation print, and finally a ‚Äúhorrid‚Äù US payrolls report‚Äîafter which risk assets slid in tandem and crypto tracked equities lower. The latest PCE data, released July 31, showed headline inflation accelerating to 2.6% year over year and core PCE at 2.8%, a notch above forecasts‚Äîwhat Kr√ºger summarized as ‚Äúslightly hot.‚Äù Related Reading: Crypto Hacks Surge 27% In July: $142M Stolen As 2025 Trend Continues Earnings tape-bombs reinforced the risk-off mood. Microsoft and Meta beat estimates and initially rallied, while Apple‚Äôs reception was cooler and Amazon‚Äôs results were ‚Äúvery poorly received,‚Äù with AMZN sliding about 7‚Äì8% as investors questioned AWS‚Äôs momentum. Coinbase‚Äôs report landed at the other extreme for crypto beta: revenue missed expectations and the stock fell, a backdrop Kr√ºger called ‚Äúdreadful‚Äù for sentiment. ‚ÄúEven though the aforementioned concerns emboldened bears, this week‚Äôs move has been mainly a macro story, given how crypto traded mostly in line with equity indices,‚Äù he wrote. He also flagged an unusual political and geopolitical coda to this weekend‚Äôs rout. After the weak jobs report‚Äîplus an unusually stark revision by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, May and June were revised down by a combined 258,000 jobs‚Äîmarkets lurched, and the White House‚Äôs subsequent decision to reposition two US nuclear submarines amid heated exchanges with Moscow added to stress, he said. Kremlin officials later tried to downplay escalation risk, calling the submarine moves ‚Äúroutine.‚Äù Kr√ºger called the nuclear rhetoric and presidential barbs at the Fed ‚Äúnoise‚Äù for markets, but said the combination likely helped flush leveraged positions into the close. On crypto-specific drivers, Kr√ºger listed a cluster of narratives that, in his view, amplified bearish conviction without changing the macro center of gravity: disappointing Coinbase results; debate around whether MicroStrategy could curtail its at-the-market equity issuance, limiting incremental BTC buys; questions about the sustainability of ‚ÄúDATs‚Äù (digital-asset treasury companies) tied to ETH; and, on the other side of the ledger, the SEC‚Äôs new ‚ÄúProject Crypto,‚Äù a policy push to modernize securities rules and move more market infrastructure on-chain‚Äî‚Äúan extremely bullish development that should drive inflows later in the year,‚Äù as he put it. The SEC‚Äôs chair outlined ‚ÄúAmerican Leadership in the Digital Finance Revolution‚Äù last week, framing tokenization and on-chain market plumbing as a regulatory priority. Related Reading: Trump-Appointed Group Calls For Easier Crypto Regulations From Federal Authorities Kr√ºger‚Äôs base case is timing-driven: either crypto ‚Äúbottomed after today‚Äôs close, given the sheer violence of that final dump, or will be bottoming together with equities on Monday.‚Äù In his plan, the trigger to add risk was early Monday‚Äîassuming the overnight remained disorderly‚Äîon the view that the analog to August 2024 would rhyme at the turn of the week. ‚ÄúA violent shakeout,‚Äù he wrote, not a regime change. He remains constructive into the fourth quarter, citing three pillars: a still-solid US economy, the start of Fed rate cuts, and a steadily improving regulatory climate that should broaden institutional and retail participation. Policy churn could amplify that path. Kr√ºger pointed to Fed Governor Adriana Kugler‚Äôs resignation‚Äîeffective this month‚Äîas a potentially market-relevant shift because it hands the White House an earlier-than-expected Board vacancy, and to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh‚Äôs call for a new ‚ÄúTreasury‚ÄìFed accord‚Äù as a signpost for constraints on central-bank independence. On Monday he added, ‚ÄúThis will prove to be very important later on,‚Äù citing Warsh‚Äôs argument about ‚Äúlimits on the Fed‚Äôs independence to help the govt with its finances.‚Äù Whether those institutional dynamics translate into earlier or deeper rate cuts remains open, but markets have already moved to price odds to 85% for a September cut following the payrolls miss. Kr√ºger‚Äôs longer arc is unabashedly bullish but explicitly conditional on the macro. ‚ÄúI remain bullish on crypto into Q4,‚Äù he wrote, while warning that ETH-linked treasury plays could ‚Äúlose momentum dramatically‚Äù later in the year if goods inflation re-accelerates as corporates pass tariffs through. He set a one-year Bitcoin target for mid-2026 at $200,000‚Äì$250,000‚Äî‚Äúextreme, but possible‚Äù‚Äîon the premise that a more dovish Fed in 2026 would coincide with ongoing adoption. For now, he is treating last week‚Äôs cascade as an echo of 2024‚Äôs Monday bottom. As he put it: ‚ÄúNow let‚Äôs see how this ages.‚Äù At press time, BTC recovered to $ Featured image created with DALL.E, chart from TradingView.com",Cryptocurrency Market News|bitcoin|crypto|Crypto market news|crypto news|Crypto Prices|cryptocurrency|cryptocurrency news|Has The Crypto Market Bottomed?,EN,0,0,MACROECONOMICS|MARKET|BTC|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-08-05 01:00:50

Amid this, attention is turning to Avalanche (AVAX), TRON (TRX), and the emerging altcoin MAGACOIN FINANCE. SEC Increases BlackRock‚Äôs ETF Limit BlackRock‚Äôs iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recently received a significant push as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) increased the limit on ETF options contracts from 25,000 to 250,000. According to analysts at NYDIG, this regulatory move is likely to solidify IBIT‚Äôs lead in the space. The ETF already manages $85.5 billion in assets, more than four times the amount held by its closest competitor, Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC. Last month, the SEC approved in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms for crypto ETFs. Industry commentators view the developments as key to expanding institutional access to digital assets. Avalanche (AVAX) and TRON (TRX): Next Breakout Altcoins? Amid Bitcoin‚Äôs momentum, Avalanche (AVAX) is showing signs of recovery. In a tweet, analyst ‚ÄúThePenguinXBT‚Äù described AVAX‚Äôs price action as a ‚Äúsuper clean correction‚Äù and suggested the altcoin may be preparing for a breakout. As of now, AVAX is trading at $21, having posted 5% gain over the past day. The chart accompanying ThePenguinXBT‚Äôs analysis suggests AVAX could soar to $36 before the end of this year. Likewise, analysts are also seeing bullish potential in TRON (TRX). In a tweet, crypto commentator Lau (@lourdesanchezok) noted that TRX has delivered an 864% return since July 2022 and gained 66% between February and July 2025. Lau attributes this performance to TRON‚Äôs dominance in the stablecoin sector, particularly through its integration with Tether (USDT). As of late July 2025, TRON hosts over 82.69 billion USDT, more than half of Tether‚Äôs total supply. Given the bullish fundamentals around TRON, Lau urges market participants to add some TRX to their portfolios, suggesting more promising performance lies ahead. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Underdog with 10,500% Potential? As AVAX and TRX are gearing up for possible rallies, MAGACOIN FINANCE is another altcoin gaining traction among market watchers. Market analysts are drawing comparisons to Shiba Inu‚Äôs meteoric rise, with forecasts surging up to 10,500% ROI. MAGACOIN FINANCE boasts real-world utility through DeFi features like staking, governance voting, and transparent tokenomics. It has earned a perfect 10/10 TrustScore from independent auditing platforms and passed a comprehensive CertiK audit, further boosting its credibility. It follows a fully community-owned model and aligns with U.S.-based investor narratives. Conclusion BlackRock‚Äôs ETF approval may signal a new chapter for institutional involvement in Bitcoin, but the next big wave could come from altcoins ready to break out. As analysts see bullish potential in Avalanche and TRON, MAGACOIN FINANCE is also gaining momentum and may be the most promising bet for early buyers.

Data released Tuesday showed consumer prices rose 2.1% from a year earlier, down from 2.2% in June and line with economists‚Äô expectations. According to Statistics Korea, core inflation‚Äîwhich strips out volatile food and energy prices‚Äîremained 2% for a second month. ‚ÄúWhile inflation is still slightly above the BOK‚Äôs 2% target, the economy is underperforming and both current and expected inflation remain contained,‚Äù said Bumki Son, economist at Barclays. ‚ÄúThat leaves room to consider a rate cut.‚Äù Trade pressures and a cooling housing market shape monetary policy decisions The cooling inflation comes on the heels of a U.S. agreement to impose 15% tariffs on most Korean imports‚Äîup from 10%‚Äîaverting a worst-case 25% levy once threatened by President Donald Trump. Exports account for over 40% of South Korea‚Äôs GDP, making the economy highly sensitive to external shocks. The BOK paused its rate-cut cycle in June and July, but economists see a potential 25-basis-point reduction at its next policy meeting on August 28. The board is walking a tightrope between shielding the economy from trade pressures and containing a still-hot housing market in Seoul. Governor Rhee Chang-yong has warned against excessive monetary easing, citing risks of reigniting real estate speculation and worsening household debt. Still, Son noted that an October rate cut could be appropriate if inflation expectations stay anchored and signs of recovery persist. Housing prices in Seoul are starting to cool. Data from the Korea Real Estate Board showed apartment prices rose by 0.12% on July 28, down from 0.43% in June. Bloomberg Economics‚Äô Hyosung Kwon said the Bank of Korea is focused on weak growth and may cut rates as early as August if the property market keeps slowing. This year, the Korean won‚Äôs strong performance‚Äîranking among the top gainers versus the U.S. dollar‚Äîhas also given policymakers more room to loosen monetary policy. By category, food and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose 3.5% year-over-year in July, while transportation costs slipped 0.2%. Education prices increased 2.6%, housing-related costs climbed 1.8%, and food and lodging rose 3.2%. Bank of England faces divided views amid rising inflation and rate-cut expectations On other developments, t he Bank of England is expected to lower its main interest rate from 4.25% to 4% on Thursday, with another cut possible before the year ends, even though inflation in June was nearly twice the bank‚Äôs 2% target. However, officials disagree on how much inflation pressure is easing and whether weak growth and a slowing job market might push inflation below target unless rates are cut further. British inflation surged more sharply than in the eurozone or the United States following Russia‚Äôs full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, reaching a peak of 11.1%. This was partly due to the UK‚Äôs heavy reliance on natural gas for heating and electricity. Inflation dropped significantly in 2023, bottoming out at 1.7% in September 2024. Since then, however, it has picked up more than in the US or eurozone, with the Bank of England forecasting in May that inflation would not return to target until early 2027. In June, inflation rose to 3.6%, its highest level since January 2024, and some economists expect it to reach 4% soon. Most Bank of England officials consider surveys of businesses and households‚Äô inflation expectations crucial for predicting future price rises, wage demands, and even the central bank‚Äôs credibility. These measures have risen over the past year, with the Citi/YouGov long-term expectations index near its highest since late 2022‚Äîwhen headline inflation was in double digits‚Äîand the BoE‚Äôs own survey at its highest since 2019.

While many platforms highlight big jackpots and sleek designs, experienced users look beyond surface features. They want fast access to their winnings, full data protection, and verifiable fairness. In 2025, a few platforms stand out for meeting these demands, and Spartans stand at the top. This list breaks down the five safest crypto casinos in 2025, spotlighting Spartans for its unmatched payout speed, fair play transparency, and deep crypto-native structure. 1. Spartans: Fastest Withdrawals and Full Crypto Integration Spartans secures the top position by delivering everything players expect from a crypto casino, without cutting corners. From the start, users are handed full control through wallet-only registration. No card linking. No banking delays. Just pure crypto interaction. The standout feature in 2025 is Spartans‚Äô instant withdrawal system. Payouts move directly to the player‚Äôs wallet without human review or tier restrictions. This eliminates common issues like delayed funds or account freezes, especially for high-volume users. Security doesn‚Äôt stop at withdrawals. Spartans use a provably fair mechanism for all games, whether it‚Äôs slots, blackjack, or crash. With blockchain-based verification built into every outcome, players can validate results themselves. The user experience is clean and efficient. Wallet integration is seamless, account creation is quick, and support is always available. Spartans also runs frequent third-party audits on its games to ensure full compliance and integrity. Players looking for speed, transparency, and real crypto functionality won‚Äôt find a better fit. Spartans removes friction from the betting process, offering a setup where privacy, fairness, and user access come first, every time. 2. Stake.com: Trusted Brand with Slower High-Value Payouts Stake.com holds its place as a major player in the space. Known for its wide game library and community appeal, it remains a trusted platform in 2025. Its provably fair gaming across popular titles helps reinforce transparency for regular users. However, Stake‚Äôs withdrawal system hasn‚Äôt kept pace. High-volume payouts still require manual checks, which slows things down for bigger players. While its security features are solid, two-factor authentication, wallet protection, and secure user accounts, the delays in releasing funds create a bottleneck. For casual gaming and familiar branding, Stake performs well. But for those expecting quick crypto settlements and full decentralization, it may not match the agility of more crypto-native competitors like Spartans. 3. Roobet: Secure Setup with Delayed Large Cashouts Roobet has long prioritized user trust and security. It delivers a smooth crypto gaming experience with reliable platform uptime and a strong lineup of verified games. The use of provably fair systems gives users confidence in every play. The platform works closely with reputable game providers, adding legitimacy to its library. However, users seeking instant access to large payouts might run into friction. Roobet still relies on manual processes for higher withdrawal amounts, which can be a drawback for more serious players. While smaller bettors may not be affected, those winning or depositing at scale will likely notice the difference in processing speed compared to platforms like Spartans. Roobet remains dependable, but its slower withdrawal protocol keeps it from topping the list. 4. 888Casino: Reliable Legacy Operator with Crypto Limits 888Casino brings legacy trust into the digital era. Backed by years of regulated betting history, its platform delivers safe gameplay and responsive customer service. In 2025, it offers BTC and ETH options, expanding into the crypto space with care. Despite this shift, 888Casino still operates with traditional workflows. Crypto withdrawals aren‚Äôt instant and may require ID verification, particularly on large transactions. This slows down what should be a fast-moving process for modern users. For players new to crypto or coming from fiat casinos, 888Casino feels familiar and secure. But for those already accustomed to rapid crypto payouts and minimal red tape, the experience can feel outdated. It‚Äôs a reliable option, but not the fastest or most seamless. 5. BetMGM: Regulated Platform with Limited Crypto Flexibility BetMGM ranks high for safety, thanks to strict licensing and compliance protocols. The platform includes key features like encrypted data protection, two-factor login, and verified account setups. It‚Äôs a well-established name in global betting. However, its crypto adoption remains cautious. Users can deposit and withdraw with crypto, but only through intermediaries. This adds delays and often triggers fees that undermine the benefits of using digital assets. While it‚Äôs ideal for players who trust traditional systems and don‚Äôt mind longer wait times, BetMGM doesn‚Äôt offer the crypto-first feel that users now expect. In contrast, platforms like Spartans provide faster, cleaner access for experienced crypto users. Why Spartans Stands Above the Rest In 2025, the crypto betting landscape is shifting toward platforms that prioritize speed, transparency, and real user control. All five casinos listed here meet high safety standards, but Spartans deliver on every key metric. With instant wallet withdrawals, provably fair games, and seamless crypto usability, Spartans offers a no-compromise experience. It‚Äôs built for those who value their privacy and time. While others offer solid infrastructure, Spartans make security feel effortless and built-in. For players serious about crypto betting, there‚Äôs a clear leader. Spartans isn‚Äôt just safe, it‚Äôs ahead of the curve in how safety should work in the world of digital gambling.

The asset has seen a nearly 4% decline in the past week, marking one of the more notable short-term corrections in recent weeks. Market analysts suggest that, while short-term volatility persists, Bitcoin‚Äôs broader outlook remains influenced by whale activity and long-term holder behavior. Recent on-chain data provided by CryptoQuant highlights significant movement among high-volume Bitcoin traders. Crazzyblockk, a contributor to CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform, analyzed transactions of 1,000 BTC or more and identified a pattern in where large-scale investors, often referred to as whales, prefer to trade. The data shows Binance is the dominant exchange for these transactions, processing both the highest total volume and the largest number of individual whale-level trades across the market. Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‚ÄòNothing To Do Until October‚Äô Binance Emerges as Primary Venue for Whale Transactions According to Crazzyblockk‚Äôs analysis, Binance leads other exchanges by a substantial margin when it comes to whale activity. Over 30 million BTC have moved through Binance in both inflows and outflows, far exceeding figures recorded on competing platforms such as HTX Global and Kraken. While volume alone highlights the scale of transactions, Binance‚Äôs leadership becomes even clearer when measuring transaction count. Data indicates more than 56 million whale transactions have taken place on Binance, compared to roughly 16 million on HTX, making it the most active platform for high-frequency, large-scale trades. This dominance suggests Binance provides unmatched liquidity for big players in the market. As Crazzyblockk noted, ‚ÄúThe concentration of whale activity on Binance provides it with unparalleled liquidity. For traders, this means tighter spreads and a greater ability to execute large orders with minimal price impact.‚Äù The findings indicate that monitoring Binance‚Äôs order book can offer valuable insights into institutional sentiment and potential market movements. Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Sustain Bullish Trend Despite Correction While whale activity dominates short-term price movements, broader market sentiment remains supported by long-term holders (LTH). Another CryptoQuant analyst, Abrahamchart, pointed out that long-term investors continue to hold significant unrealized profits, with the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio staying above 0.5. This indicates that long-term holders are not rushing to sell, helping sustain price support near the $104,000 range. Short-term holders (STH), on the other hand, appear to be taking profits during rallies, contributing to temporary selling pressure and minor corrections such as the latest dip below $113,000.

The proposed token is designed to support a subscription-based rewards program within Truth+, with potential applications across TMTG‚Äôs broader ‚ÄúTruth ecosphere.‚Äù While the filing avoids labeling the token as a full-fledged cryptocurrency, its language strongly suggests blockchain integration. This move marks the clearest crypto pivot for Trump Media to date, following recent developments such as the reported $2 billion Bitcoin treasury allocation and the launch of its fintech arm, Truth.Fi. With increasing political attention on blockchain, the MAGA-aligned push into digital assets is fueling investor interest in related altcoins‚Äîmost notably Litecoin (LTC), XRP, TRON (TRX), and the emerging MAGACOIN FINANCE project. Litecoin (LTC): Bullish Momentum Builds at Resistance Litecoin is showing renewed strength as it tests a long-standing descending resistance trend line dating back to late 2024. After reclaiming the $105 support level in July, LTC is now making its fifth attempt to break above this key technical barrier. A successful breakout could pave the way for a rally toward the $200‚Äì$230 range, particularly given the absence of strong horizontal resistance overhead. Momentum indicators are leaning bullish, though traders remain cautious ahead of confirmation. XRP: Breaks $3, But Analysts Warn of Overheating XRP surged to $3.03 on Monday, outpacing both Bitcoin and Ethereum in daily gains. The breakout above the psychological $3 mark pushed XRP into the spotlight as one of the day‚Äôs top-performing assets. However, some technical analysts caution that the rally may be overheating. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted that XRP‚Äôs MVRV ratio has printed a ‚Äúdeath cross‚Äù‚Äîa pattern that often precedes price corrections. Martinez projects potential support near $2.80, with more stable footing likely around $2.48 if the pullback deepens. TRON (TRX): Bulls Battle Bears Near Key Resistance TRON remains in a tight consolidation phase, trading around $0.3248 and struggling to break above the $0.35 resistance zone. While recent price action has tested this ceiling, bulls have so far failed to establish a convincing breakout. Technical indicators suggest weakening momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is trending downward, hinting at possible exhaustion. Nevertheless, strong support in the $0.3000‚Äì$0.3100 range continues to provide a safety net. A decisive close above $0.35 could trigger upside toward $0.36‚Äì$0.37, but failure to break out may lead to a retest of lower levels MAGACOIN FINANCE: Emerging MAGA-Aligned Token Gains Momentum MAGACOIN FINANCE is quickly emerging as a breakout project in the political-crypto space, aligning with the pro-MAGA and anti-censorship ethos. Promoted as a meme token with real DeFi utility, the project has seen rapid traction across platforms like Telegram and X, drawing early comparisons to projects such as Solana and Shiba Inu. The token stands out from many meme-based coins due to its fundamentals: a perfect 10/10 TrustScore and an ongoing audit by CertiK. With its presale reportedly selling out in phases, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting both speculative interest and longer-term DeFi-focused capital. Some analysts have forecast significant upside potential, citing the token‚Äôs limited supply, early-stage access, and its unique alignment with current political and cultural trends. Conclusion As blockchain and politics continue to intersect, MAGA-aligned crypto projects are carving out a new niche in the digital asset market. MAGACOIN FINANCE appears poised to lead this wave, offering a blend of community-driven innovation and ideological branding. Whether it becomes a lasting player or a momentary phenomenon remains to be seen, but for now, it‚Äôs a project drawing serious attention.

Just as decentralized technologies are reshaping finance, artificial intelligence is redefining how we interact with information and automate tasks. The latest figures from OpenAI underscore this profound shift, signaling a new era of mainstream AI adoption that holds significant implications for every digital domain, including the evolving Web3 space. The Phenomenal Surge in ChatGPT User Adoption OpenAI‚Äôs flagship chatbot, ChatGPT , is on the cusp of a monumental milestone, projected to reach an astounding 700 million weekly active users this week. This figure isn‚Äôt just a number; it represents a staggering acceleration in the embrace of AI by the global populace. Nick Turley, OpenAI‚Äôs VP and head of the ChatGPT app, recently highlighted this impressive trajectory, noting on X that the app had already hit 500 million weekly active users by the end of March. This growth translates to a remarkable fourfold increase in its user base since last year, a testament to its expanding utility and appeal. Turley‚Äôs sentiments capture the essence of this expansion: ""Every day, people and teams are learning, creating, and solving harder problems."" ""Big week ahead."" ""Grateful to the team for making ChatGPT more useful and delivering on our mission so everyone can benefit from AI."" This rapid expansion is not merely organic; it is a direct result of strategic enhancements and continuous innovation from OpenAI. The integration of advanced features has played a pivotal role in drawing in and retaining such a vast user base. What‚Äôs Fueling This Remarkable AI Growth ? The trajectory of ChatGPT ‚Äòs growth can be attributed to several key factors, most notably the continuous refinement and introduction of more powerful capabilities. A significant catalyst was the launch of an upgraded image-generation feature in March, powered by the highly advanced GPT-4 model. This feature allowed users to create compelling visuals directly within the chatbot interface, opening up new avenues for creative expression and practical application. Brad Lightcap, OpenAI‚Äôs COO, provided striking statistics regarding the impact of this new feature. In early April, he revealed that over 130 million users had collectively generated more than 700 million images in just a few days following its release. This demonstrates the immense demand for accessible and powerful generative AI tools. Beyond individual users, ChatGPT has also seen substantial growth in its enterprise segment. Lightcap recently announced that the platform now serves 5 million paying business users, a significant jump from 3 million in June. This increase highlights the growing reliance of businesses on AI for various operations, from content creation and customer service to data analysis and strategic planning. The enterprise adoption signals a broader acceptance of AI as a critical business tool, moving beyond experimental phases into core operational integration. Deep Dive into User Adoption AI Metrics To truly understand the depth of ChatGPT ‚Äòs impact, it is essential to look beyond mere user counts and examine engagement metrics. A recent report by market intelligence firm Sensor Tower provides valuable insights into how deeply integrated ChatGPT has become in users‚Äô daily routines. The report highlighted several compelling statistics: Average Daily Usage: Users are engaging with ChatGPT for more than 12 days a month on average. This places it in an elite category, trailing only digital giants like Google and X (formerly Twitter) in terms of consistent user interaction. Time Spent Per Session: In the first half of 2025, users spent an average of 16 minutes per day on the app. This sustained engagement indicates that users are not just briefly interacting with the chatbot but are dedicating significant time to leverage its capabilities for various tasks. These metrics underscore a profound shift in user behavior. ChatGPT is no longer just a novelty; it has evolved into a staple utility for millions, integrating seamlessly into workflows, learning processes, and creative endeavors. This level of consistent engagement is crucial for any platform‚Äôs long-term viability and points to a future where AI assistants are as ubiquitous as search engines or social media platforms. The Broader Impact of Generative AI on Technology and Beyond The success of ChatGPT is a powerful indicator of the transformative potential of generative AI across various sectors. This technology, capable of creating new content‚Äîbe it text, images, code, or even music‚Äîis not just enhancing existing processes but is enabling entirely new possibilities. For the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, this has profound implications: Smart Contract Development: Generative AI can assist in writing and auditing smart contract code, potentially reducing errors and increasing efficiency. Decentralized Application (dApp) Creation: AI can help developers design and build more intuitive and intelligent dApps, improving user experience. Automated Trading and Analysis: AI-powered bots can analyze vast amounts of market data to execute trades or provide predictive insights, though this comes with its own set of risks. Content Generation for Web3: From creating unique NFTs to drafting whitepapers or marketing copy for blockchain projects, generative AI can streamline content creation. User Support in Crypto Platforms: AI chatbots can provide instant support and answer complex queries for users navigating decentralized finance (DeFi) or NFT marketplaces. The widespread adoption of generative AI also raises important discussions around data privacy, ethical AI development, and the future of work. As these models become more sophisticated and pervasive, ensuring responsible deployment and equitable access will be paramount. OpenAI , as a leader in this field, faces the ongoing challenge of balancing innovation with ethical considerations. What‚Äôs Next for OpenAI and the Future of AI? OpenAI ‚Äòs relentless pursuit of its mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity is clearly reflected in ChatGPT ‚Äòs success. The company continues to push the boundaries of AI research and development, with each new model iteration demonstrating enhanced capabilities and broader applicability. The rapid scaling of ChatGPT ‚Äòs user base provides OpenAI with invaluable data and feedback, which in turn fuels further improvements and innovations. The future of AI, spearheaded by companies like OpenAI , is likely to see even more seamless integration into our daily lives. We can anticipate more personalized AI experiences, more intuitive human-AI interfaces, and AI models capable of tackling increasingly complex real-world problems. The journey from a niche technological marvel to a household utility has been remarkably swift for ChatGPT , setting a precedent for how quickly advanced AI can become indispensable. The Interplay of AI and Web3: A Look Ahead As ChatGPT and other AI models continue their exponential AI growth , the convergence with Web3 technologies becomes an increasingly fascinating area. Imagine AI-driven decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) making decisions, or AI agents managing digital assets within a blockchain framework. The potential for AI to enhance the efficiency, security, and accessibility of decentralized systems is immense. Conversely, blockchain technology can provide AI with decentralized data storage, verifiable computation, and enhanced privacy, creating a symbiotic relationship. The massive user adoption AI has achieved through platforms like ChatGPT means that a significant portion of the global population is now familiar with AI‚Äôs capabilities. This familiarity lowers the barrier to entry for more advanced AI applications, including those integrated with Web3. As more users become comfortable interacting with AI, the path for AI-powered dApps and blockchain solutions becomes clearer. Concluding Thoughts: A New Frontier in Digital Interaction The journey of ChatGPT from an experimental chatbot to a tool nearing 700 million weekly active users is nothing short of revolutionary. It underscores the profound impact of generative AI and the incredible pace of technological evolution. OpenAI ‚Äòs achievement is not just a commercial success; it represents a fundamental shift in how humanity interacts with technology, learns, creates, and solves problems. As this AI growth continues, its implications will reverberate across every industry, including the burgeoning digital asset space, promising a future where intelligent systems play an even more central role in our lives.

Binance has just unveiled an exciting development, adding Succinct (PROVE) as its 31st Binance HODLer Airdrop project. This move brings a fresh opportunity for eligible users, expanding the diverse range of digital assets available through Binance‚Äôs innovative programs. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, understanding these key announcements is vital for every participant looking to optimize their holdings. What is Succinct (PROVE) and Why is Its Binance Listing Significant? Binance, a leading global cryptocurrency exchange, officially announced the selection of Succinct (PROVE) for its latest HODLer Airdrop. This significant event means PROVE crypto will soon be accessible to a broader audience of investors and enthusiasts. The official Binance listing is scheduled for August 5th at 17:00 UTC, a date many are keenly anticipating. A crucial detail to note is the ‚ÄúSeed Tag‚Äù designation accompanying PROVE‚Äôs listing. This tag indicates that Succinct PROVE may exhibit higher volatility and carry increased risk compared to other established tokens on the platform. Therefore, potential participants should approach this new asset with caution and conduct thorough research, understanding that the value can fluctuate significantly. How Does the Binance HODLer Airdrop Program Work? The Binance HODLer Airdrop initiative is designed to reward users who hold specific cryptocurrencies on the Binance platform for a certain period. It is a strategic way for the exchange to incentivize long-term holding, often referred to as ‚ÄúHODLing.‚Äù By participating, users can receive free tokens from new or existing projects, effectively diversifying their portfolios without needing to make direct purchases. For PROVE, this airdrop signifies its introduction to a vast community of dedicated HODLers. It also highlights Binance‚Äôs continuous effort to integrate promising new projects into its ecosystem. Such airdrops can generate significant interest and liquidity for the newly listed token, offering a valuable boost to its initial market presence. How Can You Navigate Risks and Maximize Opportunities with PROVE Crypto? While the prospect of receiving free tokens through crypto airdrops is appealing, it is essential to understand the implications of a Seed Tag. Tokens with this tag are typically newer projects with smaller market capitalizations and less established track records. This characteristic can lead to rapid price swings, both upwards and downwards, making them a higher-risk investment. Investors interested in PROVE crypto , whether through the airdrop or subsequent trading, should carefully consider their individual risk tolerance. Implementing strategies like diversification across different assets and careful position sizing are prudent approaches to manage potential volatility. Despite the inherent risks, early participation in promising projects can offer substantial rewards if the project gains traction and proves its utility within the broader crypto market. What Are Essential Steps to Participate in Future Crypto Airdrops? To ensure you are eligible for future crypto airdrops and can benefit from opportunities like the Binance listing of PROVE, always stay updated with Binance‚Äôs official announcements. Regularly check their news section and ensure your account meets any specific criteria for HODLer Airdrops, such as maintaining minimum balances of certain eligible assets. For example, some airdrops might require holding BNB or other specific tokens. This proactive approach helps you capture potential gains and avoid missing out on valuable distributions. The successful integration of Succinct PROVE into the HODLer Airdrop program underscores the importance of staying informed and active within the Binance ecosystem. Always verify information from official sources to protect yourself from scams and misinformation. Conclusion: An Exciting New Chapter for HODLers Binance‚Äôs decision to add Succinct (PROVE) as its 31st HODLer Airdrop marks another exciting chapter for its users and the broader crypto community. While the Seed Tag indicates a higher risk profile due to its nascent stage, it also signals a potential for significant growth and innovation. As with all crypto investments, diligent research, understanding of market dynamics, and a cautious approach are crucial.

Recently, one such prominent whale made headlines with a truly audacious move: reopening a massive ETH short position just hours after experiencing a partial liquidation. This incident highlights the high-stakes nature of digital asset trading and the conviction some traders hold in their market outlook. What Triggered the Ethereum Liquidation? Earlier today, this particular crypto whale held a substantial 30,000 ETH short position. A short position essentially means the trader profits if the asset‚Äôs price falls. However, the price of Ethereum (ETH) unexpectedly surged, climbing above the $3,700 mark. This upward movement directly challenged the whale‚Äôs bearish bet. The price increase triggered a partial Ethereum liquidation of their position. Liquidation occurs when a trader‚Äôs margin balance falls below the maintenance margin requirement, leading to an automatic closure of part or all of their leveraged position to prevent further losses. This event, confirmed by @EmberCN on X, served as a costly reminder of the volatility inherent in the crypto markets. A Bold ETH Trading Strategy Unveiled What happened next was truly remarkable. Instead of retreating, the whale doubled down. Immediately following the liquidation, the trader injected an additional $3.32 million in USDC margin into their account. This substantial capital injection was not for recovery but for an aggressive re-entry into the market. The whale proceeded to reopen a new, highly leveraged 25x short position, totaling 27,000 ETH. At the time of opening, this new position was valued at an astonishing $100 million. The average entry price for this new bet was $3,637, with a critical liquidation price set at $3,828. This move signals strong conviction in their revised ETH trading strategy , despite the recent setback. Navigating Leveraged Crypto Risks and Market Liquidation The whale‚Äôs decision to re-enter with such significant leverage underscores both the potential rewards and immense risks associated with leveraged crypto trading. A 25x leverage means that for every 1% move in ETH price against the position, the whale‚Äôs capital is impacted by 25%. Consider these points: High Stakes: A $100 million position at 25x leverage means even small price fluctuations can lead to substantial gains or devastating losses. Liquidation Price: The liquidation price of $3,828 is just a few percentage points above the entry price, leaving little room for error. Market Conviction: Reopening a short after a prior market liquidation suggests the whale believes the ETH rally is temporary and a downturn is imminent. This bold maneuver by the crypto whale provides a fascinating case study for anyone observing the Ethereum market. It highlights the aggressive tactics employed by some of the largest players and their willingness to absorb significant risk based on their market analysis. This event serves as a powerful illustration of the high-risk, high-reward environment within cryptocurrency markets. While the whale‚Äôs strategy is undeniably bold, it also carries substantial risk, emphasizing the importance of robust risk management for all traders, regardless of their capital size. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is an ETH short position? An ETH short position is a trading strategy where an investor borrows Ethereum and sells it, hoping to buy it back later at a lower price to return the borrowed ETH and profit from the price difference. It is a bet that the price of Ethereum will fall. What does ‚Äòliquidation‚Äô mean in crypto trading? In crypto trading, liquidation occurs when a trader‚Äôs leveraged position is automatically closed by the exchange or protocol because their collateral (margin) falls below a certain threshold. This happens when the market moves significantly against their position, and it‚Äôs done to prevent the trader‚Äôs balance from going negative. Why would a crypto whale reopen a position after liquidation? A crypto whale might reopen a position after liquidation if they maintain strong conviction in their original market outlook despite the temporary setback. They might view the liquidation as a minor hiccup or a chance to re-enter at a more favorable price, believing the asset will still move in their predicted direction. What are the risks of 25x leveraged crypto trading? Trading with 25x leverage significantly amplifies both potential gains and losses. A small adverse price movement (e.g., 4% against your position) can lead to a complete loss of your collateral (liquidation), making it extremely risky. It requires precise timing and strong risk management. Did you find this deep dive into a crypto whale‚Äôs daring move insightful?

The Crypto Fear & Greed Index offers a fascinating snapshot of investor sentiment, providing a daily barometer for the volatile world of digital assets. Recently, this crucial index, provided by Alternative, registered a reading of 60 on August 5th. While this marks a slight four-point dip from the previous day, it notably keeps the market firmly entrenched in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone. Understanding this index is key to navigating the ever-shifting landscape of cryptocurrency analysis . What Does the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Really Tell Us? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number; it is a sophisticated tool designed to capture the prevailing emotions in the crypto market. It ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 represents ‚ÄòExtreme Fear‚Äô and 100 signifies ‚ÄòExtreme Greed.‚Äô This comprehensive index aggregates data from several critical factors to paint a holistic picture of crypto market sentiment . Here are the key components that contribute to its calculation: Volatility (25%): Measures the current market‚Äôs instability compared to average values. High volatility can signal fear or uncertainty. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Analyzes the current trading volume and market strength. Strong buying volume often indicates greed. Social Media (15%): Scans various platforms for keywords and sentiment related to cryptocurrency. A surge in positive mentions can suggest increasing optimism. Surveys (15%): (Currently paused) Previously gathered investor sentiment directly, offering insights into their outlook. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin‚Äôs share of the total crypto market capitalization. A rising dominance can sometimes indicate a shift towards safer assets during fear, or a strong bullish trend for Bitcoin. Google Trends (10%): Examines search queries related to cryptocurrencies, looking for changes in search volume and associated terms that might reflect market sentiment. Navigating Market Volatility : How Sentiment Impacts Your Strategy A reading of 60, firmly in the ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô zone, suggests that investors are generally optimistic about the market‚Äôs future. While this might sound positive, it also carries implications. High greed levels can sometimes precede market corrections, as excessive optimism can lead to overvaluation. Conversely, extreme fear often presents opportunities for long-term investors to accumulate assets at lower prices. Understanding the current crypto market sentiment allows you to make more informed decisions. For instance: When the index is high (greed), it might be a time to exercise caution and consider profit-taking or reducing exposure to highly speculative assets. When the index is low (fear), it could signal a potential buying opportunity for those with a long-term outlook, as markets tend to rebound from extreme fear. It is important to remember that the index is a tool, not a crystal ball. It provides a valuable perspective on the collective emotional state of the market, but individual investment decisions should always be based on thorough research and risk assessment, not solely on a single indicator. Factors like Bitcoin dominance also play a role in overall market stability. The Role of Bitcoin Dominance in Overall Market Health While the Crypto Fear & Greed Index gives us a broad overview, delving into its components offers deeper insights. For example, Bitcoin dominance , which accounts for 10% of the index, is a crucial metric in cryptocurrency analysis . When Bitcoin‚Äôs dominance rises, it often suggests that capital is flowing out of altcoins and into Bitcoin, possibly due to perceived safety or during a strong Bitcoin-led rally. Conversely, a falling Bitcoin dominance might indicate an ‚Äòaltcoin season‚Äô where investors are more willing to take risks on smaller cryptocurrencies. Observing this metric alongside the overall index can provide a nuanced view of where investor confidence truly lies within the broader crypto ecosystem. It‚Äôs a key piece of the puzzle for any comprehensive cryptocurrency analysis . The Crypto Fear & Greed Index remains an invaluable compass for navigating the dynamic crypto landscape. Its current position at 60, signaling ‚ÄòGreed,‚Äô highlights the prevailing optimism among investors, even with a slight dip. By understanding the underlying factors that contribute to this index, from market volatility to Bitcoin dominance , investors can better gauge the collective mood and make more strategic decisions. Always combine this insight with your own diligent research to build a resilient investment strategy in the exciting world of digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A1: The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a tool that measures the prevailing emotional state of the cryptocurrency market, ranging from ‚ÄòExtreme Fear‚Äô (0) to ‚ÄòExtreme Greed‚Äô (100). Q2: How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index calculated? A2: It‚Äôs calculated using six key factors: volatility, market momentum/volume, social media sentiment, surveys (currently paused), Bitcoin dominance, and Google Trends data, each weighted differently. Q3: What does a ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô reading on the index mean? A3: A ‚ÄòGreed‚Äô reading, like the current 60, indicates that investors are generally optimistic and eager to buy cryptocurrencies. However, high greed can sometimes signal a market that is becoming overvalued. Q4: Can I use the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to make investment decisions? A4: The index is a valuable sentiment indicator, but it should be used as one tool among many. Always combine its insights with thorough personal research, fundamental analysis, and risk assessment before making investment decisions. Q5: Why is Bitcoin dominance included in the index? A5: Bitcoin dominance is included because it reflects capital flows between Bitcoin and altcoins, providing insight into where investor confidence is concentrated within the broader crypto market.

A draft of the order, viewed by The Wall Street Journal , instructs bank regulators to investigate whether financial institutions have breached laws like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust statutes or consumer protection rules. Banks found in violation could face fines, consent decrees or other penalties. Bank of America Case Resurfaces in Draft Order While the order does not name any specific banks, it references cases that have drawn political attention in recent years. Exclusive: The White House is preparing to step up pressure against big banks over perceived discrimination against conservatives and crypto companies with an executive order https://t.co/Flha5sPtCN ‚Äî The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) August 4, 2025 Among them is a 2023 accusation that Bank of America shut down the accounts of a Christian charity operating in Uganda, according to WSJ. The bank responded by saying the closure was due to its policy of not serving small businesses located overseas. The draft also takes issue with the role certain financial institutions played in federal investigations surrounding the Jan. 6 Capitol riots. It presses regulators to eliminate any internal policies that may have contributed to the exclusion of customers based on reputational or ideological concerns. The Journal reported that the order could be signed as soon as this week, though delays remain possible. Banks Cite Risk, AML Rules in Defense This issue of ‚Äúde-banking‚Äù has been a longstanding complaint among conservative groups, which argue that their accounts and donations are often restricted or terminated without clear justification. Crypto firms have also raised alarm over what they see as unofficial pressure from regulators that has pushed banks to quietly cut ties with blockchain startups, particularly since the collapse of crypto-friendly institutions like Silvergate and Signature Bank. Banks, meanwhile, have defended these decisions as risk-based, citing compliance with anti-money-laundering regulations and federal scrutiny of emerging sectors like digital assets. They have pointed to existing regulatory frameworks that make onboarding crypto clients especially difficult, with heightened know-your-customer and transaction monitoring expectations. Banking Rules Face Shake-Up in Politicization Fight The draft order adds further pressure. It directs the Small Business Administration to examine how banks handle loan guarantees. This area is especially important for crypto startups and conservative nonprofit groups that rely on access to financial services. During President Trump‚Äôs presidency, banking regulators made a key policy change. They announced they would stop evaluating banks based on the reputational risks of their customers. Previously, banks had used this as a reason to avoid certain clients or industries. Additionally, the draft gives regulators the power to refer certain cases directly to the Department of Justice. In April, the Justice Department launched a task force in Virginia. This team was set up to investigate claims that banks had denied services or credit access based on impermissible factors. Though the draft is not yet final, it signals a broader federal effort. Critics say this effort aims to curb the growing politicization of financial services. If enacted, the order would mark a big moment in the ongoing debate over free speech, financial access and the role of banking institutions in a polarized political climate.

A recent ruling has added to the legal troubles of the Bitsonic CEO, Shin, who received an additional six-month prison term. This new Bitsonic CEO sentence comes for fraud related to the exchange‚Äôs native token, Bitsonic Coin (BSC), highlighting the severe consequences of manipulating digital markets. This case underscores the crucial need for transparency and ethical conduct within the crypto space, especially concerning crypto exchange fraud . What Led to the Bitsonic CEO‚Äôs Extended Sentence? On July 18, the Daegu District Court delivered its verdict, adding six months to Shin‚Äôs existing prison term. This specific ruling focused on his fraudulent activities involving Bitsonic Coin (BSC). The court found him guilty of actions designed to mislead investors and manipulate the token‚Äôs value. It is important to remember that Shin is already serving a substantial seven-year sentence. The Supreme Court finalized this prior conviction in October 2024. That initial case centered on a massive 10 billion won ($7.2 million) fraud. In that instance, Shin was found to have misappropriated exchange funds. He used these funds to buy back BSC, artificially inflating its price and trading volume. This blatant act of token manipulation aimed to create a false sense of demand and stability for the token, deceiving countless investors. The latest sentence reinforces the legal system‚Äôs commitment to holding individuals accountable for their actions in the digital asset landscape. It signals a clear message that such fraudulent practices will not go unpunished, further emphasizing the risks associated with unchecked power within crypto platforms. Why Does This Bitsonic Coin Scam Matter to the Crypto Community? The ongoing legal saga of the Bitsonic CEO serves as a stark reminder of the risks present in the cryptocurrency market. For investors, it highlights the importance of thorough due diligence before engaging with any exchange or token. Cases like the Bitsonic Coin scam erode trust in the broader digital asset ecosystem, making it harder for legitimate projects to gain traction. This situation also puts a spotlight on the regulatory challenges faced by governments worldwide. South Korea, a significant player in the crypto space, is actively working to establish clearer frameworks to prevent such incidents. The additional sentence for the Bitsonic CEO demonstrates the judiciary‚Äôs increasing understanding and firm stance on complex financial crimes involving digital assets. Key takeaways for the community include: Enhanced Scrutiny: Investors must be more vigilant about the legitimacy and operational transparency of crypto platforms. Regulatory Evolution: Governments are adapting laws to address digital asset crimes effectively. Accountability: Leaders of crypto entities are not immune to legal repercussions for fraudulent activities. Combating Crypto Crime: Lessons from South Korea‚Äôs Approach South Korea has been at the forefront of crypto adoption and, consequently, crypto-related legal battles. The nation‚Äôs legal system has shown a growing resolve to prosecute individuals involved in South Korea crypto crime , ranging from market manipulation to outright fraud. The Bitsonic CEO‚Äôs multiple convictions are a testament to this commitment. This case also underscores the sophisticated nature of modern financial fraud. Manipulating native tokens, creating artificial trading volumes, and misappropriating funds are complex schemes that require dedicated investigative and judicial resources. The ability of the courts to untangle these intricate webs of deception is crucial for protecting consumers and maintaining market integrity. Preventing future incidents of crypto exchange fraud requires a multi-pronged approach: Stronger Internal Controls: Exchanges need robust systems to prevent insider trading and fund misuse. Clearer Regulations: Governments must provide explicit guidelines for token issuance, trading, and exchange operations. Investor Education: Empowering individuals with knowledge to identify red flags and understand risks is vital. The continued legal actions against the Bitsonic CEO are a powerful deterrent, sending a strong message across the global crypto industry. Conclusion: Upholding Integrity in the Digital Realm The additional prison sentence for the Bitsonic CEO marks another critical step in addressing fraud within the cryptocurrency industry. This ruling, combined with his existing seven-year term for significant financial misappropriation and token manipulation , reinforces the legal consequences for those who exploit the trust of investors. As the digital asset space matures, such decisive legal actions are essential for fostering a more secure and trustworthy environment. They serve as a stark reminder that accountability is paramount, ensuring that bad actors face justice and helping to build a more resilient future for crypto.

A new White House executive order is reportedly on its way, aiming to tackle a persistent challenge: bank bias against crypto firms . This crucial move could reshape how financial services interact with the digital asset industry, ensuring fairer access for everyone. What is This White House Executive Order All About? The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the White House is preparing a pivotal White House executive order . This order intends to penalize banks that unfairly cut off customers, including crypto firms , based on political concerns rather than legitimate financial risks. It signals a strong stance against discriminatory practices in the financial sector. The draft order directs regulators to investigate if such actions violate existing laws. These include credit, antitrust, or consumer protection statutes. Banks found in violation could face fines or other penalties. This initiative aims to level the playing field, ensuring that all legitimate businesses, including those in the crypto space, have access to essential financial services . Why Do Banks Show Bank Bias Against Crypto Firms? Banks, on their part, argue that their decisions stem from legitimate legal and compliance risks. They often cite strict anti-money laundering (AML) rules as a primary concern. The perceived reputational risk of dealing with certain emerging industries has also been a major factor. Historically, regulators pressured banks to avoid ‚Äúhigh-risk‚Äù sectors, leading to a cautious approach. While the Trump administration later clarified that reputational risk would no longer be a sole basis for evaluation, the hesitation among banks regarding crypto firms persists. This long-standing bank bias has made it difficult for many legitimate crypto firms to secure traditional banking relationships. Impact on Crypto Firms and Financial Services This potential White House executive order could be a game-changer for crypto firms . It may open doors to more stable and accessible financial services . For years, many crypto businesses struggled to find banks willing to work with them, hindering growth and innovation. The order aims to foster a more inclusive financial ecosystem. Here are some potential benefits: Increased access: Crypto businesses may find it easier to secure traditional banking services. Reduced risk: The threat of sudden account closures for crypto firms could diminish significantly. Greater stability: This could lead to more stable business operations within the digital asset space. Mainstream adoption: Easier banking access supports the broader adoption of digital assets. This shift could also benefit the broader financial services landscape by encouraging a more nuanced understanding of risk rather than blanket rejections. Navigating Future Regulatory Scrutiny While the executive order promises positive change, it also highlights an era of increased regulatory scrutiny for banks.

This crucial metric, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered 43 at 00:38 UTC on August 5th. This marks an increase of three points from the previous day, as reported by Bitcoin World, further solidifying Bitcoin‚Äôs current dominance. For many in the crypto community, understanding these market cycles is key to informed cryptocurrency investment decisions. So, what exactly does an index score of 43 tell us about the broader crypto market trends ? Understanding the Altcoin Season Index : What Does it Mean? The Altcoin Season Index is a powerful tool designed to help investors gauge whether the broader altcoin market is outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. It provides a clear snapshot of market sentiment and capital flow. The index works by comparing the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap, excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens, over the past 90 days. Here‚Äôs how the index defines the seasons: Altcoin Season: This occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the last 90 days. The index score typically ranges from 75 to 100. Bitcoin Season: Conversely, a Bitcoin Season is declared when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. The index score for this period falls between 1 and 25. An index score between 26 and 74 suggests a mixed or transitional market, where neither Bitcoin nor altcoins show clear dominance. The current reading of 43 firmly places the market in a Bitcoin Season , indicating that Bitcoin is largely leading the charge. Why the Current Bitcoin Season Matters for Your Portfolio When the market enters a Bitcoin Season , it typically means that Bitcoin is capturing the majority of new capital inflows and investor attention. This often results in Bitcoin‚Äôs price appreciating at a faster rate than most altcoins, or even altcoins experiencing declines while Bitcoin holds steady or grows. This trend significantly impacts overall altcoin performance . During such periods, many altcoins might struggle to gain traction, even those with strong fundamentals. Investors often de-risk by moving funds into Bitcoin, perceived as a safer, more established asset within the volatile crypto space. This can lead to: Reduced trading volume for many altcoins. Stagnant or declining prices for a broad range of alternative cryptocurrencies. Increased Bitcoin dominance, meaning Bitcoin holds a larger percentage of the total crypto market capitalization. Understanding this dynamic is crucial for managing risk and positioning your cryptocurrency investment portfolio effectively. Navigating Crypto Market Trends : Strategies for Each Season Recognizing whether it‚Äôs an Altcoin Season or a Bitcoin Season allows investors to adapt their strategies. While no indicator is foolproof, the Altcoin Season Index provides valuable insight for navigating complex crypto market trends . During a Bitcoin Season (like now): Focus on Bitcoin: Consider accumulating Bitcoin or allocating a larger portion of your portfolio to it. Research Altcoins: Use this time to research promising altcoin projects with strong fundamentals, preparing for a potential future Altcoin Season. Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Continue to DCA into your preferred altcoins to average down your entry price. Avoid FOMO: Resist the urge to chase small altcoin pumps, as they might be short-lived. During a potential Altcoin Season: Diversify Wisely: Spread your investments across a basket of strong altcoins. Rotate Profits: As certain altcoins pump, consider taking some profits and rebalancing your portfolio. Monitor Bitcoin Dominance: A declining Bitcoin dominance often signals the onset of Altcoin Season. Remember, patience and strategic planning are vital in any market condition. Informed cryptocurrency investment decisions are always based on thorough research and a clear understanding of market indicators. Beyond the Index: Factors Influencing Altcoin Performance While the Altcoin Season Index is a helpful guide, it‚Äôs just one piece of the puzzle. Several other factors contribute to overall altcoin performance and the broader crypto market trends . These include: Macroeconomic Conditions: Global economic stability, inflation, interest rates, and regulatory news can significantly impact investor sentiment towards riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin Dominance: Bitcoin‚Äôs market capitalization relative to the total crypto market. A rising dominance often precedes or accompanies a Bitcoin Season. Technological Advancements: Breakthroughs in blockchain technology, new layer-2 solutions, or innovative decentralized applications can drive specific altcoins higher. Narratives and Hype: Emerging trends like AI integration, GameFi, NFTs, or specific blockchain ecosystems can temporarily boost certain altcoins. Therefore, while the index provides a broad overview, a holistic approach that considers these external factors is essential for making sound cryptocurrency investment choices. In conclusion, the current Altcoin Season Index reading of 43 clearly indicates that we are in a Bitcoin Season . This phase highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs current market leadership and impacts altcoin performance across the board. By understanding the implications of this metric and combining it with broader market analysis, investors can better navigate the ever-evolving crypto market trends and make more strategic cryptocurrency investment decisions. Stay informed, stay strategic, and always conduct your own research. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Altcoin Season Index?

The company, led by CEO Henry Chang, recently announced a substantial NEXUS Bitcoin purchase , signaling a strategic shift in its treasury management. This decision comes alongside their latest Q2 earnings update , which offers a glimpse into their financial health and forward-looking strategies. Understanding NEXUS‚Äôs Financial Landscape and Bitcoin Investment NEXUS‚Äôs second-quarter financial report, as detailed by local media outlet Inven, revealed some key figures. The blockchain gaming company reported 9.3 billion won (approximately $6.7 million) in revenue, demonstrating its operational scale. Despite achieving 300 million won (around $216,000) in operating profit, the company recorded a net loss of 1.9 billion won (about $1.4 million) for the quarter. However, what truly captured attention was the strategic decision outlined in their earnings report: NEXUS has adopted a novel treasury strategy. This strategy maintains a 50:50 allocation between Bitcoin and stablecoins. On August 5th, NEXUS‚Äôs board officially approved a 3 billion won (roughly $2.2 million) Bitcoin investment as part of this approach. This move positions NEXUS as one of the pioneers among gaming companies embracing digital assets for treasury management. What Does This Crypto Treasury Strategy Mean? The adoption of a crypto treasury strategy that balances Bitcoin with stablecoins is a notable development. Traditionally, corporate treasuries focus on low-risk, liquid assets like cash, bonds, and money market instruments. However, as the digital asset landscape matures, some forward-thinking companies are exploring Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation or a potential growth asset. For NEXUS, this strategy likely serves multiple purposes: Diversification: Adding Bitcoin diversifies their asset holdings beyond traditional fiat currencies. Inflation Hedge: Bitcoin is often seen as a potential hedge against inflation, protecting the company‚Äôs purchasing power over time. Alignment with Industry: As a blockchain gaming company, holding Bitcoin aligns with their core business and technological ethos. Growth Potential: While volatile, Bitcoin offers significant long-term growth potential compared to traditional treasury assets. This proactive approach highlights NEXUS‚Äôs confidence in the long-term value proposition of digital currencies. The Significance of NEXUS‚Äôs Bitcoin Purchase The $2.2 million NEXUS Bitcoin purchase is not just a financial transaction; it sends a strong message. It indicates that even amidst a challenging market, companies are increasingly recognizing Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a legitimate treasury asset. This decision by a prominent blockchain gaming company could encourage other firms in the gaming and tech sectors to consider similar strategies. Moreover, it underscores a growing trend of institutional adoption within the cryptocurrency space. When companies like NEXUS allocate a significant portion of their treasury to Bitcoin, it lends credibility and stability to the broader crypto market. It reflects a maturing understanding of digital assets beyond speculative trading. Looking Ahead: Implications of a Bold Crypto Treasury Strategy NEXUS‚Äôs decision could have ripple effects. Other gaming and technology companies might observe this move closely, potentially leading to similar strategies. The bold crypto treasury strategy could set a precedent, particularly for businesses operating within the blockchain ecosystem. While the Q2 earnings update showed a net loss, the strategic Bitcoin acquisition suggests a long-term vision. It‚Äôs a calculated risk that, if successful, could significantly enhance the company‚Äôs financial resilience and market position in the future. As the blockchain gaming sector continues to evolve, companies that embrace innovative financial strategies like NEXUS‚Äôs might gain a competitive edge. In Conclusion: A Strategic Leap Forward NEXUS‚Äôs recent actions demonstrate a clear commitment to integrating digital assets into its core financial operations. The substantial NEXUS Bitcoin purchase , combined with their balanced crypto treasury strategy , positions the blockchain gaming company as a forward-thinking entity. This strategic move, announced in their latest Q2 earnings update , highlights a growing trend of corporate confidence in Bitcoin as a viable asset class, setting an exciting precedent for the broader digital economy.

Binance Coin (BNB) remains stable, with forecasts powered by AI and macro trend analysis estimating a possible range between $700 and $900. BNB‚Äôs integrated function within the Binance platform keeps demand resilient. Meanwhile, PEPE‚Äôs recent 5% decline hasn‚Äôt deterred large-scale buyers, with whales acquiring over 2.8 trillion tokens in a single day, possibly hinting at a rebound. What‚Äôs turning heads is Cold Wallet ($CWT). Following a $270 million buyout of Plus Wallet and its robust rewards framework, it‚Äôs setting a fresh standard for user-focused crypto tools. Without relying on complexity, Cold Wallet merges growth potential with usability. BNB Eyes Higher Ground: Will the Upside Hold? Binance Coin (BNB) continues to draw interest as projections for 2025 suggest it could break into the $700‚Äì$900 bracket if favorable trends persist. AI-backed and historical analysis support this estimate. With current prices hovering around $560, BNB maintains steady growth amid broader market fluctuations. This forecast reflects factors such as reduced supply, consistent usage, and its core functionality within Binance‚Äôs ecosystem. It‚Äôs also gaining more use through fee discounts and bridging support. For those seeking stability in crypto‚Äôs top tier, BNB‚Äôs structured role offers appeal. Should Bitcoin rally and exchange activity rise, BNB could outperform its peers. Still, price swings are expected, and short-term retracements remain possible. PEPE Faces Drop, But Whale Buys Signal Hope PEPE slid roughly 5% over the past day and now trades near 0.0000011, as meme coin selling pressure intensifies. Despite the slide, blockchain data reveals that whales snapped up over 2.8 trillion PEPE during the same window, suggesting strategic buying. With a market cap above $480 million and trading activity holding steady, some analysts see this as early-stage accumulation. While volatility likely remains, strong whale interest could lend near-term support. Those tracking meme tokens often follow whale activity as a predictive tool. Cold Wallet Tackles Crypto Complexity with User-Centric Design Cold Wallet is addressing what many ignore: making wallets truly easy. Through its $270 million Plus Wallet acquisition, over 2 million new users joined its platform. While alternatives like MetaMask and Trust Wallet face usability complaints, Cold Wallet takes a cleaner route, focused on speed, clarity, and reward. There are no complex toggles or learning curves. Every action, from swaps to ramps, generates automatic Cold Wallet rewards. Perks begin from the start. As user activity grows, rewards scale up, from basic cashback to full gas refunds at the Diamond level. It‚Äôs designed for simplicity and daily use, not just experts. Now priced at $0.00942 in Stage 16, Cold Wallet‚Äôs presale follows strong momentum after the acquisition. Users tired of clunky interfaces and costly fees may find a real alternative here. Rather than chasing hype, Cold Wallet prioritizes long-term satisfaction through ease. Wrapping Up! Cold Wallet‚Äôs traction isn‚Äôt just in user count, it‚Äôs in its mission. The $270 million Plus Wallet merger secures global access and 2 million new users. While BNB‚Äôs strength lies in exchange integration and PEPE stirs excitement with large buys during dips, Cold Wallet offers lasting value through its design that pays users back. From instant cashback to fee-free swaps and an early price of $0.00942 in Stage 16, it converts costs into benefits. If usability becomes the defining factor in crypto adoption, Cold Wallet might be the standout platform heading into 2025. Crypto presale funding has now exceeded $5.7 million, with over 658 million coins already sold. Listing price is set at $0.3517.

Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Is Back In Greed Region The ‚ÄúFear & Greed Index‚Äù refers to an indicator created by Alternative that keeps track of the net sentiment present among the traders in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency markets. Related Reading: XRP MVRV Flashes Death Cross: More Decline Ahead? The metric uses data of these five factors to determine the investor mentality: trading volume, volatility, market cap dominance, social media sentiment, and Google Trends. To represent the sentiment, it uses a numerical scale running from zero to hundred. All values above 54 correspond to greed among the investors, while those under 46 to fear in the market. The region between the two cutoffs corresponds to a net neutral trader sentiment. Besides these three main zones, there are also two ‚Äòextreme‚Äô territories called the extreme greed and extreme fear. The former occurs above 75 and the latter below 25. Historically, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have tended to move in the direction that goes contrary to the expectations of the majority. The likelihood of such a contrary moving occurring has also only gone up the more sure the investors have become of the asset‚Äôs direction. As such, when the Fear & Greed Index is in the extreme zones, tops and bottoms can be probable to occur. Investors using a trading technique called contrarian investing exploit this fact. Warren Buffet‚Äôs famous quote encapsulates the idea: ‚Äúbe fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.‚Äù Now, here is how the current cryptocurrency market sentiment looks, according to the Fear & Greed Index: As is visible above, the Fear & Greed Index has a value of 64, which suggests that the investors as a whole share a sentiment of greed. The picture was different just yesterday, when the market held a neutral mentality. The weekend low of 53 in the metric was likely a result of the bearish action in Bitcoin that took its price to $112,000. Similarly, the return of greed may be caused by the slight recovery in the asset. The Fear & Greed Index spent July in and around the extreme greed zone, ending the month at a value of 72. Given this trend, the plunge this month may be an effect of the streak of optimism among the investors.

According to Dune Analytics, the surge is fueled by the integration of Zora and Farcaster into the new Base App, which streamlines ‚Äú SocialFi ‚Äù experiences for everyday creators. Zora‚Äôs ERC-20 ‚ÄúCreator Coins‚Äù allow users to mint social tokens directly from posts‚Äîtriggering over 1.6 million new tokens, 3 million+ traders, and $470 million in volume in just weeks.The result is a growing shift from speculative meme coins to content-based monetization ecosystems. While Solana still excels in transaction throughput, Coinbase‚Äôs pivot toward creator-first Web3 platforms signals a new path forward ‚Äì where social engagement becomes the value layer. This shift is also pushing retail and institutional traders to look beyond traditional Layer-1s for early-stage plays with higher upside. Among these, MAGACOIN FINANCE is increasingly viewed as a standout . Avalanche and Cardano could benefit next Analysts suggest Avalanche and Cardano are well-positioned to ride the next SocialFi expansion. Avalanche‚Äôs subnets have become key infrastructure for scalable app development, while Cardano‚Äôs push toward Midnight (privacy Layer-2) and Hydra (scalability) keeps its roadmap compelling . But despite their long-term promise, many investors now question whether these networks can still deliver exponential gains ‚Äì especially when newer tokens can move faster and more aggressively in the market. New Project filling at lightning speed As Solana and Litecoin traders rotate out of older assets, MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs early rounds are filling at lightning speed , drawing big attention for its combination of viral branding and early-stage momentum. Recent weeks have seen a sharp uptick in demand, with new wallet creation and on-chain interaction rates pushing participation to all-time highs. Unlike mature Layer-1s, MAGACOIN FINANCE remains in its early growth phase ‚Äì yet has already drawn comparisons to early SHIBA due to its fast-growing community. What sets MAGACOIN FINANCE apart is its timing and trajectory. This kind of allocation slots are dwindling rapidly, and the project has become a top pick among traders seeking aggressive ROI beyond what Solana or Litecoin can offer. For those searching for outsized returns and low-entry cost, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers a path few older tokens can match in 2025. Zora, Avalanche, and Cardano ride the SocialFi momentum As Base redefines the SocialFi landscape, projects like Zora, Avalanche, and Cardano are emerging as key beneficiaries of this ecosystem shift. Zora‚Äôs rapid rise in daily active users and token volume makes it the current poster child for creator-led crypto models. Meanwhile, Avalanche is gaining traction through subnet deployments that support scalable app layers, and Cardano continues to innovate with Hydra and its Midnight privacy layer. While none have yet replicated Solana‚Äôs previous NFT dominance, analysts note that the momentum is building. This opens the door for value investors and traders to explore opportunities early ‚Äì before these ecosystems fully capture the next wave of SocialFi capital and retail inflows. Momentum is quietly shifting beneath the surface. Why some investors prefer early-stage tokens SocialFi leaders like Zora, as well as networks like Avalanche and Cardano, each play a role in the future of decentralized applications. However, with billions already priced in, many analysts believe their potential for big gains is now modest. MAGACOIN FINANCE, by contrast, is in its launch window ‚Äì with early projections targeting significantly larger returns . The opportunity to get in before listings and exchange access is what separates average gains from life-changing ones .

This unexpected activity from such an old wallet always sparks immense interest and debate across the crypto market . What does it mean when a wallet that has held its Bitcoin for so long decides to move a portion of its substantial holdings? What Exactly Happened with This Dormant Bitcoin Wallet? On-chain analysts have been buzzing about a particular wallet that remained untouched for a staggering 14.5 years. This wallet, which held 3,963 BTC, made its first significant BTC movement in over a decade. The initial activity was a small test transaction of 0.001 BTC, followed just 10 hours later by a much larger transfer. Initial Test: A tiny 0.001 BTC moved, likely to confirm wallet access and functionality. Main Transfer: 108 BTC, valued at approximately $12.42 million, was sent to an address linked with Wintermute, a prominent crypto market maker. Remaining Holdings: The wallet still holds a massive 3,360 BTC, currently worth around $385 million. This substantial remaining balance is what truly captures attention. This kind of long-dormant wallet activity is rare and often signals a shift in the holder‚Äôs strategy or intentions. It provides valuable on-chain insights into potential future market dynamics. Why Does This BTC Movement Matter for Crypto Market Analysis? When a long-inactive dormant Bitcoin wallet stirs, it naturally raises questions about its potential impact on the broader market. Such a large BTC movement from a historical holder can be interpreted in several ways, each carrying different implications for crypto market analysis . Potential Selling Pressure: The most common speculation is that this movement precedes a larger sale. If the remaining 3,360 BTC were to enter the market, it could create significant selling pressure, potentially affecting Bitcoin‚Äôs price. Strategic Reallocation: Alternatively, the whale might be reallocating assets for diversification, institutional investment, or even moving them to a more secure or liquid platform. Wintermute, being a market maker, could facilitate various strategic moves beyond a simple sell-off. Market Sentiment: Regardless of the true intent, the sheer act of a Bitcoin whale moving such old coins can influence market sentiment. Traders and investors closely watch these movements for clues about future price action. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone involved in the digital asset space. What Can On-Chain Insights Tell Us About This Whale‚Äôs Intentions? The world of blockchain provides unparalleled transparency through on-chain data . While we cannot know the exact identity or motivation of this Bitcoin whale , the patterns of their transactions offer crucial clues. The initial small test transaction, for instance, is a classic sign of someone verifying access to an old wallet before a larger transfer. This indicates a deliberate, planned action rather than an accidental one. The transfer to a Wintermute-linked address is particularly noteworthy. Wintermute is a major player in crypto trading, providing liquidity and acting as an intermediary for large institutional and individual trades. This connection suggests a sophisticated move, possibly involving: OTC Deals: Over-the-counter (OTC) desks are often used by whales to execute large trades without impacting market prices directly. Lending/Borrowing: The BTC could be used as collateral for loans or other DeFi activities. Custodial Services: The whale might be moving funds to a more secure, managed custodial solution. Future movements from the remaining 3,360 BTC will be keenly observed, as they will provide further on-chain insights into the whale‚Äôs long-term strategy and its potential ripple effects on the crypto market . The recent activation of a 14.5-year dormant Bitcoin wallet and its subsequent $12.42 million BTC movement serves as a powerful reminder of the hidden giants within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. While the immediate impact on the market remains to be seen, this event highlights the importance of on-chain analysis in understanding potential shifts. The remaining 3,360 BTC in the wallet will be keenly observed, as any further movement could significantly influence market sentiment and price. This awakening also underscores the long-term conviction of early Bitcoin adopters who held their assets through numerous market cycles. As the crypto space evolves, every significant move from these venerable wallets adds another layer to the complex narrative of digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a dormant Bitcoin whale? A dormant Bitcoin whale refers to a cryptocurrency wallet holding a very large amount of Bitcoin that has remained inactive, meaning no transactions have occurred from it, for an extended period, often many years. The term ‚Äòwhale‚Äô signifies the substantial size of the holdings. Why is this particular BTC movement significant? This BTC movement is significant because the wallet had been dormant for 14.5 years, representing a very early adopter of Bitcoin. Any activity from such an old, large holder can signal potential market shifts, new strategies by the holder, or simply a reactivation of long-forgotten funds. What is Wintermute‚Äôs role in this BTC transfer? Wintermute is a major algorithmic market maker in the cryptocurrency space. The transfer of 108 BTC to a Wintermute-linked address suggests the whale might be preparing for a large-scale over-the-counter (OTC) sale, seeking liquidity, or utilizing Wintermute‚Äôs services for strategic asset management without directly impacting open market prices. Will this Bitcoin whale‚Äôs activity affect BTC price? While the initial 108 BTC transfer is relatively small compared to Bitcoin‚Äôs daily trading volume, the fact that the wallet still holds 3,360 BTC (over $385 million) prompts speculation of a larger sale. If a significant portion of these remaining funds were to be sold on exchanges, it could potentially create selling pressure and affect Bitcoin‚Äôs price, though this is not guaranteed. How can on-chain analysis help understand whale movements? On-chain analysis involves examining public blockchain data to gain insights into cryptocurrency transactions, wallet activity, and market trends. For whale movements, it helps track large transfers, identify dormant wallets, and speculate on the intentions behind significant transactions, providing valuable data for crypto market analysis .

Despite new regulatory frameworks, these companies are confidently navigating the rules, ensuring their users can still earn from their crypto holdings. This ongoing commitment highlights a key trend in the evolving digital asset space, providing clarity for those interested in earning through crypto stablecoins . Understanding the Stablecoin Rewards Landscape Recent legislative efforts, specifically the GENIUS Act, aim to regulate the digital asset market, including stablecoins. A notable provision in this act prohibits stablecoin issuers from paying yield directly to holders. This has raised questions about the future of earning opportunities for users. However, companies like Coinbase and PayPal have a distinct interpretation of this rule, focusing on their role as non-issuers. Both Coinbase and PayPal have clearly stated their position: they do not issue the stablecoins available on their platforms. Circle issues USDC, while Paxos issues PYUSD. This distinction is crucial to their strategy. By not being the direct issuers, they argue that the incentives they provide are structured as ‚Äúrewards‚Äù rather than traditional interest or yield. This approach allows them to continue offering attractive returns to their user base. For instance, Coinbase currently provides U.S. users with a competitive 4.1% annual return on their USDC deposits. Similarly, PayPal launched its program earlier this year, offering a 3.7% return on PYUSD. These offerings remain significant for users seeking ways to earn passively from their digital assets, reinforcing the appeal of stablecoin yield programs. How Do Coinbase and PayPal Maintain Stablecoin Rewards? The core of Coinbase and PayPal‚Äôs strategy lies in their classification as platforms facilitating access to stablecoins, not as the creators of these digital currencies. This legal nuance allows them to bypass the direct issuer prohibition. They act as intermediaries, connecting users with stablecoins and then structuring programs that incentivize holding these assets on their platforms. Their executives have emphasized this point during recent earnings calls, reassuring investors and users alike. They frame their offerings as ‚Äúrewards‚Äù for platform engagement and stablecoin adoption, rather than a yield derived from the issuance itself. This subtle but significant difference is key to their compliance strategy. Consider the benefits for users: Consistent Earnings: Users can continue to earn competitive returns on their stablecoin holdings. Accessibility: Major platforms make it easy for a broad audience to participate. Clarity: The companies are transparent about their operational model regarding these rewards. This model ensures that users can still benefit from Coinbase stablecoin rewards and PayPal stablecoin rewards without direct involvement in the issuance process. What This Means for Crypto Stablecoins and Future Regulations The stance taken by Coinbase and PayPal sets an interesting precedent within the evolving regulatory landscape for crypto stablecoins . It highlights the complexities of applying traditional financial regulations to decentralized or semi-decentralized digital assets. As regulators continue to define the boundaries, such interpretations will likely shape future policy discussions. For users, this means continued opportunities to earn from stablecoins. However, it also underscores the importance of understanding the underlying mechanics of these reward programs. It‚Äôs crucial to differentiate between yield offered by an issuer and rewards offered by a platform facilitating access. Looking ahead, the industry will closely watch how these interpretations are received by regulators. The ability of non-issuing platforms to offer attractive stablecoin yield could become a blueprint for other financial technology companies entering the crypto space. This ongoing dialogue between innovation and regulation is vital for the growth and stability of the digital asset economy. In conclusion, Coinbase and PayPal are actively navigating the new regulatory environment by emphasizing their role as non-issuers of stablecoins. Their commitment to providing attractive stablecoin rewards for USDC and PYUSD holders ensures that users can continue to benefit from their digital assets. This strategic positioning not only offers ongoing earning opportunities but also contributes to the broader discussion on how crypto innovation can coexist with evolving financial regulations. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is the GENIUS Act mentioned in the article? The GENIUS Act is a recently enacted legislation that includes provisions prohibiting stablecoin issuers from directly paying yield to holders of their stablecoins. 2. Why can Coinbase and PayPal offer stablecoin rewards if issuers cannot? Coinbase and PayPal clarify that they are not the issuers of the stablecoins (USDC and PYUSD) they support. They act as platforms offering ‚Äúrewards‚Äù for holding these stablecoins, distinct from direct yield payments from an issuer. 3. What stablecoins do Coinbase and PayPal offer rewards on? Coinbase offers rewards on USDC (issued by Circle), and PayPal offers rewards on PYUSD (issued by Paxos). 4. Are these rewards considered interest or yield? Coinbase and PayPal categorize their offerings as ‚Äúrewards‚Äù rather than traditional interest or yield, specifically to differentiate them from the issuer-prohibited payments under the GENIUS Act. 5. What are the benefits of earning stablecoin rewards? Benefits include earning consistent returns on digital assets, easy accessibility through major platforms, and transparent programs that allow users to passively grow their crypto holdings.

These liquidations, essentially forced closures of leveraged trading positions, offer a raw snapshot of market sentiment and volatility. Over the past 24 hours, significant movements have occurred, shedding light on where the market‚Äôs pressure points lie. Understanding this data is crucial for anyone navigating the digital asset space, especially when considering the implications of such rapid shifts. What Do These Perpetual Futures Liquidations Reveal About Market Direction? When we talk about perpetual futures liquidations , we are referring to instances where a trader‚Äôs leveraged position is automatically closed due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. This typically happens during sharp price movements against their bet. The latest 24-hour figures paint a clear picture of market shifts, indicating significant pressure on short positions. Ethereum (ETH): A staggering $85.65 million in ETH positions were liquidated, with a dominant 73.07% being short positions. This indicates a strong upward price movement caught many bearish traders off guard, highlighting the rapid nature of Ethereum liquidation trends . Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin saw $25.05 million in liquidations, and similarly, 66.55% of these were short positions. This reinforces the narrative of an unexpected bullish surge impacting those betting on a decline, as evidenced by recent Bitcoin liquidation data . Solana (SOL): SOL experienced $12.54 million in liquidations, with shorts making up 68.91%. This trend across major assets suggests a broad market movement that caught short-sellers in a squeeze, contributing to overall crypto perpetual futures liquidation figures. These figures are not just numbers; they represent substantial capital shifts and illustrate the inherent risks of leveraged trading. Furthermore, they provide insights into the immediate market direction, often signaling momentum shifts. Understanding Bitcoin Liquidation Data and Ethereum Liquidation Trends Observing the specific breakdown for top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum offers valuable context for traders. The prevalence of short liquidations for both BTC and ETH highlights a rapid price appreciation that forced many bearish traders to close their positions. This can often fuel further upward momentum as liquidations cascade, creating a ‚Äúshort squeeze‚Äù effect. For example, when Bitcoin liquidation data shows a high percentage of short positions being closed, it suggests that the market experienced a ‚Äúshort squeeze.‚Äù This occurs when the price of an asset increases, forcing short sellers to buy back the asset to limit their losses, which in turn drives the price even higher. Similarly, the Ethereum liquidation trends indicate a comparable phenomenon, pointing to strong buying pressure that overwhelmed sellers and contributed to the overall perpetual futures liquidations . Understanding these dynamics is vital for traders. It emphasizes the importance of managing risk, especially when engaging in highly leveraged trading. Unexpected market reversals can lead to significant losses if positions are not properly managed, showcasing the true nature of crypto market volatility . Navigating Crypto Market Volatility: Actionable Insights from Liquidations The recent liquidation events underscore the unpredictable nature of crypto market volatility . While liquidations can be painful for individual traders, they are a natural part of a dynamic, leveraged market. They serve as a powerful reminder that prices can move rapidly and against expectations. Traders must therefore prioritize robust risk management strategies to mitigate risks associated with crypto perpetual futures liquidation . What can you learn from this? Firstly, always consider the potential for rapid price swings, especially in the volatile crypto space. Secondly, leverage amplifies both gains and losses; therefore, use it cautiously. Finally, market data, such as liquidation reports, can offer clues about prevailing sentiment and potential short-term price movements. However, remember that past performance does not guarantee future results when dealing with perpetual futures liquidations . In conclusion, the past 24 hours have been a stark reminder of the power of market forces in the world of perpetual futures. The significant short liquidations across ETH, BTC, and SOL underscore strong bullish momentum that caught many off guard. This data is invaluable for understanding immediate market sentiment and reinforcing the critical need for prudent risk management in leveraged trading. Staying informed about Bitcoin liquidation data and Ethereum liquidation trends is key. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Crypto Perpetual Futures Liquidation? Crypto perpetual futures liquidation refers to the forced closure of a trader‚Äôs leveraged position by an exchange due to insufficient margin to cover potential losses. This happens when the market moves significantly against the trader‚Äôs open position, protecting the exchange from bad debt. Why do Liquidations Occur in Crypto Markets? Liquidations primarily occur because traders use leverage, borrowing funds to amplify their trading power. If the market price moves unfavorably and the trader‚Äôs margin falls below a certain threshold, the exchange automatically closes the position to prevent further losses for both the trader and the exchange. This highlights the inherent crypto market volatility . Are Liquidations Always Bad for the Market? While liquidations are detrimental for the individual traders involved, they are a natural part of a leveraged market. They can sometimes lead to cascading price movements (like a short squeeze driving prices up or a long squeeze driving prices down), but they also help maintain market stability by preventing excessive risk-taking, which is crucial given the nature of perpetual futures liquidations . How Can Traders Avoid Being Liquidated? Traders can avoid liquidation by employing sound risk management. This includes using lower leverage, setting stop-loss orders to automatically close positions before significant losses occur, and maintaining sufficient margin in their accounts to withstand market fluctuations. Paying attention to Bitcoin liquidation data and Ethereum liquidation trends can also provide early warnings. Did you find this breakdown of perpetual futures liquidations insightful?

Over a decade ago, he inadvertently discarded a hard drive containing 8,000 BTC, an asset now valued at an astounding nearly one billion dollars. After years of dedicated but ultimately unsuccessful efforts to locate it in a landfill, Howells has recently unveiled a truly groundbreaking initiative: a bold lost Bitcoin tokenization strategy for his unrecovered fortune. This innovative development marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing saga of the James Howells Bitcoin . What is This Audacious Lost Bitcoin Tokenization Plan? James Howells, widely known for his unfortunate hard drive incident, recently shared his ambitious vision via X (formerly Twitter). He announced his intention to convert the unrecoverable 8,000 BTC into a new digital asset. It‚Äôs crucial to understand that this isn‚Äôt about physically retrieving the original coins; instead, it involves creating a representative token that derives its value from the lost Bitcoin. Howells is pioneering the creation of 800 billion Ceiniog Coin (INI) tokens, directly tied to his lost BTC. Ceiniog Coin is meticulously designed to operate natively on the Bitcoin blockchain, utilizing the OP_RETURN function for its foundational data. Furthermore, this new token will integrate seamlessly with established Bitcoin ecosystem layers such as Stacks, Runes, and Ordinals, aiming for broad utility and accessibility. The much-anticipated debut of these INI tokens is projected to occur by the close of the current year, promising a new avenue for engagement with the storied James Howells Bitcoin . How Does Tokenizing BTC Work Without Recovery? The concept of tokenizing BTC that is physically inaccessible might initially sound paradoxical. However, Howells‚Äô approach brilliantly leverages the inherent immutability and transparency of blockchain technology. While the original James Howells Bitcoin remains permanently locked away on the discarded hard drive, the newly minted tokens serve as a verifiable digital representation of that value, existing on the public ledger. This initiative represents a truly novel Bitcoin recovery plan , one that shifts focus from physical retrieval to digital representation. By creating these new tokens, Howells aims to unlock the substantial value tied to his unrecoverable assets. This could potentially allow investors and enthusiasts to participate in a unique digital endeavor, transforming a personal misfortune into a collective opportunity within the crypto space. It‚Äôs a testament to the adaptability of blockchain. What is the Vision Behind Ceiniog Coin: A New Era for Digital Assets? Howells‚Äô public statements extend beyond just a financial recovery; they carry a profound philosophical message. His powerful quote, ""You can block the gates. You can pack the courts. But you cannot block the blockchain. Crypto already won,"" eloquently captures his conviction in the unstoppable power of decentralized networks. This core belief is a driving force behind the development of Ceiniog Coin . This project could establish a significant precedent for other individuals or organizations grappling with similar dilemmas of lost or inaccessible digital assets. It offers a potential pathway to re-monetize value that would otherwise be permanently stranded in the digital ether. The emergence of Ceiniog Coin is therefore not merely about Howells‚Äô personal wealth; it‚Äôs a bold declaration about the resilience, innovation, and ever-expanding possibilities within the blockchain ecosystem. What Challenges Does This Bitcoin Recovery Plan Face? While the prospect of lost Bitcoin tokenization is undeniably fascinating and innovative, it is not without its hurdles. Any groundbreaking venture in the crypto space must navigate complex regulatory landscapes, secure widespread market acceptance, and overcome inherent skepticism. Questions about liquidity, utility, and the long-term value proposition of Ceiniog Coin will certainly arise as it approaches its debut. Despite these challenges, the potential opportunities are equally compelling. This audacious move by James Howells exemplifies the continuous evolution and ingenuity within the cryptocurrency landscape. It vividly demonstrates how creative thinking, combined with advanced technological solutions, can address seemingly insurmountable problems, transforming a significant personal loss into a potentially revolutionary financial instrument for the broader digital asset community. In conclusion, James Howells‚Äô ambitious plan to tokenize his lost 8,000 BTC into Ceiniog Coin marks an unprecedented and fascinating chapter in cryptocurrency history. This innovative Bitcoin recovery plan , leveraging the robust Bitcoin blockchain and its foundational layers, aims to transform an accidental, monumental loss into a new, accessible digital asset. Whether this audacious venture fully achieves its stated goals, it undeniably sparks vital conversations about the future of digital asset recovery, the concept of ownership in a decentralized world, and the boundless possibilities that continue to emerge within the dynamic blockchain ecosystem.

Every cycle, stories emerge of small bets turning into generational wealth , from early Bitcoin miners to SHIBA INU holders who held through the noise. While established tokens like Ethereum and Solana still offer solid upside, the truth is that life-changing multipliers almost always come from newer, lesser-known projects‚Äîthe ones still in their infancy, before the world catches on. It‚Äôs in these early stages that community momentum, viral branding, and smart tokenomics can align to create meteoric growth. That‚Äôs why a growing number of analysts are turning their attention to newer projects like, which combine breakout appeal with structured development. If you‚Äôre looking for 1000x potential , early-stage projects with traction offer the best odds ‚Äì before they hit mainstream exchanges or top-10 rankings. Here are five standout tokens that may dominate the next bull cycle. MAGACOIN FINANCE MAGACOIN FINANCE has hit a major inflection point in its growth story even though it‚Äôs the newest project in this article. The project has achieved a key community milestone, with daily engagement levels now exceeding early projections , signaling strong grassroots momentum. More than just a community-driven token, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building a politically-charged ecosystem that captures attention while expanding real utility . Its momentum has attracted waves of early-mover investors, many of whom compare its structure and buzz to the earliest days of SHIBA INU and DOGE. With strong online traction, MAGACOIN FINANCE continues to stand out as one of the most promising high-upside altcoins heading into the next market cycle. Solana (SOL) Solana remains one of the most battle ‚Äì tested altcoins in the space. It delivers lightning-fast transactions, low fees, and hosts a thriving DeFi and NFT ecosystem. As Ethereum struggles with network congestion and high gas costs, Solana has become a preferred Layer-1 for developers and users seeking performance. Its deep integrations with mobile, payments, and gaming give it longevity that few other chains can match. With every cycle, Solana continues to evolve‚Äînot just as an Ethereum alternative, but as a chain with its own cultural identity and developer momentum. Avalanche (AVAX) Avalanche has carved a niche as a chain for institutions, subnets, and real-world asset tokenization. Its architecture allows for customizable blockchain deployments while maintaining speed and security, which is ideal for developers seeking both flexibility and scalability. The project‚Äôs focus on bridging traditional finance with on-chain infrastructure has kept it at the forefront of enterprise adoption. As real-world assets gain traction and more financial products migrate to the blockchain, Avalanche is positioned to lead in one of crypto‚Äôs most transformative sectors. Sui (SUI) Sui is quietly becoming one of the most advanced Layer-1s in Web3. Built for scale and responsiveness, it offers parallel transaction execution and developer-friendly architecture. This makes it ideal for applications requiring high throughput, like gaming, social platforms, and digital identity tools. What sets Sui apart is its emphasis on user experience‚Äîits object-based model simplifies building intuitive, fast apps without sacrificing decentralization. As Web3 evolves beyond speculation into practical utility, Sui‚Äôs technical foundations could become a blueprint for the next generation of on-chain platforms. Polkadot (DOT) Polkadot‚Äôs modular approach to blockchain interoperability remains a cornerstone of its long-term vision. Instead of competing with Ethereum, it enables custom blockchains to interact seamlessly, promoting a multichain future. Its relay chain design and parachain auctions allow projects to specialize while benefiting from shared security and throughput. Polkadot‚Äôs emphasis on governance and community-controlled upgrades also make it one of the most resilient and forward-thinking Layer-0 solutions in the ecosystem. As interoperability and customization become non-negotiable for developers, DOT‚Äôs role is expected to grow exponentially. Conclusion Each of these projects represents a different kind of opportunity ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs explosive community surge , Solana‚Äôs scaling success, or Polkadot‚Äôs foundational architecture. As the next bull run takes shape, analysts continue to highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE‚Äôs rapid user adoption and daily engagement milestones as strong indicators of breakout potential . Timing and narrative will shape the winners, and early positioning remains the ultimate key to 1,000X level outcomes.

A startling report reveals that North Korean hackers have unleashed a new wave of crypto theft , successfully pilfering an astounding $1.6 billion in digital assets this year alone. Their insidious method? Deceptively luring unsuspecting victims with convincing fake job offers . This alarming trend highlights the escalating cybersecurity threats faced by the crypto community and the urgent need for heightened vigilance against sophisticated cryptocurrency scams . How North Korean Hackers Infiltrate Systems? Recent reports from Google Cloud and Wiz, cited by Decrypt, shed light on the evolving tactics employed by these notorious groups. Initially, in 2023, the primary method involved embedding malicious open-source code into legitimate-looking software. However, since 2024, their strategy has shifted dramatically towards social engineering, specifically through the elaborate setup of fake job offers . These offers are not merely simple phishing attempts. They are meticulously crafted to appear genuine, targeting individuals within the IT and cryptocurrency sectors. Once a victim engages with the fake offer, the hackers gain access to their cloud systems and, subsequently, to valuable cryptocurrency exchanges. This allows them to execute large-scale crypto theft operations. The Deceptive Lure of Fake Job Offers Imagine receiving an enticing job offer from a reputable company, promising excellent pay and benefits. This is precisely the bait used by North Korean hackers . They leverage this trust to infiltrate sensitive systems. The attackers often impersonate well-known tech firms or crypto projects, making their proposals incredibly convincing. Key aspects of their deception include: Professional Impersonation: Crafting emails and websites that mimic legitimate organizations. Malicious Payloads: Embedding malware within seemingly harmless documents or software related to the ‚Äújob application.‚Äù Exploiting Trust: Capitalizing on the human desire for career advancement to bypass initial suspicions. This method has proven highly effective, leading to significant losses for individuals and platforms alike, emphasizing the pervasive nature of these cryptocurrency scams . Protecting Your Assets from Cryptocurrency Scams Given the increasing sophistication of these attacks, proactive measures are crucial to safeguard your digital wealth. Protecting against crypto theft requires a multi-layered approach, combining technological defenses with personal awareness. It‚Äôs not just about strong passwords; it‚Äôs about understanding the threats. Here are actionable insights to protect yourself: Verify Job Offers Independently: Always cross-reference job offers directly with the company‚Äôs official website. Never rely solely on links provided in emails. Be Skeptical of Unsolicited Communications: Treat unexpected job offers, especially those in the crypto space, with extreme caution. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Implement MFA on all your crypto accounts and email. Use Hardware Wallets: For significant crypto holdings, consider using hardware wallets for enhanced security. Educate Yourself: Stay informed about the latest cybersecurity threats and common scam tactics. Staying Ahead of Cybersecurity Threats The landscape of cybersecurity threats is constantly evolving, with groups like North Korean hackers continuously refining their methods. The reported incidents, including the DMM Bitcoin hack in Japan and the Bybit hack (which occurred in 2024), serve as stark reminders of the ongoing battle against these malicious actors. These attacks underscore the need for both individual vigilance and robust institutional security protocols. Organizations, particularly those in the crypto industry, must invest heavily in their cybersecurity infrastructure. Regular security audits, employee training on phishing and social engineering, and rapid incident response plans are no longer optional; they are essential for mitigating the risk of massive crypto theft . A Call for Vigilance Against Crypto Theft The staggering $1.6 billion in stolen assets through fake job offers is a powerful indicator of the financial damage that can be inflicted by determined hacking groups. As the crypto ecosystem continues to grow, so too will the efforts of those seeking to exploit it. Individuals and institutions must remain vigilant, adopting best practices to protect their digital assets from these pervasive cryptocurrency scams . By staying informed and exercising caution, we can collectively build a more secure crypto environment. Remember, your digital security is paramount in this ever-evolving threat landscape.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has recently issued internal SEC stablecoin guidance , marking a significant moment for the cryptocurrency market. This guidance suggests that certain stablecoins can now be classified as cash equivalents . This development, as reported by Bloomberg Law, is more than just an internal memo; it‚Äôs a crucial step towards building a clearer crypto regulatory framework . What Does the SEC Stablecoin Guidance Mean for You? Previously, the path for digital assets to integrate with traditional finance was often unclear. However, this new SEC stablecoin guidance provides a much-needed bridge. Essentially, if a stablecoin meets specific criteria, it could be treated similarly to cash in financial statements and transactions. U.S. Dollar Peg: The stablecoin must be firmly pegged to the U.S. dollar. Sufficient Reserves: It needs to be backed by adequate reserves, ensuring its stability. Guaranteed Redemption: Users must have a guarantee that they can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying fiat currency. This digital asset classification offers greater clarity and potential for wider adoption, especially for institutional players. Why is This Stablecoin Cash Equivalent Classification Significant? The decision to allow certain stablecoins to be treated as stablecoin cash equivalent assets carries immense weight. For years, the lack of clear guidelines hindered mainstream financial institutions from fully embracing the crypto space. This guidance signals a shift, potentially opening doors for traditional lenders and other financial entities to engage more confidently with digital assets. Moreover, it could simplify accounting and auditing processes for companies holding these stablecoins. Imagine a world where holding a compliant stablecoin is as straightforward as holding cash in your corporate treasury. This move underscores a growing recognition of stablecoins‚Äô role in the evolving financial landscape. Shifting Sands: The Broader Crypto Regulatory Framework This SEC stablecoin guidance is not an isolated event. It represents an interim but vital move towards a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework in the U.S. Under the new Chair Paul Atkins, the SEC appears to be recalibrating its approach. This includes a notable rollback of previous restrictions that often limited traditional lenders‚Äô participation in the crypto market. The shift indicates a more pragmatic and perhaps less restrictive stance from the commission. This could foster innovation while still aiming to protect investors. It‚Äôs about finding a balance, allowing the crypto market to mature within defined boundaries. Looking Ahead: What‚Äôs Next for US SEC Crypto Policy? The evolving US SEC crypto policy suggests a future where digital assets are increasingly integrated into the existing financial system. While this guidance is a positive step, it‚Äôs important to remember that it‚Äôs just one piece of a larger puzzle. The SEC, along with other regulatory bodies, will likely continue to refine their approaches as the crypto market matures. This could lead to: More detailed rules for different types of digital assets. Increased institutional participation. Enhanced clarity for businesses operating in the Web3 space.

The week started on a high note as $883 million poured in. Momentum, however, reversed sharply following the FOMC‚Äôs hawkish stance and strong US economic data. Despite Friday‚Äôs weaker payroll numbers hinting at a more dovish Fed approach, the overall risk-off mood led to more than $1 billion in outflows that day. Still, considering the past 30 days saw $12.2 billion in inflows ‚Äì half of all inflows in 2025 so far ‚Äì this correction seems more like a healthy bout of profit-taking than a bearish pivot. CoinShares explained that investors may simply be locking in gains after a steady inflow streak. The outflows, while sizable, do not necessarily indicate a broader loss of confidence. Ethereum Defies Market Panic According to the latest edition of the ‚ÄúDigital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report,‚Äù Bitcoin experienced the largest outflows amid bearish sentiment and lost $404 million over the week. Still, its year-to-date inflows remain solid at $20 billion, which CoinShares explained as ‚Äúan understandable dynamic‚Äù given the asset‚Äôs ‚Äú sensitivity to monetary policy shifts.‚Äù Ethereum also dipped later in the week but secured its 15th consecutive week of inflows, with $133 million. Investor confidence extended to other altcoins as well. XRP saw $31.3 million, Solana $8.8 million, and SEI $5.8 million in inflows. Smaller gains were recorded by Cardano and Aave, which attracted $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively. On the other hand, multi-asset products recorded $4.8 million in outflows over the past week. Sui and Litecoin followed, with $0.8 million and $0.2 million. Flows Split Geographically The U.S. led the week in digital asset outflows, with investors pulling $383 million, followed by Germany with $35.5 million and Sweden with $33.3 million. Brazil also saw modest outflows of $12.8 million. Contrastingly, Hong Kong emerged as the top destination for crypto inflows as it attracted $170.4 million. Switzerland followed with $52.4 million, while Canada and Australia saw smaller gains of $12.4 million and $7.6 million, respectively.

This significant ETH accumulation has certainly captured the attention of investors and analysts alike, sparking discussions about its potential impact on broader crypto market trends . Such a substantial move by a single entity often signals shifts in sentiment and can influence the trajectory of digital assets. Who is This Mysterious Ethereum Whale? Details emerging from on-chain analytics, specifically highlighted by @EmberCN on X, reveal the precise nature of this substantial transaction. The whale executed this colossal large ETH purchase through two prominent institutional platforms: FalconX and Galaxy Digital. This choice of platforms is particularly noteworthy, as both cater primarily to institutional and high-net-worth investors, suggesting a sophisticated player behind the move. The whale also took a strategic approach by creating three new addresses. These addresses utilized BitGo‚Äôs secure wallet service, a provider known for its robust security and institutional-grade solutions. All 63,838 ETH were funneled into these new wallets at an average acquisition price of $3,640 per ETH, indicating a calculated entry point into the market. What Does This ETH Accumulation Signify for the Market? When an entity engages in such a significant ETH accumulation , it often sends ripples across the cryptocurrency landscape. This particular transaction could be interpreted in several ways: Strong Bullish Conviction: A purchase of this magnitude suggests deep confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs future price performance and its underlying technology. The whale is betting big on ETH. Strategic Positioning: Acquiring such a large amount at a specific average price points to a strategic long-term hold rather than short-term trading. Demand from Large Players: It highlights continued demand for Ethereum from significant market participants, potentially indicating a broader trend of institutional interest. Understanding these motivations is crucial for assessing the potential impact on crypto market trends going forward. Is This Institutional Crypto Activity on the Rise? The involvement of platforms like FalconX and Galaxy Digital, coupled with the use of BitGo‚Äôs institutional-grade wallet services, strongly suggests that this large ETH purchase is likely a form of institutional crypto activity. Institutional adoption has been a key narrative in the cryptocurrency space, often seen as a catalyst for mainstream acceptance and price stability. Why does institutional involvement matter? It brings significant capital into the market. It lends credibility and legitimacy to digital assets. It can reduce market volatility over the long term as institutions tend to be long-term holders. This kind of substantial acquisition underscores a growing trend where traditional finance entities are increasingly looking to allocate capital into leading cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. How Do Large ETH Purchases Influence Future Crypto Market Trends? A significant Ethereum whale accumulating such a large sum can influence market dynamics in several ways. Firstly, it reduces the circulating supply available on exchanges, which, if demand remains constant or increases, can exert upward pressure on prices. Secondly, it can boost investor confidence, leading to a positive feedback loop where others are encouraged to buy, further impacting crypto market trends . However, it is also important to consider the potential for market manipulation. While this specific transaction appears to be an accumulation, large holdings can, in theory, be used to influence prices. Therefore, monitoring such activities remains vital for market participants. For individual investors, understanding these large-scale movements can offer valuable insights into potential future price action and overall market sentiment. This massive ETH accumulation by a prominent whale is a powerful indicator of continued confidence in Ethereum‚Äôs ecosystem and its long-term value proposition. As the cryptocurrency market matures, such large-scale transactions by institutional or sophisticated players will likely become more common, shaping the future landscape of digital finance. Keeping an eye on these significant movements provides a clearer picture of where the market might be headed. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an Ethereum whale? An Ethereum whale refers to an individual or entity holding a very large amount of ETH, significant enough to potentially influence market prices with their transactions. Q2: Why is this ETH accumulation considered significant? This ETH accumulation is significant due to its sheer size ($232 million) and the use of institutional platforms (FalconX, Galaxy Digital, BitGo), suggesting a sophisticated or institutional investor with strong conviction. Q3: How do large ETH purchases impact the crypto market? Large ETH purchases can signal bullish sentiment, reduce available supply on exchanges, and potentially drive prices up due to increased demand and investor confidence. They are key indicators for future crypto market trends . Q4: Does this indicate more institutional crypto adoption? Yes, the platforms and wallet services used strongly suggest this is institutional crypto activity, pointing towards increasing adoption of digital assets by large financial entities. Q5: What is BitGo‚Äôs role in this transaction? BitGo is a leading provider of institutional-grade digital asset financial services, including secure wallet solutions. The whale used BitGo‚Äôs service to create new addresses for receiving the ETH, emphasizing security and professional management.

The world of Spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed a significant and unexpected event on August 4, as these popular investment vehicles experienced a combined net outflow of $323.73 million. This substantial shift comes after what had been a period of generally positive flows for many of these funds, making the reversal particularly noteworthy for those tracking digital asset investment . What exactly happened, and what could these Bitcoin ETF outflows signal for the broader crypto market ? Understanding the Recent Surge in Bitcoin ETF Outflows On August 4, the collective holdings of Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a considerable reduction, with a total net outflow amounting to $323.73 million. This data, initially highlighted by @thepfund on X, paints a clear picture of capital moving away from these specific investment products. It‚Äôs a moment that captures the attention of investors keenly observing investment trends in the cryptocurrency space. A closer look reveals the key players in this financial movement. BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT, a major player in the ETF landscape, led the withdrawals with a substantial $292.49 million in outflows. Following suit, Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC also saw significant exits, totaling $40.06 million. Even Grayscale‚Äôs GBTC, known for its large existing holdings, recorded a net outflow of $9.92 million. However, the picture wasn‚Äôt entirely negative; Bitwise‚Äôs BITB stood out by attracting a net inflow of $18.74 million, suggesting selective investor confidence. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their daily holdings. Why Do Significant Digital Asset Investment Shifts Occur? The occurrence of substantial Bitcoin ETF outflows can be attributed to several intertwined factors, reflecting the complex nature of the digital asset investment landscape. One common reason is profit-taking. After periods of strong performance in Bitcoin‚Äôs price, institutional and retail investors holding these ETFs might decide to lock in gains, leading to redemptions. Another factor could be a shift in broader market sentiment. If there are concerns about the global economy, rising interest rates, or regulatory uncertainties, investors might reduce their exposure to perceived riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. This reallocation of capital is a natural part of portfolio management. Moreover, rebalancing strategies by large funds can also trigger significant outflows or inflows, independent of specific market news. These movements are not always indicative of a long-term bearish outlook. They often represent short-term tactical adjustments. For example, some investors might move from an ETF to direct Bitcoin holdings, or vice versa, depending on their strategic objectives or tax considerations. Navigating Investment Trends: What‚Äôs Next for the Crypto Market? The performance of Spot Bitcoin ETFs is increasingly vital for understanding institutional participation and liquidity within the broader crypto market . While a single day‚Äôs outflow of over $300 million is significant, it is essential to consider it within the context of the vast overall market capitalization of Bitcoin and the total assets managed by these ETFs. Such events serve as crucial data points rather than definitive indicators of a market crash. For investors, understanding these investment trends is paramount. Observing which funds gain or lose capital can offer insights into prevailing market sentiment and strategic moves. The contrasting performance of Bitwise‚Äôs BITB, which saw inflows, suggests that even during periods of overall outflows, specific investment vehicles can attract capital, perhaps due to lower fees, different underlying strategies, or investor preference. Actionable Insights for Investors: Maintain a Diversified Portfolio: Do not put all your eggs in one basket. Diversifying across different assets, including various digital assets and traditional investments, can help cushion against volatility. Adopt a Long-Term Perspective: Cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. Focusing on Bitcoin‚Äôs fundamental value, its growing adoption, and long-term technological advancements can help you ride out short-term fluctuations. Stay Informed and Analytical: Continuously monitor market news, macroeconomic indicators, and regulatory developments. Analyze data from sources like the outflow reports, but always consider the broader context before making investment decisions. Understand Your Risk Tolerance: Before making any investment, assess your personal risk tolerance. Digital asset investment carries inherent risks, and understanding these is crucial. In summary, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced a substantial $323.73 million net outflow on August 4, primarily driven by major players like BlackRock‚Äôs IBIT and Fidelity‚Äôs FBTC. This event highlights the dynamic and sometimes unpredictable nature of digital asset investment . While significant, it serves as a reminder that market movements are complex and influenced by various factors, from profit-taking to broader economic sentiment. Investors should view these Bitcoin ETF outflows as critical data points for informed decision-making, reinforcing the need for a strategic, long-term approach to navigating the evolving crypto market .

Why do Bitcoin ETFs experience outflows? Outflows can occur due to various reasons, including investors taking profits after price rallies, shifts in broader market sentiment, macroeconomic concerns, or strategic portfolio rebalancing by large institutions. 4. Does this outflow indicate a bearish trend for Bitcoin? A single day‚Äôs outflow, even a large one, does not necessarily indicate a long-term bearish trend. It often reflects short-term market adjustments or specific investor strategies rather than a fundamental shift in the crypto market outlook. 5. How should investors react to these market movements? Investors should focus on understanding the underlying reasons for such movements, maintain a diversified portfolio, adopt a long-term perspective, and stay informed about broader market and regulatory developments rather than reacting impulsively to daily fluctuations. 6.

This single-day shift saw an astonishing $465.77 million depart from these investment vehicles, sending ripples across the market. The data, shared by crypto analyst Trader T on X, highlighted a significant moment for institutional interest in Ethereum. Specifically, BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA led the charge with a substantial $375.68 million in outflows. Fidelity‚Äôs FETH followed, shedding $55.11 million. Grayscale‚Äôs mini ETH and its larger counterpart, ETHE, also experienced notable withdrawals of $28 million and $6.98 million, respectively. The remaining ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, making the concentration of these outflows particularly striking. What Triggered These Record Ethereum ETF Outflows? Such a significant movement begs the question: what prompted this unprecedented surge in Ethereum ETF outflows ? While a definitive single cause is often elusive in dynamic markets, several factors could be at play. One common reason for large outflows from investment products like ETFs is profit-taking by early investors, especially after periods of strong performance. Investors might be rebalancing their portfolios or moving capital to other opportunities they perceive as more attractive. Another contributing factor could be a broader shift in market sentiment or a reaction to specific macroeconomic indicators. Sometimes, large institutional investors, who hold substantial portions of these ETFs, make strategic decisions to reduce their exposure to certain asset classes based on their risk assessments or internal mandates. Regulatory uncertainties, though often simmering, can also occasionally trigger cautious moves among large holders, leading to significant withdrawals. Assessing ETH ETF Performance Amid Volatility This record outflow naturally raises concerns about overall ETH ETF performance and investor confidence. It‚Äôs crucial to understand that while a large outflow is a notable event, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily spell long-term doom for the underlying asset or the ETF structure itself. Markets are cyclical, and inflows often follow outflows as new investment opportunities arise or sentiment shifts. For instance, some investors might be selling their ETF shares to directly purchase Ethereum on exchanges, seeking greater control or different fee structures. Consider these points: Market Dynamics: The crypto market is inherently volatile, and large capital movements are not uncommon. Investor Strategy: Large investors frequently adjust positions based on their unique strategies, which may not reflect a negative long-term view on Ethereum. Rebalancing: Fund managers often rebalance portfolios, which can lead to temporary outflows from certain assets to maintain desired allocations. Broader Cryptocurrency Investment Trends: A Shifting Landscape? This substantial outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs provides a fascinating snapshot of current cryptocurrency investment trends . It highlights the growing influence of institutional money in the crypto space, where large movements can significantly impact market perception. While the immediate reaction might be concern, it‚Äôs also a testament to the increasing liquidity and maturity of the digital asset market. Are we seeing a fundamental shift in how institutions view Ethereum, or is this merely a tactical adjustment? It‚Äôs likely a combination of factors. The continued development of the Ethereum ecosystem, including its scalability upgrades and growing utility, suggests strong long-term fundamentals. However, short-term market fluctuations are a constant, and investors, especially large ones, will always react to perceived risks and rewards. The Road Ahead for the Digital Asset Market What does this record outflow mean for the broader digital asset market moving forward? While a single day‚Äôs outflow is significant, the long-term trajectory of institutional adoption for cryptocurrencies remains robust. The very existence and trading volume of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs signify a mainstreaming of crypto investments, offering regulated avenues for traditional investors. Moving forward, market participants will be closely watching for: Subsequent ETF Flows: Will inflows resume in the coming days or weeks, or will outflows persist? Ethereum Price Action: How will Ethereum‚Äôs price react to sustained institutional sentiment? Regulatory Developments: Further clarity on crypto regulations in the U.S. could influence future investment decisions. The August 4 record outflow from U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs serves as a powerful reminder of the dynamic nature of the crypto investment landscape. While it represents a significant withdrawal of capital, it also underscores the growing maturity of the market where such large-scale movements are now possible. As the digital asset space continues to evolve, understanding these institutional flows becomes ever more crucial for investors navigating its complexities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a U.S. spot Ethereum ETF? A U.S. spot Ethereum ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Ethereum as its underlying asset, allowing investors to gain exposure to ETH‚Äôs price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself. These ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges. Q2: Is this the first time U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have seen outflows? No, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs have experienced outflows before. However, the $465.77 million recorded on August 4 marks the largest single-day net outflow on record, making it particularly noteworthy. Q3: How does this outflow impact Ethereum‚Äôs price? While a large outflow from ETFs can exert downward pressure on Ethereum‚Äôs price in the short term due to decreased demand or potential selling by ETF issuers to meet redemptions, the long-term impact depends on broader market sentiment and fundamental developments within the Ethereum ecosystem. Q4: What is the significance of BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA leading the outflows? BlackRock is a major institutional player, and its ETF experiencing the largest outflow suggests a significant strategic move by large investors. This could indicate profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing, or a temporary shift in investment strategy by their clients. Q5: Should individual investors be concerned about these outflows? Individual investors should view these outflows as market data points. While they reflect institutional sentiment, they do not necessarily dictate the long-term performance of Ethereum. It‚Äôs important to conduct your own research, understand your risk tolerance, and avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market movements. Q6: Are there any positive takeaways from this event? Yes, the very fact that such large sums are moving in and out of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs indicates significant institutional participation and liquidity in the market. This maturity is a positive sign for the long-term growth and acceptance of digital assets as a legitimate investment class.

While digital assets often march to their own beat, the underlying currents of traditional markets, particularly the forex market dynamics , frequently dictate broader investor sentiment and capital flows. This article delves into the latest movements in Asia FX performance , examining how the steady US Dollar stability and pervasive global rate cut bets are shaping the financial outlook, with a specific focus on the acute Indian Rupee volatility stemming from recent geopolitical rhetoric. The global currency landscape is a complex tapestry, constantly influenced by economic indicators, central bank policies, and geopolitical developments. Recent days have seen Asian currencies generally trading sideways, reflecting a cautious market sentiment. This muted activity contrasts with the broader narrative of a steady US Dollar, which continues to hold its ground despite increasing speculation around future interest rate cuts by major central banks. However, not all currencies are experiencing this relative calm. The Indian Rupee, in particular, has found itself under significant pressure, highlighting the localized vulnerabilities within the broader Asian currency basket. Asia FX Performance: Navigating a Sea of Muted Activity The general trend across Asian foreign exchange markets has been one of quiet consolidation. Many regional currencies, from the Japanese Yen to the South Korean Won and the Malaysian Ringgit, have shown limited directional conviction. This muted Asia FX performance can be attributed to several factors: Lack of Fresh Catalysts: Without significant new economic data or major policy announcements, traders are largely holding positions, waiting for clearer signals. Balancing Act: Asian central banks are often caught between supporting economic growth and managing inflation, leading to a cautious approach that translates into less volatile currency movements. Influence of the Dollar: The persistent strength of the US Dollar often acts as a gravitational pull, limiting the upside for many Asian currencies. While the lack of dramatic swings might seem uneventful, it underscores a period of strategic re-evaluation for investors looking at emerging market opportunities. Understanding these subtle shifts is key to anticipating future breakouts or breakdowns in the region. US Dollar Stability: An Unwavering Anchor Amidst Shifting Tides? Despite persistent discussions about when and by how much the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates, the US Dollar stability has been a notable feature of the global currency market. The Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, has largely maintained its elevated levels. What explains this resilience? Safe-Haven Demand: In times of global uncertainty, whether geopolitical tensions or economic slowdown fears, the US Dollar often serves as a preferred safe-haven asset, attracting capital inflows. Relatively Strong US Economy: Compared to other major economies, the United States has shown more robust growth and a tighter labor market, supporting the argument for the Fed to maintain higher rates for longer, or to cut more gradually. Yield Differentials: Even with rate cut expectations, US Treasury yields often remain attractive compared to those in Europe or Japan, drawing capital into dollar-denominated assets. This sustained strength of the dollar has a direct impact on the competitiveness of exports from Asian nations and influences the cost of dollar-denominated debt for many developing economies. The unwavering nature of US Dollar stability is a critical factor for global financial planning. Global Rate Cut Bets: The Driving Force Behind Market Speculation The dominant theme across financial markets globally has been the intense speculation surrounding global rate cut bets . Central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, and the Bank of England, are under increasing pressure to ease monetary policy as inflation shows signs of cooling and economic growth moderates. How are these expectations playing out? Divergent Paths: While some central banks, like the ECB, might be closer to cutting rates, the Fed‚Äôs timeline remains more uncertain, creating a complex environment for currency traders. Impact on Yields: Anticipation of lower rates generally leads to lower bond yields, which can reduce the attractiveness of a currency. However, the market is constantly recalibrating these expectations based on incoming data. Inflation vs. Growth: Central bankers are walking a tightrope, balancing the need to control inflation with the imperative to support economic expansion. This delicate balance directly informs the timing and magnitude of any rate adjustments. The narrative around global rate cut bets is highly dynamic, with every piece of economic data, from inflation reports to jobs numbers, scrutinized for clues. This uncertainty fuels volatility in various currency pairs, creating both risks and opportunities for savvy investors. Indian Rupee Volatility: Navigating Geopolitical Headwinds and Trade Threats Among Asian currencies, the Indian Rupee volatility has stood out, largely due to external pressures. The recent remarks from former US President Donald Trump, suggesting potential tariffs or trade restrictions on countries like India if he were to return to office, sent ripples through the market. This threat, while currently hypothetical, highlights the Rupee‚Äôs sensitivity to geopolitical developments. Trade Balance Concerns: India is a net importer, and any disruption to global trade flows or imposition of tariffs could widen its trade deficit, putting downward pressure on the Rupee. Foreign Investment Sensitivity: Geopolitical uncertainty can deter foreign portfolio investment (FPI) and foreign direct investment (FDI), which are crucial for financing India‚Äôs current account deficit and supporting the Rupee. Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs Role: The RBI often intervenes in the forex market to smooth out excessive volatility, but sustained external pressure can challenge its efforts. Beyond Trump‚Äôs statements, the Rupee also contends with domestic inflation concerns, crude oil prices (as India is a major oil importer), and the broader sentiment towards emerging markets. The heightened Indian Rupee volatility serves as a stark reminder of how political rhetoric can translate into real economic consequences. Forex Market Dynamics: The Interconnected Web of Global Finance The interplay between Asia FX, the US Dollar, interest rate expectations, and individual currency vulnerabilities like the Indian Rupee underscores the intricate nature of forex market dynamics . No currency operates in isolation; each is part of a larger, interconnected global financial system. Capital Flows: Investor decisions, driven by risk appetite, yield differentials, and economic outlooks, dictate the movement of capital across borders, directly impacting currency valuations. Policy Divergence: As central banks pursue different monetary policy paths, the resulting divergence in interest rates creates arbitrage opportunities and influences carry trades, affecting currency strength. Geopolitical Risk: Events such as elections, trade disputes, or conflicts can trigger sudden shifts in sentiment, leading to rapid currency depreciation or appreciation as investors re-evaluate risk. Understanding these complex forex market dynamics is crucial not only for currency traders but also for businesses engaged in international trade and investors with diversified portfolios. The current environment demands vigilance and a nuanced appreciation of how global forces converge to shape local currency outcomes. Challenges and Opportunities The current landscape presents both challenges and opportunities for investors and businesses operating in Asia and globally. The primary challenge lies in the persistent uncertainty surrounding central bank actions and geopolitical stability. This makes forecasting currency movements particularly difficult. However, opportunities also arise: For Exporters: A stable or stronger US Dollar can make exports from Asian nations relatively cheaper, boosting competitiveness. For Importers: Conversely, a stronger Dollar means higher import costs, impacting profitability. For Investors: Volatility, while risky, can create entry points for long-term investors looking to capitalize on undervalued currencies or well-positioned assets. Diversification across different Asian markets and asset classes becomes even more critical. Actionable Insights Given the complex interplay of factors, what steps can market participants take? Monitor Central Bank Communications: Pay close attention to speeches, minutes, and press conferences from the Fed, ECB, and Asian central banks for clues on future monetary policy. Track Economic Data: Key indicators like inflation, GDP growth, employment figures, and trade balances provide vital insights into a country‚Äôs economic health and its currency‚Äôs potential direction. Assess Geopolitical Risk: Keep abreast of international political developments and trade negotiations, as these can have swift and significant impacts on currency markets. Hedge Currency Exposure: For businesses engaged in international transactions, implementing currency hedging strategies can mitigate the risks associated with adverse currency movements. Diversify Investments: Spread investments across various currencies and asset classes to reduce overall portfolio risk in volatile environments. Conclusion The Asian currency market currently reflects a cautious equilibrium, largely influenced by the steadying presence of the US Dollar and the ongoing debate surrounding global interest rate cuts. While the broader Asia FX performance has been muted, the distinct challenges faced by currencies like the Indian Rupee underscore the localized impact of global and geopolitical forces. As central banks navigate inflationary pressures and economic growth concerns, and as political rhetoric continues to shape market sentiment, vigilance remains paramount. Understanding these intricate forex market dynamics is not just for professional traders; it is essential for anyone seeking to make informed financial decisions in an increasingly interconnected world. The journey ahead promises continued fascination as these powerful economic currents unfold.

Analysts Warn of Fragile Market Support,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/is-bitcoin-losing-steam-analysts-warn-of-fragile-market-support/,"Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a steady price decline over the past week, falling by approximately 3.7% as trading activity shows signs of a possible sell-off or profit-taking phase. After peaking above $123,000 earlier last month, the leading cryptocurrency has been trading within the $113,000 to $114,000 range in the past day. At the time of writing, BTC is valued at $114,420, reflecting uncertainty in market momentum. Market analysts point to weakening liquidity and inconsistent institutional demand as key factors contributing to the price drop. A recent analysis shared by Arab Chain, a contributor to CryptoQuant‚Äôs QuickTake platform, highlights several on-chain dynamics that have limited Bitcoin‚Äôs ability to maintain price stability despite reduced available supply. Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‚ÄòNothing To Do Until October‚Äô Liquidity Constraints and Market Fragility According to Arab Chain‚Äôs analysis, a sharp collapse in the liquidity inventory ratio began in mid-July, falling to levels representing just over three months of available supply on major trading platforms. This metric tracks how much Bitcoin is accessible for sale relative to the pace of market activity. Normally, reduced supply would lead to upward price pressure. However, Arab Chain notes that insufficient new demand left the market vulnerable, resulting in the opposite effect. ‚ÄúWhen liquidity is thin and there is no consistent buying activity from large investors or ETFs, even small sell orders can lead to significant price drops,‚Äù Arab Chain explained. This behavior mirrors ‚Äúthin market‚Äù conditions, where limited order book depth magnifies volatility and makes prices more susceptible to sudden downward moves. The analysis suggests that market fragility could persist unless fresh demand enters the market. Historically, periods of constrained liquidity combined with a lack of large-scale buyers have led to prolonged corrections in Bitcoin‚Äôs price trajectory. ETF Demand Volatility and Weak Accumulation Another factor influencing the recent decline has been the erratic demand for Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Arab Chain observed sharp fluctuations in ETF inflows, with rapid surges followed by strong outflows, leaving no consistent institutional support to stabilize prices. This inconsistent participation from ETFs, which have become a major driver of Bitcoin demand since their approval, contributed to weaker price resilience during sell-offs. Additionally, on-chain data showed that ‚Äúsmart portfolios,‚Äù or high-value addresses typically associated with strategic accumulation, exhibited only modest buying activity during the recent downturn. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Selling More Aggressively As Bull Cycle Matures: Risk Appetite Fades? Although accumulation signals long-term confidence, its slow and limited pace failed to counterbalance selling pressure in real time. This lack of immediate demand further weakened market support. Additionally, while investors closely monitor liquidity conditions, ETF flows, and long-term holder activity for signs of a potential rebound. Analysts suggest that sustained institutional buying or an uptick in accumulation from large addresses could help restore stability. Until then, Bitcoin may remain in a vulnerable position, with its price movement largely dependent on shifts in demand and available liquidity.

For investors looking beyond the usual names, August is shaping up to be a key window to reposition into undervalued assets that haven‚Äôt yet caught up to the broader momentum. Topping the list? A political memecoin with growing relevance‚Äîand four strong infrastructure tokens riding under-the-radar narratives of their own. 1. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Community-Driven, Narrative-Aligned, and Rapidly Gaining Traction At the front of the pack is MAGACOIN FINANCE , a meme-powered altcoin that blends political identity with decentralized governance. Unlike most meme tokens, MAGACOIN FINANCE is rooted in a clear cultural ethos‚Äîappealing to a base that‚Äôs not just speculative, but values-driven. MAGACOIN FINANCE Presale Sparks Investor Surge‚ÄîRanked One of the Best Crypto Presales to Buy Right Now , with analysts calling it one of the top early-stage crypto opportunities. Early whale activity, surging community growth, and strong positioning outside the typical Layer 1 narrative have all fueled rising momentum. It‚Äôs gaining traction not from hype, but from offering something different: a token built on anti-centralization and community-first development . As investors look for what‚Äôs next, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging not just as a memecoin‚Äîbut as a potential movement. 2. Avalanche (AVAX): Layer 1 Strength Meets Institutional Momentum Avalanche is quietly gaining ground again. After clearing some key technical resistance zones, AVAX is showing signs of a broader recovery. With consistent developer growth, ecosystem expansion, and real-world partnerships, the fundamentals remain strong‚Äîeven if price action has been volatile. It‚Äôs still trading well below previous highs, making AVAX one of the more compelling undervalued altcoins in the Layer 1 race. 3. Arbitrum (ARB): Oversold, Underwatched, and Near a Possible Reversal ARB has struggled in 2025, down sharply from all-time highs. But accumulation near its lows suggests patient buyers are stepping in. With a large token unlock looming mid-August, short-term pressure is likely‚Äîbut long-term, Arbitrum remains essential to Ethereum‚Äôs scaling future. For contrarians, this may be the moment to start paying attention again. 4. Stacks (STX): Bitcoin‚Äôs Smart Contract Gateway Stacks is one of the few altcoins tied directly to Bitcoin‚Äôs programmable future. As Bitcoin gains fresh attention from institutions, STX‚Äôs role in enabling DeFi, NFTs, and applications on Bitcoin gives it strategic long-term potential. Clear resistance sits near $0.90‚Äîbut if broken, analysts expect a move toward $2 or higher before year‚Äôs end. 5. Immutable X (IMX): NFT Infrastructure Under Pressure‚ÄîBut Not Out IMX is under short-term pressure due to an upcoming token unlock. Still, it‚Äôs a backbone for blockchain gaming and NFT infrastructure‚Äîand those sectors tend to rebound fast once supply shocks are absorbed. With active development and solid user activity, IMX offers exposure to one of crypto‚Äôs most resilient niches. Final Thought Altcoin opportunities don‚Äôt always scream for attention‚Äîbut in markets like this, they don‚Äôt have to. While infrastructure tokens like AVAX and STX offer solid upside, and ARB and IMX present discounted entries, MAGACOIN FINANCE stands apart: a culturally driven, ideologically rooted project built on community and conviction . For investors who want more than just a trade, this may be one of the most distinctive tokens to watch as the next cycle unfolds.

The announcement was made on Monday through Phantom‚Äôs official X (formerly Twitter) account. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve acquired Solsniper, one of the fastest, most advanced trading platforms on Solana,‚Äù Phantom posted . ‚ÄúBuilt for precision and speed, Solsniper helps traders monitor tokens, track wallets, and react instantly.‚Äù Solsniper is renowned for its real-time token tracking, which offers highly sophisticated wallet analytics and lightning-quick trading execution. This has made it popular with traders in the Solana meme coin space due to its features that deal with the rapid marketplace. The purchase of Solsniper will be a large pivot on the vision of Phantom . Formerly considered little more than a Web3 wallet, the company seeks to evolve into a trading and crypto infrastructure platform. Launched in 2021, Phantom soon emerged as the wallet of choice for Solana users because of its easy-to-use interface and best-in-class security. Later, the team also added additional support for Ethereum and Polygon networks. Earlier this year, Phantom raised $150 million in a Series C funding round. The round was led by major venture capital firms Sequoia Capital and Paradigm, giving Phantom a valuation of $3 billion. Phantom maintains Solsniper as an independent platform For now, Phantom has confirmed that Solsniper will continue operating independently and won‚Äôt be immediately shut down or integrated into its existing app. All existing Solsniper users can continue using the tool as they are now. Phantom has also promised that updates and new additions are on the way, with releases planned over the next few months. Still, its commitment to keep Solsniper as a separate product shows Phantom intends to preserve the platform‚Äôs status quo while slowly adding new features. Phantom stated that it is evolving beyond its role as a simple wallet and indicated that users should expect more strategic acquisitions as the company works to broaden its product offerings and speed up its development efforts. This isn‚Äôt Phantom‚Äôs first company acquisition to boost its offerings. In February, it bought SimpleHash, a cross-chain NFT and token metadata provider. That move strengthened Phantom‚Äôs ability to support decentralized applications and NFT traders. Phantom is building a full-stack trading and data ecosystem with both acquisitions on top of its core wallet service. Phantom prepares for meme coin surge with Solsniper Solana-based meme coins will see explosive growth in 2025. Launchpads like Pump.fun made it easy for anyone to create and trade meme tokens within minutes. In January, Pump.fun alone recorded daily trading volumes of over $3 billion. This surge created a massive demand for fast, reliable tools that could give traders an edge ‚Äî especially tools that allow for rapid entry into new token launches, also known as ‚Äúsniping.‚Äù Platforms like Solsniper became essential, allowing users to track liquidity, follow whale wallets, and trade in real-time ‚Äî often within seconds of a new token going live. While trading volumes have since cooled off, interest in memecoins and token tools remains high. Phantom‚Äôs acquisition of Solsniper shows that it closely watches trader behavior and adjusts its product strategy accordingly. Crypto traders are no longer just storing assets in wallets. They are tracking, swapping, and actively engaging in fast-paced markets. Get seen where it counts.

As artificial intelligence rapidly evolves, a formidable new guardian is emerging to fortify our digital defenses: the AI bug hunter . Google‚Äôs recent announcement regarding its cutting-edge AI, ‚ÄúBig Sleep,‚Äù marks a pivotal moment, showcasing AI‚Äôs profound capability to pinpoint critical software flaws before malicious actors can exploit them. This development is not just a technological feat; it‚Äôs a significant step towards a more resilient digital future for everyone, from individual users to large-scale enterprises relying on complex software ecosystems. AI Bug Hunter: Google‚Äôs Big Sleep Uncovers 20 Critical Flaws Google‚Äôs AI-powered vulnerability researcher, aptly named ‚ÄúBig Sleep‚Äù ‚Äì a nod to its deep learning capabilities ‚Äì has officially reported its inaugural batch of 20 security vulnerabilities. This groundbreaking achievement was announced by Heather Adkins, Google‚Äôs Vice President of Security, highlighting the practical application of advanced AI in safeguarding digital infrastructure. Developed through a powerful collaboration between Google‚Äôs AI division, DeepMind, and its elite hacking team, Project Zero, Big Sleep meticulously identified these flaws primarily within popular open-source software. Specifically, the audio and video processing library FFmpeg and the image-editing suite ImageMagick were among the affected projects. These applications are foundational components for countless digital services and products, meaning a vulnerability in them could have far-reaching consequences across various industries, including those interacting with blockchain and digital assets. The fact that Big Sleep autonomously found and reproduced these vulnerabilities is profoundly significant. While Google maintains a standard policy of withholding specific details until the bugs are fixed ‚Äì a responsible approach to prevent exploitation ‚Äì the very existence of these findings underscores the immense potential of AI in cybersecurity. Royal Hansen, Google‚Äôs Vice President of Engineering, aptly described these discoveries as demonstrating ‚Äúa new frontier in automated vulnerability discovery.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt just about speed; it‚Äôs about the ability of AI to sift through vast amounts of code, identify intricate patterns, and predict potential weaknesses with a precision and scale that often eludes human analysis alone. The implications for the rapid detection and mitigation of threats are immense, offering a proactive shield against evolving cyber dangers. Google AI and the Human Element in Cybersecurity The success of Big Sleep is a testament to the sophisticated capabilities of Google AI , particularly in the realm of large language models (LLMs) applied to security research. DeepMind brings its unparalleled expertise in AI development, while Project Zero contributes its world-renowned experience in identifying zero-day vulnerabilities and advanced persistent threats. This synergy is crucial for training an AI that can truly understand the nuances of code and potential exploits. However, the path to a fully autonomous AI bug hunter is still evolving. Google‚Äôs spokesperson, Kimberly Samra, clarified that ‚ÄúTo ensure high quality and actionable reports, we have a human expert in the loop before reporting, but each vulnerability was found and reproduced by the AI agent without human intervention.‚Äù This ‚Äúhuman-in-the-loop‚Äù approach is a critical distinction. It means that while the AI performs the arduous task of initial discovery and reproduction, human intelligence provides the final layer of verification and strategic judgment. This collaboration is vital for several reasons: it ensures the validity of the findings, prioritizes vulnerabilities based on real-world impact, and helps to refine the AI‚Äôs learning process by filtering out false positives. Far from being a limitation, this partnership signifies the most effective way to leverage AI in complex domains like cybersecurity, where precision and context are paramount. It illustrates a future where AI augments human capabilities, rather than entirely replacing them, leading to a more robust and intelligent defense system against digital threats. The Expanding Cybersecurity AI Landscape: Beyond Big Sleep Google‚Äôs Big Sleep is a prominent example, but it operates within a rapidly expanding ecosystem of cybersecurity AI tools. The concept of LLM-powered systems designed to identify and exploit vulnerabilities is no longer theoretical; it‚Äôs a tangible reality. Beyond Big Sleep, other notable players include RunSybil and XBOW. Each of these tools brings a unique approach to the challenge of automated vulnerability discovery. XBOW, for instance, has already garnered significant attention, reaching the top of one of the U.S. leaderboards on HackerOne, a leading bug bounty platform. This achievement underscores the practical efficacy of such AI tools in a competitive, real-world environment where the stakes are high and accuracy is rewarded. The emergence of these diverse AI solutions signifies a ‚Äúnew frontier‚Äù not just in discovery but in the entire cybersecurity paradigm. They promise to dramatically increase the speed and scale at which vulnerabilities can be found, potentially shifting the advantage from attackers to defenders. Vlad Ionescu, co-founder and CTO of RunSybil, offered a professional endorsement of Big Sleep, stating that it is a ‚Äúlegit‚Äù project due to its ‚Äúgood design, people behind it know what they‚Äôre doing, Project Zero has the bug finding experience and DeepMind has the firepower and tokens to throw at it.‚Äù This expert validation from within the industry highlights the credibility and robust foundation of Google‚Äôs initiative. The increasing investment and innovation in this sector indicate a collective recognition of AI‚Äôs potential to revolutionize digital defense, making the internet a safer place for all forms of digital interaction, including the burgeoning Web3 space. Navigating the Challenges of Security Vulnerabilities: The ‚ÄúAI Slop‚Äù Dilemma While the promise of AI-driven vulnerability discovery is immense, it‚Äôs not without its significant hurdles. One of the most pressing concerns within the cybersecurity community, particularly among those who maintain various software projects, is the phenomenon of ‚Äúhallucinations.‚Äù These are instances where AI-powered bug hunters generate reports that, despite appearing legitimate, are actually erroneous or non-existent vulnerabilities. This issue has led some to label these misleading reports as the ‚Äúbug bounty equivalent of AI slop,‚Äù a term that vividly captures the frustration experienced by developers who must sift through potentially useless data. Vlad Ionescu of RunSybil previously articulated this challenge, stating, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the problem people are running into, is we‚Äôre getting a lot of stuff that looks like gold, but it‚Äôs actually just crap.‚Äù This ‚ÄúAI slop‚Äù can significantly burden development teams, consuming valuable time and resources as they investigate false alarms. It highlights a critical area for improvement in AI models: enhancing their ability to discern true vulnerabilities from patterns that merely resemble them. Addressing this requires more sophisticated training datasets, better contextual understanding by the AI, and robust feedback mechanisms from human experts. The goal is to maximize the efficiency of AI in identifying security vulnerabilities while minimizing the overhead associated with false positives, ensuring that these powerful tools remain a net positive for the cybersecurity community rather than adding to its workload. Strengthening Open-Source Security with AI Innovation The primary targets of Big Sleep‚Äôs initial findings were prominent open-source projects like FFmpeg and ImageMagick. This focus underscores the profound and transformative implications of AI for open-source security . Open-source software forms the backbone of vast swathes of the internet and modern technology, from operating systems to web servers, and increasingly, components of blockchain infrastructure. Its collaborative nature, while fostering innovation, can also present unique security challenges, as vulnerabilities might remain undetected for longer periods due to the sheer volume of code and diverse developer contributions. Traditionally, open-source security relies heavily on community vigilance, manual code reviews, and bug bounty programs. While effective, these methods can be time-consuming and may not scale adequately with the exponential growth of open-source projects. AI-powered tools like Big Sleep offer a game-changing solution. They can rapidly scan and analyze millions of lines of code, identifying subtle flaws that might be missed by human eyes or traditional automated scanners. This capability allows for a more proactive approach to security, potentially reducing the window of opportunity for attackers. By enhancing the integrity and resilience of open-source software, AI contributes to the overall stability and trustworthiness of the digital ecosystem, directly benefiting industries built upon these foundational technologies, including the cryptocurrency space which frequently leverages open-source code for its protocols and applications. The continuous refinement of these AI tools promises to make open-source software even more secure and reliable for global adoption. Conclusion: AI‚Äôs Pivotal Role in a Secure Digital Future Google‚Äôs Big Sleep represents a momentous leap forward in the application of AI to cybersecurity. By successfully identifying 20 critical vulnerabilities in widely used open-source software, it unequivocally demonstrates the immense potential of AI as a powerful ally in the ongoing battle against cyber threats. This achievement ushers in an era of more proactive, efficient, and scalable digital defense mechanisms. While the integration of human expertise remains vital for validating AI-generated reports and mitigating the challenge of ‚ÄúAI slop,‚Äù the trajectory is clear: AI is poised to become an indispensable component of our cybersecurity infrastructure. The collaboration between advanced AI capabilities and human oversight promises a future where digital systems are inherently more resilient.

For those deeply invested in the decentralized ethos of cryptocurrencies and the principles of digital ownership, the latest revelations surrounding AI scraping practices are particularly concerning. AI startup Perplexity, known for its conversational AI, stands accused by internet infrastructure giant Cloudflare of deliberately circumventing website preferences and engaging in unauthorized data collection. This controversy highlights a critical clash between AI innovation and the fundamental rights of content creators. Unpacking the Cloudflare Allegations Against Perplexity AI Cloudflare, a prominent internet security and infrastructure provider, recently published a detailed report, accusing AI startup Perplexity AI of systematically ignoring explicit instructions from websites to prevent content scraping. Cloudflare‚Äôs research details how Perplexity allegedly went to great lengths to obscure its identity and bypass established web standards like `robots.txt`. This web standard is a simple file that tells crawlers which parts of a site they can or cannot access, serving as a digital ‚Äòno trespassing‚Äô sign for automated bots. Cloudflare‚Äôs observations span tens of thousands of domains and millions of requests daily, indicating a widespread pattern of behavior. How Perplexity Allegedly Circumvented Cloudflare Blocking Measures According to Cloudflare‚Äôs findings, the methods employed by Perplexity to circumvent content restrictions were sophisticated and deliberate. Cloudflare observed the AI startup attempting to hide its crawling and scraping activities. The primary tactics identified include: User Agent Manipulation : Perplexity‚Äôs bots allegedly changed their ‚Äòuser agent‚Äô ‚Äì a digital signature that identifies a visitor‚Äôs device and browser type. When their declared crawler was blocked, they reportedly impersonated generic browsers like Google Chrome on macOS. Autonomous System Network (ASN) Changes : The startup is also accused of altering their Autonomous System Networks (ASNs), which are unique numbers identifying large networks on the internet. This makes it harder to trace and block their activity based on network origin. Obscuring Identity : Cloudflare‚Äôs researchers noted Perplexity‚Äôs efforts to obscure its identity, suggesting a clear intent to bypass website preferences and avoid detection. These actions, if true, represent a direct challenge to the mechanisms website owners use to control their content, making Cloudflare blocking efforts crucial for digital autonomy. Perplexity‚Äôs Response: Dismissal and Denial In the face of these serious allegations, Perplexity offered a swift, albeit dismissive, rebuttal. Jesse Dwyer, a spokesperson for Perplexity, characterized Cloudflare‚Äôs detailed blog post as merely a ‚Äòsales pitch.‚Äô Dwyer further claimed that the screenshots provided in Cloudflare‚Äôs report showed ‚Äòno content was accessed‚Äô and, in a follow-up, controversially asserted that the specific bot named by Cloudflare ‚Äòisn‚Äôt even ours.‚Äô This stark contrast in narratives leaves the tech community debating the truth behind the accusations and the ethical responsibilities of AI developers. The Critical Role of Robots.txt Bypass in AI Training The core of this controversy lies in the alleged Robots.txt Bypass . Websites use `robots.txt` files to communicate their preferences to web crawlers. While not legally binding, it‚Äôs a widely accepted ethical standard in the internet community. When AI companies like Perplexity allegedly ignore these explicit instructions, it raises fundamental questions about data ethics and intellectual property rights in the age of generative AI. AI models require vast amounts of data for training, and unauthorized scraping undermines the very foundation of content creation and ownership, threatening the economic models of publishers and individual creators alike. This ongoing challenge necessitates robust solutions and a clear framework for responsible AI development. Protecting Digital Assets: The Future of Data Privacy AI Cloudflare‚Äôs strong stance against unauthorized Data Privacy AI scraping reflects a growing concern across the internet. The company has not only de-listed Perplexity‚Äôs bots from its verified list but has also developed new techniques to block them. Beyond defensive measures, Cloudflare is actively pursuing solutions that empower content creators: AI Scraper Marketplace : Cloudflare recently launched a marketplace allowing website owners to charge AI scrapers for accessing their content, turning a challenge into a potential revenue stream. Free Bot Prevention Tool : Last year, they introduced a free tool specifically designed to prevent bots from scraping websites for AI training purposes without permission. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince has openly voiced concerns that AI is ‚Äòbreaking the business model of the internet,‚Äô particularly for publishers who rely on their content for revenue. This ongoing battle highlights the urgent need for clearer guidelines and enforceable standards for AI data acquisition. A Pattern of Plagiarism Accusations Against Perplexity This isn‚Äôt the first time Perplexity has faced accusations regarding its data acquisition and attribution practices. Last year, prominent news outlets, including Wired, alleged that Perplexity was plagiarizing their content by reproducing it without proper citation or permission. Adding to the controversy, Perplexity‚Äôs CEO, Aravind Srinivas, struggled to define the company‚Äôs stance on plagiarism during an interview at the Disrupt 2024 conference. These recurring incidents paint a picture of an AI startup navigating a complex ethical landscape, often at odds with established norms of content usage and attribution. The ongoing dispute between Cloudflare and Perplexity underscores a pivotal moment in the evolution of AI and the internet. As AI models become increasingly sophisticated and data-hungry, the ethical lines around content acquisition are blurring. For content creators, publishers, and indeed, anyone who values digital ownership, the ability to control how their data is used is paramount. This incident serves as a stark reminder that while AI promises innovation, it must operate within a framework of respect for intellectual property and user preferences. The outcome of such disputes will undoubtedly shape the future of AI development and the very structure of the open web.

For those in the cryptocurrency space, who thrive on technological disruption and groundbreaking advancements, the latest offering from Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI is certainly turning heads. Introducing Grok Imagine , an AI image and video generator that isn‚Äôt just pushing the boundaries of creativity, but also challenging conventional content moderation. Grok Imagine : Pushing Boundaries in AI Generation Elon Musk, known for his audacious ventures, has once again delivered on his promise of an ‚Äúunfiltered, boundary-pushing AI.‚Äù His company, xAI, has officially launched Grok Imagine , an innovative AI tool now available to all SuperGrok and Premium+ X users on its iOS app. This generator stands out not just for its advanced capabilities in transforming text or image prompts into dynamic 15-second videos complete with native audio, but for its controversial ‚Äúspicy mode.‚Äù This feature allows users to generate sexually explicit content, including partial female nudity. While there are some built-in limitations, with more extreme prompts resulting in blurred and inaccessible ‚Äúmoderated‚Äù images, Bitcoin World‚Äôs own tests successfully generated semi-nude imagery. This move aligns with Musk‚Äôs vision for Grok, which he positions as an AI free from the typical constraints of censorship, offering a unique, albeit risky, creative freedom to its users. The xAI Approach: Unfiltered Innovation and its Implications The release of Grok Imagine with its ‚Äúspicy mode‚Äù is not an isolated incident for xAI . It follows closely on the heels of their previous launch of a raunchy, hyper-sexualized anime AI companion, signaling a clear direction for Musk‚Äôs AI endeavors: less moderation, more freedom. This philosophy, while appealing to some for its promise of unbridled creativity, also carries significant risks. The original Grok chatbot, lauded for its unrestrained nature, eventually faced criticism for spewing hateful, antisemitic, and misogynistic content. This history raises pertinent questions about the potential ‚Äúunintended consequences‚Äù of Grok Imagine . While empowering users with creative tools, an unfiltered approach could inadvertently lead to the proliferation of harmful or exploitative content, posing considerable ethical and societal challenges. The initial reports from xAI employee Mati Roy, who publicly stated that ‚ÄúGrok Imagine videos have a spicy mode that can do nudity‚Äù in a now-deleted post, underscore the company‚Äôs awareness of this controversial feature from the outset. Understanding the Capabilities of This Advanced AI Image Generator Beyond the controversy, how does this AI image generator actually perform? Grok Imagine aims to compete with established players like Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and Runway, and its technical prowess is certainly noteworthy. Users can expect rapid image generation, often in mere seconds from a text prompt. The interface is designed to be seamless and intuitive, allowing for continuous auto-generation of new images as you scroll, which can then be animated into stylized videos. However, it‚Äôs still in its early stages. While impressive, the generated images and videos of humans sometimes fall into the ‚Äúuncanny valley,‚Äù exhibiting waxy-looking skin and a cartoonish quality. Furthermore, while the ‚Äúspicy mode‚Äù exists, there are clear limitations. Bitcoin World‚Äôs attempts to generate explicit celebrity content, such as a pregnant Donald Trump, were unsuccessful, yielding only images of Trump holding a baby or next to a pregnant woman. This indicates some level of internal restriction, which is a heartening sign given the potential for misuse, especially concerning public figures like Taylor Swift or Donald Trump. Elon Musk AI : Shaping the Future of Content Creation? The influence of Elon Musk AI initiatives extends far beyond the technical specifications of Grok Imagine. Musk‚Äôs ventures consistently disrupt industries, and his entry into the generative AI space with a tool that explicitly allows NSFW content sets a new precedent. This approach challenges existing norms of AI safety and ethical guidelines prevalent among other leading AI developers. It forces a conversation about the balance between freedom of expression and responsible AI deployment. Musk himself has stated that the model will ‚Äúget better every day,‚Äù suggesting rapid iterations and improvements are on the horizon. This commitment, combined with xAI‚Äôs willingness to push boundaries, positions Grok Imagine as a significant player in the evolving landscape of AI-driven content creation. Its impact could redefine what users expect from AI tools and how content moderation is approached across the digital sphere. Navigating the Future of Generative AI The emergence of Generative AI tools like Grok Imagine highlights a critical juncture for technology and society. On one hand, these tools offer unparalleled creative potential, democratizing content creation and allowing users to visualize complex ideas instantly. The ability to produce images and videos from simple text prompts, and to rapidly iterate on visual concepts, can revolutionize fields from marketing and entertainment to education and design. On the other hand, the ‚Äúspicy mode‚Äù and the broader unfiltered philosophy of xAI raise significant ethical concerns. The potential for deepfakes, misinformation, and the spread of non-consensual explicit content becomes a more pressing issue. As this technology matures, the debate around AI governance, content filters, and user responsibility will intensify. Users and developers alike will need to navigate this complex landscape, ensuring that innovation serves humanity while mitigating potential harms. The ongoing development of Grok Imagine will serve as a key case study in this evolving discussion. Grok Imagine represents a bold, and undeniably controversial, step in the evolution of AI image and video generation. While its ‚Äúspicy mode‚Äù has garnered significant attention, it‚Äôs crucial to look beyond the sensationalism to understand the broader implications of xAI‚Äôs approach to unfiltered AI. The tool offers impressive speed and an intuitive user experience, but its current limitations in human realism and the ethical questions surrounding its content generation capabilities mean its journey is just beginning. As Elon Musk‚Äôs AI ventures continue to challenge the status quo, the world will be watching to see how Grok Imagine evolves and what new conversations it sparks about the future of generative AI and digital content.

CFTC Acting Chairman Caroline Pham unveiled the plan on Monday, calling it the first move in the commission‚Äôs broader ‚Äú crypto sprint ,‚Äù a program aimed at quickly implementing key policy recommendations from the President‚Äôs Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. Pham framed the effort as part of a broader push under President Trump‚Äôs leadership to bring digital assets into the federal regulatory fold.

In spot trading, buyers and sellers exchange digital assets directly and immediately, unlike futures trading, where contracts are based on predictions of future crypto prices. Regulators Ask for Clarity on Crypto-Securities Boundary Stakeholders have until Aug. 18, 2025, to share their feedback through the CFTC‚Äôs website. In the meantime, the agency is seeking input on how to regulate spot crypto trading. It is focusing on laws that govern retail commodity transactions. Additionally, it is reviewing compliance requirements for registered exchanges. The commission is also seeking input on how its framework would interact with securities regulations, especially in cases where crypto assets may not meet the legal definition of securities. All comments submitted will be made public on the CFTC‚Äôs website. Unified Crypto Framework May Merge Futures and Securities Oversight The move signals growing coordination between the CFTC and SEC as both agencies look to bring clarity to crypto regulation. Just last week, SEC Chairman Paul Atkins introduced Project Crypto. This is a broad initiative to modernize securities laws for blockchain-based assets. It aims to clarify how crypto assets are classified, distributed and traded. In particular, it seeks to resolve longstanding confusion around the Howey test. The test is used to determine whether an asset qualifies as a security. Over time, it has become a sticking point for crypto companies. As a result, many have treated their tokens as securities by default. They remain cautious due to the risk of enforcement actions. Project Crypto is expected to provide a more tailored regulatory approach. With the CFTC‚Äôs latest initiative, the US may be moving closer to a dual-agency framework for digital asset regulation. This shift involves both the CFTC and the SEC. It comes at a time of growing demand from institutional and retail investors. Many are seeking clearer, regulated access to cryptocurrencies. If finalized, the CFTC‚Äôs plan could open the door for spot crypto trading under existing commodity laws, giving markets greater legal certainty without waiting for new legislation from Congress.

49561216,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=185728,1754367910,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/49561216.jpeg,Bitcoin Volatility: A Profound Shift Since Spot BTC ETF Launch,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-volatility-shift/,"BitcoinWorld Bitcoin Volatility: A Profound Shift Since Spot BTC ETF Launch The world of cryptocurrency has always been synonymous with dramatic price swings, but a remarkable shift is now underway. Recent data suggests that Bitcoin volatility , long a defining characteristic of the digital asset, has seen a profound decline. This significant change comes on the heels of a pivotal moment for the industry: the launch of spot BTC ETF products. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently highlighted this trend on X, noting a substantial reduction in Bitcoin‚Äôs 90-day rolling volatility. What does this mean for investors and the broader crypto market stability ? Let‚Äôs dive deeper into this fascinating development. What‚Äôs Driving the Change in Bitcoin Volatility ? Before the spot ETF launch, Bitcoin‚Äôs 90-day rolling volatility stood above 60. Today, for the first time, it has fallen below 40. This is a considerable drop, indicating a calmer trading environment for the premier cryptocurrency. Historically, Bitcoin was more than three times as volatile as gold. Now, this gap has narrowed dramatically, with Bitcoin being less than twice as volatile. This convergence suggests a maturation of the asset class. The introduction of spot BTC ETF s has provided institutional and retail investors with a regulated, accessible avenue to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the asset. This increased institutional participation often correlates with reduced price swings. Consider these key factors: Institutional Inflows: ETFs attract large institutional capital, which tends to be more long-term oriented and less prone to rapid, speculative trading. Market Efficiency: Enhanced liquidity and arbitrage opportunities created by ETFs can help in price discovery and reduce market inefficiencies. Mainstream Acceptance: The legitimacy conferred by ETFs can attract a broader base of investors, leading to a more diversified and stable market participant pool. How Does This Impact Digital Asset Investment ? For many, the high Bitcoin volatility was a significant barrier to entry. A more stable Bitcoin makes it a more appealing asset for a wider range of investors, including those with a lower risk tolerance. This newfound stability could position Bitcoin as a more viable long-term store of value, akin to traditional assets. It transforms the perception of Bitcoin from a purely speculative instrument to a more mature component of a diversified portfolio. Furthermore, a more stable Bitcoin price often sets a calmer tone for the entire crypto ecosystem. As the market leader, Bitcoin‚Äôs behavior significantly influences altcoins. Reduced Bitcoin volatility could contribute to overall crypto market stability . Investors might now consider larger allocations to digital assets, viewing them less as high-risk gambles and more as legitimate components of a balanced investment strategy. However, it is crucial to remember that no investment is without risk, and thorough research remains paramount. Navigating the New Era of Crypto Market Stability While the initial signs are promising, it is important to observe how this trend evolves. The long-term impact of spot BTC ETF s on Bitcoin volatility will become clearer over time. This period represents a significant evolution for digital asset investment . Despite the positive developments, the crypto market is still relatively young and subject to various external factors. These include regulatory changes, macroeconomic shifts, and technological advancements. Such factors can still introduce periods of price fluctuation. Nevertheless, experts believe that as more institutional money flows into the space via ETFs, the market will continue to mature, potentially leading to even greater stability. This could pave the way for further adoption of cryptocurrencies in mainstream finance. The benefits of this shift are clear: Increased Investor Confidence: Lower volatility can attract new capital and long-term holders. Broader Adoption: More institutions and traditional investors may feel comfortable entering the space. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs contribute to deeper, more efficient markets, benefiting all participants. The profound decline in Bitcoin volatility following the launch of spot BTC ETFs marks a significant milestone for the digital asset space. What was once seen as an extremely speculative asset is now demonstrating signs of greater maturity and stability. This shift could fundamentally reshape how investors perceive and interact with cryptocurrencies, paving the way for a new era of digital asset investment and broader crypto market stability . Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Bitcoin volatility? Bitcoin volatility refers to the degree of variation in Bitcoin‚Äôs price over a period. High volatility means large, rapid price swings, while low volatility indicates more stable prices. Q2: How have spot BTC ETFs influenced Bitcoin volatility? Spot BTC ETFs have increased institutional participation and liquidity, leading to a more mature and efficient market. This has helped to absorb large trades and reduce sudden price movements, thereby lowering Bitcoin volatility. Q3: What are the benefits of reduced Bitcoin volatility for digital asset investment? Lower Bitcoin volatility makes it a more attractive asset for a wider range of investors, including those with lower risk tolerance. It also enhances Bitcoin‚Äôs appeal as a long-term store of value and can contribute to overall crypto market stability. Q4: Does reduced Bitcoin volatility mean the Bitcoin price will no longer fluctuate? No, reduced Bitcoin volatility does not mean the price will stop fluctuating entirely. It simply means the magnitude and frequency of large price swings are likely to decrease, making it a relatively more stable asset compared to its past behavior. Q5: Is the crypto market stability trend expected to continue? While current trends are positive, the crypto market is still evolving. Many experts believe that continued institutional adoption via ETFs and further regulatory clarity will contribute to ongoing crypto market stability, though external economic factors can always introduce new dynamics.

Separately, Pi Network‚Äôs official account reminded its users how they can benefit by locking up their tokens. Passkey Added The verification process at all Pi Network systems has been a highly controversial topic within its community, as countless users have complained in the past that they were unable to receive the necessary green light, despite the team‚Äôs continuous efforts. Pi News‚Äô screenshot of the latest update shows the addition of Passkey in the Pi Wallet, which is positioned just below the information about whether the account has been verified through an ID and the password for entering the account. Passkey is an interesting alternative as it works in the following way: it‚Äôs a passwordless login method, which aims to replace traditional passwords with a more secure and convenient alternative. Users can employ biometrics (fingerprint or facial recognition) or a device PIN, instead of typing in a password. They are unique to each user and device, and offer enhanced protection against different types of exploits, such as phishing and account takeovers.

Increased Transparency: Blockchain transactions are recorded on a public ledger, offering a clear and auditable trail for every transfer. Broader Accessibility: For users in regions with limited access to traditional banking, digital remittance solutions powered by stablecoins can provide a vital financial bridge. This initiative underscores a growing trend of stablecoin adoption within the mainstream financial sector. What Challenges and Opportunities Lie Ahead for Blockchain Payments?

The recent news of the Indian Rupee hitting a record low against the US Dollar, primarily triggered by the escalating Trump Tariff threat, serves as a stark reminder of how geopolitical tensions can send immediate ripples through global economies. For those accustomed to the volatility of cryptocurrencies, understanding the forces that sway fiat currencies like the Rupee provides crucial context for the broader financial ecosystem, highlighting the interconnectedness of all financial instruments, from decentralized digital currencies to established national tenders. What Triggered the Indian Rupee‚Äôs Alarming Decline? The Indian Rupee found itself in unprecedented territory, plumbing new depths against the mighty US Dollar. This alarming decline was not an isolated event but rather a direct consequence of mounting global trade tensions, specifically the renewed threats of tariffs from the United States under the then-Trump administration. When the US signaled its intent to impose tariffs on goods from various countries, including key trading partners, it sent a jolt through international markets. Investors, seeking safety amidst the uncertainty, began to pull capital from riskier, growth-oriented economies like India and park it in perceived safe-haven assets, predominantly the US Dollar. This sudden flight of capital created a surge in demand for the dollar, inevitably weakening currencies like the Rupee. The mechanism is straightforward: when foreign investors sell their Indian assets (stocks, bonds) to move their money elsewhere, they convert their Rupees into dollars, increasing the supply of Rupees and the demand for dollars. This imbalance directly contributes to the currency depreciation . Furthermore, the fear of a looming global trade war also dampened export prospects for India, reducing potential dollar inflows and exacerbating the Rupee‚Äôs woes. The sentiment of economic uncertainty alone can trigger significant market movements, as seen in the rapid devaluation of the Indian Rupee . Understanding the Trump Tariff Threat and its Global Ripple Effects The concept of the Trump Tariff threat emerged from an ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô economic policy, which sought to protect domestic industries through the imposition of import duties. Initially targeting steel and aluminum, these tariffs quickly expanded to include a wider range of goods, particularly from China, igniting fears of a full-blown Global Trade War . The rationale behind these tariffs was to reduce trade deficits and encourage domestic production, but their immediate effect was widespread market instability and retaliation from affected countries. The global ripple effects were immediate and far-reaching: Disruption of Supply Chains: Companies that rely on international sourcing faced increased costs, forcing them to either absorb losses, pass costs to consumers, or rethink their global manufacturing strategies. Investor Uncertainty: The unpredictable nature of tariff announcements created a climate of fear, leading investors to shy away from long-term commitments in volatile markets. Retaliatory Measures: Countries affected by US tariffs often responded with their own tariffs on American goods, escalating the trade conflict and harming exporters on both sides. Slowing Global Growth: Reduced international trade, coupled with diminished business confidence, threatened to put a brake on global economic expansion, impacting demand for goods and services worldwide. This protectionist stance, while intended to benefit one nation, inadvertently created significant headwinds for the global economy, directly influencing the stability of various currencies, including the Indian Rupee . Why Does Currency Depreciation Matter for India? For a net importing nation like India, significant currency depreciation carries substantial economic consequences. When the Indian Rupee weakens against the US Dollar, it means that India has to pay more Rupees for every dollar‚Äôs worth of imports. Given India‚Äôs heavy reliance on imported crude oil, electronics, and machinery, this translates directly into higher import bills. The immediate implications for India include: Inflationary Pressure: Higher import costs are often passed on to consumers, leading to an increase in domestic prices for goods and services. This can erode purchasing power and impact household budgets. Increased Debt Burden: Many Indian companies and the government have borrowed in foreign currencies, particularly the US Dollar. A weaker Rupee makes it more expensive to service and repay these dollar-denominated debts, potentially straining corporate balance sheets and public finances. Impact on Foreign Direct Investment (FDI): While a weaker Rupee might make Indian assets cheaper for foreign investors, the underlying economic instability caused by currency depreciation can deter new FDI, as investors prefer stable and predictable markets. Travel and Education Costs: For Indian citizens planning to travel abroad or send their children for overseas education, the cost in Rupees significantly increases, making international experiences less accessible. While a weaker currency can theoretically boost exports by making them cheaper for foreign buyers, the context of a Global Trade War often means that overall global demand might be shrinking, negating much of this potential benefit. Thus, the currency depreciation of the Indian Rupee presents a net challenge for the nation‚Äôs economic stability. The Broader Implications for Emerging Markets The challenges faced by the Indian Rupee are often symptomatic of broader vulnerabilities within Emerging Markets . These economies, characterized by rapid growth but often less developed financial systems and higher external debt, are particularly susceptible to global economic shocks and shifts in investor sentiment. When a major economy like the US initiates protectionist policies or raises interest rates, it can trigger a ‚Äòcontagion effect‚Äô across the entire emerging market landscape. Key implications for Emerging Markets include: Challenge Explanation Capital Flight Investors pull funds from perceived riskier emerging market assets and move them to safer havens like US Treasury bonds, leading to currency depreciation and stock market declines. Increased Borrowing Costs As foreign capital exits, emerging market governments and companies find it more expensive to borrow, either domestically or internationally, stifling investment and growth. Imported Inflation Similar to India, reliance on imports means that weaker local currencies make essential goods, including energy and raw materials, more expensive, fueling inflation. Policy Dilemmas Central banks face a tough choice: raise interest rates to defend the currency (potentially hurting domestic growth) or allow the currency to depreciate further (risking inflation and debt issues). The interconnectedness of the global financial system means that a Trump Tariff threat, while aimed at specific trade imbalances, can create a ripple effect that destabilizes currencies and economies far beyond the direct targets, making the resilience of Emerging Markets a critical concern for global economic stability. Navigating the Global Trade War: Challenges and Potential Responses The specter of a Global Trade War presents complex challenges for policymakers worldwide, especially for countries like India that are deeply integrated into global supply chains. The uncertainty surrounding trade policies makes it difficult for businesses to plan and invest, potentially leading to reduced economic activity. Governments and central banks are left with a difficult balancing act, trying to mitigate the immediate impacts while also fostering long-term resilience. Potential responses and challenges include: Monetary Policy Tools: Central banks, like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), may consider interventions in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the Indian Rupee . However, such interventions can deplete foreign exchange reserves. Raising interest rates to attract capital is another option, but it risks slowing down domestic economic growth. Fiscal Measures: Governments might implement fiscal stimulus packages or provide support to industries most affected by tariffs to cushion the blow. However, this could strain public finances. Diversification of Trade Partners: Countries might actively seek to diversify their trade relationships, reducing reliance on specific markets that are prone to protectionist policies. This involves exploring new export markets and sourcing alternatives for critical imports. Strengthening Domestic Demand: Focusing on boosting internal consumption and investment can help offset the negative impacts of reduced international trade. Advocacy for Multilateralism: Engaging in international forums and advocating for open, rules-based trade systems remains crucial to counter protectionist tendencies and prevent a full-blown Global Trade War . The long-term economic outlook for countries caught in the crossfire depends heavily on their ability to adapt to changing global trade dynamics and implement sound economic policies that foster stability and growth despite external pressures. The experience of the Indian Rupee during this period underscores the critical need for robust economic frameworks in an increasingly unpredictable global landscape. The episode of the Indian Rupee hitting a record low due to the Trump Tariff threat serves as a powerful case study in the intricate dance between geopolitics, trade, and currency markets. It underscores how decisions made in one part of the world can have immediate and profound consequences across the globe, particularly for vulnerable Emerging Markets . The resulting currency depreciation highlights the challenges faced by nations striving for economic stability amidst the storm of a potential Global Trade War . As the world continues to navigate complex international relations, understanding these dynamics becomes paramount for investors, policymakers, and everyday citizens alike. The resilience of national economies will be tested, demanding agile responses and strategic foresight to weather future economic uncertainties.

This search makes identifying the best crypto to buy now crucial. Cardano faces technical and adoption hurdles Cardano confronts significant technical headwinds. Its price sits below key EMAs, including the 20, 50, and 100-period averages, signaling persistent weakness. The aspect of the three key interest areas is on the indicators. The DMI indicator exhibits that the -DI is well in the lead with 31.8 against a weak +DI line with 9.6, ascertaining the strength of the bearish trend indeed. Besides, the Bollinger Bands have expanded drastically to the lower side with the price of ADA below the lower band, thus an indicator of increased volatility on the selling side. Therefore, ADA‚Äôs near-term recovery depends heavily on holding the $0.68 support zone and overcoming the $0.78 resistance, a difficult task under current crypto prices. Mutuum Finance presale accelerates past $14 million Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) demonstrates exceptional presale traction, directly contrasting Cardano‚Äôs struggles. Investors have contributed over $14,000,000 since the presale began. More than 665 million MUTM tokens have been sold to 14,800 holders. Phase 6 is currently underway, offering tokens at $0.035. This price represents a substantial 250% increase from the opening phase cost of $0.01. Phase 6 is selling out rapidly, meaning the chance to acquire tokens at this discounted rate is ending soon. Consequently, the subsequent phase will see a 14.3% price hike to $0.04. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch officially at $0.06. Buying at the current Phase 6 price guarantees a minimum 71% return on investment at launch, making it a standout crypto investment opportunity. Robust security underpins Mutuum Finance project Security forms a critical pillar for Mutuum Finance (MUTM). The project team has successfully finalized its CertiK smart contract audit. This rigorous assessment yielded an outstanding 95.00 security score, reflecting a solid security posture. Complementing this, Mutuum Finance has launched an official Bug Bounty Program in partnership with CertiK. A substantial $50,000 USDT reward pool is allocated, split across four tiers based on vulnerability severity: Critical vulnerabilities Major vulnerabilities Minor vulnerabilities Low severity issues This proactive approach incentivizes continuous scrutiny and enhances platform safety for all users. Also, the project introduced a new dashboard complete with a leaderboard that monitors the top 50 holders of the token. These top owners will obtain bonuses in token form to continue occupying these positions, which promotes long-term investment. Compelling value proposition and future potential Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers tangible utility beyond speculative trading. Its core involves building a decentralized lending and borrowing platform operating efficiently on Layer-2 technology. The dual-lending model caters to diverse risk appetites, incorporating both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mechanisms. P2C allows tokenizing major assets like BTC or ETH to earn interest, while P2P facilitates direct lending agreements, potentially offering higher yields. Tokenomics drive inherent value: the fixed 4 billion token supply faces increasing demand pressure as platform usage grows. Based on its fundamentals and market positioning, post-launch targets reaching $1.50 appear achievable, translating to massive gains for Phase 6 investors. This potential makes it a compelling candidate for the best crypto to buy now, especially compared to assets like ADA facing strong bearish headwinds. Actionable opportunity amidst market volatility While Cardano wrestles with bearish technicals and adoption speed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presents a demonstrably different trajectory. For investors seeking assets with strong momentum and fundamental utility during this period of crypto market uncertainty, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a timely and strategic crypto investment.

The platform will operate on a Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending structure that will allow users to contribute blue-chip assets like ADA, BNB, or SOL into smart contract-based pools to earn yield. On the borrowing side, users will be able to stake BTC and instantly unlock USDT or USDC at up to 75% loan-to-value. This model will give investors both stability and flexibility. For those looking to personalize their lending experience, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also provide a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) option. This feature will let individuals set customized terms‚Äîideal for risk-managed trades or for leveraging high-risk tokens in the crypto ecosystem like DOGE, FLOKI, TRUMP, and BONK. The approach will blend passive income with customizable borrowing strategies, creating a truly user-centric lending marketplace. Additionally, Layer-2 blockchain integration will significantly reduce transaction costs, enhancing user efficiency without compromising decentralization. This technical advantage will make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) far more accessible than legacy DeFi protocols still dependent on expensive Layer-1 gas models. Limited-time price, high-level traction Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 6 of its presale with tokens available at just $0.035. Out of the allocated 170 million tokens for this round, 10% are already taken up, with over $14 million raised to date. The low presale price offers entry below the $0.06 planned listing, giving buyers a rare opportunity to gain early exposure to a platform gearing up for strong momentum. The project‚Äôs credibility is supported by a thorough CertiK audit, including a 95 Token Scan score and a 78 Skynet score‚Äîboth strong indicators of security and technical soundness. These scores reflect a well-audited smart contract framework and a roadmap that is already showing signs of serious execution. Adding to the community buzz is a $100,000 token giveaway ‚Äî10 winners will each receive $10,000 worth of MUTM each, giving thousands of participants a direct incentive to get involved. With over 14,900 holders and 12,000+ Twitter followers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining traction not just for its pricing, but also for its transparent operations and engaged community. Forecasts that turn heads, investments already paying off Experienced analysts are beginning to weigh in‚Äîand the expectations are substantial. One well-known market analyst, who made headlines in 2020 for correctly predicting XRP‚Äôs breakout, is now calling for a 20x rise in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as early as mid-2025. The reasoning is grounded in fundamentals: a decentralized stablecoin in development, real passive yield for lenders, and an integrated staking system that loops value back to long-term users. Already, some investors are reaping early benefits. One Phase 1 participant who swapped $3,000 in MATIC for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at $0.01 is now holding tokens worth over $10,000‚Äîeven before the official launch. With the token set to list at $0.06 and long-term targets approaching $1, these early positions are turning heads in investor circles. As whales start rotating out of large-cap positions in ETH, BTC, and AVAX in search of asymmetric upside, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is increasingly showing up on watchlists and wallets alike. The only undervalued contender left this summer Most of the summer‚Äôs top token picks have already taken off‚Äîmany of them now out of reach for the average investor. But with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) still priced under $0.05, it‚Äôs one of the last legitimate opportunities to enter a serious project at an early stage. With just 90% of Phase 6 tokens remaining and a scheduled 15% price jump to $0.040 in Phase 7, the current entry point won‚Äôt last much longer. Once listing happens, and especially as the Beta platform goes live, visibility and user demand are expected to climb significantly. Further exchange listings on major platforms like Binance, KuCoin, or Coinbase are likely to accelerate that growth, unlocking more exposure and bringing retail investors into the fold. Summer in crypto is usually filled with FOMO. For once, that fear might be justified. While others are buying tokens at peak valuations, investors who take action now on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are positioning themselves at the front of the next breakout curve.

The top altcoins to buy for the next bull run aren‚Äôt just hype plays; they come with real features, active platforms, and growing user bases. BlockDAG has pulled ahead with its GLOBAL LAUNCH release, now offering BDAG at just $0.0016, with a 3,025% ROI possible if it hits the $0.05 launch price. At the same time, Bittensor (TAO) gains strength through institutional backing. Render (RENDER) is building GPU infrastructure on Solana, and NEAR Protocol is deepening DeFi through Cardano integrations. All four projects offer something unique: AI, graphics, cross-chain swaps, and a live trading simulator. But only one offers access at ground-floor pricing, BlockDAG . 1. BlockDAG: $361M Raised, GLOBAL LAUNCH Release Offer Ending Soon BlockDAG is making fast progress in 2025. It has raised $361 million and sold over 24.7 billion coins. While the standard Batch 29 price is $0.0276, a special offer under the GLOBAL LAUNCH release has unlocked a limited $0.0016 entry price. This deal is live until August 11. After that, the price returns to its actual batch rate. For those who get in now, the difference is big. The listing price is confirmed at $0.05, setting up a projected 3,025% ROI from the GLOBAL LAUNCH release price and 2,660% from Batch 1. BlockDAG isn‚Äôt just collecting funds. It‚Äôs delivering. Its Demo Trading Exchange is already live, letting users experience BDAG trading in real time. Both buying and demo selling functions are active. Every BDAG purchase also qualifies for the 10 BTC Auction Pool. This reward model is based on how much a user buys, not luck, making it more fair and direct. Outside trading, BlockDAG‚Äôs X1 miner app is already being used by more than 2.5 million people. Its architecture combines DAG technology with Proof-of-Work to allow fast, scalable processing without the usual blockchain delays. All of these points position BlockDAG (BDAG) as the best altcoin to buy for the next bull run. It‚Äôs already built, already live, and already rewarding users. The GLOBAL LAUNCH release ends August 11. After that, the low $0.0016 entry closes for good. That‚Äôs why BDAG continues to rise to the top of analyst lists, and why many see it as the most promising project to hold in 2025. 2. Bittensor (TAO): AI Growth and Institutional Entry Bittensor (TAO) has started attracting strong attention this quarter. A major wallet recently staked 41,500 TAO‚Äîworth about $15.4 million- across Subtensor‚Äôs validator layer. This makes up 4% of TAO‚Äôs circulating supply and is earning close to 10% APY. That kind of long-term staking shows clear confidence from institutional players. Validators are increasing across the network, especially in subnet clusters, which has improved uptime and decentralisation. At the same time, emissions are being absorbed quickly by delegation, so there‚Äôs no dump pressure visible on-chain. TAO is shaping up to be more than just an AI concept. It‚Äôs turning into a full utility network focused on building a decentralised AI compute layer. With more tools going live and big money entering, TAO is now among the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run. 3. Render (RENDER): Solana GPU Power Gains Demand Render (RENDER) is moving fast. Built natively on Solana, it‚Äôs now being featured by exchanges like OKX and has grown its reach through GPU-based computing. With 517 million coins in circulation and a deflationary Burn-and-Mint system, RENDER keeps its supply controlled while supporting growing demand. The project is gaining real-world use with 3D graphics rendering, AI model training, and creative tools like OctaneRender. It‚Äôs even attracting interest from studios looking for cheaper, decentralised cloud alternatives. As GPU use increases across sectors, RENDER is catching attention beyond crypto circles. Its platform is functional, scalable, and already integrated with multiple industries. That utility, combined with its tight tokenomics, makes it one of the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run. 4. NEAR Protocol (NEAR): ADA Integration and Buy Pressure NEAR Protocol is showing clear signs of revival. Two key events pushed it back into analyst focus. First, NEAR launched a pilot with Cardano to allow trustless swaps of ADA using its Intents framework. This uses smart contracts like cardano.omft.near to carry out the swaps. Second, NEAR saw a sharp increase in trading activity, with volume up over 3% and price rising 3% in just one day. This followed increased interest from institutional buyers. The NEAR Intents platform has handled nearly $1 billion in total swap value and supports over 100 assets. This shows that NEAR‚Äôs settlement layer is catching on. With its unique AI sharding model and DeFi push, NEAR is regaining traction and looks like one of the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run. Final Thoughts on the Top Crypto Picks for the Next Bull Run The altcoin market is quickly sorting winners from talkers. TAO‚Äôs AI infrastructure, RENDER‚Äôs GPU platform, and NEAR‚Äôs DeFi push each have strong futures. But BlockDAG brings something rare, real progress, live features, and 3,025% ROI upside through its GLOBAL LAUNCH release. With $361 million raised, 24.7 billion coins sold, and a current $0.0016 price active only until August 11, BDAG offers unmatched value in this cycle. While others are scaling, BlockDAG is already operating. Its tools are live. Its rewards are flowing. That‚Äôs why it remains the top pick for those scanning the space for the best altcoins to buy for the next bull run.

Cold Wallet‚Äôs CWT now sells for $0.00924, with an expected listing at $0.3517. That‚Äôs a potential 3,633% gain before any post‚Äëlaunch growth. The concept behind Cold Wallet (CWT) is simple yet game‚Äëchanging, a wallet that rewards every transaction. With $5.6 million already raised and 15 stages gone almost instantly, demand shows no signs of slowing. It is not about proving if the model works; the real question is how much profit is left for those still watching. Every stage that sells pushes the buy‚Äëin higher, trimming the returns for those who delay while the market quickly locks in positions. Cold Wallet Solves Crypto Most Expensive Fee Problem Crypto wallets have long felt like hidden fee collectors. Every transfer takes a cut , gas, swaps, bridges, even converting to fiat. Cold Wallet changes this with one bold idea: transactions should grow balances, not drain them. Powered by CWT, Cold Wallet turns daily usage into earnings. Cashback comes from sending, rebates from swapping, and rewards even for moving money in or out. With 15 presale stages already gone and over $5.6 million secured, CWT is gaining strong market attention. A major push came from acquiring Plus Wallet for $270 million, adding over two million active users before launch. This move sets Cold Wallet apart, driving adoption faster than expected and making it one of the most anticipated names in the current crypto scene. Whales Buy Fast Every Stage Reduces Future ROI Cold Wallet‚Äôs presale is attracting serious capital. Large buyers are securing millions of CWT early, speeding up sellouts beyond initial forecasts. Stage 15 was gone in hours, and Stage 16 is quickly running low. Since the start, the price has already climbed more than 34%. Each completed stage narrows the gap between the entry cost and the fixed listing price of $0.3517, cutting future returns for late entrants. Those entering at the current $0.00924 mark still face a projected 3,633% upside, yet the opportunity shrinks with every stage gone. Watching stages vanish in real time is a clear signal that hesitation comes at a high cost in this fast‚Äëmoving presale cycle. Price Forecast Suggests Bigger Story After Launch The crypto presale numbers alone are striking a 3,633% return at launch for Stage 16 entries if CWT reaches $0.3517. Yet, many analysts think this is just the start. Market discussions in private groups already speculate on post‚Äëlaunch prices climbing toward $5 or even $10. At $0.00924, even a small rise toward these targets could turn a modest stake into life‚Äëchanging figures. The data is already visible for those who check the numbers, but the clock runs with every stage sold. The shrinking ROI with each increase in entry price is pushing early participation as the clear strategy before CWT hits public trading. One Thousand Dollar Stake Could Bring Thirty Seven Thousand Numbers tell the full picture. At $0.00924, a $1,000 stake secures over 108,000 CWT. If the coin meets its estimated launch value of $0.3517, that same stake becomes more than $37,000 before any post‚Äëlaunch movement.If CWT reached $5, the stake would exceed half a million dollars. At $10, it would pass $1 million. While these are projections, not guarantees, they explain why early stages draw heavy demand. Every new stage raises the price and reduces future gains. Many are stepping in now to capture maximum upside, leaving hesitation as the main reason others may watch opportunity slip away before launch. Conclusion At $0.00924, CWT offers an expected 3,633% ROI by launch , already less than it was just days ago. Stage 15 sold out in a flash, Stage 16 is depleting fast, and the ROI continues to shrink with each allocation claimed. The market‚Äôs response is clear: $5.6 million already secured and growing because CWT is seen as one of the top opportunities right now. A $1,000 stake today could be $37,000 at launch. Miss this stage, and the price rises while gains fall. Such clear, near‚Äëterm potential is rare in crypto, and missing it is the kind of story that gets told for years.

The influx of investor capital into ETH‚Äôs ecosystem through Ethereum hasn‚Äôt slowed down, a sign that analysts view as a positive signal for market stability. Meanwhile, there is a Remittix (RTX) , an ETH-based utility token developed to cater to low-cost and direct cross-border settlements. This new crypto project has become a fan favorite among natives who look forward to its 100x growth potential. Analysts believe both projects will deliver investors more profits than Cardano this cycle. ADA followed a similar price trajectory to Ethereum in the last 48 hours, but what‚Äôs next for the asset this quarter? Let‚Äôs answer this question, but before that, we will discuss Ethereum price action and what you need to know about Remitix. Institutional Demand is Likely to Drive Ethereum Price Higher Major corporate entities are increasing their ETH holdings, fueling the chances of an imminent breakout. BitMine Immersion, for example, has raked in about $2.9‚ÄØbillion worth of Ethereum ( i.e., over 833,000 tokens ), making it the largest public Ethereum treasury holder as of today. Besides, Ethereum ETFs saw continuous inflows, including a 17-day streak of net inflows, with $65.14‚ÄØmillion added in a single day, and BlackRock‚Äôs ETHA pushing $131.95‚ÄØmillion in late July. It‚Äôs safe to say that despite the recent Ethereum price slip, institutional appetite is still on. Source: X Over the past 30 days, Ethereum price rallied over 44.5% to approximately $3,600, with analysts now targeting a breakout above $4,100, especially if there is continued institutional activity and ETF interest. Cardano (ADA): A Golden Cross, But Challenges Ahead Cardano followed a similar price trajectory to Ethereum price in the past week, bleeding for 5 successive days, before a 9.31% jump in the next 48 hours. As of today, Cardano buys and sells at $0.7521, with 24‚Äëhour volume around $760‚ÄØmillion, up 4.5% on the day but down 6.8% week to date. A few analysts are looking at a bearish outlook for ADA, with a Fear & Greed Index at 54 (Greed). Cardano recently formed its first-ever weekly golden cross, where the 50-week moving average crossed above the 200-week average; a bullish argument others are citing. However, ADA must reclaim levels above $0.8‚Äì$0.86 to maintain momentum; else, a slip below $0.69 could be next.

A draft of the order, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, reveals that financial institutions could face stiff penalties for denying services based on political affiliations or ties to the crypto industry. The directive would require federal regulators to investigate potential violations of key laws, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, antitrust regulations, and consumer protection statutes. Banks in breach could be subject to fines, lawsuits, or compelled to enter legally binding agreements to reform their practices. While the order could be signed early this week, sources say the timeline remains fluid amid internal administration deliberations. If finalized, the move would signal a significant step by the Trump-aligned administration to safeguard banking access for groups it believes are being unjustly excluded‚Äîparticularly conservatives and crypto-related entities. Banks face pressure from crypto and conservative groups For years, many conservative organizations and cryptocurrency-related companies have claimed that banks have closed their accounts or denied them financial services for political or ideological reasons. Some groups say they were flagged or dropped simply for holding conservative beliefs. Others in the crypto industry claim banks cut them off to avoid regulatory pressure, even if no laws were broken. One high-profile case, which is indirectly referenced in the draft order, involved Bank of America. The bank reportedly shut down accounts from a Christian group operating in Uganda. The organization accused the bank of targeting them for religious reasons. However, Bank of America responded that the decision was based on policy, not politics. The bank said it does not serve small businesses operating outside the U.S. as a matter of standard practice. The draft order also criticizes banks for their role in sharing customer data with law enforcement during the January 6 Capitol riot investigation. Some banks voluntarily flagged customer transactions or activity they believed were linked to the event. Supporters of the executive order say this sets a dangerous precedent where banks may act as political gatekeepers. Meanwhile, crypto companies have faced a long struggle to access banking services. Under the Biden administration , several firms have complained of being shut out from traditional banking due to what they call a ‚Äúshadow ban‚Äù by regulators. Banks, on the other hand, argue that they are responding to legitimate compliance risks, especially when dealing with digital assets, which have been linked to fraud and money laundering. Many cite U.S. anti-money-laundering laws and a lack of clear guidance as reasons for caution. Banks act to avoid regulatory crackdown Over the past few months, several major financial institutions have updated their internal policies to clarify that they do not discriminate based on political belief or affiliation. Others have held meetings with Republican attorneys general to reassure them of their commitment to fairness. A spokesperson for Bank of America said the institution welcomes efforts by the administration to bring greater clarity to the rules. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve provided detailed proposals and will continue to work with the administration and Congress to improve the regulatory framework,‚Äù he said. The draft executive order also includes new instructions for federal agencies. It calls on banking regulators to eliminate existing policies that may have encouraged banks to consider ‚Äúreputational risk‚Äù when deciding whether to work with certain customers. Banks often use reputational risk to avoid business with politically sensitive or high-risk industries. This practice has been controversial. Critics argue it gives banks too much power to act as moral or political judges. Regulators under the Trump administration had previously said they would avoid using reputational risk as a standard. In addition, the draft order tells the Small Business Administration (SBA) to review how participating banks treat loan applicants‚Äîespecially when those banks guarantee SBA-backed loans. This could affect thousands of small businesses that rely on federal support.

Banking regulators under Trump have already stopped assessing ‚Äúreputational risk‚Äù from customers, which was seen as a boost for the crypto industry. The move represents a significant shift from Biden-era banking oversight under Operation Chokepoint 2.0, with the Trump administration positioning itself as the protector of crypto interests against alleged financial industry bias. There have been several cases in recent years where crypto industry experts or companies have been debanked, and the Trump administration clearly wants to put an end to this practice. JPMorgan Chase informed Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in December 2023 that they would close accounts of individuals whose primary income stemmed from crypto. Sam Kazemian, founder of Frax Finance, also said that JPMorgan told him they would close the accounts of anyone whose primary source of income or wealth was crypto. Custodia Bank CEO Caitlin Long, Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss, and the Bitcoin Foundation‚Äôs Charlie Shrem also said they were debanked. In November 2024, Elon Musk posted evidence that 30 tech founders were debanked under the Biden administration.

Crypto is the complete antithesis of this, enabling peer-to-peer transfers and freedom over finances.

According to Tae-yoon, BTC has reentered the classic ‚ÄúTriple Power‚Äù market structure, and as this structure nears its distribution phase, a break above $120,000 could trigger rapid upward momentum. Last weekend, Bitcoin's price fell to $112,000, a decline that some analysts believe could have triggered a ‚Äúposition reset‚Äù and paved the way for a rally. Tae-yoon argues that this correction could actually pave the way for a new upward move. The ‚ÄúPower of 3‚Äù model describes a three-stage market structure: ‚Äúaccumulation ‚Äì manipulation ‚Äì distribution.‚Äù This structure is particularly used to analyze the liquidity movements of institutional investors and is often preferred to understand the delayed reactions of individual investors. Related News: Donald Trump to Make Two Critical Appointments in the Next Few Days - Could Affect Markets, Here Are the Details According to the analysis, Bitcoin established a solid base in the $115,300-$119,500 range during the accumulation phase. The subsequent sudden drop dragged the price down to $112,000. This movement is generally interpreted as the liquidation of individual investors who bought at the peak and the creation of a new accumulation base in the market. One of the most striking points in Tae-yoon's analysis is that the $120,000 level acts as a ‚Äúpowerful price magnet.‚Äù If the price reaches and sustains above $115,300 and $116,800, Bitcoin could break through the $120,000 resistance and rapidly rally to the technical target of $126,000. It's estimated that $922 million worth of leveraged positions were liquidated during the recent correction. Position resets of this scale typically reduce market overheating and pave the way for a new rally. *This is not investment advice.

Osborne criticized Chancellor Rachel Reeves and supported Coinbase‚Äôs controversial ad campaign, which mocked the UK‚Äôs economic stagnation and pointed to crypto as an alternative. Meanwhile, the GENIUS Act itself is under scrutiny in the US for banning yield-bearing stablecoins. Critics say this favors traditional banks and undermines stablecoin innovation. Other experts argue that tokenized money market funds may benefit, but stablecoins still hold an edge in DeFi. UK Missing Crypto Opportunity George Osborne, the former UK chancellor and now adviser to Coinbase, issued a stark warning that the United Kingdom is falling behind in the digital asset race, particularly in the stablecoin sector. In a recent Financial Times op-ed , Osborne voiced his concerns over the UK‚Äôs sluggish progress in adopting crypto-friendly policies, and argued that the country is at risk of squandering its position as a global financial leader. George Osborne He criticized the government‚Äôs inaction, especially with regards to stablecoins, which he sees as essential tools for reducing friction in global finance. Osborne stated that while the US is forging ahead with initiatives like the GENIUS Act to cement the dollar‚Äôs dominance in the stablecoin space, the UK risks irrelevance. He warned that the British pound ‚Äî one of the world‚Äôs most traded currencies ‚Äî may not even play a supporting role in the digital economy if current trends continue. Osborne‚Äôs critique was aimed in part at current Chancellor Rachel Reeves, whom he accused of failing to deliver on promises to support innovation in the digital currency sector. His comments were made after a controversial ad campaign by Coinbase titled ‚ÄúEverything Is Fine,‚Äù a satirical musical piece that mocks the UK‚Äôs economic stagnation and cost-of-living crisis. According to Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, the ad was banned by UK television networks. It suggests that the traditional financial system is broken and points to crypto as a modern alternative. While the ad‚Äôs ban could not be independently verified by CNBC, it has nevertheless led to some debate and drew attention to Coinbase‚Äôs growing lobbying efforts in the UK. Coinbase entered the UK market in 2015, and has been an aggressive force in shaping crypto regulation. This is particularly true in the US where it spent more on lobbying than any other crypto firm, according to Politico and OpenSecrets. Osborne‚Äôs op-ed and the company's latest campaign indicate that there is now a renewed push to influence policy in Britain. Critics Question GENIUS Act Motives While the US is making more progress with its GENIUS Act, it might not necessarily be in the right direction. The passage of the US GENIUS Act has been widely hailed as a major milestone for stablecoin adoption, but a controversial provision in the bill is drawing a lot of criticism for potentially limiting the appeal of digital dollars. The legislation bans stablecoin issuers from offering yield-bearing versions of their tokens. This move effectively prevents both retail and institutional holders from earning interest on digital dollar holdings. Critics argue that this plays into the hands of the traditional banking sector, which has long relied on controlling yield opportunities for depositors. Trump signs GENIUS Act (Source: Fox News ) Temujin Louie , CEO of crosschain protocol Wanchain, warned that the GENIUS Act may not be the unqualified win it seems to be. He pointed out that by prohibiting yield, the bill gives a competitive edge to tokenized money market funds, which are very quickly turning into Wall Street‚Äôs answer to stablecoins. JPMorgan strategist Teresa Ho explained the potential of tokenized MMFs to serve as margin collateral and fulfill other use cases that were traditionally served by stablecoins. Louie agrees with this, and said that tokenization grants MMFs the speed and flexibility previously unique to stablecoins, while also preserving regulatory oversight. Paul Brody , global blockchain leader at EY, pointed out that tokenized MMFs and deposits could thrive in this new environment, since they can provide yield while functioning similarly to stablecoins. However, Brody added that stablecoins still maintain an edge in DeFi integration, thanks to their bearer asset nature, which allows easy use across decentralized platforms. If tokenized MMFs come with too many restrictions, their yield advantage might not be enough to win over users. The banking industry‚Äôs influence over the legislation has been a strong point of concern for many. Reports from earlier this year revealed that financial institutions were actively lobbying to block yield-bearing stablecoins, as they see them as a threat to their business model. NYU professor Austin Campbell shared that banks, having offered minimal interest for decades, fear losing ground if stablecoin issuers can provide yield directly to consumers. Despite the restrictions in the GENIUS Act, yield-bearing digital assets are not entirely absent from the US market. In February, the SEC approved the first yield-bearing stablecoin security, YLDS, issued by Figure Markets. It launched with a 3.85% yield. This means that there is a lot of potential for yield in tokenized assets, albeit under stricter securities regulations.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-05 05:30:00

Crypto users are currently buzzing about a significant announcement from Binance regarding USDC withdrawals . The world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange, Binance, recently informed its users about a temporary suspension of USDC withdrawals on several popular blockchain networks. This move is a direct result of scheduled wallet maintenance, a routine but crucial part of ensuring the platform‚Äôs stability and security. Why Are USDC Withdrawals Temporarily Paused on Binance? Binance announced on its official website that it will temporarily suspend USDC withdrawals across five prominent networks. These include Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (POL), Arbitrum (ARB), Base (BASE), and Optimism (OP). The suspension is set to begin at 07:00 UTC on August 6. The primary reason for this temporary halt is scheduled wallet maintenance. Think of it like essential roadwork ‚Äì inconvenient for a short period, but vital for long-term smooth operation. Ethereum (ETH): A foundational blockchain, widely used for DeFi and NFTs. Polygon (POL): A popular Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, known for lower fees. Arbitrum (ARB): Another leading Layer-2 solution, enhancing Ethereum‚Äôs scalability. Base (BASE): Coinbase‚Äôs new Ethereum Layer-2, gaining traction. Optimism (OP): A robust Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, focusing on speed and cost-efficiency. This proactive step by Binance highlights its commitment to maintaining a secure and efficient trading environment. Such planned maintenance activities are standard practice within the industry to upgrade systems, enhance security protocols, and improve overall service reliability. While a temporary inconvenience, it ultimately benefits users by ensuring the integrity of their assets. Understanding the Impact of Binance USDC Suspension A temporary Binance USDC suspension might raise questions for users, but it is important to understand its nature. This is not a halt to all USDC transactions on Binance, but specifically withdrawals on the listed networks. Users can still trade USDC on the exchange and potentially withdraw via other available networks if supported. However, for those relying on these specific chains for their USDC movements, planning is key. The impact is largely limited to the withdrawal function for a specific stablecoin on particular networks. It is a brief pause, not a permanent change. Binance aims to complete this wallet maintenance efficiently, restoring full withdrawal capabilities as soon as possible. Keeping an eye on Binance‚Äôs official announcements will provide the most accurate updates regarding the resumption of services. This event serves as a reminder for all crypto users about the importance of diversification in their asset management strategies. Relying on a single network or exchange for all operations can sometimes lead to temporary disruptions. Always consider having multiple avenues for managing your digital assets. Navigating Stablecoin Withdrawal Issues: What Users Should Know When facing stablecoin withdrawal issues , staying calm and informed is crucial. First, always check the official announcements from the crypto exchange. Binance, for instance, communicates such updates clearly on its website and social media channels. During periods of wallet maintenance Binance undertakes, it‚Äôs best to avoid initiating withdrawals on the affected networks to prevent potential delays or complications. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Updated: Regularly check Binance‚Äôs official announcements page or their social media for real-time updates on the maintenance status.

That future is rapidly approaching in South Korea, thanks to a groundbreaking initiative by Danal. This prominent South Korean payments firm, known for its cryptocurrency Paycoin (PCI), is set to revolutionize how foreigners spend money in the country by introducing stablecoin pre-paid cards . This innovative step marks a significant leap forward in making digital assets truly usable in daily life, addressing a critical need for seamless international transactions. What Makes These Stablecoin Pre-Paid Cards a Game Changer? Danal‚Äôs ambitious plan involves integrating stablecoins directly into pre-paid cards specifically designed for foreign visitors and residents in South Korea. Set to launch in the third quarter of this year, this initiative is monumental. It will be the very first time a Korean company enables direct stablecoin payments through a card product. This pioneering move addresses a crucial need, considering that foreign visitors spent an astonishing 56 trillion won ($40.3 billion) using pre-paid cards in South Korea during 2023 alone, according to the Migration Research and Training Centre (MRTC). The introduction of these cards means foreigners can potentially bypass complex currency exchange processes, which often involve unfavorable rates and additional fees. Instead, they can convert their stablecoins into local currency on the card, making transactions seamless and more cost-effective. This innovation simplifies spending and significantly enhances convenience for a large and economically vital demographic. How Will Danal Stablecoin Cards Operate for Users? While specific technical details are still emerging, the core concept revolves around leveraging stablecoins for everyday transactions. Danal has already laid some strategic groundwork, including recent trademark filings related to stablecoins, which clearly indicate their long-term commitment to this transformative technology. The integration will likely involve a user-friendly application or platform where individuals can load their stablecoins onto the card. At the point of sale, the system would then convert the stablecoin holdings into the required fiat currency (Korean Won), allowing users to spend as they would with any traditional pre-paid card. For existing users of Paycoin, Danal‚Äôs own cryptocurrency, this development could also mean enhanced utility and a more direct pathway to spending their digital assets. The firm‚Äôs deep roots in the crypto space suggest a smooth and intuitive transition for those already familiar with digital assets. These crypto payment cards are designed to bridge the gap between the volatile digital asset world and the stability of traditional commerce, offering a practical, real-world solution for millions. Boosting Accessibility with Korean Stablecoin Payments The implications of Danal‚Äôs initiative extend far beyond mere transactional convenience. By offering accessible Korean stablecoin payments via widely accepted pre-paid cards, Danal is actively promoting the mainstream adoption of digital currencies. This strategic move can significantly lower the barrier to entry for individuals who might be hesitant to use cryptocurrencies directly due to perceived complexity or volatility, but who are perfectly comfortable with familiar card-based transactions. Furthermore, this development showcases South Korea‚Äôs progressive stance on financial innovation and its willingness to embrace cutting-edge technologies. This pioneering effort could inspire other companies globally to explore similar solutions, fostering a more interconnected and digitally-enabled global economy. The potential for broader Paycoin integration into various payment ecosystems also grows significantly, solidifying its position as a practical digital currency. Navigating the Future: Benefits and Considerations The introduction of these cards brings numerous advantages: Seamless Transactions: Foreigners can avoid high foreign exchange fees and the hassle of physical currency conversion, making their visits more enjoyable and economical. Increased Accessibility: Stablecoins become genuinely practical for everyday spending, moving beyond speculative investment. Enhanced Security and Transparency: Leveraging blockchain technology for underlying transactions can offer improved security and auditability. Broader Adoption: This initiative encourages wider acceptance and understanding of digital assets among the general public and merchants. Economic Boost: By simplifying spending for foreigners, it could further stimulate the tourism and retail sectors. However, like any innovative leap, there are considerations: Regulatory Clarity: Navigating evolving cryptocurrency regulations in South Korea and internationally will be crucial for long-term success. User Education: Ensuring users fully understand how to manage their stablecoin holdings and card usage, including any potential fees or limits, is vital. Merchant Acceptance: While the cards function like regular pre-paid cards, ensuring widespread merchant understanding and acceptance is key. Danal‚Äôs venture into stablecoin pre-paid cards is a bold and strategic step, positioning them at the forefront of crypto innovation in the global payment sector. It highlights a future where digital assets are seamlessly integrated into our financial routines. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Payments Begins Danal‚Äôs launch of Korea‚Äôs first stablecoin pre-paid cards represents a pivotal moment for digital payments worldwide. This groundbreaking initiative not only simplifies financial transactions for foreigners in South Korea but also sets a powerful precedent for how stablecoins can integrate into mainstream commerce globally. By effectively bridging the gap between digital currencies and traditional spending habits, Danal is paving the way for a more accessible, efficient, and technologically advanced financial future. This development profoundly underscores the growing utility and practical applications of stablecoins, further highlighting South Korea‚Äôs significant role as a leader in fintech innovation and the practical adoption of blockchain technology. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What are stablecoin pre-paid cards? A: Stablecoin pre-paid cards are payment cards that allow users to spend stablecoins (cryptocurrencies pegged to a stable asset like the US dollar) for everyday purchases. The cards convert the stablecoin into local fiat currency at the point of sale. Q2: Who is Danal and what is Paycoin? A: Danal is a major South Korean payments firm. Paycoin (PCI) is its native cryptocurrency, designed to facilitate mobile payments and provide various financial services. Q3: When will these stablecoin cards be available in South Korea?

Meme coins have graduated from joke status to serious financial contenders. Investors across the globe are now seeing these viral tokens turn modest entries into portfolio-transforming moves. This wave isn‚Äôt slowing ‚Äì it‚Äôs gaining speed, traction, and attention. Among this evolving pack, one name stands tall with a strategic edge. The MoonBull Whitelist is now live, offering early access to those watching closely. This rare chance opens the gates to what could be one of the best cryptos to watch in 2025, alongside an exciting new generation of meme-driven assets including Fartcoin, Degen, ANDY, Osaka Protocol, Test, and Coq Inu. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU): The Strategic Entry Point Investors Crave The MoonBull Whitelist is now open, sparking a wave of urgency among smart crypto enthusiasts. This Ethereum-based meme coin has engineered a limited early-access model that positions its supporters for maximum leverage. With only a finite number of whitelist slots, timing becomes the ultimate edge. Whitelist members unlock privileged access before the presale opens to the public. They receive the lowest possible token entry price, secret staking reward opportunities, exclusive token drops, and roadmap hints unavailable to outsiders. Each benefit is tailored to empower early supporters before the crypto world catches on. When Early Access Pays Off: A Look at Prior Whitelist Victories Human behavior is wired to seek exclusivity. Scarcity fuels action, especially when rewards are hidden behind a countdown. The MoonBull Whitelist taps into this psychology masterfully. The desire to be first, the stress of missing out, and the rush of privilege create an emotional loop that compels immediate action. In 2021, early participants in Shiba Inu‚Äôs public trading phase saw unprecedented gains, with some wallets witnessing over 100,000% increases according to blockchain analytics from Etherscan and CoinGecko historical data. Likewise, Floki Inu‚Äôs early backers gained significant value during its viral expansion phase, with multiple wallet addresses multiplying their holdings in weeks, as tracked by BscScan and major price aggregators. The history of early access yielding oversized returns is well-documented ‚Äì and MoonBull‚Äôs current whitelist strategy positions it to potentially follow a similar trajectory. This strategic architecture, paired with Ethereum‚Äôs rock-solid DeFi base, places MoonBull among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 2. Fartcoin ($FARTCOIN): A Token That Breaks the Rules Fartcoin began as a laugh, but today it‚Äôs commanding serious attention. Built around shock value and unapologetic meme energy, this coin is dominating online traffic across Reddit, Telegram, and TikTok. Its strong community and viral spread give it the kind of grassroots fuel that meme coins thrive on. The tokenomics offer an aggressive burn model and redistribution incentives that reward long-term holders. With each transaction, a portion is burned, creating scarcity, while holders receive small rewards, encouraging retention. That duality ‚Äì deflation and passive income ‚Äì is what draws savvy investors. More than just a meme, Fartcoin is expanding its use cases in gaming and tipping platforms, adding long-term potential to its marketability. Its unconventional branding makes it stand out, but its strong fundamentals place it confidently among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 3. Degen ($DEGEN): The Community-First Coin With Powerhouse Energy Degen is not just a coin ‚Äì it‚Äôs an identity. Crafted for high-risk traders and internet-native investors, $DEGEN celebrates the chaotic charm of crypto culture. Its launch was one of the most talked-about entries of Q2, with over 100,000 holders in its first 48 hours. The project‚Äôs roadmap includes community voting tools, staking pools, and exclusive NFT collaborations. A DAO-based structure ensures that major decisions lie in the hands of its most loyal users. The inclusivity model adds legitimacy, pulling more people into the fold. Degen‚Äôs marketing strategy focuses heavily on virality, gamification, and influencer partnerships, fueling further momentum. The coin‚Äôs ability to convert raw culture into real value has made it a front-runner among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 4. ANDY ($ANDY): The Cultural Meme That‚Äôs Winning Big Support $ANDY has gained significant traction as the meme coin that blends culture, nostalgia, and social media flair. Inspired by quirky internet characters and powered by a community of content creators, its engagement rates outpace many mid-cap tokens. The token is deflationary with a capped supply, and its roadmap includes creator-centric initiatives like exclusive merchandise and fan-driven project expansions. With mainstream appeal and the ability to draw in both crypto natives and pop culture fans, ANDY has carved out a lane of its own. The coin‚Äôs fast-rising market cap, driven largely by online influencers and YouTube communities, hints at untapped potential. This digital blend of personality and performance ensures ANDY‚Äôs place among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 5. Osaka Protocol ($OSAK): The Underdog Protocol With Big-Budget Vision Osaka Protocol enters the meme space with technical depth and a long-term playbook. Built on a hybrid Ethereum layer-2 model, $OSAK focuses on combining meme momentum with security and scalability. The protocol introduces smart contract features tailored for meme coin ecosystems, including a secure staking model and on-chain voting. It plans integrations with major DeFi platforms and DEXs to extend token utility. Its whitepaper reveals serious intent ‚Äì a rarity in the meme space. Backed by an anonymous but verified dev team and multiple audits, Osaka has found favor with those who value both credibility and virality. These strategic advantages solidify its inclusion as one of the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 6. Test ($TST): This Coin Challenges Definitions Test started as a joke ‚Äì a coin literally called Test ‚Äì but its simplicity and irony sparked curiosity. That curiosity snowballed into one of the fastest-growing Telegram groups in the meme coin space. The $TST token is used in experimental NFT drops and community challenges that reward both participation and loyalty. Its gamified structure and unpredictable campaigns keep users engaged daily. With a flexible framework and a knack for surprise, Test proves that the unexpected often outperforms the over-engineered. Its rapid growth and social experimentation make Test a wild card among the best cryptos to watch in 2025. 7. Coq Inu ($COQ): High Engagement Meets High Volume Coq Inu blends meme aesthetics with tokenomics designed for volume. With over 150,000 holders and rising liquidity, $COQ is proving that meme coins can hold weight over time. It runs on a reflection-based system, where holders receive passive income in $COQ tokens from every transaction. Paired with marketing campaigns that include Twitter raids and celebrity shoutouts, the momentum is undeniable. The roadmap teases future metaverse integrations and limited-time burns, increasing scarcity while maintaining virality. Coq Inu‚Äôs ability to keep up with evolving market trends locks its status as one of the best cryptos to watch in 2025. Conclusion: What This All Means for 2025 Based on the latest research, the best cryptos to watch in 2025 include MoonBull, Fartcoin, Degen, ANDY, Osaka Protocol, Test, and Coq Inu. Each of these projects represents a different angle of meme coin dominance, from community-first to deflationary supply models and creator-centric ecosystems. MoonBull stands apart with its exclusive whitelist mechanics, early supporter rewards, and Ethereum foundation. While others bring volume, culture, and innovation, Moon Bull fuses all three with high-stakes entry mechanics designed to favor the early movers. As countries begin stacking Bitcoin reserves and retail adoption accelerates, meme coins with utility and branding strength may become the next wave of mass-adopted digital assets.

Additionally, he falsified the lockup period, only to discover that neither the investment nor interest could be returned to investors. ‚ÄúAlthough Mr. Shin was unable to reach an agreement with the victims, he admitted his wrongdoing and is reflecting on it,‚Äù said Judge Seong Gi-jun. ‚ÄúThe sentencing conditions, including the motive and circumstances of the crime, were taken into consideration when determining the sentence.‚Äù Here‚Äôs How Bitsonic Chiefs Landed in ‚ÄúLenient‚Äù Sentences In February 2024, Shin and Bitsonic‚Äôs chief technology officer, surnamed Bae, were sentenced to a combined 8 years in prison for manipulating crypto prices and hugely profiting from them. Per a Seoul District Court, Shin had ‚Äúreached an agreement with two of the victims who suffered the largest amount of damages,‚Äù at the time. Further, neither CEO Shin nor Bae had a history of committing similar types of crime, the Judge noted. This led the Judge to sentence both Bitsonic chiefs to a ‚Äúlenient‚Äù sentence. Besides, under South Korean law, defendants can appeal guilty verdicts and sentences at the High Court and the Supreme Court.

The company purchased an impressive $2.46 billion worth of Bitcoin over the past week, marking its third-largest purchase by dollar amount since it began acquiring the digital asset five years ago. Bitcoin Acquisition At Record Prices Between July 28 and August 3, Strategy added 21,021 Bitcoin to its holdings, bringing its total to 628,791 tokens. At current market prices, the firm‚Äôs portfolio is valued at over $71 billion. Saylor has adeptly transformed his company from a traditional software provider into the leading corporate buyer of Bitcoin, utilizing innovative financial strategies to fuel these purchases. Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‚ÄòNothing To Do Until October‚Äô The latest acquisition was made at an average price of $117,526 per token, which is the second-highest price the company has ever paid, just shy of the $118,940 average from the previous month. Strategy is the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, according to data from BitcoinTreasuries.net. BTC mining company MARA Holdings is second with 50,000 coins, which highlights Saylor‚Äôs firm‚Äôs purchasing power. Notably, this position has not only solidified Saylor‚Äôs influence in the crypto space but has also inspired other public companies to adopt similar treasury strategies aimed at accumulating and holding digital currencies. These include Trump‚Äôs social media company, boosted by a new regulatory regime and legislation in the US aimed at positioning the country as the crypto capital of the world, a mission that President Donald Trump has advocated since his election campaign last year. Saylor‚Äôs Strategy Pledges To Protect Shareholder Value To fund these massive purchases, Bitcoin bull Michael Saylor has employed a mix of common and preferred share sales alongside debt instruments. Recently, the company launched its latest preferred stock offering, dubbed ‚ÄúStretch,‚Äù in late July. In its second-quarter report, Strategy announced an unrealized gain of $14 billion, primarily driven by the recent rebound in Bitcoin prices and a new accounting requirement that necessitated the revaluation of its Bitcoin holdings. Saylor has also made a commitment to investors, stating that he will refrain from issuing new common shares at less than 2.5 times the company‚Äôs net asset value, except for covering debt interest or preferred dividends. Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level This pledge comes in light of concerns raised by critics like Jim Chanos, who have expressed apprehension about the premium that Strategy‚Äôs Bitcoin holdings place on its share price and the numerous securities offerings the company has executed. Since its initial foray into Bitcoin, Strategy‚Äôs stock, MSTR, has skyrocketed over 3,000%, significantly outperforming Bitcoin itself and major stock indices such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. The company‚Äôs largest purchases occurred in November, totaling $5.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, demonstrating Saylor‚Äôs aggressive strategy in the cryptocurrency market. However, on Monday, the firm did not disclose any further purchases, as it has commonly done over the past few months. Perhaps it is starting to reassess its direction with biweekly acquisitions. It remains to be seen what the firm‚Äôs next moves will be, as there have been no further official comments on the matter.

This Week‚Äôs Performance May Hold The Answer,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-discovery-rally-over-this-week-may-hold-answer/,"After falling below a crucial support level, Bitcoin (BTC) is attempting to recover some of its lost ground. An analyst suggested that this week‚Äôs performance will be decisive for the cryptocurrency‚Äôs next trend. Related Reading: Pundit Says Ethereum Price Is Headed For $9,000 After This Broadening Wedge Retest Bitcoin Loses Bull Flag Formation Over the weekend, Bitcoin lost its post-breakout range for the first time in three weeks, falling to a local low of $112,296 on August 3. The flagship crypto had been trading between the $114,000-$120,000 range since the early July breakout, hitting its all-time high (ATH) of $122,838 amid the rally. As July neared its end, BTC experienced some volatility, retesting the range lows twice over its last week. However, the cryptocurrency was unable to repeat its price recovery from the previous weekend, losing the crucial area on August 1. Rekt Capital noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs rally could be at risk, explaining that BTC has formed a bull flag in the weekly chart and held the pattern‚Äôs lows as support until the latest Weekly Close. Following its recent price action, the analyst considers that this week‚Äôs performance will be pivotal to see whether the pattern‚Äôs bottom, around the $117,200 area, will become a new resistance and confirm the breakdown, or if the flagship crypto‚Äôs price will recover the structure. According to the analysis, if the price can reclaim the structure, the correction would be considered a fake downside deviation before resynchronizing with the pattern. Meanwhile, turning the pattern‚Äôs bottom into resistance would be a bearish retest, confirming the breakdown, and potentially leading to a new retest of the $112,000 area as support. BTC‚Äôs Weekly Close To Determine Next Trend Rekt Capital also detailed that this week‚Äôs performance will determine the future of BTC‚Äôs second Price Discovery uptrend, which has technically started its fifth week. Depending on what happens to the Bull Flag (reclaim or a confirmation of the breakdown), we will know whether the Price Discovery Uptrend 2 will continue or whether BTC has experienced a very short PDU2 instead. Last week, the analyst retesting that the continuation of the Price Discovery trend could fail as BTC transitioned into weeks 5-7 of this phase. Historically, the second uptrend has started to slow down around Weeks 5-6, hitting its peak during this ‚ÄúDanger Zone.‚Äù If Bitcoin reclaims the Bull Flag and challenges new highs, then its second Price Discovery uptrend will progress according to its historical tendencies. However, if it fails to Weekly Close above the pattern‚Äôs bottom and confirms additional downside, the second Price Discovery uptrend would have ended in Week 2, much quicker than has historically been the case. Moreover, it would reveal that BTC has been in its second Price Discovery Correction, which ‚Äúwould be going completely against the grain of history.‚Äù Related Reading: Analyst Warns XRP Investors Not To Let Fear Dictate Moves As Long As Price Holds This Level The analyst suggested that macro-wise, Bitcoin still has plenty of time for a third Price Discovery uptrend. If the second phase has already ended, a final uptrend could overcompensate for the current uptrend‚Äôs underperformance. Previously, Rekt Capital asserted that what comes after the second uptrend would depend on how long the corrective phase takes, as a shot correction could allow for a third uptrend before the bear market.

One of the most telling indicators of market sentiment, especially for Bitcoin, comes from analyzing BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios. These ratios offer a unique glimpse into how traders are positioning themselves, whether they anticipate price increases (longs) or decreases (shorts). What Do BTC Perpetual Futures Long-Short Ratios Reveal? For those engaged in crypto trading , knowing the collective leanings of the market can provide a significant edge. The long-short ratio essentially compares the number of long positions to short positions on perpetual futures contracts. A ratio above 1 indicates more long positions, suggesting bullish sentiment, while a ratio below 1 points to more short positions, indicating bearish sentiment. Over the past 24 hours, the aggregated long-short ratio for BTC perpetual futures across various exchanges shows a slight lean towards short positions. The total ratio stands at: Total: Long 49.47%, Short 50.53% This suggests that, overall, a marginally larger percentage of traders are betting on a downward price movement for Bitcoin in the immediate future. Analyzing Current Market Sentiment: Why It Matters for Crypto Trading Gauging market sentiment is not just an academic exercise; it has practical implications for your trading strategy. When the market is predominantly short, it might signal potential capitulation or, conversely, an opportunity for a short squeeze if prices unexpectedly reverse. Conversely, a heavily long market could be ripe for a correction. It is important to remember that these ratios represent aggregated positions and do not necessarily predict future price movements with certainty. However, they do reflect the current psychological state of the market participants, which can often influence short-term trends. Monitoring these shifts helps traders adapt their strategies. Diving Deeper into Bitcoin Derivatives: Exchange-Specific Insights While the overall picture gives us a broad understanding, examining individual exchanges provides a more granular view of Bitcoin derivatives activity. Different exchanges attract different types of traders, and their specific ratios can sometimes reveal localized trends or the influence of larger players on a particular platform. Here are the 24-hour long-short ratios for three prominent exchanges: Binance: Long 48.78%, Short 51.22% Bybit: Long 47.03%, Short 52.97% Gate.io: Long 49.20%, Short 50.80% Notice that Bybit shows the strongest short bias among the top three, indicating a more bearish outlook from its user base compared to Binance or Gate.io. This variance highlights the diverse trading behaviors across platforms, which is crucial for comprehensive market analysis. Actionable Insights from Futures Contracts Data What can you do with this information about futures contracts ? Firstly, use it as a complementary tool, not a standalone indicator. Combine long-short ratios with technical analysis, on-chain data, and macroeconomic factors for a more robust trading plan. Secondly, be aware of extremes. Historically, extreme long or short biases have sometimes preceded market reversals. If everyone is on one side of the trade, the potential for a swift move in the opposite direction increases. For instance, a sudden shift from a heavily short-biased market to a more balanced or even long-biased one could signal a change in momentum. Conversely, if short positions continue to dominate, it might confirm a prevailing bearish trend, prompting caution for those considering long entries. Navigating the Dynamics of BTC Perpetual Futures The world of BTC perpetual futures is dynamic and constantly evolving. Staying informed about these crucial metrics helps you navigate its complexities. Understanding who is long and who is short provides a valuable lens through which to view potential price action and market sentiment shifts. Always conduct your own research and consider multiple data points before making any trading decisions. By regularly reviewing long-short ratios, you empower yourself with a deeper understanding of the collective market psychology, enabling more informed and potentially more profitable crypto trading strategies. This data is a powerful tool for anticipating market shifts and managing risk effectively. In conclusion, the 24-hour long-short ratios for BTC perpetual futures offer a vital snapshot of current market sentiment. While the slight short bias across major exchanges indicates a cautious outlook, understanding these dynamics on an exchange-specific level provides deeper insights. Utilize this data as part of a comprehensive analysis to enhance your decision-making in the volatile crypto markets. Staying informed about these metrics is key to successful trading. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a long-short ratio in crypto trading? The long-short ratio compares the total number of open long positions (bets on price increase) to open short positions (bets on price decrease) for a specific cryptocurrency on derivatives exchanges. It indicates prevailing market sentiment. Why are BTC perpetual futures important for market analysis? BTC perpetual futures are widely traded derivatives that allow traders to speculate on Bitcoin‚Äôs price without owning the underlying asset. Their long-short ratios provide a real-time gauge of bullish or bearish sentiment among a large segment of crypto traders. How do different exchanges‚Äô long-short ratios vary? Long-short ratios can vary significantly between exchanges due to differences in user bases, liquidity, and regional trading preferences. Analyzing these individual exchange ratios can reveal specific trading behaviors and localized sentiment trends. Can long-short ratios predict future Bitcoin price movements? While long-short ratios are strong indicators of current market sentiment, they are not direct predictors of future price movements. They are best used as a complementary tool alongside technical analysis, on-chain data, and other fundamental factors to form a comprehensive trading strategy. What does a higher short percentage mean for BTC perpetual futures? A higher short percentage, as seen in the recent data, indicates that a larger proportion of traders are betting on Bitcoin‚Äôs price to fall. This suggests a bearish sentiment in the short term, though extreme biases can sometimes precede reversals. Found this analysis of BTC perpetual futures long-short ratios insightful?

The European Union will suspend two planned tariff countermeasure packages for six months after reaching an agreement with U.S. President Donald Trump, an EU Commission spokesperson confirmed Monday.

Animoca Brands, a leading force in blockchain entertainment, recently announced significant backing for its pioneering Tower Ecosystem . This strategic move, confirmed by Chairman Yat Siu, signals a robust commitment to the future of decentralized gaming and a clear vote of confidence in its long-term potential. Why is Animoca Brands Offering Strong Animoca Brands Support ? Animoca Brands‚Äô commitment to the Tower Ecosystem isn‚Äôt just a casual endorsement; it‚Äôs a profound statement about the future of Web3 gaming. Chairman Yat Siu‚Äôs announcement on X highlighted the company‚Äôs initiation of public backing, starting with strategic TOWER token buybacks . This action underscores a deep belief in building sustainable, on-chain economies. The Tower Ecosystem stands out as one of Animoca‚Äôs earliest and most community-centric Web3 gaming initiatives .

Understanding the Impact of TOWER Token Buybacks The decision to conduct TOWER token buybacks serves multiple purposes. Firstly, it injects direct capital and confidence into the Tower Ecosystem , demonstrating a tangible commitment from Animoca Brands. Buybacks typically reduce the circulating supply of a token, which can positively influence its value by creating scarcity and increasing demand. Indeed, the market has already reacted positively. Following the announcement, the TOWER token saw a remarkable surge.

This immediate price action highlights investor and community confidence in Animoca‚Äôs strategic backing and the intrinsic value of the TOWER token within the ecosystem. For current and prospective holders, these buybacks mean: Potential Price Stability: Reduced supply can help stabilize or increase the token‚Äôs price over time. Enhanced Utility: A stronger token value can lead to more robust in-game economies and increased utility for the TOWER token across various games within the ecosystem. Long-Term Vision: It signifies a long-term commitment from Animoca Brands to nurture and grow the Tower Ecosystem .

They envision a future where players truly own their in-game assets, have a voice in governance, and participate in the economic success of the games they love.

Yat Siu emphasized that Web3 gaming is crucial for building robust on-chain economies. These economies empower players, fostering vibrant communities and creating new opportunities for value creation that go beyond traditional gaming models. Animoca‚Äôs continued investment in projects like the Tower Ecosystem reinforces their leadership in this evolving space, tackling challenges such as player retention and sustainable economic models head-on. The F2P to P2E model allows players to: Start Playing Freely: Lowering the barrier to entry for new users. Earn Rewards: Gaining TOWER tokens or other digital assets through gameplay.

Analysts from multiple platforms, including CoinCentral and Economic Times, point to a potential parabolic rally‚Äîpossibly pushing toward the $10 range by 2027 if ETF developments and regulatory clarity materialize. Tony ‚ÄúThe Bull‚Äù Severino even suggested a 333% surge in just 40 days, citing wave-based patterns that mirror past explosive cycles. Meanwhile, legal progress in Ripple‚Äôs long-standing battle with the SEC is restoring confidence among institutional investors. Traders are watching XRP closely, anticipating a breakout moment as liquidity begins rotating into pre-ETF plays. Ethereum‚Äôs utility keeps it dominant Ethereum continues to serve as the backbone of the blockchain economy. With new staking demand, Layer-2 rollups, and stablecoin integrations on the rise, ETH remains a core holding for both institutions and long-term believers. However, price action has been relatively conservative compared to more speculative altcoins. Analysts expect ETH to retest its previous all-time high sometime in 2026 or 2027, but few see it producing triple-digit returns in the short term. For many, Ethereum functions more like a ‚Äú crypto blue-chip ‚Äù than a high-growth asset. That said, its role as a network anchor is undisputed and continues to shape the broader DeFi and NFT infrastructure. MAGACOIN FINANCE enters the conversation With Ethereum and XRP offering strong long-term prospects, many traders are also turning to smaller-cap opportunities for faster gains . One such name generating intense early momentum is MAGACOIN FINANCE. While ETH and XRP might require years to deliver 3x or 4x returns , MAGACOIN is being highlighted by analysts for its explosive trajectory, now projecting as much as a 1 4,900% potential ROI, given its early presale stage and viral community growth. Whale wallets have recently begun accumulating large positions, and institutional trackers show increasing mention volume across media platforms. For investors who missed the early days of Ethereum or the first XRP breakout, MAGACOIN FINANCE is being quietly positioned as a way to access those same levels of upside ‚Äì without waiting years . Timing the market‚Äôs next rotation As Bitcoin consolidates and altcoin dominance begins to rise, timing is becoming just as important as coin selection. Projects like XRP and Ethereum remain critical to any balanced portfolio‚Äîbut they may not offer the high-velocity returns some traders seek in shorter cycles. This is why projects with real traction in the early-stage are drawing attention . MAGACOIN FINANCE, in particular, is benefiting from being early, visible, and well-positioned ‚Äì making it a tempting option for those chasing more aggressive gains while still wanting exposure to a growing ecosystem. With market analysts now projecting as much as a 14,900% potential ROI, the timing could be favorable for those entering before major exchange listings.

49568171,https://invezz.com/?p=2825873,1754376264,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,From $0.035 to $2? Why some predict MUTM could outrun AVAX in 2025 bull cycle,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/05/from-0-035-to-2-why-some-predict-mutm-could-outrun-avax-in-2025-bull-cycle/,"Being built around risk-managed lending, real-yield mechanics, and a stablecoin-based revenue loop, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is shaping up to be the lean, purpose-built protocol the next bull cycle needs. Smarter lending, leaner DeFi: what sets MUTM apart AVAX rode a wave of speculation during its early growth phase. But where it once drew attention for raw speed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now standing out for something more durable: utility with built-in value. Instead of relying on inflationary incentives or vague promises, MUTM uses real lending mechanics through a DeFi-native Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model. This structure allows users to deposit stablecoins and blue-chip assets like ETH and earn passive returns via smart contracts. On the other side of the equation, borrowers will be able to lock collateral‚Äîsay, AVAX or LINK‚Äîat up to 75% LTV and unlock stablecoins like USDC. That balance between capital efficiency and platform integrity is exactly what makes the system appealing to both conservative lenders and active DeFi users. For those seeking higher returns, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will also offer Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality, where users can define their own terms for borrowing and lending. By designing a lending ecosystem that serves both sides of the market, MUTM steps into a category that‚Äôs not only sustainable but also revenue-generating‚Äîsomething few projects in AVAX‚Äôs early days offered. Presale momentum builds as demand rises The interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn‚Äôt just theoretical‚Äîit‚Äôs being confirmed in the numbers. The project is currently in Phase 6 of its presale, priced at just $0.035. More than $14 million has already been raised, and 10% of the 170 million token allocation for this phase is already committed. With a listing target of $0.06, investors entering now are positioning for immediate upside, and those projecting further growth are looking at returns well beyond that. The audit credibility further strengthens confidence. CertiK‚Äôs 95 Token Scan and 78 Skynet scores reflect a project that‚Äôs not only secure but also built with transparency in mind. On the marketing front, the $100,000 MUTM giveaway is driving rapid community engagement, with over 12,000 Twitter followers onboard. These numbers suggest not just hype, but a growing base of holders and backers before the token even hits exchanges. DeFi growth blueprint: from launch to Layer-2 dominance What‚Äôs attracting market analysts is the infrastructure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is preparing for post-launch. Upon listing on top known exchanges like Binance, KuCoin and MEXC, the platform plans to launch with a Beta version of its core dApp, giving users immediate access to lending and borrowing functions. But the real edge lies in its Layer-2 integration. This will allow for cost-efficient, high-speed transactions, removing the barriers that slowed DeFi adoption during the last cycle. One analyst, who gained a following for accurately forecasting SOL‚Äôs 2021 run, is now projecting a $2 target for MUTM in the next cycle. His rationale: a clean token model, immediate product-market fit, and a DeFi roadmap that aligns with what serious investors actually want‚Äîcapital growth with real utility. A live snapshot of ROI in the making The performance trajectory for early backers is already notable. One investor who exchanged $5,000 worth of AVAX in Phase 1 for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens at $0.01 is now sitting on approximately $17,500, just based on current Phase 6 pricing. With a listing at $0.06, that same position scales to $30,000. And with projections aiming for $2, this investor stands on track for a 200x gain. In a market where large caps like BTC and ETH are showing slower growth, early-stage projects like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are beginning to draw capital rotation from whales seeking fresh momentum. It‚Äôs a classic cycle shift: from consolidation in majors to growth in high-upside, fundamentally sound assets. Act before the price moves With 90% of Phase 6 tokens still available but a 15% price increase set to kick in at Phase 7, the window for discounted entry is rapidly closing. Just as AVAX surprised early investors in 2021, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now emerging as the token to watch in the upcoming cycle. Smart money doesn‚Äôt wait. It moves before the breakout. As the market begins to rotate and traders hunt for the next narrative, the spotlight is moving toward protocols with real utility, revenue potential, and a clear product vision. That spotlight is now on Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äîand it‚Äôs only getting brighter.

While markets have stabilized somewhat since Monday, sentiment remains fragile amid a fresh round of Donald Trump-issued tariffs and another week of choppy ETF flows. BTC traded near $114,200 in the Asian afternoon hours on Tuesday, remaining flat on the day but still below the key $115,000 ‚Äì $118,000 range that had acted as short-term support over the past two weeks. Ether (ETH) fared slightly better, recovering toward $3,650 after dipping under $3,550 over the weekend, supported by sustained institutional interest and resilient flows. ‚ÄúAlthough Bitcoin has not managed to regain ground past $115,000, Ethereum has nearly recovered this week‚Äôs dip,‚Äù said Nick Ruck, director at LVRG Research, in a note to CoinDesk. ‚ÄúTreasury strategies, IPOs, and the hunt for the next MicroStrategy are fueling demand. We remain positive the bull run can continue,‚Äù Ruck said. Altcoin season over? Altcoins, meanwhile, have struggled. Solana (SOL) is down nearly 20% from last week‚Äôs highs, and XRP (XRP) is flatlining near $3 despite broader market stabilization. A colloquial narrative that ‚Äúaltseason‚Äù is imminent has weakened, with traders rotating capital back into majors or moving to the sidelines entirely. Part of the risk-off tone stems from Friday‚Äôs U.S. jobs report, which came in weaker than expected, and a fresh round of trade tensions from Washington. The result is a broad flight to safety in global markets, with crypto caught in the crossfire. Friday also marked the second-largest outflow day for bitcoin spot ETFs, and the fourth-largest for ether, dimming hopes that institutional flows would offer short-term price support. Still, not all desks are turning bearish. QCP Capital noted in a Monday note that the broader structure remains bullish. ‚ÄúThe recent drawdown appears more corrective than capitulatory,‚Äù the firm said in a client note. It highlighted growing activity in BTC options markets ‚Äî specifically 29AUG25 call flys targeting $124,000 ‚Äî as a sign that sophisticated players are positioning for a rebound. Put skew remains elevated but is not yet flashing panic. A move back above $115,000, combined with a rebound in ETF inflows and compressing implied volatility, could flip sentiment quickly, QCP said. Until then, traders are closely monitoring ETF flow data. If institutional demand stabilizes and macro jitters subside, this week‚Äôs consolidation could set the stage for a renewed push toward new highs. However, if outflows persist and risk appetite continues to fade, especially in alternative assets, markets may face another wave of de-risking before finding a true floor.

We are witnessing a notable stablecoin supply surge for specific assets, particularly Ethena USDe (USDe) and Sky‚Äôs USDS. This fascinating shift is directly linked to the recent passage of the U.S. stablecoin regulation bill, known as the GENIUS Act . What‚Äôs Behind the Remarkable Stablecoin Supply Surge? Following the GENIUS Act becoming law, data from platforms like DefiLlama and CoinGecko indicates a dramatic increase in the circulating supply of certain stablecoins. Specifically, the supply of USDe and USDS , which are known for offering staking rewards, has seen impressive growth. Since July 18, Ethena USDe‚Äôs circulating supply has soared by 70%, reaching approximately 9.49 billion. Similarly, Sky‚Äôs USDS has experienced a 23% increase, pushing its supply to nearly 4.81 billion. This surge highlights a clear response from the market to new regulatory frameworks. Investors are actively seeking out stablecoin options that align with their yield expectations in this evolving landscape. Decoding the GENIUS Act and Its Influence The GENIUS Act is a pivotal piece of legislation for the stablecoin sector. CryptoQuant‚Äôs Head of Research, Julio Moreno, explains a key provision: the Act prohibits stablecoin issuers from directly providing yields to holders. This regulation aims to bring more clarity and oversight to the stablecoin market, but it also creates a new dynamic for investors. This legislative change effectively redirects investor interest. If direct yields from issuers are no longer permitted, where do investors turn for returns on their stablecoin holdings? The answer, as the recent data shows, is towards platforms and protocols that facilitate stablecoin staking . Why Are Investors Embracing Stablecoin Staking? The appeal of staking rewards is a major driving force behind the growth of USDe and USDS . These are examples of yield-bearing stablecoins , meaning they allow holders to earn returns by participating in various decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, such as staking or liquidity provision. When traditional avenues for yield become restricted, these alternative methods gain significant traction. Investors are adapting their strategies to continue generating passive income from their stablecoin assets. This shift underscores the innovation within the crypto space, as the market finds new ways to offer value while adhering to emerging regulations. It‚Äôs a clear indication that the demand for yield in the stablecoin ecosystem remains strong. Navigating the Future of Yield-Bearing Stablecoins The ongoing stablecoin supply surge of assets like USDe and USDS illustrates a significant trend in the digital asset space. It demonstrates how regulatory developments can reshape investment behaviors and highlight specific segments of the market. As the crypto landscape matures, understanding the interplay between regulation and innovation becomes crucial. The growth of yield-bearing stablecoins is likely to continue as investors seek compliant ways to maximize their holdings. This trend also emphasizes the importance of robust DeFi protocols that can securely offer staking opportunities. The market is constantly evolving, and staying informed about these shifts is essential for any participant. In conclusion, the passage of the GENIUS Act has undeniably spurred a significant stablecoin supply surge for yield-offering assets like USDe and USDS . This development showcases the market‚Äôs adaptability and the persistent demand for stablecoin staking opportunities, even under new regulatory frameworks. It‚Äôs a dynamic period for stablecoins, promising continued innovation and strategic shifts for investors. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the GENIUS Act? The GENIUS Act is a U.S. stablecoin regulation bill that, among other provisions, prohibits stablecoin issuers from directly providing yields to holders. It aims to establish a clearer regulatory framework for stablecoins. Why have USDe and USDS supplies surged after the GENIUS Act? The supplies of USDe and USDS have surged because, unlike traditional stablecoins under the new Act, they offer staking rewards through decentralized protocols. This makes them attractive to investors seeking yield after direct issuer-provided yields were restricted. What are yield-bearing stablecoins? Yield-bearing stablecoins are digital assets pegged to a stable value (like the U.S. dollar) that allow holders to earn returns or yield through various mechanisms, such as staking, lending, or participating in DeFi protocols. Is stablecoin staking legal under the new U.S. regulations? The GENIUS Act focuses on preventing stablecoin issuers from directly providing yield. Staking rewards typically come from decentralized protocols or other market mechanisms, which operate under different legal considerations. Investors should always research specific platforms and consult with financial advisors regarding their activities. How does this affect the broader stablecoin market? This trend suggests a shift in investor preference towards stablecoins integrated with DeFi yield opportunities. It could lead to increased innovation in yield-generating protocols and a clearer distinction between regulated issuer-backed stablecoins and decentralized yield-bearing stablecoins.

With this, the bears seem to have reclaimed control once again, pushing Dogecoin deeper into loss territory after taking out an important position at $0.2. Nevertheless, the current decline seems to pale in comparison to the bullishness that continues to dominate among investors, with the expectations that this correction will be only temporary. Dogecoin Price Still Showing Signs Of Bullishness According to an analysis shared by crypto analyst KrissPax, the Dogecoin price may be down right now, but it is not out of the game. This is because the meme coin is currently the subject of a bullish formation as it travels down to retest a level that has previously led to a massive price surge in the past. Related Reading: Satoshimeter Shows Where Bitcoin Price Is In This Cycle The crypto analyst pointed out that the¬†Dogecoin price is expected to fall below 30 on the 4-Hour RSI chart again, and historically, such a decline has led to a recovery. The last time that the RSI fell below 30 on the 4-Hour chart was back in June 2025, and what followed was an over 70% recovery in the next month. Using this historical performance, the Dogecoin RSI falling below 30 once again could end up registering a similar performance. The only difference this time around is that the prices are at different levels, which points to a major difference in where the highs of the uptrend will be. Last time the RSI was this low, the price was trading at the $0.14 level. This time around, the analyst explains that Dogecoin sitting at $0.2 means that there is a higher low. The good thing about the formation of higher lows is the fact that they often lead to higher highs. In the event of another 70% increase in price from here, Dogecoin could end up rallying as high as $0.34 before it loses steam. However, this would still put it at more than 50% below its all-time high of $0.74, which was hit back in 2021 and has remained the peak for the meme coin.

Data from CryptoRank shows that the cryptocurrency is already down by 5.31% this month and climbing. This is not out of the ordinary, as the month of August has historically been one of the most bearish months for the Dogecoin price. In fact, if the trend holds, then DOGE investors could be looking at an average of -10% decline this month and a close in the red.

Plan B‚Äôs model targets $250K to $1M in coming years. RSI at 72.5 signals strong momentum and ongoing bull market. Bitcoin had closed the month of July at $115,000, an $8,000 jump from June‚Äôs close which is the highest monthly close in its history. According to analyst PlanB, this record-breaking move is right in line with his models, which suggest the market is in the middle of a slow and steady bull market with a long way to go. On-Chain Data Supports BTC Bull Theory According to on-chain metrics, the market is in the middle of a slow and steady bull market. Bitcoin‚Äôs current cycle has lasted longer than previous ones, already 18 months long and yet, is still rising.

Silbert, who founded Grayscale in 2013, takes over from Mark Shifke, who will remain on the board as the company prepares for its future as a publicly traded entity. This leadership transition also coincides with Grayscale‚Äôs plans to bring in independent directors to strengthen its governance. New Executive Team At Grayscale In a significant move to bolster its executive team, Grayscale has appointed four professionals with extensive backgrounds in traditional finance (TradFi). According to the firm‚Äôs announcement made on Monday, the new hires include Diana Zhang as Chief Operating Officer, Ramona Boston as Chief Marketing Officer, Andrea Williams as Chief Communications Officer, and Maxwell Rosenthal as Chief Human Resources Officer. Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‚ÄòNothing To Do Until October‚Äô These executives join Grayscale from firms such as Bridgewater, Apollo, Goldman Sachs, and Citadel, reporting directly to CEO Peter Mintzberg, who has been at the helm since last year. Mintzberg stated: This blend of institutional rigor and entrepreneurial drive shapes every aspect of how we operate at Grayscale, enabling us to deliver clients innovative investment strategies with the operating integrity they expect from a trusted partner. Silbert‚Äôs return comes at a critical juncture for the company, following a turbulent period marked by regulatory scrutiny. He stepped down as chairman in late 2023, just before the US Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) ruling on spot Bitcoin ETFs, including Grayscale‚Äôs long-standing effort to convert its Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) into an ETF. Around the same time, Silbert‚Äôs parent company, Digital Currency Group (DCG), faced legal challenges from New York‚Äôs attorney general regarding the collapse of crypto lending company Genesis, and its connections to crypto exchange Gemini‚Äôs Earn program, with Silbert himself named in the lawsuit. Regulatory Headwinds In his statement following the announcement, Silbert expressed his enthusiasm about rejoining Grayscale, emphasizing his belief in the company‚Äôs direction and the team leading it. Silbert noted: When I founded Grayscale in 2013, we saw an enormous opportunity to pioneer a new model for accessing and investing in digital assets, and to build the operational infrastructure that investors would ultimately demand. Today, I continue to have deep conviction in the company‚Äôs long-term positioning and in the leadership team guiding it forward.

This short-term recovery comes on the heels of a difficult few weeks in which the token lost the $3 support level , reflecting the ongoing volatility that continues to define the digital asset landscape. Despite the recent turbulence, investor sentiment around XRP appears resilient. Over the past month, the token has risen by almost 39%. The asset also hit a new all-time high in July , and its recent performance points to sustained interest even as broader market conditions remain cautious. However, trading volumes have retreated notably from July‚Äôs peak. Data shows that 24-hour turnover has declined, now standing at $6.27 billion. This suggests that market enthusiasm has cooled, though accumulation continues. AI Forecast Suggests Moderate Upside To estimate XRP‚Äôs potential movement through the end of the month, we‚Äôve referenced Finbold‚Äôs machine learning framework, which is powered by multiple large language models (LLMs). These AI agents considered numerous factors, including market indicators, such as the MACD, RSI, and more. Based on this analysis, XRP is projected to reach an average price of $3.12 by August 31. This suggests a modest upside of 2.295% from its current value. While the models generally pointed to bullish continuation, there was a wide range of outcomes depending on the assumptions and indicators emphasized. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to Finbold, Claude 3.5 Sonnet offered the most optimistic outlook, projecting a 15% increase amid expectations of improved liquidity and potential regulatory clarity. In contrast, GPT-4o predicted only a slight rise. While Grok 2 Vision flagged downside risks, suggesting a possible dip to $2.8, a price another analyst recently highlighted as a crucial level to watch if the asset falls. Market Outlook Hinges on Legal and Technical Factors XRP remains above its 50-day simple moving average, suggesting a constructive technical structure. However, failure to hold July highs and mixed momentum indicators have added uncertainty. The $3 level now serves as key support, with upcoming price action likely influenced by sentiment surrounding the SEC vs. Ripple case. A joint status update in the case is scheduled for August 15 and is drawing widespread attention with predictions that the lawsuit will end on that date. Though procedural, the filing may offer clues on regulatory direction. The SEC has shown a favorable stance toward cryptocurrencies, and the end of the lawsuit could help XRP outperform expectations.

The metric has recently retreated to zero, according to data source Amberdata, indicating that long-term market sentiment has shifted from bullish to neutral. The shift comes as some analysts warn of a bear market in 2026. A similar reset occurred at the onset of the previous bitcoin bear market, according to Griffin Ardern, head of options trading and research at crypto financial platform BloFin. ""I've noticed a rather worrying sign with the recent market pullback. Bitcoin's bullish sentiment for the far-month options has vanished, and it is now firmly neutral,"" Ardern told CoinDesk. ""This means the options market believes it's difficult for BTC to establish a long-term uptrend, and the likelihood of new highs in the coming months is decreasing."" ""A similar situation last occurred in Jan and Feb 2022,"" he added. A put option offers insurance against price drops in the underlying asset, while a call provides an asymmetric bullish exposure. A positive skew implies a bias towards calls, indicating bullishness in the market, whereas a negative skew suggests the opposite. The neutral shift in the 180-day skew could be partly driven by structured products selling higher strike call options to generate additional yield on top of the spot market holdings. The popularity of the so-called covered call strategy could be driving the call implied volatility lower relative to puts. Macro jitters BTC fell over 4% last week, nearly testing its former record high of $11,965, as the core PCE, the Fed's preferred inflation measure, rose in June, while nonfarm payrolls disappointed, stoking concerns about the economy. The price drop has pushed short-term skews below zero, a sign of traders seeking downside protection through puts. According to Ardern, the inflationary effects of ""supply chain impulses"" are already showing up in economic data. ""Although falling auto prices in the last CPI report offset rising prices for other goods, one thing is undeniable: the impulse from the West Coast of the Pacific has reached the East Coast, and retailers are already trying to pass on tariffs and a host of associated costs to consumers. While wholesalers and commodity trading firms are working to smooth supply chains, price increases will still occur, albeit more moderately or ""delayed by several months,"" Ardern noted, explaining the renewed neutrality of the long-term BTC options. According to JPMorgan, President Donald Trump's tariffs are likely to elevate inflation in the second half of the year. ""Global core inflation is projected to increase to 3.4% (annualized rate) in the second half of 2025, largely due to a tariff-related U.S. spike,"" analysts at the investment bank noted, adding that cost pressures will likely be concentrated in the U.S. An uptick in inflation could make it harder for the Fed to cut rates. Trump has repeatedly criticized the central bank for keeping rates elevated at 4.25%. Traders will receive the ISM non-manufacturing PMI later Tuesday, providing insights into inflation in the service sector, which accounts for a significant portion of the U.S. economy. It will be followed by July CPI and PPI releases later this week.

Key Takeaways: MEXC Ventures invested in Triv at a $200M valuation to grow its Southeast Asia footprint. Triv is one of Indonesia‚Äôs oldest licensed exchanges, operating under OJK and BAPPEBTI. The funding will boost Triv‚Äôs coin offerings, liquidity, and crypto media operations. The deal, confirmed on August 5 , marks part of MEXC‚Äôs broader plan to strengthen its presence in Southeast Asia, though the investment amount remains undisclosed. Founded in 2015, Triv is one of Indonesia‚Äôs longest-running digital asset exchanges, with over 3 million registered users. Triv Operates Under OJK and BAPPEBTI Oversight Triv operates with regulatory oversight from Indonesia‚Äôs Financial Services Authority (OJK) and the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (BAPPEBTI), offering services in spot trading, staking, and futures. The exchange competes in a crowded field that includes Binance-backed Tokocrypto, Pantera-funded Pintu, and Indodax. It also faces pressure from new entrants. This includes Hong Kong-based OSL Group, which acquired local player Evergreen Crest Holdings in June for $15 million. Until now, Triv has not revealed any outside capital involvement. It is unclear if this is the platform‚Äôs first institutional funding round, and MEXC Ventures has not shared details on the size or terms of the deal. ‚ÄúIndonesia is one of the most dynamic and promising digital asset markets in the region,‚Äù said Leo Zhao, investment director at MEXC Ventures. ‚ÄúTriv has earned a strong reputation for compliance, security, and user trust.‚Äù Triv CEO Gabriel Rey said the funding will help expand its coin listings, improve liquidity, and scale its crypto news arm, CryptoWave Media. Indonesia‚Äôs New Crypto Tax Rules Kick In The timing of the investment is notable, coming just after the implementation of Indonesia‚Äôs updated crypto tax rules on August 1 . The revised structure imposes a 0.21% tax on domestic exchange users, double the previous rate. For users trading through foreign platforms, the seller tax has surged from 0.2% to 1%. While VAT on purchases has been removed, crypto miners now face a 2.2% VAT and will soon be subject to regular income tax rates as a special 0.1% mining tax is phased out by 2026. In Indonesia, crypto is permitted for investment but not for payments. The market is growing rapidly. Crypto transactions in 2023 topped 650 trillion rupiah (around $40 billion), and user numbers across licensed platforms have surpassed 20 million, outpacing the country‚Äôs stock market participation. As reported, Indonesia‚Äôs annual crypto tax revenue jumped sharply in 2024, marking its highest level since the government introduced taxation on digital assets in 2022. According to officials from the Directorate General of Taxes, the country collected 620 billion rupiah (around $38 million) last year, a 181% rise from the 220 billion rupiah recorded in 2023. The sharp increase reflects a broader surge in local crypto activity. Officials attributed the growth to a rise in transaction volumes, which reportedly reached 650 trillion rupiah ($39.67 billion) in 2024.

This week, Chloe (@ ChloeTalk1 ) from HTX Research offers insights into recent macro surprises and the regulatory pivot reshaping crypto‚Äôs policy landscape. Soft Jobs Data Resets Market Expectations After the July FOMC meeting, the Fed left the funds rate at 5.25%-5.50% and offered no timeline for rate cuts, stoking fears of a ‚Äúhigher-for-longer‚Äù regime. The 10-year Treasury yield jumped to 4.24% , the U.S.-Dollar Index reclaimed the 100 handle, gold slipped below $3,270 , and Bitcoin retreated to the $116,000 area as on-chain activity cooled. Three days later, the macro narrative flipped: July non-farm payrolls ‚Äúcollapsed,‚Äù with only 73k jobs versus the 180k consensus, while May‚ÄìJune gains were revised down by roughly 129k (-90 %). The sudden chill forced an aggressive rate reset‚ÄîCME FedWatch showed the probability of a September cut surging from 38% to 82% , with two cuts by year-end now priced at 64% . The 10-year yield slid below 4.10% , gold bounced $40 to $3,363/oz , and Bitcoin briefly spiked before recession angst pushed it to an intraday low near $112,000 . Yet the broader economy still resembles a growth-slowdown rather than a full-blown recession. By 2025 Q2, household debt stood at 98% of disposable income ‚Äîwell below the 2008 peak of 133%. Credit-card delinquencies eased from 2.7% to 2.5% ; retail sales are holding a 2.8%-3.1% YoY band. America‚Äôs richest 10% control 72% of household wealth and finance nearly half of total consumption, providing a sturdy demand floor. On the corporate side, JPMorgan and Bank of America report commercial-loan growth of 5%-7% YoY , with no material uptick in loss reserves. Historically, a mix of softer payrolls and sticky-but-easing inflation marks the Fed‚Äôs turn toward accommodation, ushering in a ‚Äúhigh-volatility liquidity window‚Äù where BTC and gold attract hedging flows while leveraged alt-coins face valuation and deleveraging pressure. Regulatory Shift Opens Up DeFi and RWA Momentum The truly disruptive catalyst comes from regulation. On 31 July , SEC Chair Paul Atkins unveiled ‚ÄúProject Crypto,‚Äù pledging to put U.S. finance ‚Äúfully on-chain‚Äù via deregulation, innovation safe-harbors and exemptions. Atkins stated that most crypto assets should not be defaulted into securities status and that AMMs and on-chain lending are ‚Äúnon-intermediated financial activity‚Äù deserving legal recognition. The signal unlocks huge upside for DeFi protocols such as Uniswap , Aave and Lido , long suppressed by the ‚Äúsecurities overhang.‚Äù According to data from HTX, DeFi tokens including UNI and AAVE have recorded notable gains in August. Atkins also floated a ‚ÄúSuper-App‚Äù license for brokers to aggregate equities, crypto, staking and lending. The draft further names ERC-3643 ‚Äîwith its ONCHAINID permission layer‚Äîas the reference standard for tokenized RWA, paving a compliant path for real estate, private equity and other trillion-dollar markets. Crucially, the SEC will revise the decades-old Howey Test , introducing clear disclosure waivers and safe harbors for airdrops, ICOs and staking, ending the era where founders had to ‚Äúflee to Cayman‚Äù or geo-block U.S. users; venture capital could now re-shore, reigniting an on-chain startup cycle in America. Outlook and Structural Signals Bitcoin and Ethereum remain central to market structure, with BTC dominance and stablecoin basis offering key signals for capital rotation. High-beta altcoins and leveraged products may remain under pressure, particularly if the U.S. dollar strengthens or long-term yields rebound above 4.40%. Tokens with clear compliance paths‚Äîespecially DeFi governance assets and RWA tokens built on ERC-3643‚Äîare increasingly positioned to benefit from evolving policy support and real-world adoption narratives. With macro softening, liquidity conditions easing, and regulatory upgrading now converging, Bitcoin‚Äôs role as a global inflation hedge and policy-beta asset is hardening, while on-chain finance enjoys its first genuine policy tail-wind‚Äîsetting the stage for the next structural up-cycle in crypto markets. *The above content is not an investment advice and does not constitute any offer or solicitation to offer or recommendation of any investment product.

Son Rebuilds AI empire around arm to reclaim lost ground in chip race At the center of SoftBank‚Äôs AI strategy is Arm Holdings Plc, the UK-based chip designer with a 90% stake. Son is now crafting a portfolio of key industry players around Arm, aiming to regain ground after missing the historic AI-fueled rally that propelled Nvidia to a $4 trillion valuation and TSMC close to $1 trillion. ‚ÄúNvidia is the picks and shovels for the gold rush of AI,‚Äù said Ben Narasin, founder of Tenacity Venture Capital. SoftBank‚Äôs growing stake in Nvidia may give it greater influence ‚Äî and potentially faster access ‚Äî to the chipmaker‚Äôs in-demand hardware, he added. ‚ÄúMaybe he gets to skip the line.‚Äù SoftBank is expected to report strong paper gains from its Nvidia bet when it announces earnings on Thursday. Since its April low, Nvidia‚Äôs market value has surged nearly 90%, while TSMC shares are up over 40%. Despite being an early believer in AI, SoftBank sold a 4.9% stake in Nvidia in 2019 ‚Äî a position that would now be worth more than $200 billion. Massive losses at the Vision Fund also limited its capacity to invest aggressively in generative AI early on. Son spearheads large-scale initiatives like the $500 billion Stargate data center project with OpenAI, Oracle, and Abu Dhabi‚Äôs MGX fund. He‚Äôs also in talks with TSMC and others to build a $1 trillion AI chip manufacturing hub in Arizona. Comgest Asset Management‚Äôs Richard Kaye believes Son views himself as the natural provider of AI semiconductor technology, aiming to control the industry‚Äôs upstream and downstream segments. SoftBank rallies investors as Son eyes big AI deals Investors are buying into Son‚Äôs vision. SoftBank‚Äôs shares hit a record high last month, buoyed by strong AI exposure and plans for a $6.5 billion acquisition of Ampere Computing LLC and a possible $30 billion investment in OpenAI. Still, SoftBank trades at a roughly 40% discount to its net asset value, which includes its dominant stake in the $148 billion-valued Arm. Its $119 billion market cap remains a fraction of AI giants like Nvidia. To navigate regulatory headwinds, Son is leveraging his connections with Donald Trump and is reportedly holding frequent meetings with U.S. officials. This comes as SoftBank‚Äôs planned acquisition of Ampere faces an FTC review amid heightened scrutiny of AI and semiconductor deals. Investors will be watching Thursday‚Äôs earnings for clues on which assets SoftBank may divest next to fund its hardware ambitions. The firm raised about $4.8 billion in June by selling part of its T-Mobile stake. CFO Yoshimitsu Goto has cited a net asset value of ¬•25.7 trillion ($175 billion), indicating sufficient liquidity for continued expansion. Over the past year, the Vision Fund exited holdings in DoorDash, View Inc., Wiz, and Peak, while ramping up purchases of Nvidia, TSMC, and Oracle shares. In June, Son told shareholders that SoftBank is pursuing AI through a broad network of startups and group companies, intending to position itself as the key architect behind the leading platform in the era of artificial super intelligence.

Legal expert Bill Morgan weighs the possibility of his influence on SEC commissioners‚Äô votes to end the long-standing case. The chairman officially launched ‚ÄúProject Crypto,‚Äù which he described as a commission-wide initiative aimed at modernizing securities regulations to ensure the United States becomes a global leader in blockchain and crypto asset technology. In his tweet, Atkins stated , ‚ÄúWe will make sure the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America.‚Äù In the accompanying video, Atkins emphasized that the SEC, under his leadership, would not stand by while digital innovation and capital markets advance overseas. He referenced the President‚Äôs Working Group (PWG) report on Digital Asset Markets, calling it a ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù for maintaining U.S. dominance in the crypto space. The report outlines recommendations for agencies like the SEC to help build a regulatory structure enabling America‚Äôs financial markets to transition on-chain. Atkins made it clear that the SEC intends to lead actively in this transformation, noting that the initiative aligns with President Trump‚Äôs broader goals for digital asset leadership. Stuart Alderoty Responds to the Announcement Ripple‚Äôs Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, responded to Atkins‚Äô statement on X, focusing on the contrast between the SEC‚Äôs current stance and its previous regulatory approach. Alderoty said, ‚ÄúChair Atkins knows the prior administration pushed crypto companies offshore. He‚Äôs now focused on clear, tailored standards ‚Äî and drawing firm lines to curb SEC overreach.‚Äù Chair Atkins knows the prior administration pushed crypto companies offshore. He‚Äôs now focused on clear, tailored standards ‚Äîand drawing firm lines to curb SEC overreach. https://t.co/gyGaLR398S ‚Äî Stuart Alderoty (@s_alderoty) August 4, 2025 Ripple CLO‚Äôs comment highlights the often-cited criticism that the former SEC administration under Chair Gary Gensler created an uncertain and adversarial regulatory climate for U.S.-based crypto firms, which some believe compelled them to relocate their operations overseas. Alderoty‚Äôs post implies optimism about the change in tone from the SEC‚Äôs highest office, suggesting that the new leadership may aim to establish regulatory clarity through measured reforms instead of enforcement-centric tactics. The emphasis on ‚Äúcurbing SEC overreach‚Äù highlights a significant theme in Ripple‚Äôs ongoing legal conflict with the agency. Bill Morgan Raises Legal Implications for Ripple Appeal Responding directly to Alderoty‚Äôs post, Australian legal expert Bill Morgan offered a pointed question that drew immediate attention from those closely following the Ripple v. SEC lawsuit. Morgan wrote, ‚ÄúCan Chair Atkins actually get the SEC commissioners to vote to dismiss the Appeal in SEC v Ripple and his SEC attorneys to file papers dismissing the Appeal.‚Äù Can Chair Atkins actually get the SEC commissioners to vote to dismiss the Appeal in SEC v Ripple and his SEC attorneys to file papers dismissing the Appeal. https://t.co/MzPc58VjRi ‚Äî bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) August 4, 2025 Morgan‚Äôs remark touches on a critical legal stage in the Ripple case. Although Judge Torres previously ruled t hat XRP sales on exchanges did not constitute securities offerings, the SEC has appealed the decision. Morgan is questioning whether, under the newly announced Project Crypto initiative and its stated goal of regulatory clarity and pro-innovation policy, Chair Atkins will push for a withdrawal of the appeal. Such a move would require the support of the SEC‚Äôs commissioners and action by the agency‚Äôs legal team. This comment from Morgan implies a potential test of the new SEC leadership‚Äôs sincerity in implementing its stated policy objectives. If the SEC genuinely aims to abandon the enforcement-heavy approach of the past, then ending the legal battle against Ripple could serve as a defining early move for the administration.

Key Takeaways: BitMine holds 833,137 ETH worth over $3 billion, making it the largest corporate Ethereum holder. The firm‚Äôs aggressive strategy puts it far ahead of rivals just one month after announcing its ETH push. BitMine is betting on Ethereum‚Äôs upside amid shifting macro conditions. The move cements BitMine‚Äôs position as the top Ethereum-holding treasury firm and places it fourth among global crypto treasuries overall, according to a Monday press release . The purchase was disclosed on Monday, coinciding with a sharp Ether price swing that saw the asset climb 5.8% to $3,730 before easing back to $3,654, according to CoinGecko. BitMine Accelerates Ethereum Push Just One Month Into New Strategy BitMine‚Äôs latest accumulation highlights its aggressive entry into the Ethereum space just over a month after the firm unveiled its ETH strategy. ‚ÄúWe have separated ourselves among crypto treasury peers,‚Äù Lee said in a statement, emphasizing the rapid pace at which the firm has raised its crypto net asset value per share. ‚ÄúBitMine moved with lightning speed in its pursuit of the ‚Äòalchemy of 5%‚Äô of ETH.‚Äù The firm‚Äôs acceleration puts distance between it and rivals like SharpLink Gaming, which holds 438,200 ETH worth $1.61 billion, and The Ether Machine, now at 345,400 ETH after a $40 million buy on the same day. Rounding out the top five are the Ethereum Foundation (232,600 ETH) and PulseChain SAC (166,300 ETH), according to StrategicETHReserve data. BitMine‚Äôs rise has been fueled by notable backing. Investors include billionaire Bill Miller III, macro veteran Stanley Druckenmiller, and ARK Invest‚Äôs Cathie Wood ‚Äî all vocal advocates for long-term crypto exposure. The firm‚Äôs positioning signals rising institutional conviction in Ethereum, which has outperformed in recent weeks while attempting to close the gap with leaders Bitcoin and Solana.

He said signs of an easing Federal Reserve could lift both equities and crypto markets, potentially pushing the S&P 500 to new all-time highs ‚Äî a move that would likely benefit Ether. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre going to rally pretty strongly in August,‚Äù says Tom Lee of @Fundstrat . ‚ÄúI think we can get to 6500, 6600 [on the S&P 500] and all-time highs in the next couple of weeks.‚Äù https://t.co/ZAsld9FqER ‚Äî Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) August 4, 2025 With its latest buy, BitMine is not just betting on price appreciation but also staking its claim as a dominant force in Ethereum treasury strategy, outpacing peers both in speed and size.

The open-ended repurchase plan comes amid BitMine‚Äôs larger goal of acquiring 5% of Ethereum‚Äôs total supply, a move it sees as part of a long-term capital strategy.

Trading around $0.0225 at the time of writing, FUN has already delivered consistent growth underpinned by measurable adoption and a disciplined approach to supply reduction. With a target that represents nearly a 5X return from current levels - and a 10X profit for early 2025 accumulators - many traders are asking: Is this momentum sustainable? A closer look at FUNToken‚Äôs deflationary mechanics and community incentives suggests the answer may be yes. Deflation by Design: A Model That Shrinks Supply One of the most powerful forces behind FUNToken‚Äôs recent surge is its predictable, revenue-backed deflationary model, a system that rewards real usage with measurable scarcity. Unlike projects that announce token burns to generate headlines but never deliver, FUNToken has built a consistent framework that connects every burn directly to platform activity. ‚óè In June 2025, the project permanently removed 25 million tokens from circulation. This burn was not funded by reserves or one-off treasury spending; it was driven by actual transaction revenue collected from gameplay fees, mission completions, and engagement inside the ecosystem. ‚óè The burn itself was fully traceable on-chain, providing the community with transparent proof of execution. This transparency has become a cornerstone of FUNToken‚Äôs strategy, reinforcing investor confidence that scarcity here is an operational commitment. ‚óè Quarterly burns are scheduled as part of the long-term roadmap . As the platform expands to 30 live games and rolls out the FUN Wallet mobile app with integrated staking, each burn event is expected to grow in size. More users and higher transaction volumes mean more revenue, and more tokens removed from supply. ‚óè Every time a burn occurs, the remaining tokens become proportionally scarcer, gradually tightening the market and supporting upward price pressure as demand expands. This disciplined approach to supply reduction is what sets FUNToken apart from competitors relying only on speculation. Community Engagement That Drives Daily Demand Supply reduction alone isn‚Äôt enough to sustain momentum - especially in crypto. What makes FUNToken‚Äôs approach unique is how it pairs deflation with a vibrant, fast-growing community that fuels daily demand. ‚óè The AI-powered Telegram bot has become the daily entry point for over 105,000 players, offering everything from quizzes and missions to hyper-casual games and the Wheel of Fortune. This constant engagement creates a predictable stream of microtransactions, each contributing revenue that funds future burns. ‚óè The $5 million giveaway is one of the largest incentive programs in Web3 gaming. Unlike limited-time promotions, this campaign rewards users for holding FUN tokens, referring friends, and participating consistently. This not only drives organic growth but also encourages players to keep tokens in their wallets instead of trading them away. ‚óè Daily activity means FUN tokens are always in motion, being earned, spent, staked, and re-earned. This dynamic keeps liquidity healthy and helps maintain a steady baseline of demand, even during broader market volatility. ‚óè The project‚Äôs roadmap reinforces this engagement cycle. Upcoming milestones like the launch of the FUN Wallet app, the expansion to new gaming experiences, and the integration of staking rewards all deepen the reasons players log in daily. Taken together, these elements form a self-sustaining ecosystem where every mission, spin, and referral supports adoption and reinforces the deflationary model. This is why, even when market sentiment cools, FUNToken‚Äôs engaged community acts as an engine that keeps the project moving forward, and why many see the $0.10 target as a realistic step, not a marketing slogan. Why the $0.10 Target Looks Credible Reaching $0.10 is no small feat. But there are clear reasons why this goal is realistic if the roadmap continues to deliver: Ongoing Quarterly BurnsEvery three months, tokens are removed from circulation, tightening supply. As more players participate, each burn grows in scale. Expansion to 30 Live GamesA larger catalog means more microtransactions, which generate additional revenue to fund buybacks and burns. FUN Wallet Mobile AppLaunching in Q3/Q4, the app will integrate staking, making it effortless for users to lock up tokens and reduce circulating supply. Daily Utility and IncentivesThe combination of the Telegram bot, the giveaway, and consistent mission rewards keeps the community active, reducing speculative churn. When adoption and deflation advance together, the price potential becomes much stronger. What to Watch as the Year Progresses If you‚Äôre tracking FUNToken‚Äôs journey toward $0.10, here are the key milestones to keep in focus: ‚óè Next scheduled burn events and whether their scale increases as forecasted. ‚óè The launch of the FUN Wallet mobile app, which will make staking accessible to casual players. ‚óè Ongoing expansion to 30+ live games, driving higher transaction volumes. ‚óè Growth in Telegram engagement and community size, especially as the $5 million giveaway continues to attract new participants. Together, these developments create the conditions where a 10X profit isn‚Äôt just a headline. It becomes a measurable possibility. Final Thoughts FUNToken‚Äôs strategy is clear: build daily utility, reduce supply, and reward loyalty. The combination of a disciplined deflationary model and a highly engaged community is what gives this project a credible path to $0.10 by the end of the year. For early participants, this could be the foundation for one of Web3 gaming‚Äôs most significant success stories.

Peirce used a ‚Äúpeanut butter and watermelon‚Äù anecdote to illustrate the value of disintermediation or removing intermediaries from processes, in this case, finances. The pro-crypto commissioner was critical of financial surveillance and the banking system, stating that the 55-year-old Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) has ‚Äúdeputized American financial institutions as de facto law enforcement investigators.‚Äù A Surveillance State The current financial system is a surveillance state. In 2024, 324,000 financial institutions filed more than 25 million transaction reports, including 4.7 million ‚ÄúSuspicious Activity Reports.‚Äù Meanwhile, third-party doctrine allows the government to access financial data without warrants, and the SEC‚Äôs Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT) tracks every investor‚Äôs trading activity without suspicion of wrongdoing. Privacy-protecting crypto technologies such as zero-knowledge proofs, mixers, and privacy pools can reduce reliance on intermediaries while DeFi protocols offer transparent, equal access without discrimination, she said. ‚ÄúA bank that might not want to lend to certain types of people gives way to a DeFi protocol through which everybody can borrow on the same, publicly transparent terms.‚Äù Grateful to SEC Commissioner @HesterPeirce for spotlighting the need to defend Americans‚Äô right to financial privacy and including @katie_haun ‚Äòs argument that our financial data is among the most sensitive personal information we produce.

Recent reports from Bitcoin World market monitoring confirm a significant Bitcoin price drop , with BTC falling below the crucial $114,000 mark. Specifically, Bitcoin is currently trading at $113,996 on the Binance USDT market. This sudden BTC market dip has naturally sparked conversations and concerns among investors and enthusiasts alike. What does this mean for the broader crypto landscape, and how should we navigate such cryptocurrency volatility ? Understanding the Recent Bitcoin Price Drop The cryptocurrency market, known for its dynamic nature, frequently experiences fluctuations. This latest Bitcoin price drop is a prime example of such movements. When a major asset like Bitcoin sees its value decrease, it often signals a broader sentiment shift across the digital asset space. While a single price point like $114,000 might seem arbitrary, breaking through significant psychological or technical support levels can amplify market reactions. Investors are closely watching to see if this is a temporary correction or the start of a more prolonged downturn. Understanding these immediate reactions is vital for informed decision-making. What Triggers a BTC Market Dip? Several factors can contribute to a sudden BTC market dip . Understanding these triggers is essential for any investor looking to make informed decisions. Here are some common influences: Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic news, interest rate changes, or inflation reports can influence investor appetite for risk assets like Bitcoin. For example, rising interest rates might make traditional investments more appealing. Regulatory News: Announcements from governments or financial bodies regarding crypto regulations can have a profound impact. Positive news can boost prices, while restrictive measures can cause a dip, as seen with past regulatory crackdowns. Whale Movements: Large holders of Bitcoin (often called ‚Äòwhales‚Äô) can significantly influence the market. A large sell-off by a whale can trigger a cascade effect, creating selling pressure. Technical Analysis Indicators: Traders often use technical indicators. If key support levels are broken, it can trigger automatic sell orders, accelerating a price fall as more traders follow suit. Market Sentiment: News events, social media trends, or even widespread fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) can quickly shift market sentiment, leading to increased selling pressure. Navigating Cryptocurrency Volatility Cryptocurrency volatility is a defining characteristic of this asset class. While it presents risks, it also offers opportunities for savvy investors. It is crucial to remember that price swings are a normal part of the crypto journey. Rather than panicking during a Bitcoin price drop , consider these approaches: Long-Term Perspective: Many experienced investors advocate for a long-term view. Short-term dips might be less concerning if your investment horizon is several years, focusing on Bitcoin‚Äôs long-term growth potential. Risk Management: Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Diversifying your portfolio beyond just Bitcoin can also mitigate risk, spreading your investments across different assets. Stay Informed: Keep up-to-date with reliable news sources. Understanding the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô behind market movements can help you react rationally, avoiding emotional decisions. Strategies for Bitcoin Trading in Turbulent Times For those actively engaged in Bitcoin trading , turbulent times demand a disciplined approach. It is not about avoiding risk entirely, but managing it effectively. Here are some strategies that traders often employ: Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): Instead of investing a lump sum, invest a fixed amount regularly. This strategy helps smooth out the impact of volatility by averaging your purchase price over time. Set Stop-Loss Orders: These orders automatically sell your assets if they fall to a certain price, limiting potential losses and protecting your capital. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Always research before making any trading decisions. Understand the project, its fundamentals, and its potential, rather than relying on hype. Avoid Emotional Decisions: Fear and greed are powerful emotions in trading. Stick to your pre-defined trading plan and avoid impulsive actions based on short-term price swings. Analyzing Current Crypto Market Trends The recent Bitcoin price drop is just one piece of the larger puzzle when we analyze current crypto market trends . While Bitcoin often leads the market, altcoins can react differently. Sometimes, a Bitcoin dip can lead to altcoin rallies as capital flows into other assets, or it can pull the entire market down. Monitoring the overall market capitalization, trading volumes, and investor sentiment across various assets provides a more comprehensive picture. The market is constantly evolving, influenced by technological advancements, regulatory clarity, and broader economic shifts. Staying attuned to these trends helps in forecasting potential future movements. In conclusion, the recent Bitcoin price drop below $114,000, as reported by Bitcoin World market monitoring, serves as a potent reminder of the inherent volatility in the cryptocurrency space. While such movements can be unsettling, they are a normal part of the market cycle. By understanding the potential triggers, adopting robust risk management strategies, and maintaining a long-term perspective, investors can navigate these turbulent waters more effectively. Staying informed and making rational decisions, rather than reacting to every fluctuation, is key to success in the dynamic world of Bitcoin and beyond. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Is this Bitcoin price drop unusual for the cryptocurrency market? No, price drops and significant volatility are common in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin, like other digital assets, experiences frequent price fluctuations due to various factors including market sentiment, regulatory news, and macroeconomic events. This specific Bitcoin price drop is part of its typical market cycle. 2. What should I do if my Bitcoin investment is currently down? If your Bitcoin investment is down, it‚Äôs crucial to avoid panic selling. Consider reviewing your original investment thesis, assessing your risk tolerance, and sticking to a long-term strategy if that was your initial plan. Strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) can also help mitigate the impact of market dips over time. 3. How does regulatory news affect a BTC market dip? Regulatory news can significantly impact a BTC market dip . Positive regulatory clarity or supportive frameworks can boost investor confidence and prices. Conversely, news of stricter regulations, bans, or increased scrutiny can lead to fear and selling pressure, causing prices to fall. 4. Is Bitcoin still a good investment despite its volatility? Many investors believe Bitcoin remains a strong long-term investment due to its limited supply, growing adoption, and role as a decentralized asset. While cryptocurrency volatility is inherent, the long-term trend has historically been upward. However, it‚Äôs essential to conduct your own research and consider your personal financial situation. 5. What are the key indicators to watch for future crypto market trends? To understand future crypto market trends , keep an eye on global economic indicators, major regulatory developments, institutional adoption rates of cryptocurrencies, technological advancements within the blockchain space, and overall market sentiment as reflected in trading volumes and social media discussions.

The country believes the Trump administration is targeting it over its imports of Russian oil. India‚Äôs Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement Monday that the country began importing its energy trade deal with Russia after the start of the war with Ukraine. The MEA also argued that its traditional supplies were diverted to Europe after the war began, leading New Delhi to seek other alternatives for energy. India prioritizes economic security According to the ministry, the U.S. previously commended India‚Äôs oil trade initiative for strengthening global energy market stability. They also condemned the EU and the U.S. for criticizing New Delhi, yet they indulge in trade with Russia. The EU and Russia traded goods worth 67.5B euros last year, up from 17.2B euros the previous year. Official data also shows India‚Äôs trade with Moscow reached a record $68.7 billion for the 12 months to March 2025. The bloc accounted for 38.4% of Russia‚Äôs exports in 2024. Its bilateral trade with Russia also saw a 74% drop in 2024 from 275.5B euros in 2021. Moscow continues to export machinery and transport equipment, chemicals, iron and steel, and fertilizers to the EU. India and Russia only traded a mere $10.1 billion during the pre-pandemic trade. The figures indicate that New Delhi‚Äôs trade was much lower than the EU‚Äôs trade with Russia. The MEA condemned the U.S. for continued import of Russian Uranium, which it had banned in May 2024. The ministry noted that the Western country also imports palladium from Moscow to power its EV industry . The ministry highlighted that the targeting of the country is unjustified and unreasonable. India said it will take all necessary precautions to protect its national interests and economic security. Trump threatens higher tariffs on India Trump had called out India last week for continuing its energy trade with Russia and imposed 25% tariffs on the country, plus additional penalties. The President also threatened to raise levies for New Delhi on Monday, but didn‚Äôt specify the level of the higher tariffs. Trump said that India didn‚Äôt care about the deaths in Ukraine as they continue to buy massive amounts of Russian oil. His deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, reiterated on Sunday that it was not acceptable for India to continue financing the conflict in Ukraine by purchasing Russian energy. Trump has also accused India of purchasing cheap Russian oil and selling it on the Open Market for big profits. The U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that India went from importing 100,000 barrels per day before the conflict ‚Äì 2.5% of its total imports ‚Äì to more than 1.8 million barrels (39%) per day in 2023. ‚ÄúOur bilateral relationships with various countries stand on their own merit and should not be seen from the prism of a third country. India and Russia have a steady and time-tested partnership.‚Äù -Randhir Jaiswal, Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs of India. Former Indian foreign secretary Shyam Saran called for the country to follow the example of China and Brazil to stand up to the Trump administration. He argued that the President‚Äôs exaggerated demands had turned political as well as economic, and could undermine India‚Äôs national interests. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Soon, you will be able to engage in Linea ETH staking directly through the network, leveraging the power of Lido v3 for enhanced capital efficiency. This integration promises to transform how users interact with their bridged ETH, opening up exciting new possibilities for passive income and liquidity. What is Linea ETH Staking and How Does It Work? Linea, a prominent Layer-2 solution built on Ethereum, is set to introduce a groundbreaking feature within a few months. This new functionality will enable ETH that users bridge to Linea to be automatically staked on the Ethereum mainnet. The mechanism utilizes Lido liquid staking , specifically through its v3 protocol. When you bridge your ETH to Linea, the network will facilitate its transfer to the Ethereum mainnet for staking. In return, you will receive stETH, Lido‚Äôs liquid staking token, on the Linea network. This means your staked ETH remains liquid, allowing you to use your stETH in other DeFi protocols on Linea while still earning staking rewards. This seamless process simplifies participation in Ethereum‚Äôs proof-of-stake consensus, making it more accessible for a wider range of users on the Consensys Linea network . Why is Liquid Staking on Linea a Game Changer for Users? The introduction of Linea ETH staking through Lido v3 offers several compelling advantages, particularly for those looking to maximize their digital assets. It addresses a key challenge in traditional staking: illiquidity. However, this new approach provides significant benefits. Enhanced Capital Efficiency: Your staked ETH remains liquid as stETH, allowing you to participate in other DeFi activities like lending, borrowing, or providing liquidity on Linea. Simplified User Experience: The automatic staking process removes much of the complexity typically associated with direct mainnet staking. Accessibility: By leveraging Linea‚Äôs Layer-2 architecture, users can potentially benefit from lower transaction fees compared to direct mainnet interactions, making staking more economical. This innovation significantly boosts the utility of ETH within the Linea ecosystem, paving the way for more dynamic DeFi opportunities . Consensys Linea Network: A Boost for DeFi Opportunities As an initiative from Consensys, a leading Ethereum software company, Linea brings significant credibility and technical prowess to the Layer-2 space. This upcoming staking feature is a testament to Linea‚Äôs commitment to enhancing user experience and expanding the utility of its network. Moreover, the integration with Lido v3, a well-established liquid staking provider, reinforces this commitment. This development is not just about staking; it is about creating a more vibrant and interconnected DeFi ecosystem. Users will gain more flexibility with their assets, which can drive further innovation and adoption within Linea‚Äôs decentralized applications. The ability to earn staking rewards while maintaining liquidity is a powerful incentive for both new and existing users to bridge their assets to the Consensys Linea network . Preparing for the Rollout: What Users Should Know About Linea ETH Staking While the official rollout is still a few months away, it is wise for interested users to prepare. Understanding the mechanics of liquid staking and the benefits of using an Ethereum Layer-2 for such operations will be crucial. Users should also stay informed about official announcements from Linea regarding the exact launch date and any specific requirements. Consider the following actionable insights: Security: Always ensure you are interacting with official Linea and Lido channels to avoid scams. Understanding stETH: Familiarize yourself with how stETH works and its potential peg fluctuations relative to ETH. Gas Fees: While Linea aims for lower fees, understand the costs associated with bridging ETH and interacting with DeFi protocols. This feature represents a significant step forward for Linea, enhancing its appeal as a robust platform for decentralized applications and financial services. Conclusion: A New Era for ETH Staking on Linea The upcoming launch of Linea ETH staking through Lido v3 marks a pivotal moment for the Linea network and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. By offering a seamless, efficient, and liquid staking solution, Linea is set to empower users with greater control and utility over their bridged ETH. This move underscores Linea‚Äôs position as an innovative Ethereum Layer-2 , committed to fostering a more accessible and capital-efficient DeFi landscape. As the rollout approaches, the crypto community eagerly anticipates the positive impact this revolutionary feature will have on user engagement and the overall growth of the Linea ecosystem.

DOGE‚Äôs price dropped to $0.202 over the last 24 hours as buyers tried to maintain support around $0.2010, but could not succeed. Moreover, sellers are currently competing for dominance over the price action. What is the expected value of Dogecoin in 2025? Dogecoin is expected to trade at an average price of $0.328029 in 2025. Will DOGE reach $0.50? If the broader cryptocurrency market turns bullish, DOGE will join the rally. As a meme coin, it runs mostly on positive speculation. It‚Äôs expected that the coin will touch this level by March 2026. Will DOGE reach $1? Considering Dogecoin‚Äôs current value, $1 is still a far-reaching target. However, robust community support can push this meme coin to $1 by 2028. Will DOGE hit $10? Despite the risk involved with meme-based crypto pairs like Dogecoin, they can still shoot up on positive momentum. However, the market speculates that DOGE cannot reach the $10 level in the foreseeable future. How much is $500 worth of Dogecoin right now? $500 is worth nearly 2,284 DOGE in August; however, this amount changes based on day-to-day price fluctuations. Does DOGE have a good long-term future? Most well-known altcoins are trading at lower levels, but looking at DOGE, it‚Äôs trading above its average price of the last two years. Currently, the coin is trading below the year‚Äôs peak price of $0.414, which was observed on January 17, 2025, but the trend is expected to change, and a positive outbreak can be expected. The DOGE/USD pair is expected to reach the $1.71 mark by 2031, so holding it for longer can be beneficial.

Our analysis shows that DOGE could cross $1.71 by 2031. Dogecoin historic price sentiment DOGE price history by Coingecko 2013 was the beginning of Dogecoin, and it surged to $0.0004 in the first days of trading. By March 2014, the coin attempted a breach of $0.001 but failed, closing the year at $0.0001. In the subsequent years, Dogecoin faced immense competition from new coins, including Stellar, Neo, and Monero, which dragged the coin‚Äôs price further down. According to the Dogecoin price history, it traded in a strict range of $0.002 to $0.0036 for most of 2019. In January 2021, DOGE saw significant gains, closing the month at $0.037. Subsequently, Dogecoin attained an ATH of $0.7376 on May 8, 2021, but lost 76% of its value, closing the year at $0.1703. In 2022, Dogecoin maintained an average market price of about $0.07. The coin began trading around $0.08 in 2023 and closed the year at $0.08955, as per crypto market records. In 2024, Dogecoin (DOGE) began consolidating around $0.08, surged above $0.2 during March‚Äôs bull run, fluctuated between $0.1011 and $0.1759 through mid-year, spiked to $0.4312 in November, and ended the year at $0.314. In January 2025, DOGE clocked the highest price of $0.41; however, after shedding 38% value, it stepped down to $0.258 in February. In March, DOGE‚Äôs value decreased further as it dipped to the $0.20 range, and April saw the lowest DOGE price of $0.142. However, in May, the meme coin recovered to the $0.249 mark, following some improvement. On July 20, 2025, Dogecoin peaked at $0.274, and at the start of August, DOGE is trending near $0.214.",Crypto Price Predictions|DOGE,EN,0,0,MINING|DOGE|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|SPONSORED|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-08-05 08:10:39

A significant development in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region recently highlighted this, as Alaan, a pioneering AI-powered fintech company, announced a monumental $48 million Series A funding round. This achievement marks one of the largest Series A rounds for a fintech in the MENA region, signaling strong investor confidence in its transformative approach to corporate finance. How is Alaan Revolutionizing Corporate Expenses in MENA? The genesis of Alaan stems from a common pain point experienced by many businesses in the MENA region: inefficient corporate expense management. Parthi Duraisamy, co-founder and CEO of Alaan, vividly recalls the challenges faced during his consulting days at McKinsey‚Äôs Dubai office. The limited acceptance of traditional corporate cards, like American Express, often forced employees to cover substantial travel expenses out-of-pocket, followed by the tedious process of manual expense reporting. ‚ÄúIt was a constant pain,‚Äù Duraisamy shared, detailing the hours spent on weekends reconciling receipts. Recognizing this critical need, Duraisamy, alongside fellow McKinsey alumnus Karun Kurien, launched Alaan. Their vision was to create a seamless solution for corporate expense management, a platform that would eliminate manual reconciliation and streamline financial operations. The recent $48 million Series A funding round, led by Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia Capital India & SEA), validates Alaan‚Äôs impact. Notable participants in the round included founders from 885 Capital, Y Combinator, 468 Capital, Pioneer Fund, and even founders of some of Alaan‚Äôs unicorn customers, such as Hosam Arab (Tabby) and Mudassir Sheikha (Careem). What Makes Alaan a Leader in Spend Management? Alaan has rapidly ascended to become the Middle East‚Äôs leading spend management platform, despite facing significant hurdles. Its path to market leadership was not without challenges, particularly regulatory complexities and the necessity for robust banking partnerships. For instance, launching in the UAE and later expanding into Saudi Arabia required years to secure approvals from apex banks. ‚ÄúThe biggest challenge we faced, both in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, was simply going live,‚Äù Duraisamy explained. However, Alaan‚Äôs agility in other areas allowed it to innovate swiftly. The company made a pioneering move by integrating Apple Pay into its B2B offerings, a feature previously unavailable to finance teams in the region. More significantly, Alaan‚Äôs strategic adoption of AI has been central to its product evolution. Initially, a conversational chatbot for spending queries did not gain traction. This led to a crucial shift in strategy: leveraging AI to work in the background, streamlining processes such as: Receipt Matching: Automating the tedious task of matching receipts to transactions. Reconciliation: Simplifying the complex process of financial reconciliation. VAT Extraction: A particularly valuable feature in the region, helping businesses navigate complex VAT regulations and reclaimable taxes. Through these AI-driven efficiencies, Alaan claims its platform has saved finance teams over 1.5 million hours of manual work, a number expected to grow as the company continues its investment in automation. Why is Alaan‚Äôs Funding a Game-Changer for MENA Fintech? The $48 million Series A round positions Alaan as a significant player in the burgeoning MENA fintech landscape. Compared to Saudi Arabia‚Äôs buy-now-pay-later platform Tamara, which raised $110 million a couple of years ago, Alaan‚Äôs funding round stands out as one of the largest for a Series A fintech in the region, highlighting the growing investor appetite for innovative financial solutions in MENA. Since its launch in 2022, Alaan has processed over 2.5 million transactions for more than 1,500 finance teams across major regional enterprises, including G42, Careem, Tabby, and Lulu Group. Beyond impressive transaction volumes, Alaan boasts a crucial differentiator: profitability. Duraisamy noted that the company spent $5 million to generate $10 million in revenue, a testament to its capital-efficient model. GV Ravishankar, Managing Director at Peak XV, affirmed this, stating, ‚ÄúThe category has demonstrated strong product-market fit in the MENA region, and Alaan stands out as the category leader. Their customer-centric and product-led mindset has enabled them to build solutions tailored to modern finance teams.‚Äù This disciplined approach, Duraisamy credits to Y Combinator and his mentors, sets Alaan apart in a market where many fintechs prioritize payment volumes over sustainable growth. What‚Äôs Next for This AI-Powered Fintech Innovator? With this substantial Series A funding, Alaan is poised for accelerated expansion, particularly in Saudi Arabia, where it launched earlier this year and has already seen transaction volumes double month-over-month for the past six months. The investment will fuel hiring across sales, customer success, and compliance teams, while also doubling down on its core strength: AI-powered fintech automation for finance. When questioned about the influence of global success stories like Ramp, whose valuation significantly increased recently, Duraisamy emphasized Alaan‚Äôs focus on fundamental strength. ‚ÄúWhen you talk to investors, what really matters for a company at our stage is the fundamentals: how capital-efficient we are, how much revenue we generate, how strong our go-to-market motion is,‚Äù he explained. This pragmatic outlook underscores Alaan‚Äôs commitment to building a robust and sustainable business, regardless of broader market trends or the performance of other players. Their success is rooted in addressing real pain points in corporate expenses and delivering tangible value through advanced technology. In conclusion, Alaan‚Äôs impressive $48 million Series A funding round is a landmark achievement for the MENA fintech ecosystem. By leveraging AI to tackle the complexities of corporate expense management, Alaan has not only achieved profitability but also cemented its position as a category leader. Its strategic expansion plans and commitment to AI-driven automation promise continued innovation and growth, empowering finance teams across the region with smarter, more efficient tools. Alaan‚Äôs journey is a compelling narrative of identifying a critical need, navigating regulatory landscapes, and building a technologically advanced, customer-centric solution that resonates deeply within the market.

Here‚Äôs why,https://timestabloid.com/analyst-says-cardano-ada-could-due-for-another-pullback-heres-why/,"Cardano (ADA) has been on a steady upward trend, recently reclaiming the $0.74 area after a series of strong sessions. However, a new development on the 4-hour chart has introduced a note of caution for traders closely monitoring the asset‚Äôs short-term trajectory. Prominent crypto analyst Ali Martinez (@ali_charts) shared a chart on X showing that ADA may be approaching a local top. According to the chart, the TD Sequential indicator , commonly used to anticipate potential trend exhaustion, has now triggered a sell signal. This signal appears at the ninth candle of the sequence, which is often interpreted as a point where bullish momentum could begin to stall. Cardano $ADA could be due for another pullback as the TD Sequential flashed a sell signal on the 4-hour chart! pic.twitter.com/Qhk2lu89ON ‚Äî Ali (@ali_charts) August 4, 2025 TD Sequential Signal Appears After Sustained Rally The indicator‚Äôs timing is notable, as it comes after a strong recovery from the recent downturn. ADA‚Äôs price has been climbing consistently, as illustrated by a succession of higher candles in the 4-hour time frame. The upward push brought the token close to the $0.7428 high, just before the most recent bearish candle marked the ninth bar in the sequence. Martinez‚Äôs chart places the gray arrow above this ninth candle, confirming the presence of the TD Sequential signal. In technical analysis, this type of signal is not an automatic reversal cue but often precedes short-term pullbacks or consolidation phases. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Cardano‚Äôs TD Sequential Indicator showed a similar sell signal on the 4-hour chart in March , and this caused the asset to fall from over $0.7 to around $0.51 in under two weeks. The same indicator marked the beginning of the recent upward turn, and that bearish momentum appears to have reached its peak. What‚Äôs Next for Cardano (ADA)? At the time of the chart‚Äôs publication, ADA was trading around $0.7378. The appearance of a TD sell signal could prompt some caution among traders. However, some market participants are confident that ADA can keep climbing, as the recent whale buying spree has renewed the many investors that the asset can reach $1. The broader structure remains intact for now, but with ADA approaching a zone that has previously acted as both support and resistance, the next few candles will be critical. Martinez recently highlighted ADA‚Äôs similarity to the 2021 bull run , which sent it to its all-time high of $3.1. If the asset can escape a bearish turn, it may target similar levels soon.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts and traditional investors alike, understanding the direction of the world‚Äôs reserve currency is paramount, as its strength or weakness can significantly influence asset prices, capital flows, and market sentiment. Recent analysis from Bank of America (BofA) offers a compelling perspective, suggesting that despite a temporary surge in July, the USD pressure is set to continue, pointing towards sustained weakness. But what exactly does this mean for your portfolio, and why are BofA‚Äôs insights so crucial? Understanding the Persistent USD Pressure : What Does It Mean? When analysts speak of ‚Äò USD pressure ,‚Äô they are referring to a sustained tendency for the US Dollar to depreciate against other major global currencies. This isn‚Äôt just a fleeting daily fluctuation; it indicates a deeper, fundamental shift in market sentiment and economic factors that favor other currencies over the greenback. While July saw a brief period of strength for the dollar, largely driven by safe-haven demand amidst global uncertainties or specific economic data points, BofA‚Äôs deep dive into forex positioning suggests this was merely a temporary reprieve, not a reversal of the underlying trend. The implications of persistent USD pressure are far-reaching. For international trade, a weaker dollar makes US exports cheaper and imports more expensive, potentially boosting American competitiveness but also fueling domestic inflation. For investors, it impacts the value of foreign assets when converted back to dollars and influences commodity prices, often leading to higher prices for dollar-denominated goods like gold and oil. Furthermore, for those deeply invested in cryptocurrencies, a weaker dollar environment can sometimes be seen as a bullish signal for digital assets, as investors seek alternatives to traditional fiat currencies to preserve purchasing power or gain exposure to growth assets. BofA‚Äôs analysis moves beyond surface-level observations, delving into the intricate mechanics of market positioning to uncover where the ‚Äòsmart money‚Äô is truly leaning. They argue that the July strength was likely driven by short-term tactical moves or unwinding of extreme short positions, rather than a fundamental shift in the dollar‚Äôs long-term trajectory. This distinction is vital for anyone trying to navigate the complex currents of the global currency trends . Decoding Forex Positioning : What BofA Sees in the Data At the heart of BofA‚Äôs forecast lies their meticulous examination of forex positioning . But what exactly is this? In essence, it refers to the net long or short positions held by large speculative traders in the currency futures market, as reported by bodies like the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). These positions reflect the collective bets institutional investors and hedge funds are making on the future direction of various currency pairs. BofA‚Äôs methodology often involves analyzing the Commitment of Traders (COT) report, a weekly publication detailing these positions. When a large number of speculative traders are net long a particular currency (meaning they expect it to rise), it can sometimes be a ‚Äòcontrarian‚Äô signal. Why? Because if too many participants are already on one side of the trade, there are fewer new buyers to push the price higher, and any small negative news can trigger a cascade of selling as these crowded positions are unwound. Conversely, if traders are heavily net short, it suggests the currency might be oversold and due for a rebound. BofA‚Äôs recent findings highlight that despite the dollar‚Äôs brief rally, speculative positioning suggests that the market remains structurally short on the dollar against key currencies. This indicates a deeply ingrained expectation of continued USD pressure among sophisticated market participants. Here‚Äôs a simplified look at what this positioning might imply: EUR/USD: Large net long positions in the Euro suggest a continued belief in Euro strength against the dollar, reinforcing the outlook for dollar weakness. USD/JPY: While there might be tactical shifts, persistent speculative short positions in the Japanese Yen against the dollar could be seen as an opportunity for a Yen rebound, further contributing to dollar depreciation. GBP/USD: Similar to the Euro, significant net long positions in the British Pound signal a conviction that Sterling will outperform the dollar. This persistent forex positioning , where major players are betting against the dollar, is a strong indicator for BofA that the July strength was merely a blip. It implies that the structural factors driving dollar weakness are still very much in play, and the market is primed for further depreciation. What Does This Mean for the US Dollar Outlook ? Based on their forex positioning analysis, BofA‚Äôs US Dollar outlook remains predominantly bearish for the medium to long term. This isn‚Äôt just about speculative bets; it‚Äôs underpinned by several fundamental economic and policy factors that continue to weigh on the dollar. Key drivers contributing to this anticipated weakness include: Interest Rate Differentials: While the Federal Reserve has been aggressive in its rate hikes, other major central banks are also catching up or maintaining hawkish stances. If the interest rate differential narrows or even reverses, it reduces the attractiveness of dollar-denominated assets. Inflation Dynamics: Persistent inflation in the US, even as the Fed tries to tame it, can erode the purchasing power of the dollar, making it less appealing globally. Fiscal Deficits and Debt: The US continues to run substantial fiscal deficits, adding to its national debt. While not always an immediate concern for currency markets, long-term fiscal unsustainability can put downward pressure on a currency. Global Economic Recovery (or Divergence): If other major economies demonstrate stronger or more stable recovery paths compared to the US, capital may flow out of the dollar and into these regions, strengthening their currencies. Geopolitical Developments: While sometimes leading to safe-haven demand for the dollar, prolonged geopolitical tensions or shifts in global alliances can also encourage diversification away from the dollar. The temporary strength observed in July could be attributed to various factors such as short-term risk aversion, a brief period of robust US economic data, or even a technical rebound from prior overselling. However, BofA emphasizes that these are unlikely to override the more entrenched factors influencing the US Dollar outlook . The bank‚Äôs conviction is that these underlying pressures will reassert themselves, leading to continued dollar depreciation. Navigating Global Currency Trends Beyond the Dollar A weakening dollar doesn‚Äôt exist in a vacuum; it profoundly influences global currency trends and the relative strength of other major currencies. When the USD pressure intensifies, it often implies strength for other major currencies, particularly the Euro, Japanese Yen, and British Pound, and potentially a broader rally in emerging market currencies. Consider the ripple effect: Euro (EUR): As the largest component of the Dollar Index (DXY), the Euro often moves inversely to the dollar. A weaker dollar typically translates to a stronger Euro, especially if the European Central Bank maintains a hawkish stance or European economic data surprises positively. Japanese Yen (JPY): The Yen, often seen as a safe-haven currency, can benefit from dollar weakness, particularly if global risk sentiment improves or if the Bank of Japan shifts its ultra-loose monetary policy. British Pound (GBP): The Pound‚Äôs performance against a weaker dollar will depend heavily on the UK‚Äôs domestic economic stability, inflation trajectory, and the Bank of England‚Äôs policy decisions. Emerging Market Currencies: A weaker dollar generally provides a tailwind for emerging market currencies. It makes dollar-denominated debt cheaper to service and encourages capital inflows into higher-yielding developing economies. The concept of ‚Äòde-dollarization‚Äô also plays a role in these global currency trends . While not an overnight phenomenon, growing discussions and actions by various countries to reduce their reliance on the US Dollar for trade and reserves can contribute to its long-term depreciation. This shift, driven by geopolitical considerations and the desire for greater financial autonomy, adds another layer to the bearish US Dollar outlook . Furthermore, the interplay between commodity prices and currency movements is crucial; a weaker dollar often supports higher commodity prices, which in turn can strengthen the currencies of commodity-exporting nations. Key BofA Insights for Investors and Traders The BofA insights derived from their detailed forex positioning analysis offer valuable guidance for investors and traders navigating the current market environment. Their core argument is clear: the market is positioned for continued USD pressure , and any rallies should be viewed with skepticism. Here are some key takeaways from BofA‚Äôs perspective: Fade USD Rallies: BofA suggests that temporary periods of dollar strength should be seen as opportunities to ‚Äòfade‚Äô or sell into, rather than buy into. This implies taking short positions on the dollar during its rallies, anticipating a return to its downward trend. Favor Non-Dollar Assets: Given the bearish US Dollar outlook , investors might consider increasing their exposure to non-dollar denominated assets, including international equities, bonds, and commodities, particularly those priced in currencies expected to strengthen against the dollar. Monitor Central Bank Divergence: The divergence in monetary policy between the Federal Reserve and other major central banks will be a critical factor. BofA‚Äôs insights suggest that central banks adopting more hawkish stances or whose economies show greater resilience could see their currencies strengthen against the dollar. Structural vs. Tactical: It is crucial to distinguish between structural trends (long-term, fundamental) and tactical moves (short-term, speculative). BofA emphasizes that the current dollar weakness is a structural phenomenon, making short-term strength unsustainable. These BofA insights are not just academic; they have practical implications for portfolio construction and trading strategies. For instance, a trader might look to go long EUR/USD or GBP/USD on dips, while an investor might allocate more capital to European or Asian markets, anticipating better returns when converted back to a weakening dollar. Challenges and Nuances: Is the Path Clear for the Dollar‚Äôs Decline? While BofA‚Äôs analysis presents a compelling case for continued USD pressure , it is important to acknowledge that financial markets are inherently unpredictable. Several factors could challenge or alter this bearish US Dollar outlook : Unexpected Economic Surprises: A sudden and significant acceleration in US economic growth, coupled with declining inflation, could lead to a reassessment of Fed policy and strengthen the dollar. Global Risk-Off Events: Major geopolitical crises or a severe global economic downturn could trigger a renewed flight to safety, with the dollar temporarily regaining its safe-haven appeal, irrespective of underlying forex positioning . Policy Shifts: Unexpected shifts in monetary or fiscal policy from the Federal Reserve or other major central banks could dramatically alter currency dynamics. Market Reflexivity: If the bearish consensus on the dollar becomes too crowded, it could ironically trigger a sharp short squeeze, leading to a temporary dollar rally as traders rush to cover their positions. Therefore, while BofA insights provide a robust framework, market participants must remain agile and continuously monitor incoming data and events that could influence global currency trends . Actionable Insights for Navigating a Weaker Dollar Environment For investors and traders, understanding the anticipated USD pressure is only the first step. The real value lies in converting this knowledge into actionable strategies: Diversify Currency Exposure: Consider holding a portion of your portfolio in non-dollar denominated assets or stablecoins pegged to other major currencies if available. This can hedge against dollar depreciation. Focus on Export-Oriented US Companies: A weaker dollar makes US exports more competitive, potentially boosting the earnings of companies with significant international sales. Consider Commodities: Historically, a weaker dollar tends to be bullish for dollar-denominated commodities like gold, oil, and industrial metals, as they become cheaper for holders of other currencies. Review International Investments: If you have investments in foreign markets, a weakening dollar could enhance your returns when those foreign currency gains are converted back to dollars. Strategic Forex Trading: For active traders, this environment presents opportunities to go long on major currencies like EUR, GBP, or JPY against the dollar, or to consider shorting the dollar against a basket of currencies. Staying informed about global currency trends and the nuanced communications from central banks will be key to making informed decisions in this evolving landscape. Conclusion: Adapting to the Persistent USD Pressure BofA‚Äôs analysis of forex positioning paints a clear picture: despite temporary bouts of strength, the underlying forces driving USD pressure remain firmly in place. The bank‚Äôs insights suggest that the US Dollar outlook points towards continued weakness, influenced by a complex interplay of interest rate differentials, fiscal policies, and broader global currency trends . This isn‚Äôt just a technical forecast; it‚Äôs a fundamental assessment of the dollar‚Äôs position in the global financial ecosystem. For investors, traders, and businesses, recognizing this anticipated depreciation is crucial. It calls for strategic adjustments, from diversifying currency exposure to rethinking investment allocations and hedging strategies. While no forecast is infallible, the depth of BofA insights into market positioning provides a compelling framework for understanding the likely path ahead for the US Dollar. As the financial landscape continues to evolve, staying attuned to these expert analyses will be vital for navigating the currents of currency markets and making robust financial decisions.

That precise nature, however, has also led to numerous crashes in the past, so traders should be wary when dealing with them and not follow and invest blindly. From $22.8K to $2.48M in just 3.5 months ‚Äî a 109x return! This trader spent $22.8K to buy 27.86M $TROLL 3 months ago, sold 1.28M for $16.2K and still holds 26.57M $TROLL ($2.48M). With $TROLL ‚Äòs recent surge, his position has flipped over 100x ‚Äî nearly $2.48M in profit!‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/VqfyXTJKtd ‚Äî Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 5, 2025 This particular example of substantial ROI comes from the meme coin TROLL. Currently, the asset has a market capitalization of just over $100 million, placing it within the top 500 alts by that metric. Based on the Solana network, it‚Äôs a meme coin inspired by the online trolling culture, designed for ‚Äúentertainment and community engagement with no intrinsic value.‚Äù Although the description acknowledges that it lacks intrinsic value, this hasn‚Äôt stopped certain traders from investing millions in it, transforming it into a highly popular lower-cap meme token. The anonymous trader spotted by Lookonchain spent just under $23,000 to accumulate 27.86 million coins over three months ago. They disposed of a small portion almost immediately, perhaps to cover a large part of their initial investment amid the first price pump, but now hold over 26.5 million tokens. Given TROLL‚Äôs massive surge in the past few months, as the asset is up by 570% since July 5 alone, the trader‚Äôs fortune has skyrocketed to be worth almost $2.5 million at the time of Lookonchain‚Äôs post. Such impressive returns are not isolated events in the cryptocurrency industry, especially in the meme coin space. You can find another similar example here . However, their notorious volatility has also resulted in painful price crashes that have wiped out millions in unrealized profit, such as this trader who went from a paper profit of $5.2 million to a $335,000 loss in months. Meme coins are inherently volatile as they tend to react more dramatically to bull runs and bear markets. Traders should not just FOMO in based on a few success stories. They need to do their own research and allocate funds to memes they are prepared to lose.

Potential resistance near $1.50 or beyond is discussed in some optimistic models, but failure to clear the $0.78‚Äì$0.82 range could keep ADA trading sideways in the $0.65‚Äì$0.80 band. Meanwhile, as investors explore the next wave of utility-based DeFi projects, attention is also turning toward emerging tokens like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Presale Embarks on Expansion with Launch of Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is performing excellent in presale, selling out the 5th round ahead of schedule. The project is now on round 6 valued at $0.035. Mutuum Finance is changing the face of the DeFi world by developing an extensible financial ecosystem with real-life applications. The presale has seen more than 14,800 token holders and has raised over $14 million. Grab Your Share of $100K in Tokens Mutuum Finance also launched a $100,000 giveaway . 10 winners will be given a $10,000 prize in Mutuum Finance tokens. The giveaway is a testament to how committed the project is to developing a long-term and faithful fan base. As part of another drive towards transparency and security, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has launched an Official Bug Bounty Program in collaboration with CertiK. The project team will be paying up to a maximum of $50,000 USDT to the participants for reporting likely vulnerabilities in the project. The goal of the bounty program is to obtain a suitable coverage of all the classes of vulnerabilities; it is segmented into the four classes of severity; i.e., critical, major, minor, and low. The project also reflects the team‚Äôs commitment towards security of ecosystem as well as confidence of investors. Innovative Two-Tier Lending Model Mutuum Finance is among the top DeFi projects whose customers fully retain control of their assets. The platform has a double-lending mechanism for provision of flexibility besides the efficiency that comprises Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer models. Peer-to-Contract utilizes an automatically executing smart contract which carries out the lending independently without intervention, programmed to act on the fluctuating market prices. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates intermediaries and carries a potential for lenders to be directly linked with borrowers. It is even more common in meme coins as it carries a potential to enjoy pre-specified conditions. Cardano (ADA) may reach $1.20 or higher if momentum holds, but growth remains gradual. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is seeing rapid interest from early investors. The token is in Phase 6 of presale at $0.035. Over $14 million has been raised, with more than 14,800 holders already involved. With a $100K giveaway, $50K bug bounty, and a dual-lending DeFi model, MUTM is quickly becoming one of the top cryptos to watch in 2025. Secure your token before the next price jump.

The turbulent July trading led to 47% volume growth, boosted by altcoins. July turned out to be a dynamic crypto month, leading Hyperliquid to a new record of monthly trading volumes. The month was the most dynamic to date, achieving up to $320B in cumulative volumes for the month. Hyperliquid saw its volumes increase by 47%, retaining the trend of regular monthly growth. Hyperliquid had its best month in history in terms of trading volumes, driven by increased interest in ETH trading. | Source: DeFiLlama . Hyperliquid also broke above $15B in total open interest for the first time in history. One of the main drivers for the growth was Ethereum, nearly doubling its open interest for the past month. Hyperliquid retains its top spot due to first mover advantage and the presence of whales and traders. For now, the exchange competes with centralized markets offering derivatives. Hyperliquid‚Äôs activity now makes up 11.9% of Binance‚Äôs derivative markets. However, Hyperliquid offers riskier trades with higher leverage, often attracting dramatic positions and public liquidations. Currently, Hyperliquid carries $597M in total value locked based on collaterals. In July, the exchange produced over $4M in daily fees regularly, with a minimum of $2M. The fee generation also reflected the unprecedented activity, with almost no idle days in July. Hyperliquid token HYPE struggles to retain positions One of the sources of activity for Hyperliquid is the native HYPE token. The asset traded at $38.54, extending its losing streak after almost touching $50. Most of the HYPE activity is still dependent on the native exchange, carrying over 40% of volumes. However, HYPE trading has shifted to other exchanges, changing the mechanism of price discovery. The ability to arbitrage HYPE on several markets has stopped its seemingly endless climb from the early months of the exchange. HYPE open interest is also down to a one-month low at $1.46B. Of that open interest, $1.1B is still on Hyperliquid. More than 70% of traders are long on HYPE, potentially inviting attacks against their positions. High-ranked traders still use Hyperliquid for exposure At the end of July, one of the most widely known traders, James Wynn, seemingly gave up on Hyperliquid. He has no positions open as of August 5, and recently claimed he would focus on meme tokens. Landed back in Monaco. Just ordered a double espresso martini while I wait for the crew to arrive early morning. Going full trench mode over next 2 months. X and perps has burnt me out. Won‚Äôt be tweeting much.

Trader Aguila Trades has switched to a 40X BTC short position, which is now once again threatened by liquidation. Aguila Trades lost over $35M in July, following risky positions as BTC shifted direction within hours. The White Whale recently appeared as a public trader with a more cautious and rational approach, closely watched for decisions and analysis. For now, the White Whale has managed to avoid dramatic liquidations. Hyperliquid‚Äôs position as a global hub for perpetual futures trading may be challenged by regulated exchanges offering a similar product. However, for now, Hyperliquid remains the only directly accessible platform, no-KYC market, settling directly on-chain. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

While Cardano governance grabbed headlines, Remittix confirmed its Q3 2025 wallet beta and teased major exchange listings alongside a $250,000 community giveaway. Cardano Treasury Vote Sparks Debate Cardano‚Äôs first direct treasury funding cleared 96 million ADA‚Äî about $71 million ‚Äîwith 74 % support. Cardano stakeholders backed an upgrade roadmap that includes Hydra for faster, low-fee transactions and Project Acropolis for modular node architecture. That vote marked a milestone in Cardano‚Äôs Voltaire era , as 200 delegates approved the proposal against just six opposing it. Cardano‚Äôs ADA price reacted quickly, jumping almost 3% to $0.74 on the news. Daily active addresses on Cardano have hovered around 240,000 since late July, signaling steady user engagement even as transaction costs remain near 0.34 ADA. Some community members argue Cardano needs smaller, targeted funding votes to maintain transparency, while others say the $71 million will finally equip Cardano for enterprise-grade performance. Remittix Wallet And Listing Buzz Steal Spotlight While Cardano leaders wrestled over funding, Remittix stole the show with a concrete rollout plan. Remittix confirmed its mobile wallet beta will launch in September 2025, enabling instant crypto-to-bank payouts in 30 countries. Alongside that milestone, Remittix hinted at upcoming listings on tier-1 centralized exchanges, promising liquidity for RTX holders. The project also launched a $250,000 giveaway that boosted wallet registrations by over 420 % this month. Here‚Äôs why Remittix stands out: Deflationary tokenomics designed for long-term growth Mass-market appeal beyond just the crypto crowd The 40 % token bonus is still live for early backers One of the few projects with product progress before TGE Global payout rails are already integrated and expanding Beyond those features, Remittix‚Äôs upcoming listings are drawing institutional interest, positioning RTX as a top entrant in PayFi. Exchange partnerships will enable seamless trading for ADA and BTC holders looking to diversify into real-world utility tokens. Positioning Portfolios for 2025 Gains Cardano‚Äôs $71 million treasury approval underscores its commitment to on-chain governance, yet the path from funding to feature delivery remains months away. Investors chasing Cardano rewards may now consider splitting exposure into projects with deliverables on the horizon. Allocating a slice to Remittix provides direct access to live payment corridors, imminent wallet utility and exchange liquidity.

If Bitcoin slides below that level, he plans to double his holdings. He already owns about 73 Bitcoins and wants to reach 100 by the end of the year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finds Support At $114K, But Rally May Stall Without New Drivers Kiyosaki Eyes August Dip According to Kiyosaki, August has a history of sharp dips in Bitcoin‚Äôs value. He wrote on X that he hopes for a crash below $90,000 so he can add more coins. He‚Äôs not shy about laying out his plan. He‚Äôll buy aggressively if that trigger hits.

He called them top voices on what might be ahead for global markets. He also praised sessions with Larry Lepard and other speakers at gatherings named ‚ÄúThe Collective‚Äù and ‚ÄúLimitless Financial Education Event.‚Äù He said these talks sharpened his view on why dips are opportunities, not disasters. Debt And Doubts At Fed Kiyosaki points fingers at Washington rather than crypto‚Äôs ups and downs. He blames a trillion-plus debt and ‚Äúincompetent PhDs‚Äù running what he calls ‚Äúthe SWAMP‚Äù in the Fed and Treasury. He sees those running US money policy as the real risk. In his view, fixing that mess beats worrying over Bitcoin‚Äôs swings. Based on reports, he still sees Bitcoin alongside gold and silver as shields against a possible financial crisis. He has warned his 2 million-plus X followers that holding cash is risky. His long-term price goal for Bitcoin is $250,000 before the end of 2025. Thinking big helps him stay calm when the market gets rocky. Calls For Calm Amid Volatility While Bitcoin topped about $120,000 last month, it‚Äôs since see-sawed between $112k and $113 last week. Kiyosaki says those shifts will make investors richer if they buy when others panic. He urges people to ignore negative headlines and focus on buying in a downturn. That‚Äôs his lesson for anyone listening. Related Reading: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Bleed Over $800 Million: Second‚ÄëLargest Exit Ever ‚Äì Details His strategy is simple.

Macroeconomic shifts often create ripple effects that extend across all asset classes, including digital currencies. Recent reports indicate a significant rise in Euro demand , primarily driven by increased positioning from major hedge funds. This development signals a robust shift in global investment patterns, prompting a closer look at what this means for the broader financial landscape and how it might indirectly influence your investment decisions. What‚Äôs Driving the Surge in Euro Demand ? The latest market intelligence points to a notable accumulation of long positions in the Euro by prominent hedge funds. This strategic move is not arbitrary; it typically reflects a calculated assessment of economic fundamentals and future policy directions. Several key factors are contributing to this heightened interest: Economic Resilience: Despite global headwinds, the Eurozone economy has shown signs of stability and resilience. Improved economic data, including industrial production and consumer confidence, may be bolstering investor confidence. Interest Rate Differentials: The European Central Bank‚Äôs (ECB) monetary policy stance, particularly its interest rate trajectory, plays a vital role. If the ECB maintains or signals a tighter monetary policy compared to other major central banks, it makes Euro-denominated assets more attractive, drawing in capital from hedge funds seeking higher yields. Geopolitical Stability: While Europe faces its share of challenges, perceived relative stability compared to other regions can make the Euro a safer haven for large institutional capital flows. Valuation Attractiveness: After periods of fluctuation, the Euro might be seen as undervalued, presenting an opportune entry point for funds with long-term investment horizons. These elements combine to create a compelling narrative for sophisticated investors, prompting them to allocate more capital to the single currency. Unpacking the Strategy of Hedge Funds Hedge funds are known for their agile and often aggressive trading strategies, aiming to generate high returns regardless of market direction. Their increased Euro exposure is a powerful indicator of their collective outlook on the currency‚Äôs future. When these large players build significant positions, it‚Äôs often based on extensive research and proprietary models that analyze a multitude of variables. Their strategies typically involve: Macroeconomic Analysis: Deep dives into GDP growth, inflation rates, employment figures, and trade balances across the Eurozone. Monetary Policy Expectations: Forecasting ECB decisions on interest rates, quantitative easing, and other tools that influence currency strength. Carry Trade Opportunities: Borrowing in a low-interest-rate currency and investing in a higher-interest-rate currency, profiting from the interest rate differential. The Euro‚Äôs yield potential, relative to funding currencies, could be a draw. Technical Analysis: Identifying price patterns and market trends to time entries and exits for maximum profitability. The collective action of these funds can create significant momentum in the forex market , influencing currency valuations and volatility for other participants. The Ripple Effect on the Forex Market An increase in Euro demand by hedge funds does not occur in isolation; it sends ripples across the entire global forex market . The Euro is one of the world‚Äôs most traded currencies, and its strength or weakness has broad implications. Here‚Äôs how this trend can affect other currency pairs: EUR/USD: A stronger Euro against the US Dollar can lead to a rise in this pair, reflecting a shift in capital flows and potentially influencing global trade dynamics. EUR/JPY & EUR/GBP: Similar trends might be observed against the Japanese Yen and British Pound, depending on the relative economic performance and monetary policies of Japan and the UK. Commodity Currencies: Changes in Euro strength can indirectly impact commodity currencies (like AUD, CAD) by influencing global trade and investor risk appetite. This institutional positioning can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, where initial buying spurs further buying, leading to sustained trends. However, it also introduces the potential for increased volatility if these positions are unwound quickly. Navigating the Landscape of Currency Trading For individual investors and traders, understanding these large institutional moves is crucial for informed decision-making in currency trading . While direct participation in the forex market might not be for everyone, the implications extend to other asset classes. Here are some considerations: Factor Impact on Euro Consideration for Traders ECB Policy Stance Hawkish = Stronger Euro Monitor ECB announcements and economic forecasts for future rate hikes or cuts. Eurozone Economic Data Positive = Stronger Euro Track key indicators like GDP, inflation (CPI), employment rates, and industrial output. Global Risk Sentiment Risk-on = Potentially Stronger Euro (as growth currency) Assess broader geopolitical events and global economic stability, as the Euro can act as a safe-haven or growth currency depending on context. US Dollar Strength Strong USD = Weaker EUR/USD The inverse relationship with the US Dollar is key; monitor US economic data and Fed policy. Understanding these dynamics can help in assessing broader market liquidity and the appetite for risk, which can cascade into other investment areas, including digital assets. Understanding Investor Sentiment : A Key Indicator? The actions of hedge funds are often considered a bellwether for broader investor sentiment . Their significant positioning in the Euro suggests a prevailing optimism regarding the Eurozone‚Äôs economic prospects and the currency‚Äôs stability. This collective confidence can create a positive feedback loop, attracting further investment from other institutional and retail players. However, it‚Äôs also important to remember that hedge funds can reverse their positions quickly. While their current stance indicates strong confidence, market conditions can shift rapidly due to unexpected geopolitical events, sudden policy changes, or unforeseen economic downturns. Monitoring these shifts in sentiment is vital for anyone engaged in financial markets. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the increase in Euro demand presents opportunities, it‚Äôs crucial to acknowledge potential challenges: Policy Reversals: An unexpected dovish shift by the ECB could undermine the Euro‚Äôs appeal. Global Economic Slowdown: A significant downturn in global growth could dampen Eurozone exports and economic activity, reducing Euro strength. Geopolitical Instability: Renewed conflicts or political crises within Europe could trigger capital flight. Market Volatility: Large institutional positions can lead to sharp price movements if unwound rapidly, increasing risk for less agile traders. Actionable Insights for Diverse Portfolios For investors, including those with a primary focus on cryptocurrencies, observing these trends in traditional finance offers valuable insights: Diversification: A strong Euro might indicate a robust traditional financial environment, prompting some to consider diversifying a portion of their portfolio into stable traditional assets or foreign exchange. Risk Assessment: Understanding the drivers of Euro strength can inform a broader assessment of global economic health and risk appetite, which can influence decisions in the crypto market. Macro Awareness: Staying informed about major currency movements helps in understanding the global liquidity landscape, which often impacts the flow of capital into and out of digital assets. The increased positioning by hedge funds in the Euro signals a powerful vote of confidence in the currency‚Äôs future. This surge in Euro demand reflects a complex interplay of economic fundamentals, monetary policy expectations, and strategic investment decisions. While this trend offers potential opportunities and insights into global investor sentiment , market participants must remain vigilant to evolving conditions.

While digital assets often capture headlines, the underlying currents of the forex market analysis frequently dictate broader liquidity, risk appetite, and capital flows that ultimately impact all asset classes, including cryptocurrencies. A recent pronouncement from Bank of America (BofA) offers a compelling insight into these traditional market dynamics, specifically their preference for the Swiss Franc over the Euro, particularly in the face of a developing bearish dollar view amidst significant yield curve shifts . This isn‚Äôt merely a technical trade recommendation; it‚Äôs a strategic call rooted in a deep assessment of global economic health, central bank policies, and geopolitical stability. For anyone navigating the complexities of modern markets, grasping the rationale behind such a stance provides a valuable lens through which to view potential shifts in investment sentiment and capital allocation. Understanding the Bearish Dollar View : Why the Greenback Faces Pressure The US Dollar, long considered the world‚Äôs primary reserve currency and a bastion of safety, is now facing increasing headwinds, leading to a bearish dollar view among some major financial institutions like BofA. Several factors contribute to this evolving outlook, signaling a potential shift in global financial architecture: Inflationary Pressures and Fed Policy: While the Federal Reserve aggressively hiked interest rates to combat inflation, concerns persist about the long-term impact on economic growth. A slowing economy, coupled with the potential for the Fed to pause or even pivot on its tightening cycle, could diminish the dollar‚Äôs yield advantage over other major currencies. Global Economic Rebalancing: As other major economies, particularly in Europe and Asia, show signs of stabilization or recovery, capital that flowed into the dollar during periods of global uncertainty might begin to seek opportunities elsewhere. This rebalancing of global growth prospects naturally reduces demand for the dollar. Fiscal Health and Debt Concerns: Ongoing debates surrounding government spending, rising national debt, and potential fiscal cliffs can erode investor confidence in the dollar‚Äôs long-term stability. While the US Treasury market remains deep and liquid, persistent fiscal challenges can introduce an element of risk premium. Geopolitical Shifts: The evolving geopolitical landscape, including discussions around de-dollarization in certain trade blocs, while nascent, adds another layer of complexity. Any move towards alternative reserve assets or currencies could incrementally diminish the dollar‚Äôs global dominance. These combined forces suggest that the dollar‚Äôs period of exceptional strength might be waning, prompting investors and institutions to seek alternative havens or growth opportunities in other currencies. The Allure of the Swiss Franc : A Safe Haven in Volatile Times Given a bearish dollar view , the Swiss Franc (CHF) emerges as a compelling alternative for institutions like BofA. Switzerland has long been synonymous with stability, neutrality, and financial prudence, qualities that are highly valued during periods of global uncertainty. Here‚Äôs why the CHF holds such appeal: Unwavering Stability: Switzerland boasts a robust economy, low unemployment, and a strong fiscal position. Its political neutrality and stable governance minimize geopolitical risks, making the CHF a classic ‚Äòsafe-haven‚Äô currency. When global markets face turmoil, capital often flows into the CHF, appreciating its value. Prudent Monetary Policy: The Swiss National Bank (SNB) is known for its independent and pragmatic monetary policy. Historically, the SNB has been proactive in managing inflation and maintaining price stability, which reinforces the currency‚Äôs purchasing power. Unlike some central banks facing intense political pressure, the SNB often prioritizes long-term stability. Low Inflation Environment: Switzerland has consistently maintained lower inflation rates compared to many other developed economies. This low-inflation environment preserves the real value of the Swiss Franc , making it attractive for investors seeking to protect their capital from inflationary erosion. Strong Current Account Surplus: Switzerland consistently runs a significant current account surplus, indicating that it exports more goods and services than it imports, and receives substantial income from foreign investments. This surplus reflects a healthy external financial position, providing fundamental support for the CHF. For BofA, the Swiss Franc represents a reliable anchor in a potentially turbulent global currency environment, offering a defensive posture against a weakening dollar and broader market volatility. The Euro vs Dollar Conundrum: Navigating Divergent Paths While the Euro vs Dollar pairing is one of the most actively traded in the forex market analysis , BofA‚Äôs preference for the Swiss Franc over the Euro against a weakening dollar highlights fundamental differences in their respective economic outlooks and policy challenges. Why is the Euro seen as less attractive than the CHF? Eurozone Fragmentation and Challenges: The Eurozone, a diverse bloc of 20 nations, faces inherent challenges related to economic disparities, varying fiscal policies, and structural issues. While the European Central Bank (ECB) has been tightening monetary policy, the region‚Äôs susceptibility to energy shocks, slower growth prospects, and potential sovereign debt concerns in some member states make the Euro a riskier proposition compared to the highly unified and stable Swiss economy. Energy Dependency: Europe‚Äôs significant reliance on imported energy, particularly in the wake of geopolitical conflicts, has made its economy vulnerable to price shocks and supply disruptions. This vulnerability can weigh on economic activity and investor confidence, dampening the Euro‚Äôs appeal. Interest Rate Differentials: Although the ECB has raised rates, the interest rate differential with the US and the perceived future trajectory of rate hikes might not be as compelling as the stability offered by the Swiss Franc . Furthermore, the SNB‚Äôs recent willingness to strengthen the CHF through interventions or rate hikes has provided additional support. Relative Safe Haven Status: While the Euro can attract some safe-haven flows during certain periods, it does not possess the same deep-seated, traditional safe-haven characteristics as the Swiss Franc . In times of extreme global stress, investors often flock to the most reliable and neutral currencies, and the CHF typically tops that list over the Euro. Therefore, when considering a move away from the dollar, the Euro presents a different risk-reward profile than the Swiss Franc , with BofA clearly leaning towards the latter‚Äôs perceived safety and stability. Deciphering Yield Curve Shifts : Impact on Currency Valuations One of the critical technical drivers behind BofA‚Äôs currency preference is the analysis of yield curve shifts . Yield curves graphically represent the yields of bonds with different maturities. Their shape provides vital clues about economic expectations and monetary policy, directly influencing currency valuations: Inverted Yield Curves: When short-term bond yields rise above long-term yields (an inverted yield curve), it often signals impending economic slowdowns or recessions. For the dollar, an inverted US yield curve can suggest that the Fed‚Äôs aggressive tightening is hurting long-term growth prospects, making the currency less attractive for foreign investment seeking long-term returns. Interest Rate Differentials and Capital Flows: Currencies tend to strengthen when their underlying bond yields are higher relative to other countries, attracting capital flows (the ‚Äòcarry trade‚Äô). However, when yield curve shifts indicate that future rate hikes are less likely or that growth is slowing, this yield advantage can diminish or even reverse. Impact on Dollar Strength: If US bond yields, particularly at the longer end, fall or become less attractive relative to other safe-haven bonds (like Swiss government bonds), it reduces the incentive for global investors to hold dollar-denominated assets. This directly contributes to a bearish dollar view . Swiss Yields as an Anchor: Switzerland‚Äôs stable economic environment and consistent monetary policy mean its bond yields often serve as a low-volatility benchmark. If US yields become more volatile or less appealing due to economic concerns, the steady, albeit lower, yields of Swiss bonds can become comparatively more attractive for risk-averse investors. Understanding these intricate yield curve shifts allows institutions to anticipate changes in capital flows and adjust their currency strategies accordingly, making them a cornerstone of sophisticated forex market analysis . Strategic Forex Market Analysis : BofA‚Äôs Rationale and Implications BofA‚Äôs decision to favor the Swiss Franc over the Euro in a bearish dollar view scenario is a prime example of comprehensive forex market analysis at play. It‚Äôs not a singular factor but a confluence of macroeconomic indicators, central bank policies, and market sentiment that informs such a strategic move. BofA‚Äôs Rationale in Summary: Defensive Positioning: With a weakening dollar outlook, BofA seeks currencies that offer stability and resilience. The Swiss Franc, with its traditional safe-haven status and strong fundamentals, fits this defensive strategy perfectly. Relative Strength: The Euro, despite being a major currency, faces more structural and cyclical headwinds than the Swiss Franc , including energy vulnerability and persistent economic divergences within the Eurozone. This makes the CHF a relatively stronger and safer bet. Yield Considerations: While Swiss yields are typically lower, the relative stability and predictable nature of Swiss bond markets, especially when juxtaposed against potentially turbulent US yield curve shifts and Eurozone economic uncertainties, enhance the CHF‚Äôs appeal for capital preservation. Macroeconomic Divergence: BofA‚Äôs analysis likely points to a divergence in economic trajectories and policy responses between Switzerland, the Eurozone, and the United States, making the CHF the most attractive option for hedging against broader market risks. Actionable Insights for Investors: Diversification is Key: This analysis underscores the importance of diversifying currency exposure, even for those primarily focused on equity or crypto markets. Currency fluctuations can significantly impact the real returns on international investments. Monitor Macro Trends: Pay close attention to central bank rhetoric, inflation data, and yield curve shifts in major economies. These macro trends often precede significant shifts in currency valuations and broader market sentiment. Safe-Haven Appeal: Understand the role of traditional safe-haven assets like the Swiss Franc and gold. In times of increased uncertainty or a bearish dollar view , these assets can offer a degree of protection. Beyond the Headlines: Look beyond simple interest rate differentials. Comprehensive forex market analysis involves assessing economic stability, fiscal health, geopolitical risks, and structural advantages of each currency. Conclusion: Navigating the Tides of Global Finance Bank of America‚Äôs strategic preference for the Swiss Franc over the Euro in a period marked by a bearish dollar view and significant yield curve shifts serves as a powerful reminder of the intricate connections within the global financial system. It highlights that even in an era dominated by digital assets, the foundational principles of forex market analysis remain critical for understanding capital flows and managing risk. This nuanced approach by a major financial institution signals a proactive move to position portfolios defensively against anticipated shifts in the global economic landscape. For investors, whether seasoned forex traders or newcomers to the crypto space, grasping these macro currents is essential. It enables a more informed decision-making process, helping to identify potential opportunities and mitigate risks as the financial world continues to evolve.

See Where You Stand,https://timestabloid.com/updated-xrp-ranking-ladder-released-see-where-you-stand/,"As XRP continues its recovery above $3, prominent community figure JackTheRippler (@RippleXrpie) has shared an updated XRP ranking ladder , categorizing XRP holders based on the number of tokens they own. The classification, posted on X, outlines ten levels, ranging from ‚ÄúWorm‚Äù at the lowest tier to ‚ÄúBig Whale‚Äù at the top. The New #XRP Ranking Ladder: Big Whale = +50,000 XRP Whale = +25,000 XRP Shark = +10,000 XRP Dolphin = +5,000 XRP Fish = +2,500 XRP Octopus = +1,000 XRP Crab = +250 XRP Shrimp = +100 XRP Worm = + 1 XRP ‚Äî JackTheRippler ¬© (@RippleXrpie) August 4, 2025 The rankings provide an informal snapshot of wallet stratification within the XRP ecosystem. It assigns symbolic creatures to different wallet sizes, beginning with the smallest level, ‚ÄúWorm,‚Äù representing just 1 XRP, and topping out with ‚ÄúBig Whale,‚Äù denoting ownership of 50,000 XRP or more. The term whale is often used to refer to the largest investors in the market , but JackTheRippler splits this category into two sections. With XRP trading at $3.08 at the time of the post, the Big Whale position carries a minimum market value of $154,000. The next category, labeled ‚ÄúWhale,‚Äù corresponds to 25,000 XRP, or approximately $77,000 in value. Tiers in the Ranking Ladder The ladder narrows sharply between categories. ‚ÄúShark‚Äù holders possess 10,000 XRP, valued at $30,800, while ‚ÄúDolphin‚Äù wallets contain 5,000 XRP, equal to $15,400. From there, the levels fall to ‚ÄúFish‚Äù at 2,500 XRP ($7,700), ‚ÄúOctopus‚Äù at 1,000 XRP ($3,080), and ‚ÄúCrab‚Äù at 250 XRP ($770). Smaller holders are designated as ‚ÄúShrimp‚Äù with 100 XRP ($308) and ‚ÄúWorm‚Äù at the bottom with a single XRP worth just $3.08. The scale highlights the disparity in XRP accumulation across wallets. It also adds context to discussions around liquidity and market behavior, particularly as XRP attempts to reclaim and consolidate gains above $3 following its brief dip below that psychological threshold . We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Joining the Top Ranks of XRP Holders Although the ranking ladder isn‚Äôt tied to any official XRP mechanism, it carries relevance for understanding the market structure itself. By assigning clear XRP amounts to each tier, it offers a straightforward reference point for holders to gauge their relative position. However, a recent analysis of the XRP rich list revealed that market participants need a much more substantial investment to join the top ranks of token holders . To join the top 1%, investors would need 50,637.37 XRP, which sits slightly above the minimum threshold for Big Whales. Climbing further, investors will need over 359,000 tokens to join the top 0.1%, and over 5.73 million tokens to join the top 0.01%. The latest data shows that only 663 wallets are in this exclusive club, but with whale accumulation on the rise , more wallets may soon join the top ranks.

The alert warns against total fund loss and exposure to fraud risks. SEC identifies ten crypto platforms operating without registration The Philippines SEC identified ten unregistered platforms continuing crypto-asset services to Filipino residents. OKX and Bybit lead the list with full accessibility and active marketing. Both exchanges maintain websites accessible in Philippines with promotional campaigns targeting locals. MEXC, KuCoin, Bitget, Phemex, and CoinEx are also available in the Philippines. These platforms have ongoing promotions across the country‚Äôs borders. Bitmart and Poloniex are still available but have no ongoing promotional activities at the time. Kraken rounds out the list maintaining both accessibility and marketing presence. The commission warns this list remains non-exhaustive with other violators existing. Additional platforms offering similar services without registration face identical legal risks. SEC Memorandum Circular No. 4 and No. 5 Series of 2025 mandate registration. The SEC CASP Rules took effect July 5, 2025 covering all participants. Regulations tie up operators of crypto-asset trading platforms or intermediation services. Following the last geo-blocking enforcement action by Binance, the SEC is systematically pursuing the remaining exchanges. The commission discovers platforms in comparable situations conducting unauthorized activities. Such operators offer buying, selling, and derivatives trading without a license. All identified platforms lack SEC license, registration, or authorization for Philippine operations. Their unauthorized actions violate Philippine securities laws creating legal vulnerabilities. The commission prepares enforcement measures against continued violations. Unregistered platforms expose Filipino investors to fund loss Unregistered crypto exchanges expose Filipino investors to total loss of funds according to SEC. The commission warns users have no legal recourse whenever something goes wrong. Unregistered platforms expose investors to market manipulation and fraud scams. Identity theft is a serious issue when dealing with unlicensed cryptocurrency services and exchanges. Unregistered services do not have proper security controls in place to safeguard user personal information. Lack of regulation means greater exposure to all sorts of criminal behavior. Money laundering and terrorist financing risk heightens to a significant extent by unregistered crypto-asset platforms. Virtual Asset Service Providers require robust controls under the Philippine Anti-Money Laundering Act. Customer due diligence, reporting suspicious transactions, and recordkeeping become obligatory requirements. Unregistered platforms operate with inadequate AML systems offering drastic vulnerabilities on a routine basis. Philippine regulators have no means of tracking these parties for compliance with financial regulation. The Financial Action Task Force regularly flags these problems for international attention. Cross-border illicit finance risk imperils the integrity and reputation of the country‚Äôs financial system. Gray-listing issues are raised due to ongoing direct public access to unregulated cryptocurrency platforms. The commission cautions against reputational damage to the Philippines abroad. Filipino investors should not invest or trade via unregistered platforms whatsoever. Care should be exercised as regards crypto promotions done by social media and influencers. Filipino targeted mobile apps should be verified before interacting or investing. SEC threatens enforcement actions including website blocking The Philippines SEC will take legal and regulatory action against violators independently. Commission enforcement includes issuing Cease and Desist Orders to stop operations. Website and application blocking requests target unregistered platforms serving Filipino users. Criminal complaints filing under SRC and FCPA creates serious legal consequences. The commission coordinates with global platforms including Google, Apple, Meta, and TikTok. Unauthorized marketing activities face removal through international platform cooperation efforts. Other appropriate enforcement actions remain available as the commission deems necessary for violations. The regulatory body operates under statutory mandate protecting investors and market integrity. Enforcement occurs either through commission initiative or public complaints submitted. Filipinos should report unauthorized crypto-asset offerings to designated SEC email addresses. The investor alert pursues SEC‚Äôs statutory mandate protecting investors from unauthorized activities.

Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 88.87 trillion. It is important to note that 80.59 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk‚Äôs supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights? How high will BONK go in 2025? Let‚Äôs get into the BONK price prediction for 2025 and beyond.

Bonk price analysis gives a bearish prediction regarding the ongoing market events. The coin‚Äôs value has decreased to $0.00002519 in the past 24 hours. At the same time, the cryptocurrency has lost up to 6.92 percent today. Technical indicators do not favor any side of the market, but the price charts project a bearish market scenario for the day. Is Bonk a good investment? After its launch in December 2022, Bonk quickly gained traction. Being on the Solana blockchain, it triggered a surge in SOL‚Äôs price due to Bonk‚Äôs unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.000207, which is approximately 681% more than its current price, making it a good investment to consider. However, it is advised to do your own research and conduct expert opinion before investing in the highly volatile meme coin market. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a portion of its value over the last 24 hours. Today, its price decreased to $0.00002519. The overall bearish trend in the market moved Bonk‚Äôs price in a negative direction, resulting in the recent correction. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk‚Äôs strongest current resistance level is $0.00003541. Over the last few days, BONK saw intense selloff below this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.00005835 by the start of 2026. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by the end of 2026. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin‚Äôs market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan‚Äôs review of the meme coin, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.000207 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price. Recent news/opinion on Bonk Bonk announced in a post that active on-chain holders of BONK tokens are inching closer to 1 million. Bonk also claimed that it is the largest community on Solana.

Bonk historic price sentiment Bonk price history. Source: Coingecko In December 2022, Bonk was launched with a price of $0.0000001487 and made history by making a surge of more than 30% in SOL tokens. Bonk cryptocurrency quickly climbed into the top 100 by market cap, reaching $0.0000034 per coin on January 5, 2023, according to crypto market records. However, by March 2023, the price of the Bonk token had fallen from $0.0000004134, losing substantial value. In June 2023, Bonk‚Äôs price did not experience much action, and it gradually decreased to $0.0000001927 in September 2023. In October 2023, Bonk started to see bullish sentiment, with the price reaching $0.0000005518, which eventually reached $0.00002445 on December 15, 2023. Bonk closed 2023 with a price tag of $0.00001407, significantly higher than the price at the start of the year but almost 50% down from the highest price point of 2023. Bonk hit key highs in 2024, including $0.00003771 in March and an all-time high of $0.00004115 in May, before dipping to $0.0000223 in August.

The token later rebounded and is currently trading at $122 at the time of writing, per CoinMarketCap data . LTC has been showing strong upward momentum since April, with bulls predicting a possible $140 mark in the coming months. LTC‚Äôs rally comes amid a broader market pullback and Bitcoin facing rejection below $116K. The trend signals strong bullish momentum and potential for further upside. Litecoin is up 11.6% on a weekly trading chart, with its 24-hour volume skyrocketing past 200%. What is Driving LTC Price? CoinGate data revealed that litecoin processed 14.5% of all crypto payments in July 2025. The altcoin has surpassed USDC and TRON to become the second-most used crypto after Bitcoin, it noted. Additionally, over 40 million transactions occurred on LTC in 2025 alone. This means that rising payment adoption directly increases LTC‚Äôs utility and buy-side demand. Besides, Polymarket odds for a Litecoin ETF approval in 2025 jumped to 81%, adding a bullish impact on the coin. Further, Bloomberg analysts have assigned a 90% chance of eventual ETF approval. That said, the regulatory environment remains favorable, with the CFTC classifying Litecoin as a commodity. With Grayscale‚Äôs LTC Trust already holding $180M in Litecoin, the ETF approval on the horizon would unlock institutional capital. Last month, MEI Pharma announced a $100 million private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction to add Litecoin into its corporate treasury. Market Watchers Say Litecoin Would Hit $150 According to a crypto commentator, Rain, LTC would hit a price target of $150 after witnessing a strong rise since April. ‚Äú$150 is the nearest target, with big moves likely to come.

This remarkable surge, reported by Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock), marks the first time in history that digital asset transactions involving stablecoins have reached such a monumental figure. It highlights the growing reliance on these digital currencies for various financial activities within the blockchain ecosystem. What is Driving This Record Stablecoin Volume? Stablecoins are a crucial component of the broader crypto market, designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This stability makes them ideal for trading, lending, and payments, avoiding the volatility often associated with other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Several factors likely contributed to this historic surge in stablecoin volume : Increased Trading Activity: With market movements, traders often use stablecoins as a safe haven or as a base currency for quick entry and exit from volatile assets. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Growth: The DeFi sector heavily relies on stablecoins for lending, borrowing, and yield farming protocols. As DeFi adoption expands, so does the demand for and use of stablecoins. Cross-Border Payments: Stablecoins offer a faster and often cheaper alternative for international remittances compared to traditional banking systems. Institutional Interest: Growing interest from institutional players in the digital asset space is also contributing to larger transaction sizes and overall digital asset volume . The Impact of Surging On-Chain Stablecoin Volume This record-breaking on-chain stablecoin volume signifies more than just large numbers; it reflects the increasing utility and integration of stablecoins into the global financial landscape. It suggests a maturing market where digital assets are being used for practical applications beyond speculative trading. The dominance of major players like Tether (USDT) and USDC in this volume is also noteworthy. While specific breakdowns aren‚Äôt detailed in the initial report, it‚Äôs widely known that Tether consistently processes a significant portion of stablecoin transactions. This consistent high volume underscores their pivotal role in facilitating liquidity and transactions across various exchanges and DeFi platforms. Furthermore, the data points to a growing comfort level among users and businesses with conducting substantial transactions on blockchain networks. This trust is vital for the long-term adoption of decentralized finance and digital currencies. Are There Challenges Amidst Record Digital Asset Volume? While the surge in digital asset volume is positive, it also brings certain considerations. Regulatory scrutiny around stablecoins remains a key topic globally. Policymakers are keen to ensure consumer protection, financial stability, and anti-money laundering compliance. Potential challenges include: Regulatory Clarity: The lack of a clear, unified global regulatory framework can pose hurdles for widespread institutional adoption. Centralization Concerns: While stablecoins operate on decentralized blockchains, their issuance and redemption processes are often centralized, leading to questions about audits and reserves. Market Volatility Impact: Although stablecoins aim for stability, extreme market events can still test their peg, as seen with some algorithmic stablecoins in the past. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the continued growth and stability of the stablecoin market. As the ecosystem matures, we can expect more robust frameworks and greater transparency from issuers. What Does This Mean for Crypto Stablecoins Going Forward? The impressive July figures for crypto stablecoins indicate a strong trajectory for their future. They are no longer just a niche product but a foundational layer for much of the crypto economy. Their efficiency and accessibility are driving real-world utility, from facilitating international trade to enabling innovative financial services. This trend suggests that stablecoins will continue to be a cornerstone of the digital economy, bridging the gap between traditional finance and the blockchain world. As technology evolves and regulatory environments adapt, the utility and volume of stablecoins are likely to expand even further, paving the way for a more interconnected and efficient global financial system. The record-breaking monthly on-chain stablecoin volume in July is a powerful testament to the expanding utility and adoption of digital assets. It underscores the vital role stablecoins play in providing liquidity, facilitating transactions, and enabling innovation across the decentralized finance landscape. This milestone sets a promising precedent for the future growth and integration of blockchain technology into everyday financial activities. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is on-chain stablecoin volume? A1: On-chain stablecoin volume refers to the total value of stablecoin transactions that occur directly on a blockchain network within a specified period, in this case, a month. Q2: Why did stablecoin volume reach a record high in July? A2: The record high was driven by increased trading activity, growth in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), use in cross-border payments, and growing institutional interest in the digital asset space. Q3: How do stablecoins contribute to the crypto market? A3: Stablecoins provide stability in a volatile market, serving as a reliable medium for trading, lending, borrowing, and facilitating quick transfers without the price fluctuations of other cryptocurrencies. Q4: What are the main challenges facing stablecoins? A4: Key challenges include the need for clearer regulatory frameworks, concerns over the centralization of some stablecoin issuance, and the potential impact of extreme market events on their peg. Q5: Is Tether the only major stablecoin driving this volume? A5: While Tether (USDT) is a dominant player and processes a significant portion of stablecoin transactions, other major stablecoins like USDC also contribute substantially to the overall on-chain stablecoin volume.

Adding to the uncertainty are cooling institutional demand and further geopolitical tensions following Trump‚Äôs August 4 threat of tariffs on India in response to the South-Asian country‚Äôs continued purchases of Russian oil . BTC price prediction To see where Bitcoin might be by the end of the month, Finbold‚Äôs AI prediction agent used multiple LLMs to generate an average forecast for improved accuracy while incorporating momentum-based indicators into its context. You can experiment with the existing prompts or create your own. Try here now. To make its prediction, the AI analyzed a number of technical indicators, including moving average convergence/divergence ( MACD ), Relative Strength Index ( RSI ), stochastic oscillators, and 50-day moving averages (MA). According to the results, Bitcoin is in for a period of downturns, with the average predicted price sitting at $108,417, implying a 4.88% downside from the current price of $113,974. PBTC stock AI price prediction. Source: Finbold Of the three LLMs used in the prediction, ChatGPT-4o was the most optimistic, with the projected price of $110,000, which suggests a downside of -3.49%. Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Gemini 1.5 Flash 002 were slightly more bearish , the former predicting a price of $108,250, suggesting a -5.02% loss, and the latter setting the price at $107,000, implying a -6.12% downside. Bitcoin August price potential As mentioned, institutional flows, evolving on-chain dynamics, and U.S. regulatory changes are all painting an increasingly complex picture when it comes to Bitcoin.

Still, a lot of uncertainty remains following the Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs (SEC) decision to delay the approval of the politically sensitive Truth Social ETF until September 18. On the other hand, the CME FedWatch Tool currently sees a 92% probability of a September rate cut, which could lead to increased demand and prices.

The retest of the $3 resistance triggered a volume surge of more than 110 million XRP traded, which is more than triple the daily average. What Fueled the Volume Surge? Institutional and retail demand, especially from South Korea, where trading volumes on Upbit alone soared past $95 million, made XRP the most traded asset. XRP cleared several intraday resistance bands at $2.87, $2.92, and $2.97, helping to validate the breakout. Technical Breakdown & Resistance Outlook Resistance continues to be held firmly at the $3.00‚Äì$3.03 zone, with all eyes clued to whether XRP will gain notable momentum to be able to surge to the key breakout zone of $3.12 to $3.14. A sustained move above this resistance zone could open the door to an increase to the recent all-time high (ATH) of $3.65 and beyond. Meanwhile, support is now anchored around $2.97‚Äì$2.92, with lower layers at $2.85, $2.80, and as low as $2.65 if weakness intensifies. Notably, some of the key momentum indicators , such as the relative strength index (RSI) and exponential moving averages (EMAs), are showing mixed reactions. On one hand, the short‚Äëterm trend remains bullish, but signs of overextension and minor fatigue have emerged. Broader Catalysts Behind the Rally Regulatory optimism is rising as the Ripple vs. SEC settlement, expected by August 15, nears. Ripple is reportedly ready to pay a $125 million fine and drop appeals, with the SEC likely to settle in response, fueling bullish market sentiment. Furthermore, Ripple‚Äôs expanding ecosystem, driven by rising institutional adoption of its stablecoin RLUSD, is fueling increased trading inflows and market interest. Conclusion XRP‚Äôs recent tripling in trading volume reflects strong institutional and retail conviction around the $3 resistance zone. Its ability to hold and build above that threshold in coming days with legal clarity and momentum working in its favor could mark the start of a broader breakout phase.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|MARKET|REGULATION|ASIA,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-05 09:55:51

However, while its price remains stable around $0.74 amid the ongoing evolution of decentralized finance, more ambitious investors are turning their attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . This promising token has already surged over 250% from its earliest presale levels and remains attractively priced at just $0.035, positioning itself as a compelling alternative for those seeking stronger returns in 2025. Cardano (ADA) Holds Steady at $0.74 Cardano (ADA) has stabilized at ~$0.74, showing resilience despite a 12.88% weekly decline, trading with a 24-hour volume of $713.54 million, down 30.7%, per CoinGecko data. The price holds above the 26-period EMA ($0.74), with support at $0.69 and resistance at $0.85. A bullish MACD crossover and RSI at 45 suggest fading bearish momentum, hinting at a potential rebound. On-chain activity remains robust, with 38.5k active addresses and $57 million in exchange outflows, signaling whale accumulation. The Cardano Card launch by Emurgo, enabling global ADA spending via Apple Pay, and the upcoming Hydra rollout boost long-term prospects. However, a drop in active investors to 20,000 and competition from faster Layer-1 chains like Solana pose risks. A break above $0.78 could target $1, while failure to hold $0.69 may see $0.66. ADA‚Äôs DeFi Roots vs MUTM‚Äôs Yield Revolution While Cardano has focused heavily on building a reliable smart contract ecosystem, its approach to DeFi monetization has been cautious and gradual. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will offer a distinctly reward-focused model that appeals to yield hunters. At the heart of MUTM‚Äôs value proposition will be its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) lending system, which will enable users to deposit stablecoins such as USDC, USDT, or DAI, as well as blue-chip cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH) or Solana (SOL), and receive yield-bearing mtTokens at a 1:1 ratio. These mtTokens will appreciate over time thanks to interest accrued in the lending pools. For example, an investor who deposits $10,000 worth of ETH at a 7% annual percentage yield will earn $700 in passive income each year. On top of that, staking these mtTokens in the smart contracts will allow users to earn additional rewards paid in MUTM tokens‚Äîcreating a powerful double-income mechanism that will elevate returns beyond the capabilities of many existing DeFi platforms, including those built on Cardano. This dual-reward approach will redefine DeFi 2.0. Where ADA‚Äôs ecosystem continues to grow steadily, MUTM will prioritize tangible yield generation and incentivize long-term participation‚Äîdrawing a broader base of active users once the platform fully launches. Presale Uptick and Roadmap to Launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently navigating Phase 6 of its presale, maintaining a discounted price of $0.035. Over 14,900 holders have collectively propelled the project to raise upwards of $14 million, with 10% of Phase 6‚Äôs 170 million token allocation already claimed by savvy investors. This momentum signals strong confidence ahead of the upcoming price increase to $0.040 in Phase 7, a 15% jump that makes acting now essential before the token approaches its anticipated $0.06 listing price. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs four-phase roadmap reflects a carefully planned trajectory to success. Phase 1 laid the groundwork by designing the platform, conducting security audits, and implementing an AI helpdesk. Currently, Phase 2 is focused on building the core lending pools, deploying the mtToken system, and rigorous user interface testing. Phase 3 will usher in the beta launch, including bug bounty programs and stablecoin integration, further enriching the platform‚Äôs utility. Finally, Phase 4 aims to deliver full exchange listings on major platforms, Layer-2 scalability for faster, cheaper transactions, and a buyback mechanism that will support token price stability and growth. Lending and Borrowing The lending functionality within Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is built for flexibility and efficiency. Borrowers can access loans up to 75% of their deposited collateral‚Äôs value‚Äîmeaning a $5,000 deposit in Avalanche (AVAX) can unlock a $3,750 stablecoin loan. The absence of fixed repayment schedules allows borrowers to manage their debts according to individual financial needs, while lenders enjoy continuous passive income from interest earned. The platform‚Äôs Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model complements this by enabling borrowers and lenders to negotiate terms directly, ideal for higher-risk assets or longer loan durations. Smart contracts automate the process, minimizing counterparty risk and maximizing transparency. This approach is especially attractive to seasoned DeFi users looking for tailored lending solutions and enhanced yield opportunities. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)‚Äôs commitment to security is validated by a rigorous CertiK audit, achieving a high Token Scan score of 95 and a Skynet rating of 78. Additionally, a $50,000 bug bounty program invites community participation to uncover vulnerabilities, strengthening overall platform safety. To encourage early adoption, a $100,000 giveaway rewards ten lucky winners with $10,000 in MUTM tokens each, underscoring the project‚Äôs dedication to growing a loyal and engaged user base. Early investors, such as those who bought into Phase 1 at $0.01, are already enjoying more than 3X their initial investment. With the beta launch, Layer-2 scaling solutions, and upcoming listings on top-tier exchanges on the horizon, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to multiply gains by three to five times post-listing, driven by real utility and growing market presence.

33767162,[object Object],1754388007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Why The XRP Lawsuit Has Gone Silent ‚Äî What Lawyers Know That You Don‚Äôt,https://bitcoinist.com/why-the-xrp-lawsuit-has-gone-silent/,"Nearly five years after the Securities and Exchange Commission charged Ripple Labs with conducting an unregistered securities offering, the XRP lawsuit is quiet once again. The hush has prompted a fresh round of conjecture on X, but interviews and public statements by two veteran securities lawyers‚ÄîAustralian solicitor Bill Morgan and former SEC San Francisco Regional Director Marc Fagel‚Äîoffer a straightforward procedural explanation: the Commission has not yet completed the internal vote required to abandon its own appeal. When Will The Quiet End In The XRP Lawsuit? Ripple scored a partial victory in July 2023 when US District Judge Analisa Torres found that programmatic sales of XRP on exchanges did not constitute securities transactions, while institutional sales did. Both sides noticed appeals in October 2024. Ripple withdrew its cross-appeal in June 2025 and has already placed the agreed-upon $125 million civil penalty in escrow, but the SEC‚Äôs appeal remains technically alive, leaving the judgment non-final and the injunction in place. The agency‚Äôs posture toward crypto changed sharply after President Donald Trump elevated former commissioner Paul Atkins to the chair earlier this year. ‚ÄúWe will make sure the next chapter of financial innovation is written right here in America,‚Äù Atkins declared in an August 4 X post unveiling ‚ÄúProject Crypto,‚Äù a commission-wide rulemaking agenda to replace the prior regulation-by-enforcement strategy. His broader regulatory d√©tente has fueled hopes that the Commission will simply drop the XRP lawsuit and cement Judge Torres‚Äôs retail-market ruling as binding precedent. Against that backdrop, pro-XRP lawyer Bill Morgan asked his followers whether Atkins ‚Äúcan actually get the SEC commissioners to vote to dismiss the Appeal ‚Ä¶ and his SEC attorneys to file papers dismissing the Appeal.‚Äù Morgan noted, ‚ÄúNo, conspiracy. But let‚Äôs just have them get it done.‚Äù He points to August 15 as ‚Äúa procedural checkpoint‚Äù when both sides must file a joint status report with the Second Circuit. ‚ÄúI hope we will have an update soon on or before 08/15,‚Äù he writes. Marc Fagel, who spent two decades inside the agency and now lectures at Stanford Law School, responded that the case is stalled on a single mechanical step: ‚ÄúThere was a (very small) chance the original approval vote encompassed dismissal even without the modification of the injunctive order. Given the delay, seems pretty clear that was not the case, so we‚Äôre presumably still waiting on another vote.‚Äù Fagel further explained on X that the prior Commission, during failed settlement talks this spring, did authorize dismissal in principle, but only contingent on modifications to the proposed injunctive order. ‚ÄúThey already voted to do this (in the context of the failed settlement) before Atkins even arrived. So it seems pretty obvious where this is going. They just have to get through the standard internal approval process,‚Äù Fagel noted. Because Judge Torres rejected the negotiated injunction, a second formal vote appears to be necessary. Contrary to social-media speculation, the Senate‚Äôs August recess and the still-pending CLARITY Act have no bearing on that purely administrative process. As Fagel put it, ‚ÄúThey will file to dismiss as soon as the commissioners vote to do so.‚Äù What Happens On‚ÄîOr After‚Äî15 August The upcoming status report is not a hard deadline to abandon the appeal; it merely obliges each party to declare whether further briefing is necessary. If the SEC remains divided‚Äîor if staff review drags‚Äîthe agency can seek another sixty-day extension. Yet insiders see little appetite for prolonging a fight that the new chair has publicly framed as regulatory overreach. Should the Commission vote in the coming days, dismissal notices would be filed almost immediately. That would lift the injunction, release the $125 million penalty to the US Treasury, and end the one remaining appeal that prevents XRP‚Äôs legal status from crystallizing.

Research into EU interns has found that Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) investments fall sharply in 2025. According to the research, the cryptocurrency preferences of young EU investors have changed dramatically. Bitcoin and Ethereum, once dominant forces among young investors, have lost their appeal, while XRP has emerged as the new dominant force. According to the research, only 12% of EU trainees currently own Bitcoin, a sharp decline from 63% in 2022. 82% of respondents said they do not own any cryptocurrencies, up from 69% in 2024. Ethereum investment has seen a similar decline, with investment in Ethereum falling from 60% in 2022 to just 7% in 2025. While Bitcoin and Ethereum experienced sharp declines, XRP reversed the trend. According to the research, XRP was the only cryptocurrency to gain momentum, with ownership rising from 0% to 5%. This growth is likely due to XRP gaining greater regulatory clarity, as well as the massive surge that made headlines in the fourth quarter of 2024. *This is not investment advice.

Market share rebounded from 4.6% to 5%, sparking analyst attention on possible recovery. Traders watch mid-August SEC guidance that could shape XRP‚Äôs regulatory status and market outlook. Price Swings and Volume Changes Ripple (XRP) jumped past the $3 mark in the last 24 hours, briefly reaching $3.05 before easing to $3.02. The token is up 1% for the day but remains 4% lower for the week. Earlier, it spiked from $2.92 in a quick rally that lifted it before traders locked in some gains. Roughly $4.25 billion worth of XRP changed hands over the same period. That is about 15% less than the previous day, showing trading activity cooled after the initial surge. Even with the decline, XRP stayed among the most traded large-cap digital assets. Market Share and Analyst Remarks XRP now represents 5% of the total crypto market. That share is a long way from the 30% it once held. Charts show the token recently bounced from a support level near 4.6% after briefly breaking above 5.5%. Buyers defended that level and kept the market share from sliding further. The $XRP Dominance chart is a sleeper no one‚Äôs talking about. At one point, XRP held 30% of the entire crypto market ‚Äî now it‚Äôs hovering just under 5%. That kind of drop-off doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs dead. It means there‚Äôs massive room for capital to rotate back in. With regulatory‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/2q2x86raGd ‚Äî CryptoPulse (@CryptoPulse_CRU) August 4, 2025 CryptoPulse, which monitors market flows, said the current level leaves space for capital to move back into XRP. A steady hold above 5% could open the way for a larger market share recovery. Analyst Crypto Rand added on X that XRP ‚Äúlooks ready to explode,‚Äù though he noted he is not usually a supporter of the token. Whale Selling and Regulatory Watch Blockchain data revealed that some large wallets sold during the mid-July rally, which took the asset to a new all-time high of over $3.6. These moves suggest that bigger holders used the spike to secure profits while retail and short-term traders were caught unprepared. Meanwhile, the next key moment for XRP could come in mid-August. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to give further guidance on whether the token is considered a security. Mainstream interest has also grown. A USA Today report described XRP‚Äôs potential for real-world use and said the US environment looks more favorable after the recent presidential election.

On-Chain Metrics Make a Strong Case,https://cryptopotato.com/200k-bitcoin-btc-this-year-on-chain-metrics-make-a-strong-case/,"Bitcoin has entered a technical correction phase after reaching an all-time high of $123,400 on July 14. The crypto asset is down by almost 7% as it currently trades near $114,000. The drop is attributed to macroeconomic pressures such as inflation and tariffs, bearish technical signals, and liquidation events. Data suggests that Q4 historically benefits Bitcoin, and after a strong July, bulls are hopeful for another breakout. Bitcoin‚Äôs Technical Dip CryptoQuant views the decline as primarily technical and said that the market is still in a broader price discovery cycle. This cycle, which reflects market attempts to determine Bitcoin‚Äôs fair value through supply and demand, could push the price toward the $200,000 level by the end of Q4 2025. BTC has traditionally seen strong performance in Q4, and current market conditions could help continue that seasonal pattern. Binance‚Äôs on-chain data reveals large stablecoin reserves. This points to a considerable amount of sidelined capital that could soon flow back into the market, potentially boosting Bitcoin and prominent altcoins like BNB. This, in turn, may set the stage for a potential altseason. The current reflexive relationship between Bitcoin and emerging treasury investors could aid its price discovery in Q4. But whether altcoins will follow suit remains uncertain amid growing market crowding. Nonetheless, institutional interest may further boost Bitcoin‚Äôs upward trajectory in the coming months. Adding to this narrative, Glassnode noted that Bitcoin‚Äôs $109K-$116K range is steadily filling during price dips, which reflects continued investor interest. The consistent staircase-like pattern suggests steady accumulation. Additionally, minimal selling between $118K-$120K means that investors in this range are largely holding, which indicates confidence in long-term price appreciation. Big Bets On Year-End Rally Several market watchers remain optimistic about a strong year-end comeback despite the current pullback. TeraHash, for one, recently predicted a price range of $130K-$150K by December, citing ETF inflows, potential Fed rate cuts, and upcoming regulatory clarity from the SEC and MiCA framework. Important catalysts include continued ETF inflows, Fed policy easing in September, and full implementation of Europe‚Äôs MiCA framework. Meanwhile, on-chain data shows surging mining difficulty and geographic expansion, while Hashrate-as-a-Service models attract institutions seeking exposure with less risk. Bullish projections also came from Fundstrat‚Äôs Tom Lee and American venture capital investor Tim Draper, who forecast $250K by year-end. Even more aggressive predictions from Charles Schwab and Mike Novogratz place Bitcoin at $1 million by the end of 2025. The post $200K Bitcoin (BTC) This Year?

While Toncoin‚Äôs value has climbed during a sluggish market, the newcomer XYZepe has posted even more impressive early returns. With its upcoming launch on the horizon, investors are watching closely to see if XYZepe can outpace established contenders. Demand for $XYZ Surges As Its Capitalization Hits the $15M Milestone XYZVerse ($XYZ), recently recognized as Best NEW Meme Project, is drawing significant attention thanks to its standout concept. It is the first ever meme coin that merges the thrill of sports and the innovation of web3. Unlike typical meme coins, XYZVerse offers real utility and a clear roadmap for long-term development. It plans to launch gamified products and form partnerships with big sports teams and platforms. Notably, XYZVerse recently delivered on one of its goals ahead of schedule by partnering with bookmaker.XYZ, the first fully on-chain decentralized sportsbook and casino. As a bonus, $XYZ token holders receive exclusive perks on their first bet. Price Dynamics and Listing Plans During its presale phase, the $XYZ token has shown steady growth. Since its launch, the price has increased from $0.0001 to $0.005, with the next stage set to push it further to $0.01. The final presale price is $0.02, after which the token will be listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges. The projected listing price of $0.10 could generate up to 1,000x returns for early investors, provided the project secures the necessary market capitalization. So far, more than $15 million has been raised, and the presale is approaching another significant milestone of $20 million. This fast progress is signaling strong demand from both retail and institutional investors. Champions Get Rewarded In XYZVerse, the community calls the plays. Active contributors are rewarded with airdropped XYZ tokens for their dedication. It‚Äôs a game where the most passionate players win big. The Road to Victory With solid tokenomics, strategic CEX and DEX listings, and consistent token burns, $XYZ is built for a championship run. Every play is designed to push it further, to strengthen its price, and to rally a community of believers who believe this is the start of something legendary. Airdrops, Rewards, and More - Join XYZVerse to Unlock All the Benefits Toncoin (TON) Source: TradingView Toncoin has shaken off its lull. Price now sits in the 3.24-3.81 band after a 5.81% rise in 7 days. The last 30 days show a sharp 30.24% leap, trimming the 6-month loss to 5.76%. Short bursts of buying are back on the chart. Both the 10-day and 100-day moving averages meet at 3.57, signaling a tight tug-of-war. Relative strength is 46.83 and stochastic is 50.85, both neutral. MACD at -0.00771 slips just below zero, hinting momentum has slowed. Resistance lines sit at 4.06 and 4.63, while supports rest at 2.93 and 2.36. If bulls clear 4.06, price could sprint another 10% toward 4.63; breaking that cap opens room for a 20% overall run from today‚Äôs level. Failure to hold 2.93 risks a slide of 10%-25% into the 2.36 safety net. The strong monthly climb and neutral gauges tilt the bias slightly upward, though range action may linger around 3.57 before a decisive move. Conclusion TON shows strong growth, but XYZVerse (XYZ) stands out as the first all-sport memecoin. Its unique sports and meme mix, ambitious growth goal, and early community-driven approach position XYZ as a potential market leader.

In this line, cryptocurrency trading analyst Master Ananda noted that this move could play out within weeks, as XRP remains in the early stages of its bull market, according to a TradingView post on August 4. As per the outlook, XRP recently found strong support just above the 0.618 Fibonacci level at $2.71, sparking an immediate rebound. A green daily candle reversed the drop and broke resistance, followed by another green candle that confirmed the bullish reversal. XRP price analysis.

With support confirmed and the 0.382 level at $2.87 holding firm, traders are now eyeing the next Fibonacci extension targets, first at $4.4948 (1.618 Fib extension), followed by the primary target at $6.2768 (2.618 extension). Ananda emphasized that this move is part of a broader 2025 bull market cycle, where bullish momentum is expected to persist. He added that while some traders may wait for further confirmation, the technical rebound and swift recovery already signal a resumption, and possible acceleration, of the bullish trend. XRP‚Äôs path to $4 Another bullish outlook was shared by pseudonymous crypto analyst Lord of Alts , who noted that XRP is on the verge of a major breakout. Technical charts show one of the largest bullish pennants in months, with the token holding firm above key support levels. XRP price analysis chart.

Mutuum Finance is at presale phase 6 at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the previous phase. Investors who buy now are guaranteed a 71.43% return on investment upon launch. Mutuum Finance presale has surpassed over $14 million and has been bought by more than 14,800 unique holders. As speculative eyes search for the next token to echo SHIB‚Äôs viral rise, Mutuum‚Äôs traction among early adopters, combined with its approach to decentralized lending, sets it apart from other emerging projects. Dual-Layer Decentralized Lending Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is an asset management and liquidity protocol that‚Äôs non-custodial. The protocol has a Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending platform whose main aim is to achieve flexibility and efficiency. Peer-to-Contract system utilizes the power of smart contracts to provide loans with minimal to no human involvement and the smart contracts modify freely according to the market by suggesting adjustable interest rates. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates middlemen and enables lenders and borrowers to directly communicate. The model is highly convenient for dealing with unstable assets like meme coins. Mutuum Finance Presale Enters Phase 6 Mutuum Finance is taking a lot of speed as its presale stages are ending in a rush. The project is currently in stage 6 of the presale for $0.035. Its next stage price will increase by 14.29% to $0.04. Going live at $0.06, investors in stage 6 are hoping to make a return on investment of 71.43%. Demand for investments is increasing with the project already more than $14 million and already having more than 14,800 token holders. Mutuum Finance Giveaways Mutuum Finance has initiated a $100,000 giveaway to grow its community. 10 investors have a chance to win $10,000 tokens of MUTM each. The giveaway does not only invite new investors on the platform, but it also demonstrates that the project is willing to go the extra mile in building a long-term and loyal user base. MUTM‚Äôs Peer-to-Contract lending uses a self-executing smart contract that conducts the lending automatically with no human intervention, programmed to respond to the change in market prices based on a floating rate of interest. Peer-to-Peer model eliminates the middlemen. It is even more common in meme coins because it has a possibility of having specified terms of a loan and flexibility based on the risk-bearing willingness of a user. Mutuum Finance Prepares to Enter Stablecoin Market with USD-Pegged Asset Mutuum Finance is developing a fully collateralized USD-pegged stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. The project is also audited by CertiK, a veteran blockchain security company. In addition to investors‚Äô assurance of code base transparency and integrity, the auditing process carried out ensures that the project will indeed develop a secure DeFi protocol. The project has launched a $50,000 USDT Bug Bounty Program with CertiK. The four types of vulnerabilities to be rewarded are categorized as critical, major, minor and low. Over $14 million has been raised by Mutuum Finance (MUTM), attracting more than 14,800 unique holders and signaling strong early momentum. Currently priced at $0.035 in presale phase 6, the token offers investors a potential 71.43% ROI by launch. The project stands out with its dual-layer decentralized lending protocol, upcoming USD-pegged stablecoin, CertiK audit, and a generous $100,000 giveaway to boost community engagement.

The message spread fast on social media, drawing fresh attention to Strategy‚Äôs massive crypto buys and Saylor‚Äôs bold forecasts for the token‚Äôs future. Aggressive Bitcoin Purchases Based on reports, Strategy snapped up an extra 21,021 BTC for about $2.46 billion at an average price of $117,256 per coin. That single deal lifted the firm‚Äôs stash to 628,791 BTC. At today‚Äôs levels, those holdings translate into roughly $71.4 billion on the balance sheet. Since January, Strategy has posted a 25% yield on its Bitcoin reserves, thanks to a steady climb in prices. Saylor‚Äôs purchase spree underlines his faith that Bitcoin will stay on an upward track. Bitcoin ‚Äî An Offer You Can‚Äôt Refuse. pic.twitter.com/XEWWt2ZTXu ‚Äî Michael Saylor (@saylor) August 4, 2025 Saylor isn‚Äôt shy about painting vivid pictures. He‚Äôs called Bitcoin ‚Äúa swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth.‚Äù Those lines aren‚Äôt from a tech paper; they‚Äôre poetic, almost mystical. He wants readers to feel that Bitcoin is more than code or money. He wants them to sense that it‚Äôs a force‚Äîone that can reshape how people save and spend. Soaring Corporate Holdings Strategy isn‚Äôt the only public company building up a giant crypto hoard. Companies like BlackRock‚Äôs iShares ETF and Grayscale‚Äôs trusts hold heavy slices of the total supply as well. Together, these big players control about a quarter of all coins in circulation. That level of concentration is unprecedented. A few years ago, no single institution held more than a fraction. Now, corporate treasuries and investment funds are major owners. Institutional interest has helped tame the crypto‚Äôs swings. Big buyers tend to stick around through rough patches, and their steady orders can plug gaps when smaller traders cut back. Still, packing so much into one asset carries risks. A sudden pullback could leave a huge mark on Strategy‚Äôs books. Paper gains can vanish in hours if sentiment turns. But, that‚Äôs another story. Bitcoin, The Ultimate Offer For Saylor, borrowing The Godfather line isn‚Äôt just flair. He sees Bitcoin‚Äôs fixed supply and rising demand as an offer too good to refuse.

(TSMC) announced the detection and eventual discovery of what seems to be a leak of proprietary data about its 2nm chips. The company disclosed that it had started legal proceedings against the affected employees, who were also fired. The top chipmaker revealed that the leaked data included sensitive information about the 2nm chip‚Äôs development and production. TSMC said the discovery was made during ‚Äúroutine monitoring,‚Äù and the leaked information could threaten national security. The company is set to begin mass production of these 2nm chips later this year. However, the impact of this latest development on this timeline is still unclear. TSMC also said it is unclear what the allegedly involved employees intended to do with the data obtained. It emphasized that investigations are ongoing into the data‚Äôs possible destination. The investigations also include examining the scope of the leak and whether other parties are involved. However, TSMC mentioned that the case is under ‚Äújudicial review,‚Äù although the High Prosecutors‚Äô Office of Taiwan had no comments. It promised to share details as events unfold. Wei claims copying TSMC‚Äôs tech is impossible C.C. Wei, TSMC‚Äôs Chairman and CEO, previously said duplicating the company‚Äôs technologies was impossible. He pointed out that the complicated process requires both development and production knowledge. Only TSMC, Rapidus, Samsung , and Intel are actively developing 2nm chip technology. The rest have quit the race. TSMC said it maintains a ‚Äúzero-tolerance policy‚Äù towards actions compromising trade secrets or their protection. The company is also against actions that could harm its interests. Such violations are strictly and decisively dealt with. TSMC promised to pursue the matter ‚Äúto the full extent of the law.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe will continue to strengthen our internal management and monitoring systems and will work closely with relevant regulatory authorities as necessary to protect our competitive advantage and operational stability.‚Äù ‚Äì TSMC The company added that it remains committed to safeguarding its employees‚Äô shared interests and its ‚Äúcore competitiveness.‚Äù TSMC said it has a ‚Äúcomprehensive and robust monitoring mechanism‚Äù that allows it to identify issues early and swiftly take steps to mitigate the risks. Taiwan protects ‚Äònational core critical technologies‚Äô The Supreme Prosecutors‚Äô Office‚Äôs Intellectual Property Division said on August 5 that a former TSMC employee surnamed Chen was suspected of illegally obtaining trade secrets. A current employee surnamed Wu was also involved in the scheme, but he has been dismissed. Investigations launched in July allowed the court to ‚Äúdetain and deny‚Äù contact with all suspects for violating the National Security Act. Taiwan‚Äôs 2022 National Security Act protects trade secrets linked to ‚Äúnational core critical technologies‚Äù from unauthorized access, use, reproduction, or disclosure. Breaching the Act can result in criminal charges. Prosecutors from the Intellectual Property Division (IPD) asked the Ministry of Justice Investigation Bureau‚Äôs investigation station in Hsinchu City to summon and arrest all involved parties. They also directed the Northern Mobile Workstation and the Information Security Workstation to search the workplaces and residences of all suspects between July 25 and July 28. The Intellectual Property Division stated that it is illegal to know or possess trade secrets of Taiwan‚Äôs core technologies. It added that the current ‚Äúcriminal suspicion‚Äù is ‚Äúserious‚Äù because it is the first in the country. The IPD‚Äôs office disclosed that Chen and his alleged criminal partners would be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted ‚Äúin accordance with the law.‚Äù Get seen where it counts.

However, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading relatively flat, altcoins are leading the charge. BTC traded above $115,000 late on Monday but lost momentum and fell to an intraday low of $114,198 before moving to its current level of $114,380. Ethereum (ETH) continued to push higher, briefly crossing $3,700 before moving to its current level. The world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency is up almost 4% in the past 24 hours, trading around $3,671. Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is up over 2% and is trading around $3.05, having reclaimed the crucial $3 level. Solana (SOL) is up over 4% as it attempts to reclaim $170, while Dogecoin (DOGE) is up over 3%, trading around $0.206. Cardano (ADA) is up nearly 3% and Stellar (XLM) is marginally up, trading around $0.409. Chainlink (LINK) , Litecoin (LTC) , and Polkadot (DOT) also registered substantial increases. However, Hedera (HBAR) and Toncoin (TON) bucked the bullish trend, registering notable declines. CFTC To Allow Spot Crypto Trading On Registered Exchanges The US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is launching an initiative to allow spot crypto trading on CFTC-registered futures exchanges. The new initiative is part of its ‚Äúcrypto sprint‚Äù initiative to implement recommendations from President Donald Trump‚Äôs Working Group on Digital Assets Markets, which includes 18 recommendations. CFTC Acting Chair Caroline Pham stated, ‚ÄúThe CFTC is full speed ahead on enabling immediate trading of digital assets at the Federal level in coordination with the SEC‚Äôs Project Crypto. There is a clear and simple solution the CFTC can implement now.‚Äù A spot crypto contract will resemble a futures-style, listed contract that will mirror spot crypto prices and trades on a CFTC-registered designated contract market (DCM). The Working Group‚Äôs crypto policy report requested that the CFTC outline how cryptocurrencies may be considered commodities, how registration requirements would apply to decentralized finance market participants, and provide guidance to CFTC-regulated entities. CFTC Urged To Investigate Quintez Kalshi Links A US Congresswoman has urged the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to investigate nominated chair Brian Quintenz over his association with Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction platform. Democratic Representative Dina Titus asked CFTC acting chair Caroline Pham to open an inquiry to determine if Quintenz has violated CFTC policies, any applicable federal statute, or his ethical pledge. ‚ÄúSpecifically, I request that you release all relevant communications from or about Mr. Quintenz related to prediction markets and event contracts. As you are aware, Mr. Quintenz is currently on the board of Kalshi and holds stock options in the company.‚Äù Voting to confirm Quintenz‚Äôs nomination has been repeatedly delayed. Last week, the Senate Agriculture Committee pulled a planned hearing for the nomination at the request of the White House. Trump Bitcoin Advisor Wants To Create $200M PAC David Bailey, an entrepreneur and Bitcoin advisor to President Donald Trump, is looking to raise $200 million for a political action committee (PAC) to advance Bitcoin‚Äôs interests in the US. Bailey, founder of Bitcoin Magazine and BTC Inc., was an advisor during President Trump‚Äôs campaign and is considered one of the key figures behind the President‚Äôs Bitcoin pivot. Bailey stated in a post on X, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned a lot about politics and how the game is played this year. I‚Äôm thinking about raising a $100m-$200m PAC (anchored by Nakamoto) to advance Bitcoin priorities. I have my ideas, but what do you think should be part of the Bitcoin voter platform?‚Äù PACs in the US raise funds through donations and donate the money to specific candidates, parties, and causes. The proposed PAC will focus on helping the Bitcoin (BTC) price reach $10 million and position the asset for the long term. SEC Issues Guidance To Treat Stablecoins As Cash Equivalents The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has issued guidance allowing certain dollar-backed stablecoins as cash equivalents on corporate balance sheets. The guidance is part of a broader initiative streamlining cryptocurrency regulation. Stablecoins qualifying under this guidance must meet strict criteria and have full backing through Treasury bills or cash, maintain a 1:1 peg to the dollar, and guarantee redemption. However, the guidance excludes algorithmic stablecoins, yield-bearing tokens, and any asset not tied to the US Dollar. The new guidance removes an accounting hurdle that prevented traditional financial institutions from participating in the stablecoin ecosystem. It will also improve corporate reporting transparency and simplify how companies with crypto exposure can manage their accounting. The SEC guidance aligns with recent policy changes, including the GENIUS Act. Crypto Funds End 15-Week Streak As Market Sentiment Dampens Crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) ended the previous week in the red, as their 15-week inflow streak came to an end. Investor sentiment turned bearish due to a hawkish Federal Reserve after the conclusion of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. Crypto EPTs registered $223 million in outflows last week, according to a report by CoinShares. ETPs made a strong start to the week, but worsening investor sentiment reversed market trends in the second half of the week. The report added, ‚ÄúGiven we have seen US$12.2bn net inflows over the last 30 days, representing 50% of inflows for the year so far, it is perhaps understandable to see what we believe to be minor profit taking.‚Äù Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 1% at $114,202. The flagship cryptocurrency faced substantial selling pressure last weekend and dropped to a low of $111,971 on Sunday as bearish sentiment peaked. Despite this, it recovered to reclaim $114,000 and end the day at $114,311, up almost 2%. Buyers retained control on Monday as BTC started the week in positive territory but lost momentum during the current session. BTC‚Äôs latest price action has divided analysts over its next move. Some analysts believe the price could recover towards $116,000, while others are concerned about a bigger decline. These concerns are in sharp contrast with the belief that BTC‚Äôs retracement is over and that the price is preparing to push to new all-time highs. Crypto Trader Daan Crypto summarized on X, ‚Äú$BTC has continued its streak of setting the high or low within the first week of the month. We‚Äôll have to see if August is going to be any different. What we do know is that the current monthly high ($116K) has a very low chance of holding as we've never seen a monthly wick high this small in the past 4 years.‚Äù The analyst concluded that volatility has been insufficient so far compared to price moves earlier in 2025. ‚ÄúThe current move from high to low is also just ~3.6%. There's also a very high likelihood we'll make a larger move this month. The smallest monthly low-to-high difference within a month is about 10% for BTC in its past 4 years. This, of course, says nothing about direction.‚Äù BTC has steadily declined since last week, and market analysts have raised alarm bells about weak liquidity and inconsistent institutional demand. According to a popular CryptoQuant analyst, BTC began experiencing a sharp decline in its liquidity inventory ratio in mid-July, as the ratio fell to levels that indicated only three months of available supply on major trading platforms. While reduced supply generally leads to upward price pressure, the analyst highlighted a lack of new demand, which left markets susceptible to a price drop. ‚ÄúWhen liquidity is thin and there is no consistent buying activity from large investors or ETFs, even small sell orders can lead to significant price drops.‚Äù The analyst hinted that weak markets could persist unless fresh demand enters the market. BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.31% on Sunday and settling at $119,398. However, it was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.11% to $118,069. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price registered a marginal drop and settled at $117.925. It fell to an intraday low of $115,772 on Wednesday before recovering to reclaim $117,000 and settle at $117,788, ultimately dropping 0.12%. Sellers retained control on Thursday as BTC fell 1.69% and settled at $115,800. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below $114,000 and settling at $113,365. The price continued declining on Saturday, dropping almost 1% and settling at $112,601. BTC fell to an intraday low of $111,971 on Sunday. However, it recovered from this level to reclaim $114,000 and settle at $114,311, ultimately registering a 1.51% increase. BTC started the current week in positive territory, rising 0.69% to reclaim $115,000 and settle at $115,097. The current session sees BTC down almost 1%, trading around $114,193. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) led the crypto market‚Äôs upward push on Monday as BTC traded flat. The world‚Äôs second-largest cryptocurrency rebounded on Sunday, rising over 3% to $3,500, reversing some of last week‚Äôs losses. Bullish sentiment intensified on Monday as ETH rose over 6% to reclaim $3,700 and settle at $3,721 before losing momentum during the ongoing session. Despite the drop, ETH is up over 2% over the past 24 hours. ETH‚Äôs Monday rally can be attributed to BitMine‚Äôs massive purchase of 208,137 ETH. The purchase took the value of the firm‚Äôs ETH holdings above $3 billion, pushing the altcoin‚Äôs value past $3,700. It also helped BitMine widen its lead over SharpLink Gaming, the second-largest publicly-listed ETH holder. BitMine is the fourth-largest crypto-treasury company in the world, behind only Strategy, MARA Holdings, and Twenty One Capital. Growing institutional interest and confidence in ETH have been key drivers of the altcoin‚Äôs rally. BitMine‚Äôs rapid accumulation strategy has led to fierce competition among Ethereum treasury firms. Tom Lee, who heads the treasury company, stated, ‚ÄúBitMine moved with lightning speed in its pursuit of the alchemy of 5% of ETH, growing our ETH holdings to over 833,000 from zero 35 days ago. We have separated ourselves among crypto treasury peers by both the velocity of raising crypto NAV per share and by the high liquidity of our stock.‚Äù ETH ended the previous weekend up 3.52% at 3,875. However, it lost momentum on Monday, falling over 2% to $3,797. The altcoin experienced volatility on Tuesday as buyers and sellers struggled to establish control.

But while the corporate giant stacks coins like a vault on steroids, retail investors are focusing their attention elsewhere. But while the corporate giant stacks coins like a vault on steroids, retail investors are turning their attention elsewhere. A new crypto project is catching fire ‚Äì one with memes, momentum, and a whole lot of buzz ‚Äì called Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) . Let‚Äôs examine Metaplanet‚Äôs latest move more closely and why savvy investors might be watching $HYPER next. Metaplanet Buys $52M Worth of Bitcoin, Nears $2B in Holdings Metaplanet has doubled down on its Bitcoin strategy by purchasing 463 more $BTC at an average price of $119,5K per coin. That brings its total holdings to 17,595 $BTC, valued at roughly $1.8B. The Tokyo-based firm now ranks among the top corporate Bitcoin holders globally, sitting just behind giants like Strategy. This move is a strategic effort to safeguard shareholder value amid rising inflation and a weakening yen. Metaplanet uses a metric called ‚Äò$BTC Yield,‚Äô which monitors the growth of its Bitcoin holdings relative to share dilution to evaluate its performance. Between July 1 and August 4, the company posted a $BTC Yield of 24.6%. In Q2 alone, it recorded an impressive 129.4% $BTC Yield with 5,237 $BTC gained ‚Äì worth about $604M at that time. It‚Äôs a bold, crypto-forward strategy that‚Äôs paying off and transforming how corporate treasuries are managed. Bitcoin Hyper: The Layer 2 That‚Äôs Supercharging Bitcoin Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is the fastest Layer 2 ever built for Bitcoin. It uses the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) to deliver sub-second transactions and near-zero gas fees. This high-performance infrastructure brings smart contracts, meme coins , dApps, and DeFi directly into the Bitcoin ecosystem.

The network is designed to scale, grow, and support the next generation of Bitcoin-native apps and communities. Whether you‚Äôre launching a DAO or trading a meme coin, this is where it all happens. It‚Äôs fast, it‚Äôs meme-ready, and it‚Äôs finally making Bitcoin feel modern. Why $HYPER Is Getting So Much Attention The crypto presale has already passed $7M, and right now you can still buy $HYPER for just $0.012525. Investors are getting in early to earn staking rewards, airdrops, governance rights, and priority access to new launches within the Bitcoin Hyper ecosystem. Bitcoin Hyper combines strong fundamentals with high-speed infrastructure and a cross-chain design that links Bitcoin with Ethereum, Solana, and more.

Recently, Cango, a well-known Chinese automotive trading platform, made waves with its impressive foray into Bitcoin mining . This strategic pivot has clearly paid off, as the company announced a substantial increase in its monthly BTC output. Their July performance highlights a powerful growth trajectory in the competitive crypto mining landscape. Cango‚Äôs Impressive Bitcoin Mining Performance Cango‚Äôs recent announcement has certainly captured the attention of the cryptocurrency community. According to a PR Newswire press release, the company successfully mined 650.5 BTC in July. This figure represents a remarkable 45% increase compared to the 450 BTC mined in June. Such a surge in production demonstrates Cango‚Äôs growing operational efficiency and commitment to its new venture in digital assets . This significant leap in output follows Cango‚Äôs strategic acquisition of $256 million worth of Bitcoin mining machines from Bitmain. This investment clearly positioned the company for substantial growth, allowing them to scale their operations rapidly and effectively. The results from July underscore the potential of well-executed investments in high-capacity mining hardware. What Fuels Cango‚Äôs Growth in Crypto Mining? Many factors contribute to a mining operation‚Äôs success, and Cango‚Äôs recent performance is a testament to several key elements: Strategic Hardware Acquisition: The substantial investment in Bitmain‚Äôs state-of-the-art mining machines provided Cango with cutting-edge technology, crucial for maximizing hash rate and efficiency. Operational Scaling: Rapid deployment and optimization of these new machines allowed Cango to quickly ramp up their mining capacity. Market Timing: Entering the crypto mining space with a large-scale investment during a period of evolving market conditions can yield significant returns if managed correctly. This robust performance by Cango provides a compelling case study for other companies considering diversification into the blockchain and cryptocurrency sectors. It shows that with the right infrastructure and strategic planning, significant gains in digital assets are achievable. Impact on the Digital Assets Landscape Cango‚Äôs success in Bitcoin mining is not just a win for the company; it also sends a strong signal to the broader market. As more established companies, even those from traditional sectors like automotive trading, venture into crypto, it lends further credibility and institutional interest to the space. This trend can potentially lead to: Increased mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Greater investment in mining infrastructure globally. Further innovation in mining technology and energy efficiency. The company‚Äôs ability to boost its BTC production so dramatically in a single month is a clear indicator of the potential profitability and scalability within the professional crypto mining industry. It highlights the ongoing evolution of business models embracing blockchain technology. Looking Ahead: Cango‚Äôs Future in Bitcoin Mining Cango‚Äôs July results set a high benchmark for its future operations.

Which is why efforts to do so are generally collaborative, pulling in expertise and experience from multiple areas. You need a network, of course, for traceability and security; a real-estate firm willing to fractionalize bricks and mortar into digital assets; and a marketplace that connects tokenized property with investors to facilitate round-the-clock trading. This collaborative approach is evident in an alliance that has ambitiously targeted tokenizing $10 billion of property in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). The dream team combines an RWA-focused Layer-1 blockchain (Mavryk), a global derivatives giant (MultiBank), a Dubai real estate company (MAG Group), and an institutional-grade custody leader (Fireblocks), with the quartet aiming to make make property ownership accessible to all. Although the on-chain real-world asset (RWA) market is already worth a cool $24.8 billion , that figure is just a fraction of crypto‚Äôs total $3.7 trillion market cap. It‚Äôs also a drop in the ocean when compared to the $226 trillion global real estate market. The expression ‚Äòwe are still early‚Äô has rarely been so accurate. Why Now? The maturation of the crypto market, led by bitcoin and ethereum but with dollar-pegged stablecoins also playing their part, has led institutions to explore what the Web3 world has to offer. Hence last year‚Äôs arrival of spot BTC ETFs and BlackRock‚Äôs tokenized fund BUIDL , the latter being the current largest tokenized RWA. The tokenization of real-world assets involves issuing digital tokens that represent ownership or a claim on an underlying asset ‚Äì bonds, treasuries, stocks, carbon credits, property, gold, credit, art, etc. Currently, there are around 340,000 RWA holders (up 21% in the last month) and 256 issuers, with action spread across top chains like Ethereum and Solana. A recent Bank of America report, meanwhile, notes rising investor interest in real-world assets. Hashkey CEO Dr. Xiao Feng believes China‚Äôs crypto re-engagement could focus on stablecoins and RWAs. It‚Äôs natural to ask ‚ÄòWhy now?‚Äô The truth is, the walls dividing tradfi from defi are coming down and legacy financial services companies now recognize blockchain‚Äôs disruptive potential. Crypto-native fintechs, meanwhile, are eager to bring institutional investors into their orbit by exposing them to Web3 products and services. Mavryk , a regulatory-compliant Layer-1 network, is the linchpin of the aforementioned deal to bring $10bn of luxury property on-chain. Unlike competitors rearchitecting their chains to jump on the RWA ‚Äòtrend‚Äô, Mavryk has been built from inception to serve this market. When its mainnet launches later this year, it promises to grant investors opportunities to secure tokenized stakes in multiple high-end properties in MAG Group‚Äôs portfolio, and even earn on-chain yield backed by this value. Fireblocks , which secures over $7 trillion across 100+ blockchains, will provide state-of-the-art custody services after recently joining the founding trio. Is Dubai the Epicenter of RWA Revolution? It is worth noting that the Mavryk-MAG-MultiBank-Fireblocks deal isn‚Äôt the only one centered in Dubai. A strategic partnership between the Dubai Land Department, Prypco, and Ctrl Alt Solutions could also see several billion dollars worth of property brought on-chain. Dubai‚Äôs crypto-friendly policies and public investment initiatives have made the Emirate a digital business hub, with disruptive tech high on the national agenda. Indeed, it is one of few places in the world with clear laws for buying property with cryptocurrency. Property, of course, is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to RWAs. However, it‚Äôs perhaps the best gateway for ordinary investors ‚Äì since even those who shy away from stocks appreciate the appeal of owning real estate. Little by little, we are progressing towards a future in which anyone can invest in real-world assets ‚Äì be it property or precious metals ‚Äì wherever they are. In time it‚Äôs even possible the RWA sector could ‚Äòeat‚Äô the crypto market that spawned it. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

This represents a dramatic rise compared to the 2021 bull market, when ETH traded at similar price levels but OI on Binance peaked at only $2.5 billion. Ethereum‚Äôs Market Is Heating Up In its latest analysis, CryptoQuant revealed that the current figure, nearly 3.5 times higher, highlighted the growing appetite for leveraged exposure in Ethereum‚Äôs market. Despite this surge in OI, funding rates, interestingly, remain neutral, indicating that traders are not yet heavily biased toward long or short positions. The lack of directional conviction hints at room for further buildup in positions without triggering immediate liquidation pressures. The increase in OI, paired with neutral funding, paints a picture of cautious but growing speculative interest. With the broader crypto market trending upward, these conditions may support a steady rally in the leading altcoin‚Äôs price, potentially accompanied by increased volatility. CryptoQuant said that the current setup is a constructive signal, and added that Ethereum has a high chance of continuing its bullish trajectory. The quiet accumulation of leveraged positions on Binance, absent extreme sentiment, may be laying the groundwork for the next phase of price expansion. As traders position themselves, Ethereum could be primed for a sharper move in the near term. Ethereum Defies Market Outflows Despite the broader market turbulence last week, Ethereum continued to attract investor interest and secured its 15th straight week of inflows with $133 million. While digital asset investment products saw net outflows of $223 million, the first in 15 weeks, Ethereum stood out for maintaining positive momentum. The week began with a strong $883 million in inflows but reversed sharply after hawkish signals from the FOMC and strong US economic data. Bitcoin bore the brunt of the risk-off sentiment and lost $404 million. Still, CoinShares said that the recent correction likely reflects profit-taking, not fading confidence, especially as Ethereum and select altcoins like XRP and Solana remained resilient.

The pseudonymous analyst known as Checkmate says in a new interview on the What Bitcoin Did podcast that a few dynamics are starting to materialize that indicate the current BTC bull run could be ‚Äúbulletproof.‚Äù Says Checkmate, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got the bear market recovery, where there‚Äôs a lot of PTSD. This is really 2023. Everyone was like fearing the ghost of Sam Bankman-Fried was going to come back, and we‚Äôre going back to zero. But we just never got that lower high, and it just kept drifting higher. Then we got the excitement phase, you start getting up towards the all-time high. I thought that we would‚Äôve moved into the euphoria phase already, because in past cycles we have, but I think we‚Äôre getting there. Look at the treasury company trend. Derivatives leverage is pretty much at an all-time high. We‚Äôre closing on like 5.8% of the Bitcoin market cap for futures and options. So it‚Äôs getting leverage. As I said, I‚Äôve had people call me saying, ‚ÄòHow do I lever up my Bitcoin to buy more Bitcoin?'‚Äù Checkmate notes that leaving a stair-stepping pattern and gaining ‚Äúserious momentum to the upside‚Äù will make the chart unsustainable and start bringing BTC ‚Äúcloser to a meaningful top.‚Äù Bitcoin is trading at $114,833 at time of writing.

Over the past several days, the exchange introduced new features, including Discount Buy and Binance Wallet (Web). Attention, Binance Users The world‚Äôs largest crypto exchange will perform wallet maintenance for USDC withdrawals via Ethereum (ETH), Polygon (POL), Arbitrum (ARB), Base (BASE), and Optimism (OP) networks on August 6 . To support the process, USDC withdrawals through the networks above will be halted on that day. The maintenance is expected to be concluded in two hours, and after that, all services will be resumed . Binance assured that the trading of tokens on the depicted networks will not be impacted and promised to handle all technical requirements involved for the users. It also said there will be no further announcements on the matter. The company regularly conducts such operations to enhance the overall user experience and ensure the seamless operation of its services. Last week, it paused all deposits and withdrawals due to a live upgrade on its wallet network infrastructure. Over the past several months, it briefly suspended services on the TRON, Cardano , and other networks because of similar efforts. Binance‚Äôs Latest Features The company frequently introduces new products to address ongoing market trends and provide additional services to its users. Just a few days ago, it unveiled Discount Buy ‚Äì a feature which allows clients to make advanced crypto purchases in markets with lower volatility. Included in Binance‚Äôs Earn portfolio, this product lets users lock in future buys at pre-set prices under market value, or collect a fixed APR if the trade isn‚Äôt carried out . ‚ÄúDiscount Buy is well-suited for users who anticipate limited price fluctuations and want to accumulate crypto at a discount without needing to time the market or monitor prices closely. It offers flexibility across investment scenarios, giving users more choices and opportunities in how they want to participate in the crypto market,‚Äù said Jeff Li, VP of Product at Binance. Earlier this week, the exchange introduced Binance Wallet (Web), which allows users to ‚Äútrade smart, fast, and securely, all without leaving their desktops.‚Äù A key feature of the offering is Secure Auto Sign (SAS) ‚Äì a new signing method that enables customers to approve transactions once and trade seamlessly for up to seven days, without repeated confirmations. The product is specifically designed for those who want to discover new meme coins, follow on-chain activities in real time, explore transaction history and token balances in one place, and access Alpha tokens. ‚Äú Binance Wallet (Web) was introduced to address desktop-specific needs. It offers more screen space, modular layouts, and faster multitasking for on-chain users who trade actively or monitor multiple signals. While the mobile app excels in portability, Binance Wallet (Web) enables plugin-free, browser-native trading with floating widgets and real-time data panels, all on a single page. It is ideal for meme coin discovery, wallet tracking, and strategy execution without tab switching,‚Äù the disclosure reads. Currently, the feature supports BNB Smart Chain and Solana. Clients of the exchange can instantly connect their account to Binance Wallet (Web) via QR code, with no additional setup required.

The Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (KBA) showed Tesla posted only 1,110 registrations in July. This marks a decline exceeding 55% compared with the same month last year. Year‚Äëto‚Äëdate through July, its German tally fell by nearly 58% to about 10,000 vehicles relative to the previous year‚Äôs performance. Last month, new Tesla sign-ups across major European markets decreased, even after the automaker unveiled a refreshed version of the Model Y. The company continues to contend with fallout from CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs political views , evolving regulatory challenges and intensifying rivalry from other brands. By comparison, Chinese automaker BYD recorded a surge in German registrations , reaching 1,126 in July, roughly five times its level of a year earlier. Through the first seven months, BYD‚Äôs volumes climbed to 7,449 cars, more than five times its total from the previous year. High costs slow rivals while Tesla bets on cameras and AI Making fully self-driving cars has turned out to be harder than expected. Steep expenses for essential components and stringent oversight have prompted competitors, including GM‚Äôs Cruise division, to scale back their ambitions. Rather than employing costly lidar and radar, Musk relies on cameras paired with AI, setting Tesla‚Äôs approach apart from rivals like Waymo and Zoox. Tesla initiated a limited beta of its self-driving taxi service in Austin this June, deploying roughly a dozen Model Y SUVs under the watch of onboard safety attendants. Musk said his EV firm has been ‚Äúsuper paranoid about safety‚Äù and is pushing to make service available to half the U.S. population within five months. The company is now awaiting approvals in several states. California‚Äôs Department of Motor Vehicles declined to comment on the potential effects of the Florida ruling, while Nevada and Arizona said they continue to review Tesla‚Äôs applications. Florida authorities had no immediate remark. Tesla faces further hurdles in expanding Robotaxi across U.S. A Florida court decision may impede Tesla‚Äôs introduction of its planned autonomous robotaxis. In a recent ruling previously reported by Cryptopolitan, jurors awarded roughly $243 million to relatives of two crash victims from a 2019 incident involving an Autopilot-enabled Model S. The verdict concluded that Autopilot had faults contributing to the fatal outcome. Tesla maintained that driver error was to blame and has announced plans to appeal. The outcome follows multiple federal inquiries and recall notices tied to incidents involving the company‚Äôs self-driving technology. Legal analysts caution that getting state regulators on board with a robotaxi rollout could take longer, potentially postponing Tesla‚Äôs goal to bring its service to half the U.S. population by the end of the year. ‚ÄúNow there‚Äôs essentially an opinion that some aspect of Tesla‚Äôs business is not safe and maybe the safety that the company advertises isn‚Äôt what it‚Äôs cracked up to be,‚Äù said Aaron Davis, a legal partner at a Washington firm. The standard Autopilot package manages vehicle pace, spacing and lane positioning on highways. The optional Full Self-Driving upgrade extends operation into urban areas, handling maneuvers such as turning and lane shifts. Analysts at Piper Sandler note the Florida decision doesn‚Äôt directly apply to the latest FSD iterations. Tesla has usually won or settled lawsuits over its driver-assistance system, but this case was different. In this incident, a Model S ran a stop sign and hit a parked Chevy Tahoe, killing two people nearby. The driver said he was picking up a dropped phone and didn‚Äôt get any warnings from the system. The jury decided Tesla‚Äôs Autopilot was at fault. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll take time for regulators to move forward‚Äîdefinitely past the end of the year,‚Äù said Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a black eye for Tesla‚Äôs image.‚Äù Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Insane Prediction Forecasts Supply Shock",https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-to-10000-programmed/,"Crypto analyst Ripple Queen has made a bold prediction that the XRP price can reach $10,000 at some point. The analyst also highlighted factors that make this price target achievable despite how ambitious it is. XRP Price To $10,000 Is Already On The Horizon In an X post, Ripple Queen declared that an XRP price tag of $10,000 is already ‚Äúlocked in.‚Äù She claimed that the math proves that the altcoin can reach this target and then alluded to how its supply is limited and its utility is unmatched. The analyst added that the world is catching up fast, indicating that more people are adopting XRP. Related Reading: Market Cap Not A Hindrance To XRP Price Reaching $1,000, Expert Explains Why Ripple Queen further stated that regulatory clarity is falling into place for the crypto industry, which is bullish for the XRP price. Thanks to this regulatory clarity, with laws like the GENIUS Act, Ripple is set to expand its operations, which will boost XRP‚Äôs adoption. The altcoin is known to be at the centre of the crypto firm‚Äôs operations. Ripple CTO David Schwartz also recently indicated that it will continue to be the bridge currency for their payment services. In line with this, Ripple Queen remarked that mass adoption is no longer a dream but a countdown, which is why she believes that the XRP price will reach $10,000. The analyst also stated that banks and institutional investors are quietly accumulating, a move that she is confident will soon lead to a massive supply shock for the altcoin. These institutional investors will also have an avenue to accumulate more XRP once the SEC approves the spot ETFs. Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have already predicted a 95% chance of approval for the XRP ETFs. The launch of these funds will drive more capital into the altcoin‚Äôs ecosystem, which is bullish for the XRP price. Current Price Action On Journey To $10,000 Crypto analyst CasiTrades has provided insights into the current XRP price action, even as it eyes this projected rally to $10,000. In an X post, she stated that the price action isn‚Äôt bearish yet from a technical standpoint despite the recent correction. The analyst noted that the low at $2.75 remains above the wave 1 high around $2.65, which keeps the larger uptrend intact. Related Reading: Analyst Says XRP Price Is Now In Wave 4 ‚Äî What To Expect CasiTrades further revealed that bullish divergences are showing up on the 15-minute chart up to the 4-hour chart. She claimed that this supports the case that $2.75 could be the bottom of this corrective wave. Moving forward, the analyst stated that a proper reclaim of $3.21 and a strong break above this level would begin to confirm that the correction is over and that the next leg up is underway. If that happens, the next target zone will be between $4.60 and $4.80. At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $3.05, up over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

For anyone tracking the institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies, this news from Galaxy Digital provides a compelling snapshot of confidence and strategic liquidity. What Do Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Robust Cash Reserves Mean? Understanding the significance of Galaxy Digital‚Äôs substantial cash and stablecoin holdings requires a look at the broader context of the digital asset market.

Firstly, it demonstrates a commitment to managing risk effectively, ensuring ample capital to navigate potential market volatility or unexpected challenges. Secondly, it provides strategic flexibility, allowing the company to seize investment opportunities as they arise, or to fund operational expansions without immediate reliance on external financing. The reported $1.2 billion in cash and stablecoins forms a crucial part of Galaxy Digital‚Äôs total assets. This allocation highlights a strategic decision to maintain significant liquidity, which is particularly valuable in the fast-evolving cryptocurrency space. Stablecoins, being pegged to fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, offer a bridge between the traditional financial system and the digital asset economy, providing stability while remaining within the crypto ecosystem. Risk Mitigation: A large reserve acts as a buffer against market downturns. Operational Flexibility: Funds are readily available for strategic investments or operational needs.

This figure encompasses not just liquid assets but also other digital asset holdings , investments, and operational infrastructure, reflecting a diversified and robust portfolio. For the second quarter, Galaxy Digital also announced a net income of $30.7 million.

Achieving positive net income in a sometimes unpredictable market environment underscores the efficacy of their business model and their ability to generate revenue from their diverse crypto financial services offerings.

Successful advisory and banking services for institutional clients entering the digital asset space. These elements collectively contribute to a strong financial footing for Galaxy Digital, positioning it as a key player. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Financial Services? Galaxy Digital‚Äôs strong Q2 performance and substantial cash and stablecoins reserves are not just isolated figures for one company; they offer broader insights into the maturing landscape of crypto financial services . As institutional adoption of digital assets continues to grow, firms that demonstrate financial prudence and strong balance sheets are likely to gain a competitive edge. This level of transparency and financial health can help build greater trust and confidence across the entire ecosystem.

By holding a substantial portion of its assets in highly liquid forms, Galaxy Digital ensures it can adapt quickly to evolving conditions, whether they are new regulatory frameworks or shifts in investor sentiment. This proactive approach is vital for long-term sustainability in the digital asset industry. Moreover, the success of Galaxy Digital could serve as a benchmark for other companies operating in the digital asset space, encouraging higher standards of financial reporting and liquidity management. It reinforces the idea that institutional-grade operations are not only possible but are becoming the expectation within crypto finance. Looking Ahead: Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Strategic Position in Digital Asset Holdings With its robust Q2 financial results , including substantial digital asset holdings and a healthy net income, Galaxy Digital appears well-positioned for future growth. The firm‚Äôs ability to generate profit while maintaining significant liquidity speaks volumes about its operational efficiency and strategic foresight. As the crypto market continues to evolve, companies with strong financial foundations are better equipped to capitalize on emerging trends, whether it‚Äôs the tokenization of real-world assets, the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi), or the increasing demand for institutional-grade custody solutions. Galaxy Digital‚Äôs emphasis on liquidity through cash and stablecoins also provides a degree of stability that can attract more traditional investors and institutions. These entities often prioritize security and accessibility, and a firm with a strong liquid balance sheet offers just that. This strategic approach reinforces Galaxy Digital‚Äôs role as a bridge between traditional finance and the innovative world of digital assets, solidifying its standing as a leader in the institutional crypto space. In conclusion, Galaxy Digital‚Äôs Q2 report is more than just a financial update; it‚Äôs a testament to strategic strength and adaptability in the burgeoning crypto economy.

However, technical indicators suggest the right conditions are forming for a potential breakout. According to cryptocurrency trading expert Micha√´l van de Poppe, Ethereum is currently facing significant resistance on its path to new all-time highs. In this case, the asset‚Äôs recent price action shows a stalled rally and a sharp pullback from local peaks, he said in an X post on August 5. ETH price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Poppe noted that Ethereum attempted to push higher but failed to reach the critical resistance zone near $4,100, the last major barrier before potential price discovery. Instead, ETH reversed, delivering a 15% correction, underlining selling pressure below that level. His analysis identified $4,100 as the crucial threshold Ethereum must break to revisit or surpass previous highs. Ethereum‚Äôs key price levels to watch At the same time, Poppe also highlighted key support levels to monitor, including $3,200 to $3,400 range is marked as a prime ‚Äúbounce zone,‚Äù with a 70% probability of holding. Below that, the $2,800 to $3,000 range is seen as stronger support, though with only a 30% likelihood of being tested. Meanwhile, cryptocurrency analyst Ted Pilows also expects a continued Ethereum rally after a recent rebound. In an August 5 X post , he noted that ETH has bounced off the critical $3,400 support level, signaling renewed bullish momentum following last week‚Äôs correction. ETH price analysis chart.

Speaking at Monday‚Äôs Science of Blockchain Conference, Peirce said privacy-preserving tools and the right to self-custody digital assets must be safeguarded. She emphasized that developers of open-source privacy software should not be held liable for how others use their code. ‚ÄúWe should take concrete steps to protect people‚Äôs ability not only to communicate privately, but to transfer value privately, as they could have done with physical coins in the days when the Fourth Amendment was crafted,‚Äù said Peirce. She further argued that requiring immutable, open-source protocols to comply with financial surveillance measures is ‚Äúfruitless‚Äù since anyone can use such code forever without restriction. Tornado Cash trial debates developer liability Peirce‚Äôs remarks come as Roman Storm, co-founder of crypto mixing service Tornado Cash , awaits a verdict in the Southern District of New York. Storm is accused of enabling money laundering through the service, though his defense team maintains that the tool is neutral and not inherently illegal. The Commissioner compared the case to the 1990s battle over cryptography, when engineers like Phil Zimmermann fought for strong encryption for everyone. She points out that these early victories were crucial to the success of the internet, but reminds us that they still inform our modern fight for privacy rights. SEC Commissioner warns against undermining civil liberties Peirce also criticized the now-defunct DeFi broker rule , which would have required decentralized platforms to collect and report user data to the IRS. ‚ÄúDoing so would deputize us to surveil our neighbors‚Äîa practice antithetical to a free society,‚Äù she said. Like the internet, she maintained that blockchain-based technologies with legitimate uses must remain openly accessible‚Äîeven if some bad actors misuse them‚Äîbecause restricting them risks infringing on fundamental freedoms. The Tornado Cash trial may establish a crucial legal precedent for courts‚Äô interpretation of developer liability in the crypto space. In a related case, Samourai Wallet co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill have indicated their intention to plead guilty to charges linked to their crypto mixing service. Documents filed in a New York federal court on Thursday indicated that Rodriguez and Hill both intend to enter guilty pleas on Wednesday morning. In April 2024, the two had entered their original not guilty plea in connection with allegations they operated an unlicensed money transmitting business that processed over $2 billion of illegal financial transactions‚Äî some linked to darknet marketplaces like Silk Road.

Respected analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, in a detailed update shared on X, highlights several key technical signals that suggest XRP is positioning for its next breakout phase‚Äîif critical levels hold. Bullish Closes Above $3 Reinforce Momentum. XRP has now printed several clean candlestick closes above the $3.00 mark, a major psychological and technical milestone. Whole numbers such as $3.00 tend to carry weight in trading, often acting as strong resistance or support zones. In this case, XRP‚Äôs ability to stay above that level‚Äînot just wick through it‚Äîindicates sustained buyer confidence. The consistency of these closes shows that bulls are firmly in control, and market sentiment continues to favor upside. This is a key short-term validation of XRP‚Äôs strength, as traders often look to such psychological levels for confirmation of trend continuation. #XRP Analysis: 4-Hour Time Frame Update Let‚Äôs Zoom In into the #XRP chart to identify potential price movements and behavior on lower time frames (LTF)! Zooming In: 5 Key Observations 1‚É£ Bullish Closing: We‚Äôre seeing multiple candlesticks closing above $3.00, a‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/INUfdkbBVO ‚Äî EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) August 5, 2025 Wick Behavior Shows Sellers Are Present but Weak EGRAG also points to a notable pattern in XRP‚Äôs candlestick wicks. Most of the wicks are forming on the upper side, signaling some selling pressure as the price moves higher. However, the bodies of the candles remain solidly above $3.00, suggesting that while some traders are taking profits, the selling isn‚Äôt strong enough to reverse the trend. This type of price behavior‚Äîlimited upper wicks with full candle bodies above support‚Äîis often seen in strong uptrends, where profit-taking is absorbed by fresh buying interest. A Potential Retest Between $2.96 and $2.93 Despite the bullish momentum, a short-term pullback to the $2.96‚Äì$2.93 range is not out of the question . EGRAG flags this area as a possible retest zone before the next leg up. A revisit to this level would not signal weakness; in fact, pullbacks into former resistance zones often act as bullish re-tests that create a springboard for further rallies. Traders will be watching this region closely for signs of accumulation and renewed buying pressure, which could strengthen the next upward move. $2.80 Support Is Crucial The real line in the sand is $2.80. According to EGRAG, if XRP closes below this level on the 4-hour chart, the bullish structure would be significantly weakened. $2.80 has acted as a foundation during previous market phases, and holding above it is key to preserving upside momentum. So far, XRP continues to trade comfortably above this support, reinforcing the short-term bullish case. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Key Targets Ahead: Breakout Levels in Focus Looking forward, $3.185 is the immediate price target. A confirmed 4-hour close above this level would break local resistance and likely trigger further upside. After that, $3.25 is the next bullish checkpoint, a level that could draw in more momentum traders and increase market participation. More importantly, closes above $3.33 and $3.45 would serve as strong signals that XRP is preparing for a new all-time high (ATH). These levels mark the threshold between current consolidation and full-blown breakout territory. Summarily, XRP‚Äôs 4-hour chart is painting a bullish picture, supported by consistent closes above $3.00, moderate but manageable selling pressure, and a clear roadmap of target levels ahead. EGRAG CRYPTO‚Äôs technical insight provides a detailed framework to understand where the token currently stands‚Äîand where it might be headed next. As long as XRP continues to defend key supports and breaks above near-term resistance levels, the path toward new highs remains firmly in play.

49580536,548303,1754395711,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49580536.jpeg,Trump‚Äôs Crypto Advisor Plans $200M PAC to Send $BTC to $10M ‚Äì Where Is $HYPER Headed?,https://bitcoinist.com/trump-advisor-pushes-btc-pac-hyper-best-presale/,"David Bailey is planning to raise $100M‚Äì$200M to build a pro-Bitcoin political force. The entrepreneur, widely known as the architect behind Trump‚Äôs recent Bitcoin pivot, shared on X that the PAC aims to send $BTC to $10M by locking in its place in mainstream finance. But politics won‚Äôt fix Bitcoin‚Äôs outdated infrastructure. The growing realization is pulling more investors toward Bitcoin Hyper, a new Layer-2 project that future-proofs Bitcoin using Solana tech. The Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) presale broke $7M on Monday, defying the broader market dip. Bailey‚Äôs $200M PAC Could Make Bitcoin a Political Power Player Political Action Committees (PACs) raise money to support political candidates and causes. They are becoming increasingly influential in the crypto space, too. For example, Fairshake, backed by Coinbase and Ripple Labs, has played a key role in getting pro-crypto voices into office. Under Trump‚Äôs leadership, crypto became a campaign pillar in the 2024 election cycle, with Crypto PACs spending over $130M to support pro-crypto causes. David Bailey‚Äôs PAC could be the next big political move for Bitcoin, ahead of the 2026 elections. Bailey, the Chairman of Bitcoin Magazine, now heads Nakamoto Holdings. The bitcoin treasury company is building a global portfolio of bitcoin native companies across media, advisory, and finance. Bailey was also President Donald Trump‚Äôs Bitcoin advisor during the 2024 election campaign. He is now looking to raise capital to advance Bitcoin priorities. The PAC‚Äôs mission could involve pushing for zero capital gains tax on $BTC, self-custody rights, and federal funding for Bitcoin education. The X thread also attracted some interesting ideas like legal protections for developers, more Bitcoin ATMs, and allowing foreign governments to repay U.S. debt in Bitcoin. Alex Gladstein, the Chief Strategy Officer at the Human Rights Foundation (HRF), has published a long wishlist of Bitcoin policy priorities for Bailey‚Äôs PAC. Still, many have warned Bailey to proceed with caution as he heads Nakamoto Holdings, questioning whether mixing political efforts with shareholder assets could pose legal risks. I‚Äôd be careful, your duties are to shareholders, if you anchor political efforts with public company funds, you may find yourself staring down the barrel of a class action lawsuit for breach of fiduciary duty. Not involved in politics, but have decades of experience with public companies. My advice is to tread very cautiously. ‚ÄîCharles Allen, CEO of publicly traded company BTCS. Bailey points to Fairshake as proof that this approach isn‚Äôt a serious cause for concern. Pro-Crypto Laws and Institutions Are Bullish, But Tech Still Lags Under Trump‚Äôs return to office, crypto has gone from political headache to policy focus. Clearer SEC rules, better tax guidance, and government backing encourage institutions to dive in. Asset managers are pouring into $BTC ETFs. Hedge funds are increasing allocations. Overall, $BTC treasuries are on the rise. In fact, Ark Invest‚Äôs Cathie Wood reaffirmed her $1.5M Bitcoin prediction in a recent interview with Steven Bartlett. Long-term holders aren‚Äôt backing off either, with wallet data making it clear that accumulation continues despite short-term dips. Over 160K $BTC were accumulated over the past 30 days alone. But is Bitcoin ready to handle its growing acceptance? The fact remains that the network still can‚Äôt support smart contracts, dApps, or DeFi . This question drives investors to emerging top altcoin projects like Bitcoin Hyper, which is building the kind of infrastructure that can make Bitcoin technologically competent. $HYPER Presale Hits $7M as Layer-2 Ignites Buying Frenzy Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is a utility token with an upcoming Layer-2 for Bitcoin. Built using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) , it brings smart contract functionality to the Bitcoin blockchain without compromising speed or security. Here‚Äôs how it works: you first deposit $BTC to a given address on the main network. The Hyper Layer-2 then mints wrapped $BTC through a cross-chain canonical bridge. You can then use your wrapped $BTC to access cross-chain platforms and dApps not otherwise compatible with $BTC. Think NFT marketplaces, simplified DeFi lending, or even DAO governance. Unlike most new crypto projects that remain a theory, the Bitcoin Hyper devnet is already operational, with features like program deployment via Solana CLI and real-time transaction visibility via the blockchain explorer. According to its whitepaper , the fully-developed mainnet, bridge, and the first dApps are set to go live in Q3, 2025, before the $HYPER token lists on exchanges. Following the listings in Q4 2025, our Bitcoin Hyper price prediction forecasts a $0.32 high. $HYPER is still in the pre-market phase, having raised an impressive $7M as one of the best crypto presales this year. When live, the token will power on-chain gas fees, governance, and protocol rewards in the Hyper ecosystem. Early buyers are wasting no time hoarding the token at low costs (currently $0.012525). The dynamic staking rewards, now at 152%, also make early backing even more attractive. Note the reward rate goes down as more investors start staking. Visit the Bitcoin Hyper presale. Long-Term Players Make Moves in the Dip The crypto market might be lukewarm this week, but the long-term picture looks fiercely bullish, with Bitcoin-backed PACs, improving regulatory clarity, and institutional accumulation. More importantly, projects like Bitcoin Hyper are actively solving Bitcoin‚Äôs infrastructure gaps, helping it turn into a base layer for real-world applications. For long-term believers, this is a great time to hoard both $BTC and $HYPER. While Bitcoin is selling for $114K, $HYPER‚Äôs presale price is a cheap $0.012075. Note the next price jump is just hours away. As always, do your research before investing in cryptocurrencies.

Ethereum, with its robust smart contract platform, and Solana, known for its high-speed transactions, represent key pillars of the decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 movements. Holding a mix of these major cryptocurrencies can offer several benefits: Diversification: Spreading risk across different digital assets. Growth Potential: Tapping into the unique growth trajectories of various blockchain ecosystems. Ecosystem Engagement: Potentially enabling future integration or services built on these networks. This strategy is a prime example of a forward-thinking corporate crypto strategy . It positions Exodus Movement not just as a software provider but also as a significant player within the digital asset investment landscape. The Broader Impact of Corporate Crypto Holdings Exodus Movement‚Äôs decision to further increase its Exodus Movement BTC acquisition and maintain a robust crypto portfolio reflects a broader shift in corporate finance. Companies are increasingly exploring how digital assets can serve as legitimate components of their financial strategy. This trend has several implications for the wider market: Increased Legitimacy: Corporate adoption lends credibility to the cryptocurrency market. Institutional Interest: It can pave the way for more traditional institutions to enter the space. Market Stability: Large, long-term holdings by corporations can contribute to market stability. While challenges such as regulatory uncertainty and price volatility remain, the continued accumulation by entities like Exodus Movement signals a long-term bullish outlook for digital assets. Their actions provide a tangible example of how businesses are adapting to the evolving financial landscape. In conclusion, Exodus Movement‚Äôs latest 29 BTC acquisition is more than just a transaction; it is a clear statement of their confidence in the future of digital assets.

Because XRP is a major altcoin, its movements are closely tracked by both whales and retail investors alike. To get a better read on where this Ripple-based crypto could be headed after such a sweltering July, we turned to Gemini, Google‚Äôs homegrown AI chatbot. Thanks to its direct integration with Google Search, Gemini is uniquely positioned to sweep both mainstream headlines and find underrated insights to deliver a balanced picture of XRP‚Äôs potential by the time Santa Claus rolls into town. Spoiler alert : Gemini boldly predicts that $XRP could hit $5 by year-end, implying a chunky 64% upside from current levels. In this article, we‚Äôll break down Gemini‚Äôs bold $XRP price prediction, explore the fundamentals behind it, and introduce a new presale crypto ‚Äì Best Wallet Token ($BEST) ‚Äì that could ride XRP‚Äôs momentum and potentially deliver eye-popping returns. $XRP Poised for a $5 2025 Target Gemini cited several compelling reasons behind its bold $XRP price prediction. First and foremost, the high likelihood of an XRP ETF being approved in the third quarter of 2025 could serve as a major catalyst for the token‚Äôs growth. According to Bloomberg, there‚Äôs a 95% chance the SEC will approve XRP spot ETFs . It‚Äôs also worth noting that Gemini‚Äôs 2025 XRP projection aligns closely with that of analysts at Standard Chartered, who‚Äôve suggested a similar $5.50 price target. The bank further noted that a potential XRP ETF approval in Q3 could unlock $4B-$8B in institutional inflows within just the first year . The SEC‚Äôs recent dismissal of the Ripple Case is another fundamental win for the project. That‚Äôs because it clears legal uncertainty and makes it far more attractive to institutional investors. XRP is also making big strides internally. The network is currently racing to integrate smart contract functionality , which would drastically boost its utility and adoption among Web3 developers. On top of that, the XRP Ledger‚Äôs architecture is uniquely suited for financial institutions looking to tokenize real-world assets like bonds, stocks, and real estate ‚Äì a sector poised for exponential growth in the coming years . XRP Technicals Flash Bullish Momentum From a technical analysis perspective, $XRP is currently bouncing off the 50% Fibonacci retracement level , drawn from its $2.0687 low. This bounce suggests a renewal of bullish momentum, as the 50% Fib level often acts as a strong support zone where traders re-enter positions in anticipation of a breakout. The breakout in question is the one that occurred in July, when $XRP blasted through a descending triangle pattern. All in all, with a mainstream cross-border payments token like $XRP poised to skyrocket on the back of both technical and fundamental tailwinds, smart investors are now turning to another payments-based crypto project ‚Äì Best Wallet Token ($BEST) ‚Äì for 1,000x¬†potential. What is Best Wallet Token? $BEST is the native cryptocurrency of Best Wallet , a free crypto wallet that‚Äôs both highly secure and beginner-friendly. And it is this brilliant combination of top-tier security and ease of use that puts it in a great position to ride the wave of growing crypto wallet adoption. Why Best Wallet‚Äôs Security Stands Out First and foremost, Best Wallet is a non-custodial crypto wallet , which means only you hold the keys to your funds ‚Äì not any third party. At a time when hacks and thefts continue to plague the crypto space , Best Wallet‚Äôs commitment to self-custody is not just reassuring; it‚Äôs applaud-worthy, offering peace of mind for both newcomers and veterans alike. It also integrates Fireblocks‚Äô MPC-CMP cryptographic tech, adding a powerful extra layer of protection.

Recently, Bhutan executed a significant Bhutan BTC transfer , moving 517 Bitcoin, valued at approximately $59.23 million, to a new wallet. This wallet is reportedly linked to Binance, as observed by Onchain Lens on X. This substantial move raises questions about the nation‚Äôs evolving strategy for its Bhutan Bitcoin holdings and its broader approach to digital assets. What Does This Bhutan BTC Transfer Signify? This large-scale movement of Bitcoin by a sovereign nation is more than just a transaction; it is a signal. While the exact reasons remain undisclosed, such a transfer suggests a deliberate strategic decision rather than a simple liquidation. Governments holding cryptocurrencies often do so for various purposes, including investment, reserve diversification, or even as part of broader economic initiatives. Strategic Reallocation: The transfer could indicate a shift in how Bhutan manages its crypto reserves, potentially seeking better liquidity or more robust security measures. Operational Efficiency: Moving funds to a wallet linked to a major exchange like Binance might streamline future transactions or management processes. Increased Transparency (Potentially): While the wallet itself might be new, an association with a known entity like Binance could imply a move towards more transparent or auditable operations, even if indirect. Bhutan‚Äôs Approach to Digital Asset Management Bhutan has quietly been involved in the crypto space for some time, reportedly mining Bitcoin using hydropower. This latest Bhutan BTC transfer reinforces their commitment to digital asset management . Unlike many nations that are still debating the role of cryptocurrencies, Bhutan appears to be actively integrating them into its financial considerations. This proactive stance highlights a forward-thinking perspective on national wealth and economic diversification in the digital age. Managing significant Bitcoin reserves requires specialized expertise and infrastructure. Therefore, this transfer could be a step towards optimizing their custodial arrangements or preparing for potential future uses of these assets. It demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the crypto landscape. Is This a Trend in Government Crypto Adoption? The actions of nations like Bhutan contribute to a growing narrative of government crypto adoption . While El Salvador made headlines by adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, other countries and sovereign wealth funds are quietly accumulating or managing digital assets. This trend reflects a global acknowledgment of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets, capable of playing a role in national economies. This transfer by Bhutan, while specific to their strategy, adds another data point to the increasing institutional interest in crypto. It suggests that even smaller nations are exploring innovative ways to manage their wealth in an increasingly digital world. This could inspire other countries to evaluate their own positions on digital assets. The Significance of a Binance-linked Wallet The detail that the wallet is ‚Äúlikely linked to Binance‚Äù is particularly noteworthy. Binance is one of the world‚Äôs largest cryptocurrency exchanges, known for its vast liquidity and wide range of services. A connection to such a platform could imply several things regarding Bhutan‚Äôs intent: Enhanced Liquidity Access: Direct or indirect access to Binance‚Äôs liquidity pools could facilitate larger transactions without significant price impact. Custodial Solutions: It might involve using Binance‚Äôs institutional services for secure storage and management, offering a regulated environment for their Bhutan Bitcoin holdings . Future Market Operations: The link could be a preparatory step for future buying, selling, or staking activities, allowing Bhutan to actively participate in the crypto market. It‚Äôs important to remember that ‚Äúlinked‚Äù does not necessarily mean direct custody by Binance, but rather a connection that facilitates interaction with the exchange‚Äôs ecosystem. What‚Äôs Next for Bhutan‚Äôs Bitcoin Strategy? The recent Bhutan BTC transfer positions the nation as a quiet but significant player in the sovereign crypto space. While the immediate purpose of this transfer remains speculative, it underscores Bhutan‚Äôs strategic foresight in navigating the evolving financial landscape. This move could pave the way for more active participation in the digital economy, potentially influencing future national financial policies and investment strategies. As the world watches, Bhutan‚Äôs continued engagement with Bitcoin provides a compelling case study for other governments considering the integration of digital assets into their national frameworks. It‚Äôs a testament to the growing acceptance and strategic utility of cryptocurrencies on a global scale. Conclusion: A Bold Step in Digital Sovereignty The Royal Government of Bhutan‚Äôs recent 517 BTC transfer to a Binance-linked wallet is a pivotal moment, highlighting its proactive and sophisticated approach to digital asset management . This significant Bhutan BTC transfer not only underscores the nation‚Äôs continued engagement with Bitcoin but also provides valuable insights into the broader trend of government crypto adoption . As nations increasingly explore the potential of cryptocurrencies, Bhutan‚Äôs actions serve as a compelling example of strategic foresight in the digital age, shaping its future financial landscape.

According to SMQKE, Grealish‚Äôs comments represent confirmation that XRP and Stellar Lumens (XLM) are poised to play a critical role in the future of the financial system. In the video , Grealish outlines several key takeaways from the industry event, emphasizing how blockchain technology, smart contracts, and digital assets are embraced by financial institutions in response to outdated payment infrastructure. Grealish begins by contrasting the current operations of banks with those of modern digital systems. She explains that while e-commerce and front-office trading systems operate continuously and with minimal latency, traditional banks still rely on batch processing methods. Messaging, clearing, and settlement processes are often decoupled and can take days to complete. According to her, this discrepancy between fast-moving digital markets and sluggish financial infrastructure is unsustainable. As a result, she notes that financial institutions and consortia at SIBOS are actively exploring how blockchain-based technologies can make traditional banking systems align with the demands of the digital economy. Alenka Grealish, Senior Analyst at Celent, confirmed at SWIFT SIBOS that XRP and XLM are set to play a key role in the future financial system. Watch. pic.twitter.com/TJfR1Itew0 ‚Äî SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) August 4, 2025 Emergence of the Internet of Value In her second major point, Grealish describes how the concept of the ‚ÄúInternet of Value‚Äù is beginning to materialize. She used a framework that likens the adoption process of blockchain to a mechanical flywheel that initially requires significant energy to move but builds momentum over time. Within this framework, the initial focus has been on feasibility. However, she asserts that the industry has now entered a phase where economic viability is being demonstrated through real-world use cases. Grealish references specific applications that were highlighted during the SIBOS conference, including interbank payments, delivery versus payment arrangements, and various forms of cross-border transactions. She also draws attention to the social utility of blockchain-based remittance systems. In that context, she explicitly names XRP, Stellar Lumens, and the stablecoin USDC as playing vital roles in enabling these emerging payment mechanisms. She characterizes these assets as integral to the ongoing development of the Internet of Value, a term that reflects the merging of financial services and decentralized digital technologies. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Legitimization of Cryptocurrencies as an Asset Class Grealish‚Äôs third and final observation addresses the shifting perception of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment instruments. She recalls how the original vision behind Bitcoin was to serve as a medium of exchange and enable a fully operational Internet of Value. However, she notes that Bitcoin failed to fulfill this role due to its inefficiency in facilitating lawful, everyday transactions. Instead, the focus shifted to the underlying distributed ledger technology. Now, according to Grealish, Bitcoin is regaining significance, not as a currency, but as a leading example in a new digital asset class. She adds that this shift is being accelerated by increasing interest from institutional investors. Whereas retail investors drove early momentum, she emphasizes that institutional involvement introduces more sophisticated forms of demand. This, she says, is leading to faster progress in areas such as decentralized finance. Conclusion Drawn from the SIBOS Remarks SMQKE‚Äôs tweet underscores Grealish‚Äôs mention of XRP and Stellar Lumens as important contributors to the transformation of financial systems. Her remarks provide evidence that within influential financial forums like SWIFT SIBOS, these assets are being recognized not just for their technological capabilities but also for their practical relevance in reshaping international payment processes. SMQKE presents this as confirmation of long-held views in the digital asset community that XRP and XLM are essential elements in the shift toward a more efficient, blockchain-based financial future.

A significant stride in this direction has just been announced: Inveniam Capital Partners, a leader in decentralized data infrastructure for private market assets, has made a substantial MANTRA investment of $20 million. This strategic move aims to accelerate RWA market expansion , particularly in key regions like the UAE and the U.S., paving the way for a new era of financial innovation and showcasing the power of Tokenizing Real-World Assets . What Does This Inveniam MANTRA Partnership Mean for RWAs? This isn‚Äôt just a financial transaction; it‚Äôs a powerful alliance set to redefine the future of finance. Inveniam, known for its robust data infrastructure, is joining forces with MANTRA, a layer-1 blockchain specifically designed for Tokenizing Real-World Assets . Their combined expertise is poised to tackle the complexities of bringing illiquid, tangible assets onto the blockchain. The goal is to unlock new liquidity and investment opportunities globally, driving significant RWA market expansion . The collaboration will focus on: Enhancing transparency and efficiency in private markets. Developing compliant frameworks for RWA tokenization. Expanding access to a broader range of investors, supported by this key MANTRA investment . Ultimately, this Inveniam MANTRA partnership seeks to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi), making real-world assets more accessible and liquid than ever before. This is a crucial step towards mainstream adoption of Real-World Assets blockchain solutions. Why is Tokenizing Real-World Assets a Game Changer? Tokenizing Real-World Assets represents a monumental shift in how we perceive and interact with value. Imagine owning a fractional share of a luxury property, a rare art piece, or even infrastructure projects, all represented by a digital token on a blockchain. This process offers several compelling benefits that fuel RWA market expansion : Increased Liquidity: Historically illiquid assets can be divided into smaller, tradable units. Enhanced Transparency: Blockchain‚Äôs immutable ledger provides clear ownership records and transaction history. Reduced Costs: Eliminating intermediaries can lower fees and streamline processes. Global Accessibility: Investors from anywhere in the world can participate, democratizing access to high-value assets. This push for RWA market expansion through tokenization holds the potential to unlock trillions of dollars in value currently locked away in traditional, cumbersome structures. The significant MANTRA investment from Inveniam directly supports this transformative vision. Navigating the Path to RWA Market Expansion with a Strong Inveniam MANTRA Partnership While the promise of RWAs is immense, the journey to widespread RWA market expansion is not without its challenges. Regulatory clarity remains a key hurdle. Different jurisdictions have varying approaches to digital assets, which necessitates careful navigation and adherence to local laws. This is where the focus on the UAE and the U.S. becomes particularly strategic, as both regions are actively exploring robust regulatory frameworks for digital assets, offering a fertile ground for innovation. The Inveniam MANTRA partnership is uniquely positioned to address these challenges by: Leveraging Inveniam‚Äôs extensive experience with regulated private markets. Building on MANTRA‚Äôs compliance-focused Real-World Assets blockchain infrastructure. Engaging proactively with regulators to foster a conducive environment for Tokenizing Real-World Assets . Their combined efforts aim to establish best practices and robust infrastructure, ensuring that the growth of the Real-World Assets blockchain ecosystem is both secure and compliant. The Future is Bright for Real-World Assets Blockchain and Beyond The $20 million MANTRA investment by Inveniam marks a significant milestone in the evolution of the RWA sector. It underscores a growing confidence in the ability of blockchain technology to revolutionize traditional finance. As these two innovative companies collaborate, we can anticipate a surge in the availability and accessibility of tokenized assets, driving further RWA market expansion . This initiative promises to democratize investment opportunities, bring unprecedented transparency to private markets, and ultimately reshape the global financial landscape. The journey towards a fully integrated Real-World Assets blockchain ecosystem is accelerating, and partnerships like this Inveniam MANTRA partnership are at its very core, propelling us into an exciting future for Tokenizing Real-World Assets .

According to HBAR News updates, these projections envision returns up to 5,000% in 2025, sparking investor curiosity. HBAR News Focus: Could Hedera Surpass ADA Dramatically? According to the latest HBAR News analysis , HBAR‚Äôs 2025 outlook ranges from $0.24 to $0.88, with consensus momentum targeting ~$1.20. That would still fall short of a 5,000% gain unless HBAR jumped to $15‚Äîconsidered highly implausible this cycle. Its enterprise-linked governance and high-throughput protocol make it a viable long‚Äëterm Layer‚Äë1, but Cardano remains the more steadily adopted blockchain. Source: TradingView Even using HBAR News bullish sentiment , ADA‚Äôs projected $0.65‚Äì$1.50 range appears cautious by comparison. Hedera's ability to outperform ADA relies on massive adoption, government or corporate rollouts, and a favorable altseason environment‚Äînone of which are guaranteed. Remittix Section: Why Remittix is the best crypto presale of the year As HBAR News continues to highlight speculative ceiling pricing, Remittix is gaining ground on fundamentals, real-world use, and wallet execution. RTX is priced at $0.0895, has raised over $18 million, and sold 580 million+ tokens. A 40% bonus is currently active as it nears its $18M soft cap, fueling investor enthusiasm. ‚óè Q3 2025 wallet launch supporting Ethereum and Solana networks‚óè Crypto-to-bank payments across 30+ countries with a mobile-first design‚óè Built-in staking with competitive yields and low gas fees‚óè Real-time FX conversion and fiat rail integrations for global gig workers‚óè CertiK, SolidProof, and BlockSAFU audits confirm secure architecture Is Remittix the Top Crypto Presale of 2025? Given its utility, ecosystem fit, and pricing, many believe RTX could outperform ADA and even HBAR if listings and usage scale quickly.

Final Take: Risk Greenlight vs Utility Exposure HBAR News stories fuel high-end speculation, but Cardano remains a steady long‚Äëterm chain backed by the community and technical research. For investors chasing early-stage utility and global access, Remittix is an early pick with real-world functionality, low cap upside, and fast-moving execution. Remittix Is Leading the Pack as the Best Presale of 2025.

With HBAR's price possibly climbing to roughly $1.20, the excitement around these cryptos is palpable. What Makes HBAR a Strong Contender Against Cardano? Despite a conservative forecast of $0.24 to $0.88, HBAR's potential to reach $1.20 lies in its robust technological infrastructure and enterprise applications, posing a substantial growth narrative when compared to Cardano's broader adoption but slower growth trajectory. Here's a more detailed analysis from HBAR News which suggests that under optimal conditions, including broad adoption and significant enterprise rollouts, HBAR could see an unexpected surge in valuation. Why Remittix Might Be the Dark Horse of Crypto in 2025 Turning the spotlight on Remittix, it stands out not just for its promising initial coin offering but for the real-world application and infrastructural capabilities it promises. Priced at just $0.0895 currently, with over $18 million raised and more than 580 million tokens sold, Remittix is positioning itself as a formidable contender in the market. Projected Q3 2025 wallet launch supporting Ethereum and Solana networks Enabled crypto-to-bank payments in over 30 countries Competitive yields through built-in staking and low transaction fees Real-time foreign exchange conversion with fiat integrations for global users Given these advancements, Remittix could potentially eclipse both ADA and HBAR, should it continue to scale swiftly and efficiently. Comparative Outlook: HBAR, Cardano, and Remittix in 2025 Crypto 2025 Forecast Bull Case Scenario Main Strength HBAR $0.24-$0.88 $1-$2 (with massive adoption) High throughput enterprise solutions ADA $0.65-$1.50 $3+ (in bullish conditions) Stable, research-driven blockchain RTX $0.0895 (pre-launch) $4-$5 (if market traction increases) Advanced payment solutions and user-friendly wallet design Final Analysis: Weighing Investment Risks Against Innovative Utility As speculative interests drive HBAR's valuations, and Cardano maintains steady growth, Remittix emerges as a fresh face with tangible products set to revolutionize payment frameworks globally. Its compelling presale metrics and strategic functionalities position it as a top contender for exponential growth in 2025.

Bitcoin treasury companies are valued by Market Net Asset Value (mNAV), focusing on the market value of their bitcoin holdings minus debt. We can estimate the new entities market cap if it trades in line with a similar market cap ratio relative to mNav as Strategy. Early investors in CEPO lack clarity into the new entity's path to growing bitcoin per share as well as the shares outstanding in the new entity until the merger completes. Another day, another bitcoin treasury company. Weekly, sometimes daily, it seems another company makes it their strategy to build a bitcoin treasury or convert their balance sheet to holding bitcoin. Cantor Equity Partners II( CEPO ) has become one of the latest companies to announce that they will be reverse merging into a bitcoin treasury company with Adam Back as CEO . If you've been interested in bitcoin for any length of time, Adam Back's name might sound familiar. He was a pioneer in cryptography and one of the first proponents of bitcoin. Following a reverse merger, his company will be going to market with over 30 thousand bitcoin and $1.5 billion in ""PIPE"" financing. More on that later. Adam Back has been a fierce proponent of bitcoin for the freedom that it offers individuals who find themselves under assault from the traditional financial system. Although his money has always been where his mouth is, this furthers his commitment to advocating for and creating a bitcoin world. ‚Äú We are putting unprecedented firepower behind a single mission: Maximizing Bitcoin ownership per share while accelerating real-world Bitcoin adoption,‚Äù said Adam Back. Once the merger is completed, the company will appropriately be called Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company or BSTR Holdings, Inc. and trade under the ticker BSTR. Cantor Equity Partners and Twenty One Capital This announcement comes on the heels of the April 22 announcement that Cantor Equity Partners, not to be confused with Cantor Equity Partners I, would enter a definitive reverse merger agreement with CEO Jack Maller's newly formed Twenty One Capital. I wrote an article discussing that merger here . Cantor Fitzgerald's CEO, Brandon Lutnick made this comment regarding this second bitcoin treasury company reverse merger. As a long-time Bitcoin advocate, Cantor is incredibly proud to partner with Dr. Back, one of Bitcoin's leading luminaries, to launch BSTR. Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company ""PIPE"" Financing PIPE Financing stands for ""Private Investment in Public Equity."" Adam Backs' company has the potential for $1.5 billion in fiat PIPE financing from various sources. This is potentially three times as large as the PIPE financing obtained from the Cantor Equity Partners announcement which indicates a continued and potentially growing demand for bitcoin treasury investments. Here is a breakdown of BSTR's Pipe Financing. $400 million of common equity Up to $750 million in convertible senior notes Up to $350 million in convertible preferred stock In addition to this PIPE financing, there are other components that will make CEPO an investment lacking clarity prior to the merger. For example, there will be a potential for CEPO shareholders to convert their shares into shares of BSTR at a $10 per share conversion rate. There are several examples like this where the conversion rate and thus the number of shares will not be known until the merger is finalized. C-Suite Adam Back - Chief Executive Officer Adam Back was one of the original cryptographers and created Hashcash in 1997 as an attempt at creating digital money. His work on Hashcash later became cited within the bitcoin whitepaper. Then in 2014, Adam Back co-founded Blockstream which still operates today and focuses on a variety of strategies to grow the bitcoin ecosystem. Back became the CEO of Blockstream in October 2016. Sean Bill - Chief Investment Officer Sean Bill is currently also the Chief Investment Officer at Blockstream and will become the CIO alongside Adam Back at BSTR as well. Sean Bill had over three decades of experience before coming to Blockstream where he has worked alongside CEO Back to bridge bitcoin with traditional finance. Cantor Equity Partners I and their mNAV Bitcoin treasury companies have come to be valued by market analysts based on their mNAV or Market Net Asset Value. Market Net Asset Value is effectively valuing the company's balance sheet based on the market value of their assets less their debt. For example, Strategy( MSTR ), formerly known as Microstrategy, who just reported earnings on July 31, 2025 owns 628,791 bitcoins . Their stock currently trades at $366 per share. Based on the number of bitcoin they own, the market value of their bitcoin is 628,791 bitcoin x $113,000/bitcoin = ~$71 billion. Then subtracting debt of $14.4 billion, this gives them a mNAV of ~$56.6 billion. Strategy trades with a market cap of $114 billion giving them a valuation of ~2 times mNAV. CEPO expects to come to market with about 30,000 bitcoin which will give them an mNAV of ~$3.4 billion. By applying the same multiple, we can expect CEPO to have a market cap of about $6.8 billion. Difficulty Estimating BSTR Shares Outstanding After Merger In order to determine the value of a share of CEPO, you must know how many shares outstanding of BSTR there will be and what proportion of those shares will go to CEPO holders. But as you will see below, estimating the BSTR shares outstanding after the merger makes this a constantly moving target. $400 million in common equity priced at $10.00 per share implying 40 million shares. Up to $750 million in convertible senior notes, with $500 million committed and an option for an additional $250 million, convertible at $13.00 per share. Up to $350 million in convertible preferred stock, with $30 million committed and an option for an additional $320 million, also convertible at a common stock equivalent price of $13.00 per share. 5,021 Bitcoin in-kind PIPE priced at $10.00 per share. The number of shares will depend on bitcoin's price at time of conversion. 25,000 Bitcoin contributed by founding shareholders, priced at $10.00 per share. The number of shares will depend on bitcoin's price at time of conversion. Up to $200 million from CEPO, subject to shareholder redemptions, also priced at $10.00 per share. Again, it is unclear how many shares of BSTR this will convert into. As you can see, estimating the shares outstanding along with the number of shares that CEPO will convert into, is near impossible. Whereas, CEP had more straightforward terms as to how many shares would be created from the start. Cantor Equity Partners II & III So far, Cantor Equity Partners( CEP ) and Cantor Equity Partners I( CEPO ) have made announcements to become bitcoin treasury companies through strategic reverse mergers. As a sidenote, there are currently two more Cantor Equity Partners SPACs that trade publicly in the market. What are Cantor Equity Partners' plans for these companies? If you can follow the trend, one might expect them to also become bitcoin treasury companies after finding their Jack Mallers or Adam Back to steer the company. This creates the question, does buying these two public SPACs also present an opportunity or a risk for potential investors? That all depends on a person's risk tolerance as buying these tickers right now is pure speculation. Here is brief overview of the timing of the various Cantor Equity Partner SPACs IPOs and their merger announcement date, if they have had one. It may be a little self-serving, but Cantor has also recently come out with an analyst report noting their bullishness on bitcoin treasury companies. SPAC Name IPO Date Merger Announcement Date Cantor Equity Partners 8/13/2024 4/22/2025 Cantor Equity Partners I 1/7/2025 7/17/2025 Cantor Equity Partners II( CEPT ) 5/2/2025 TBD Cantor Equity Partners III( CAEP ) 6/26/2025 TBD Risks The risks of purchasing CEPO at this pre-merger stage are very similar to the risks I listed in my article about CEP . Owning Bitcoin By owning CEPO, you are owning a bitcoin treasury company which means you will be directly affected by bitcoin's price. If you don't think its a good idea to own bitcoin, then you shouldn't own CEPO. Business Strategy If you choose to invest in CEPO ahead of the reverse merger, you may be assuming more risk as it is unclear how BSTR plans to grow its bitcoin per share for its shareholders. Although Adam Back and Sean Bill have tremendous experience and connections, it would be a leap of faith to invest without understanding their business strategy. Conversion Ratios Like I spoke about above, there is a lot of ambiguity as to how many shares outstanding there will be after the reverse merger is completed. It depends on various factors which make it difficult. For example, around 5,000 of the bitcoin will be converted to BSTR at $10 per share and this makes the number of shares dependent upon the bitcoin price when BSTR is issued. Opportunity Cost As with any investment, there is the risk of investing one way and missing out on another. For example, by investing in CEPO, you might be missing out on investing in a more established bitcoin treasury company such as Strategy, which has a more established path forward. Market Saturation and Feedback Loops That Eventually End One risk to consider is the market saturation for bitcoin treasury companies. This is a risk that I don't consider a major risk as I believe there is ample demand for bitcoin remaining in the market and I expect each bitcoin treasury company to eventually find new ways to drive bitcoin yield, leveraging their own expertise to unlock new capital markets. And if they find new capital markets, then every other bitcoin treasury company shares in their success as the bitcoin price will likely respond positively. I see a synergistic positive feedback loop...until it stops. If companies begin overleveraging, using debt instruments to purchase more bitcoin, then perhaps investors will know they should begin to be more cautious. Although I don't think we are there yet, this is undoubtedly a risk and investors should understand it and proceed cautiously with that in mind. Conclusion My conclusion for CEPO is the same as it was for CEP. Without having more information on how Adam Back's company will earn a return on their bitcoin stack and increase bitcoin yield for investors, it is too early to recommend buying or selling CEPO and I rate it a hold. Furthermore, add to the uncertainty, it is unclear how many shares outstanding there will be after the merger is completed. I'd rather wait and see how many there will be before I try to understand the value of the shares. Strategy, or MSTR, remains the gold standard with an already well-established pipeline of financial products producing bitcoin yield for their shareholders. I believe it is wiser to invest in Strategy if you want to invest in a bitcoin treasury company. This is subject to change as these new bitcoin treasury companies establish their own strategies to access new capital to drive bitcoin yield for their shareholders.",MSTR|CEP|CEPO,EN,0,0,BTC|MACROECONOMICS|REGULATION|MARKET|TREASURY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-08-05 13:32:28

49584040,https://finbold.com/?p=250447,1754400887,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,Ripple v. SEC: The case that refuses to die,https://finbold.com/ripple-v-sec-the-case-that-refuses-to-die/,"XRP is regaining momentum as institutional adoption grows backed by a solid technical outlook and growing speculation about potential spot exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ). However, the market is now mostly focused on the ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). First filed in December 2020, the case is heading toward another pivotal moment as it approaches the August 15 deadline by which the SEC is required to update the appellate court on the status of the dispute. Ripple vs. SEC August 15 deadline: What does it mean? The kernel of the problem is the question of whether Ripple‚Äôs XRP sales constituted unregistered securities offerings. A 2023 ruling by the U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres already found that institutional sales did qualify as securities, while programmatic sales on various exchanges did not. Though Ripple recently withdrew its appeal, the SEC has yet to follow suit. Judge Torres also rejected a proposed settlement between the SEC and Ripple that sought to lower penalties and dissolve an injunction, adding another layer of uncertainty. It bears mentioning that the upcoming deadline is not a dismissal date. It is rather a procedural update deadline, even if some legal experts, like the former SEC attorney Marc Fagel, believe the appeals could be dropped by then. I believe that‚Äôs the date for the parties to report on the status of their appeals. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a hard deadline by which they must file their dismissal papers, but I assume they will try to do so before then. ‚Äî Marc Fagel (@Marc_Fagel) July 28, 2025 XRP price analysis In spite of the unresolved legal hurdles, XRP seems to be doing fine. Of course, the partial regulatory clarity from the court‚Äôs ruling has strengthened institutional confidence, but the asset shows bullish technicals too. At press time, XRP is trading at $3.03, having gone up 0.76% in the past 24 hours. However, it‚Äôs still down -3.33% on the weekly chart. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold In a recent update , crypto trading analyst Master Ananda highlighted that XRP‚Äôs ongoing price movements imply early stages of a broader bull market cycle, noting also that the upward move could play out within weeks if momentum continues. The recovery began after XRP found strong support just above the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.71, triggering a rapid rebound. A green daily candle reversed the previous downtrend, and another confirming candle followed, sealing the reversal. XRP then reclaimed the $3 level, which remains a key psychological threshold. Another analyst, known as ‚ÄúLord of Alts,‚Äù pointed to one of the largest bullish pennant formations seen in months. According to this analysis, XRP is consolidating above key support levels within a tightening range, which suggests a potentially sharp breakout. Featured image via Shutterstock The post Ripple v.

Already raising over $18.1 million, the Remittix project stands out as one of the best crypto presale 2025 entries, especially when compared to meme-based tokens like SHIB and DOGE. Doge Gains Look Modest Compared to RTX Potential Dogecoin has been a top crypto under $1 for years. As of early August 2025, DOGE trades around $0.20 with a market cap close to $29.7 billion. If DOGE hits a $50 billion valuation, that‚Äôs only a 1.7x gain . This makes Dogecoin a safer bet among crypto with real utility, but it may not offer the explosive growth of some newer low cap crypto gems. Its strong community and meme status still make it a top crypto to buy now, but investors seeking the next 100x crypto might be looking elsewhere. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Path to $50B Is Steeper Shiba Inu currently sits near a $7.3 billion market cap, trading at about $0.0000123. A rise to $50 billion would be about a 6.8x gain . That's better than Doge, but still lags what early stage crypto investments like Remittix could return. Source: TradingView While SHIB has built utilities in DeFi and gaming, it remains largely speculative. Some investors continue staking SHIB in decentralized exchanges, but others now explore cross-chain DeFi project options that solve real problems. Why Remittix is the Best Crypto Presale of the Year Remittix Could Be the Most Underrated Crypto Presale of the Decade. Unlike meme coins, it solves a $19 trillion global remittance challenge with crypto-to-fiat rails. A $50B market cap could turn its $0.0895 token into a portfolio game-changer. At its current stage, Remittix offers: ‚óè Crypto-to-bank payments in 30+ countries‚óè Support for 40+ cryptocurrencies‚óè Mobile wallet launching September 15‚óè 50% bonus tokens live now‚óè Over 581 million tokens sold‚óè $18.1M+ already raised by early adopters Analysts believe it could deliver 10x or more if adoption accelerates and PayFi demand grows. Some even tip it to outperform SHIB and DOGE in this cycle. Remittix is quietly becoming the breakout presale of 2025. It has use cases beyond hype freelancers, expats and global workers can directly send money to local bank accounts. This Could Be the Presale That Changes Everything: Remittix. Which Coin Pumps Your Portfolio? DOGE offers modest growth from here. SHIB could still offer nearly 7x gains. But if you want the highest upside, experts say Remittix is the dark horse that‚Äôs winning over smart investors. It leads the pack as the best presale of 2025 with huge passive income potential, a strong DeFi project roadmap and growing hype from crypto staking enthusiasts.

The Comparative Growth Potential of Dogecoin Dogecoin, traditionally a favorite due to its low price, has shown sustained popularity. As of early 2025, the price of DOGE is around $0.20 with a market cap nearing $29.7 billion. Achieving a $50 billion market cap would represent a 1.7x gain , modest compared to newer market entries. Shiba Inu's Potential Surge Shiba Inu, with its current market cap around $7.3 billion, could see a significant increase in value. A jump to $50 billion indicates a potential 6.8x gain . While it exceeds Dogecoin's potential, it's still not as promising as some of the newest cryptocurrencies on the market. Why Remittix Stands Out in the Crypto Presale Scene Distinctly, Remittix offers a practical solution to global financial transactions involving a large market potential. With advanced crypto-to-fiat solutions and broad global reach, its current presale stage highlights substantial growth potential. Investors are especially drawn to its utility in sectors like global remittance, which is valued at around $19 trillion. The versatility of Remittix is evident through its support for multiple cryptocurrencies and forthcoming services such as a mobile wallet, expected to launch soon. With over $18.1 million raised already and more than 581 million tokens sold, the project's scope for expansion and investor interest is considerable. Market analysts predict a 10x growth for Remittix if trends continue, potentially outperforming both SHIB and DOGE in the current financial cycle. Final Thoughts: Choosing Your Investment With all factors considered, Remittix appears to be the dark horse in the race, possibly providing the highest returns in this investment cycle.

In 2025, it‚Äôs less about simply flipping a switch and more about ensuring your project appears in the right places, at the right time, and in front of the right people. Get it right, and you‚Äôre suddenly on everyone‚Äôs radar. Get it wrong, and you risk getting buried in the noise. The Web3 space is moving fast. We‚Äôre seeing Layer 2 networks becoming the norm, modular chains reshaping how things are built, and cross-chain compatibility finally becoming a reality. But with all that progress comes more complexity. Token listings are no longer as straightforward as they once were. This guide breaks it all down. We‚Äôll walk you through what‚Äôs changed in 2025, how to choose the right platform for your token, and which five platforms are worth considering. Whether you‚Äôre a solo builder, working with a lean decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), or part of a small team chasing a big idea, this is for you. Quick Navigation Top 5 Token Listing Platforms in 2025 What‚Äôs Changed About Token Listings in 2025?

Seamless Launch Flow : Combines pre-listing distribution, liquidity preparation, and immediate listing into a single coordinated launch process. Post-Listing Liquidity Support : Access to deep order books, active market makers, and promotional visibility through Binance‚Äôs trading ecosystem. Global User Exposure : Tokens are introduced to one of the world‚Äôs largest crypto communities, boosting access, adoption, and trading volume from day one. Pros: High trading volume and deep liquidity Trusted platform with global brand recognition Launchpool drives early user engagement Attracts both institutional and retail attention Cons: Long and competitive approval process High listing standards may exclude early-stage projects Less flexibility in listing terms compared to smaller exchanges Uniswap: Leading permissionless DEX on Ethereum Uniswap is the leading DEX on Ethereum, known for its permissionless nature. It lets anyone list a token by simply creating a trading pair, making it the easiest and fastest way to go live on-chain. No gatekeepers, no approvals, just plug into Ethereum‚Äôs liquidity and start trading. Notably, this ease of access has made Uniswap the default launchpad for new tokens on Ethereum. Whether it‚Äôs a serious DeFi project or a weekend meme coin experiment, projects often launch here first. Thanks to the platform‚Äôs deep liquidity, strong aggregator support, and active bot trading, which helps drive volume. Best For: Meme coins, NFT-related tokens, experimental DeFi protocols, and early-stage Ethereum-based projects.

Doesn‚Äôt support Ethereum or other chains Volatility is high, and many projects are short-lived Little control over how your token is received or adopted Jupiter: Solana‚Äôs primary DEX aggregator for visibility and liquidity Jupiter is the go-to DEX aggregator on Solana. Rather than serving as a launchpad, it routes trades across all major Solana DEXs to secure the best prices for users. For new tokens, being visible on Jupiter means instant discoverability and access to deep, aggregated liquidity. Although Jupiter doesn‚Äôt launch tokens directly, it plays a key role in making them tradable and findable. As soon as a token has a liquidity pool on platforms like Raydium or Orca, Jupiter indexes it, enabling immediate access for users and bots. Best For: Solana-based tokens that want fast, early visibility post-launch, especially meme coins, DeFi tokens, and social coins that rely on volume and discovery.

Sniper and Bot Compatibility : Structured data and fast indexing make it suitable for bots and automated traders. Pros: No need to apply or list. Jupiter picks up tokens automatically Instant access to deep Solana DEX liquidity High discoverability for new tokens Fast swaps with minimal slippage Cons: Visibility depends on having active liquidity Limited exposure beyond the Solana ecosystem What‚Äôs Changed About Token Listings in 2025? Not too long ago, listing a token was pretty simple. You got on a centralized exchange (CEX), hoped for volume, and took it from there. But in 2025, it‚Äôs a completely different game. Token launches are far more strategic now. These days, many projects launch on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or even meme-driven platforms. It‚Äôs quicker, cheaper, and a great way to test the waters. If you‚Äôve been watching the Solana meme coin scene, you‚Äôve seen how this works. Platforms like Pump.fun allow anyone to launch a token with a single click, and if the community gets involved, it can skyrocket overnight. Then you‚Äôve got tools like Jupiter and 1inch stepping in to smooth the process. They route trades across multiple DEXs, which means people can find and swap your token more easily, even if it‚Äôs not on a major exchange yet. CEXs, on the flip side, have raised the bar. They‚Äôre looking for solid communities, well-thought-out tokenomics, smart contract audits, and compliance with KYC/AML rules. Getting listed takes more effort now, but if you succeed, the visibility can be substantial. Multichain launches have also become the norm. Many projects now go live on Ethereum, BNB Chain, Solana, or all three simultaneously. With bridges, cross-chain swaps, and vesting tools becoming more accessible, it‚Äôs easier to execute than ever. How to Choose the Right Token Listing Platform Not every platform is the right fit for every project. What works for a DeFi protocol might flop for a meme coin, and vice versa. So before you hit the launch button, here are five key factors to consider: 1. Liquidity and Volume Can people actually trade your token without getting crushed by slippage? Look at the platform‚Äôs liquidity pools and average trading volume. If users can‚Äôt move tokens easily, they might not even try. 2. Audience Fit Where does your community live? Meme coins tend to thrive on Solana or fast-paced DEXs. More serious projects (like DeFi protocols or real-world asset platforms) often benefit from launching on regulated CEXs with compliance infrastructure. 3. Blockchain Support Ensure the platform supports your token standard, such as ERC-20, SPL, BEP-20, or another compatible standard. Some platforms also offer useful launch tools, such as templates or no-code deployers, to simplify setup. 4. Costs and Incentives What‚Äôs the cost of entry? Some platforms charge listing fees, while others require liquidity seeding or a portion of the token supply. Launchpads may offer marketing or dev support in return, so consider the trade-offs carefully. 5. Features and Reputation Listing is just the start. Look out for extras like token lockers, vesting tools, analytics dashboards, and KYC integrations. Also, consider how the platform‚Äôs reputation may influence your project‚Äôs initial impression. First impressions matter a great deal in the crypto world. Frequently asked questions (FAQ) What‚Äôs the cheapest way to launch a token? Using a DEX like Uniswap or Pump.fun is your lowest-cost option. You just need to cover gas fees and provide some liquidity‚Äîno listing fees, no middlemen. Do I need a developer to launch a token? Not necessarily. No-code tools like Pump.fun let you launch with zero coding skills. But if you want custom features or better security, having a developer is a smart move. How long does it take to get listed on a CEX? It varies. Top-tier exchanges like Binance can take months and require deep due diligence. Others, like MEXC or Gate.io, might list your token in just a few weeks if everything checks out. How long does it take to get listed on a DEX? It‚Äôs usually fast. On permissionless platforms like Uniswap, you can launch a trading pair and add liquidity in minutes. No approvals needed. How can I make my token more accessible after launch? Platforms like ChangeNOW help with post-launch distribution by supporting instant, non-custodial swaps across 100+ blockchains. This lets users trade your token without registration, expanding its reach and usability without going through a CEX. Conclusion: Top 5 Token Listing Platforms in 2025 Token listing in 2025 isn‚Äôt a one-size-fits-all process; it depends on your goals, your community, and where your users already spend their time. DEXs offer speed, affordability, and accessibility, making them a great place to start. Tools like Pump.fun and DEX aggregators can help you gain early traction with minimal friction. As your project matures, listing on a centralized exchange can help expand your reach, but it comes with stricter requirements and higher expectations. Ultimately, it‚Äôs not just about where you list, but when and why. The best launch strategy is the one that meets your users where they are and grows with them over time.

Despite the regulatory restriction, decentralized protocols have continued to offer attractive returns through staking, fueling demand for tokens like Ethena‚Äôs USDe and Sky‚Äôs USDS. Since July 18, the circulating supply of USDe has jumped by 70%, reaching 9.49 billion coins, according to DefiLlama data. This rise has elevated USDe to the third-largest stablecoin by market capitalization. Meanwhile, USDS‚Äôs supply has grown by 23% to 4.81 billion, making it the fourth-largest stablecoin in circulation. The surge in demand for USDe has also had a positive effect on its governance token, ENA, which has rallied nearly 60% since mid-July. ENA is currently trading at $0.58, according to CoinMarketCap. Investors Shift to Protocol-Based Yield Models The growth of these assets appears to be driven by an investor pivot to protocol-based yield mechanisms, which remain legally viable under the GENIUS Act. By staking stablecoins within the protocol‚Äôs native system, tokenholders can still earn passive income. ‚ÄúSurprising winners in a post-GENIUS era ‚Äî yield-bearing stablecoin supply is up a TON,‚Äù wrote Anthony Yim, co-founder of blockchain analytics firm Artemis, in a post on X. Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, echoed this view, stating that investors are ‚Äúflocking to USDe and USDS‚Äù because they offer yield in a more compliant and decentralized way. ‚ÄúThe GENIUS Act banned issuers from offering yield directly, but protocols offering native staking options are filling that gap,‚Äù he told Cointelegraph. These staking mechanisms often leverage real-world assets, such as U.S. Treasurys or lending platforms, to generate returns. Currently, staked USDe (sUSDe) offers a 10.86% APY, while staked USDS (sUSDS) yields 4.75%. Adjusted for the U.S. inflation rate of 2.7% in June, this gives real returns of 8.16% and 2.05%, respectively. Stablecoin Market Eyes $300 Billion Milestone The total stablecoin market has grown from $205 billion at the beginning of 2025 to $268 billion, a 23.5% increase . Julio Moreno believes that if the current pace continues, stablecoin supply could reach $300 billion by year-end. However, Temujin Louie, CEO of Wanchain, warned that tokenization of money market funds by traditional finance players could limit this growth. As financial institutions adopt blockchain for regulated, interest-bearing products, stablecoins may face increased competition.

Spot Crypto Contracts Approved on Futures Exchanges The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has announced a new initiative to allow the trading of spot crypto asset contracts on federally registered futures exchanges, marking a significant development in the evolution of US digital asset regulation. Acting Chairman Caroline Pham said the plan aims to facilitate immediate trading of digital assets in coordination with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under a broader framework dubbed ‚ÄúProject Crypto.‚Äù The initiative is positioned as the starting point of a wider ‚Äúcrypto sprint‚Äù launched to implement key recommendations from the President‚Äôs Working Group on Financial Markets. Push for Regulatory Clarity and Federal Oversight According to Pham, the CFTC already holds the authority to oversee such trading under the Commodity Exchange Act, which mandates that retail commodity trades involving leverage, margin, or financing must be conducted through designated contract markets (DCMs). Spot crypto trading has been operating in largely unregulated venues until now. The new move seeks to bring it under federal supervision. To support the rollout, the CFTC is soliciting feedback from stakeholders regarding the listing of spot crypto asset contracts on DCMs. In particular, it seeks comment on section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Commodity Exchange Act, the CFTC‚Äôs Part 40 regulations, and how these might intersect with securities laws under the SEC‚Äôs jurisdiction. Public comments will be accepted until August 18 via the CFTC‚Äôs official website. Industry Impact and Broader Strategy This latest regulatory move comes amid a broader shift in federal crypto policy under the Trump administration. President Trump, shortly after taking office in January, directed the creation of a dedicated crypto working group to streamline oversight and fulfill campaign promises to foster innovation in the sector. SEC Chair Paul Atkins has also signaled a more accommodating stance, directing staff to develop clearer guidance on how digital tokens are classified and to consider tailored disclosure and exemption frameworks. These moves contrast sharply with the Biden-era approach, which saw several major exchanges, including Coinbase and Binance, targeted in high-profile enforcement actions that have since been dropped. A Turning Point for US Crypto Markets Industry analysts view the coordinated regulatory momentum from the CFTC and SEC as a meaningful shift that could pave the way for a broader range of digital assets to be listed and traded on US platforms. Joseph Edwards of Enigma Securities noted that steps like these could accelerate the integration of digital assets into mainstream financial infrastructure over the next two years. Pham reiterated the strategic vision behind the initiative, stating, ‚ÄúTogether, we will make America the crypto capital of the world.‚Äù Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Key Takeaways: Coinbase and PayPal continue offering stablecoin rewards despite a federal ban targeting issuers. Both firms argue they are not subject to the law since they are not the actual stablecoin issuers. Global corporate interest in stablecoins remains strong. The GENIUS Act, signed into law last month , prohibits issuers of stablecoins from offering interest or yield to users, aiming to distinguish stablecoins as payment tools rather than investment products. The legislation was a hard-fought compromise, with lawmakers rejecting crypto industry attempts to allow yield-bearing stablecoins. Coinbase and PayPal Defy Stablecoin Law, Say Yield Rules Don‚Äôt Apply In recent earnings calls, executives at both Coinbase and PayPal confirmed they will continue rewarding users who hold stablecoins on their platforms, arguing the law does not apply to them. ‚ÄúWe are not the issuer,‚Äù Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said , responding to a shareholder question. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt pay interest or yield, we pay rewards.‚Äù Coinbase currently offers US users 4.1% APY on USDC holdings, calling the payout a ‚Äúrewards program.‚Äù While Coinbase co-developed USDC with Circle, it ceased being a formal issuer of the stablecoin in 2023. Circle, now the sole issuer, offers no direct yield to users. Coinbase's stablecoin revenue is up 44% year-to-date vs. the same period last year, despite 100bps of rate cuts since then. pic.twitter.com/Z1BoNH8Bhl ‚Äî Ryan Rasmussen (@RasterlyRock) July 31, 2025 PayPal, meanwhile, offers 3.7% annual returns to users holding its stablecoin, PYUSD, through both PayPal and Venmo. While PYUSD bears the company‚Äôs name, it is technically issued by Paxos, a third-party firm. That legal distinction allows PayPal to argue it, too, is not violating the GENIUS Act. PayPal CEO James Alexander Chriss defended the rewards structure during last week‚Äôs earnings call, calling it a key feature for user growth. The SEC dropped a long-running investigation into PYUSD‚Äôs classification earlier this year. Stablecoins are also gaining ground for their cost-efficiency. The global average remittance fee still hovers around 6.6%, well above the UN‚Äôs 3% target. However, not everyone is on board. Senator Elizabeth Warren warned that private firms launching stablecoins could lead to privacy invasions and systemic risks. ‚ÄúThen they‚Äôll come begging for a bailout when it inevitably blows up,‚Äù she said. Despite such concerns, interest from global corporations , including Amazon, Walmart, and Chinese giants like JD.com and Alipay, suggests the race is well underway. Stablecoins Edge Closer to Mainstream Adoption Western Union is positioning itself for a new phase of digital transformation, signaling strong interest in using stablecoins to modernize its global remittance operations. Last month, CEO Devin McGranahan outlined how stablecoins could streamline cross-border transfers, improve currency conversion in underserved markets, and provide financial tools for populations grappling with unstable local currencies. ‚ÄúWe see stablecoins really as an opportunity, not as a threat,‚Äù McGranahan said, pointing to ongoing pilot programs in South America and Africa. As reported, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has said the stablecoin sector is poised for explosive growth, projecting the market could balloon from its current $250 billion capitalization to as much as $2 trillion in the near future. ‚ÄúMany people think it will reach $1 to $2 trillion in a handful of years,‚Äù Garlinghouse said, adding that Ripple is positioned to benefit from that trajectory.

The comments came after Trump told CNBC‚Äôs Squawk Box that he was planning to sharply raise tariffs on Indian exports, warning the current 25% threshold could go even higher within 24 hours. Trump said India had been ‚Äúbuying Russian oil‚Äù and ‚Äúfueling the war machine,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to be happy‚Äù if they kept it up. He also accused India of reselling discounted oil from Moscow for ‚Äúbig profits‚Äù on the global market. Kremlin rejects pressure, backs India‚Äôs trade freedom Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov responded Tuesday by rejecting Trump‚Äôs threats outright. ‚ÄúWe do not consider such statements to be legitimate,‚Äù Peskov said during a briefing, adding, ‚ÄúThese are attempts to force countries to stop trade relations with Russia.‚Äù He stressed that countries like India have the right to choose their own trade and economic partners based on what benefits them. The comments followed Trump‚Äôs earlier warning on Monday that tariffs on Indian goods would rise ‚Äúsubstantially,‚Äù though he still hasn‚Äôt named a specific figure beyond the original 25% duty. The president had already floated the idea of a new ‚Äúpenalty‚Äù last week if India didn‚Äôt stop doing business with Russia. This standoff between Washington and New Delhi over oil imports is drawing attention from global investors. India, one of Russia‚Äôs biggest current buyers, has continued to import large volumes of crude despite Western sanctions aimed at cutting off the Kremlin‚Äôs war funds. Russia became India‚Äôs largest oil supplier after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. India defends ties with Russia, sends key officials to Moscow India isn‚Äôt backing away from the partnership. In fact, it‚Äôs deepening it. Ajit Doval, India‚Äôs National Security Adviser, is heading to Russia this week, and S. Jaishankar, the External Affairs Minister, will follow later in the month. Indian officials familiar with the trips confirmed the plans, though details remain private for now. Doval‚Äôs travel was first reported by The Times of India on Tuesday. The trips come right after Trump‚Äôs latest round of tariff threats. But Indian officials have pushed back hard. The Foreign Ministry issued a statement dismissing U.S. and European Union criticism as ‚Äúunjustified and unreasonable,‚Äù pointing out that those same countries are still trading with Moscow even when it‚Äôs not vital to their national interests. ‚ÄúIt is revealing that the very nations criticizing India are themselves indulging in trade with Russia,‚Äù the ministry said. ‚ÄúUnlike our case, such trade is not even a vital national compulsion [for them].‚Äù Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has maintained close contact with Vladimir Putin, traveling to Russia last October. Putin is expected to visit India later this year, and that visit will likely be discussed during Doval and Jaishankar‚Äôs meetings in Moscow. Since the invasion began in 2022, the trade bond between the two countries has grown sharply. Before the war, India bought fewer than 100,000 barrels of oil per day from Russia, which made up just 2.5% of its total crude imports. By 2023, that number jumped to over 1.8 million barrels per day, or 39% of all oil coming into the country. Western countries have tried to block Russia‚Äôs energy revenues by putting limits on imports and imposing sanctions, but India and China have continued to purchase at scale. Unlike their Western counterparts, India says its dependency on Russian oil is essential.

Ethereum Technical Analysis: ETH Eyes $4,050 Bullish Flag Breakout Despite ETF Selloff From a technical perspective, Ethereum‚Äôs 4-hour chart displays a classic bullish flag formation that recently broke higher, indicating potential trend continuation. The price surge from below $3,400 to the $3,700 zone has led to consolidation within a tight range, currently retesting the breakout area. The measured target from this flag pattern suggests a move toward the previous swing high resistance near $4,050, representing approximately 10% upside potential from the breakout level. Source: TradingView The MACD indicator reinforces this bullish outlook, having crossed into positive territory with the MACD line advancing above the signal line and the histogram displaying increasing bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the RSI reading of 56.74 shows upward momentum while remaining well below overbought conditions, indicating room for additional gains before exhaustion signals emerge. CryptoQuant analyst Abramchart shares this optimistic perspective regarding Bitcoin, stating that the BTC price remains within a bullish zone, primarily supported by Long-Term Holder (LTH) confidence and conviction. The analyst attributes the current dip and selling pressure to short-term holders and retail participants. Julio Moreno, Head of Research at CryptoQuant, concurs that the crypto bull market is not yet over, explaining that Bitcoin is currently experiencing its third significant profit-taking wave in the present bull cycle, leading to a consolidation and correction phase before the next upward movement.

While near-term volatility may persist, especially around the $116K retest zone, a sustained breakout from the current consolidation could pave the way for a renewed bullish rally. Technical Analysis By ShayanMarkets The Daily Chart Following a wave of heightened selling pressure, partly fueled by geopolitical tensions between Russia and the USA, Bitcoin broke below the lower boundary of its long-standing ascending channel. The decline extended toward the key $112K support range, which coincides with a major breaker block, indicating the presence of significant demand. This level successfully halted the decline, initiating a rebound toward the previously broken channel boundary near the $116K region. This movement likely represents a pullback to retest the trendline, a typical market behavior after a breakdown. Should this retest be completed, a secondary rejection is plausible, potentially resulting in another shakeout toward the $112K support. Nonetheless, the price action within this zone suggests a phase of bullish consolidation, as the market prepares for a more decisive move. The 4-Hour Chart Zooming into the lower timeframe, Bitcoin has demonstrated strong support around the $112K level. This region aligns with both the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level and the lower boundary of a bullish flag pattern, both technically significant structures that attract buyers. Recent price action indicates a corrective phase, implying a potential continuation of the broader uptrend. As long as Bitcoin remains supported above the $112K range, the prevailing outlook remains bullish. However, extended sideways consolidation within the flag pattern is likely before any decisive breakout occurs. Sentiment Analysis By ShayanMarkets Recent futures order flow data highlights a sharp rise in small-sized positions, a strong indicator of retail trader activity within the current $112K‚Äì$118K range. This spike in smaller orders suggests that retail is actively engaging during this consolidation phase. What‚Äôs notably absent is significant large-scale sell-side activity (typically represented by green circles in order flow heatmaps). These large sell orders, often attributed to institutions or whales, are currently not present, signaling that smart money is not exiting the market or betting against the uptrend. Historically, this combination ‚Äì high retail involvement and quiet institutional activity ‚Äì often precedes bullish breakouts. It typically represents a ‚Äúcooling-off‚Äù period, allowing the market to absorb recent gains and reset before another upward move. The lack of panic selling by whales reinforces the idea that this is healthy consolidation, not a trend reversal. If the current range resolves to the upside, we may see a renewed wave of demand driving Bitcoin toward new highs.

BounceBit , an innovative CeDeFi (Centralized Decentralized Finance) infrastructure platform, has just launched its highly anticipated BB Prime platform. This move is set to redefine how institutional investors access yield in the crypto space, truly bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized ecosystems. What is BB Prime and How Does it Work? At its core, BB Prime is a structured yield platform designed to offer a secure and compliant pathway for institutional capital into the crypto market. It‚Äôs not just another DeFi protocol; it‚Äôs a strategic collaboration that brings together the best of both worlds. BounceBit has partnered with global asset management giant Franklin Templeton to make this vision a reality. The Partnership: Franklin Templeton, a well-established name in traditional finance, brings its expertise and its tokenized U.S. Treasury-backed money market fund (MMF), known as BENJI. The Mechanism: BB Prime combines the stability of these tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) with dynamic crypto-based yield strategies. This means institutions can use compliant collateral, like BENJI, to participate in the burgeoning crypto yield landscape. The Goal: BounceBit describes this partnership as a significant leap towards seamlessly integrating traditional finance with decentralized finance, opening up new avenues for secure and compliant yield generation. Unlocking RWA-Backed Yield : The Core of BB Prime The concept of RWA-backed yield is a game-changer. For years, institutional investors have eyed the high yields available in crypto but have been hesitant due to regulatory uncertainties and volatility. BB Prime directly addresses these concerns by leveraging the stability and compliance of real-world assets. Consider the benefits: Stability: By using tokenized U.S. Treasuries as collateral, the underlying assets are inherently stable and regulated, offering a stark contrast to purely volatile crypto collateral. Compliance: Franklin Templeton‚Äôs involvement ensures that the RWA component adheres to traditional financial regulations, making the platform attractive to institutions that must operate within strict compliance frameworks. Enhanced Yield: Investors can now access the attractive yields offered by crypto strategies, but with the added security layer of RWA collateral, potentially mitigating some of the inherent risks. This creates a compelling proposition for those seeking diversified and robust returns. The Broader Impact: CeDeFi ‚Äòs Evolution with BounceBit BB Prime is more than just a new product; it‚Äôs a testament to the growing maturity of the CeDeFi sector. CeDeFi aims to blend the transparency and innovation of decentralized finance with the security and regulatory adherence of centralized entities. BounceBit is at the forefront of this evolution. This launch signals several key trends: Institutional Adoption: The explicit focus on institutional investors, combined with the partnership with a traditional finance giant, indicates a strong push for broader institutional engagement in crypto. Tokenized Assets: The increasing use of tokenized assets , particularly those backed by tangible, regulated real-world assets, is a critical step towards mainstream acceptance of blockchain technology beyond speculative cryptocurrencies. Risk Mitigation: By offering a compliant collateral mechanism, BB Prime helps reduce counterparty risk and provides a more structured environment for yield generation, appealing to risk-averse investors. This initiative from BounceBit is paving the way for a more integrated financial future where the strengths of traditional and decentralized systems are combined for mutual benefit. A New Horizon for Financial Innovation The launch of BB Prime by BounceBit, in collaboration with Franklin Templeton, marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency and traditional finance landscapes. By skillfully blending the stability of tokenized U.S. Treasuries with the lucrative potential of crypto yield strategies, BounceBit is not just offering a new product; it is crafting a new paradigm for secure, compliant, and attractive investment opportunities for institutional players. This initiative truly demonstrates the power of CeDeFi to bridge previously disparate financial worlds, setting a precedent for future innovations in the space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is BB Prime? A1: BB Prime is a structured yield platform launched by BounceBit in partnership with Franklin Templeton. It allows institutional investors to use compliant, tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) as collateral to access crypto-based yield strategies. Q2: How does BB Prime bridge traditional finance and crypto? A2: BB Prime bridges these worlds by integrating Franklin Templeton‚Äôs tokenized U.S. Treasury-backed money market fund (BENJI) with crypto yield strategies. This provides a compliant and stable asset base for crypto investments. Q3: What are Real-World Assets (RWAs) in this context? A3: In this context, RWAs refer to assets from the traditional financial world, such as U.S. Treasury bonds, that have been tokenized (represented on a blockchain). Franklin Templeton‚Äôs BENJI token is an example of such a tokenized asset. Q4: Who is the target audience for BB Prime? A4: BB Prime is primarily designed for institutional investors who seek compliant and secure ways to generate yield from both traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets. Q5: What are the main benefits of using BB Prime? A5: Key benefits include access to stable RWA-backed collateral, enhanced crypto yield strategies, institutional-grade compliance, and a reduction in counterparty risk compared to purely crypto-native solutions. Q6: What is CeDeFi? A6: CeDeFi, or Centralized Decentralized Finance, is a hybrid approach that combines elements of centralized financial services (like regulatory compliance and institutional-grade security) with the transparency and innovation of decentralized finance protocols.

While initially riding the hype of a massive airdrop and promises of decentralization, the token‚Äôs steep decline is now raising uncomfortable questions about tokenomics, aggressive unlocks, and venture capital exit strategies. Source: CryptoNews/TradingView Launched with significant community backing in late 2023, Celestia‚Äôs TIA token was distributed to 580,000 users through one of the largest airdrops in recent memory. TIA surged to $20 in September 2024, fueled by optimism around Celestia‚Äôs architecture and adoption prospects. However, as vesting cliffs began to expire, large volumes of previously locked tokens entered circulation. According to Tokenomist data , many of these belonged to early backers and core contributors, including venture capital firms that had acquired TIA at deep discounts during early fundraising rounds. The result was a flood of sell pressure. As these tokens hit the open market, TIA‚Äôs price collapsed, reaching lows of just $1.65, a drop of over 90%. Despite this, the token‚Äôs market cap rose by 50%, now hovering around $1.2 billion. Polychain Exit and Celestia‚Äôs Attempt to Regain Control The tipping point came in July when one of Celestia‚Äôs most prominent backers, Polychain Capital, divested entirely from the project. The Celestia Foundation announced a $62.5 million buyback of Polychain‚Äôs entire remaining TIA holdings, priced at approximately $1.44 per token, near its market rate at the time. In an effort to stabilize the token economy, the foundation plans to redistribute the repurchased tokens under a new rolling unlock schedule, starting August 16 and concluding November 14. The revised structure is part of a broader strategy to manage inflation and repair investor trust. The Celestia Foundation has worked with Polychain Capital to assign Polychain‚Äôs entire remaining TIA holdings to new investors. This month, the Foundation purchased 43,451,616.09 TIA from Polychain Capital for $62.5m. Polychain will shortly be undelegating their entire staked‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Celestia (@celestia) July 24, 2025 Criticism had been building around Polychain‚Äôs handling of staking rewards. Despite their initial investment still being under lock, on-chain analysts estimate the firm offloaded more than $240 million worth of TIA, primarily from staking yield. The heavy sell-offs were seen by many as exploiting loopholes in the reward system, disproportionately benefiting early insiders at the expense of retail participants. In response, Celestia introduced a staking reform as part of its upcoming ‚ÄúLotus‚Äù mainnet upgrade . The update implemented a lock mechanism in which early investors will no longer be able to cash out staking yields prematurely, ensuring that reward access is aligned with long-term commitment to the network. From Blast to Bust: TIA Crash Indicates Fragility of New Tokenomics The recent plunge in Celestia‚Äôs TIA token price mirrors a broader pattern plaguing newer Layer 1 and Layer 2 projects, where aggressive unlock schedules and liquidity mismanagement dismantle early hype. The most striking collapse came from Blast , which initially attracted over $2.7 billion in Total Value Locked (TVL), becoming the sixth-largest blockchain within six months. At its peak, it boasted more than 200 deployed dApps and 180,000 daily active users. But the momentum was short-lived. A massive June 2024 unlock, over 10.5 billion tokens, accounting for more than half its supply, flooded the market, crashing prices to all-time lows. As of today, TVL has cratered by over 96% to just $105 million, with daily activity down to 3,800 users. Also, Berachain suffered a 50% price drop within hours of launch amid insider trading accusations and an unpopular airdrop that saw some users receive millions while others got nothing. BERA soared to $14.83, then crashed 50%. Insider trading or just another crypto flop? With anonymous founders and an airdrop that left some with zero tokens and others with millions, Berachain's future is on shaky ground. #Berachain #BERA https://t.co/zQmFywsmxf ‚Äî Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) February 7, 2025 Similarly, Omni Network ‚Äôs token fell over 50% on launch day. With another 15.98 million OMNI unlocking on May 3, worth nearly $40 million at current prices, the bearish trend seems likely to continue. OMNI has already lost over 92% from its all-time high of $53.81. These failures underscore a growing skepticism around newer tokens that prioritize early liquidity and inflated valuations over sustainable ecosystem growth. Token Unlocks Continue to Pressure Market as Major Projects Brace for Volatility The crypto market is preparing for another turbulent week as major token unlocks threaten to shake investor sentiment. Between August 4 and August 10, 2025, several high-profile projects, such as Ethena (ENA), Jito Labs (JTO), and Immutable (IMX), will release millions in tokens, potentially creating fresh waves of volatility. Top 7 Token Unlocks of the Upcoming Week The following tokens with the largest unlock amount will be unlocked next week: $ENA ‚Äì $101.87M $JTO ‚Äì $19.07M $IMX ‚Äì $12.15M $MOVE ‚Äì $6.44M $GAL ‚Äì $3.69M $SXT ‚Äì $2.18M $AI ‚Äì $2.05M pic.twitter.com/h8SKCFdLM4 ‚Äî CryptoRank.io (@CryptoRank_io) August 3, 2025 Ethena tops the list with a scheduled unlock of 171.85 million ENA tokens on August 5, worth an estimated $101.87 million, or 2.70% of its market cap. ENA‚Äôs price has already slipped -61.43% from its all-time high of $1.52 and is now trading at $0.5883. The project previously conducted a widely followed airdrop in April 2024, distributing 750 million tokens to participants. However, the fresh supply could pressure prices further if recipients decide to sell into the unlock. On August 7, Jito Labs will release 11.31 million JTO tokens , worth $19.07 million and accounting for 3.14% of its market cap. The Solana-based DeFi project distributed around $225 million worth of tokens during its December 2023 airdrop. Since then, JTO has fallen -70.13% from its all-time high of $5.61, currently trading at $1.69, raising concerns about continued downside risk. Immutable will unlock $12.15 million worth of IMX tokens on August 8, or 1.30% of its market cap. While over 95.1% of IMX‚Äôs total supply has already been released, the unlock still matters, as IMX has plummeted -94.57% from its peak of $9.50 and is now trading at just $0.5173. IMX‚Äôs token dynamics reflect the trend seen across many airdrop-heavy projects‚Äîbrief initial hype followed by sharp post-unlock sell-offs. These upcoming unlocks come at a time when market confidence in airdrop-distributed tokens continues to falter. With airdrop recipients often acting as aggressive sellers, future unlocks, especially in a bearish or sideways market, could exacerbate downward pressure across the altcoin sector.

Stablecoins. Lending. Payments. You name it, it‚Äôs being built on Bitcoin. And users are finally taking to it with aplomb. Now that the core tooling and infra has been built out, almost anything that can be done on Ethereum can be done on Bitcoin, enhanced by being anchored to the security of Proof of Work. It‚Äôs been a long time in the making, but Bitcoin DeFi is finally a working reality. Despite the limitations of the Bitcoin network‚Äôs non-Turing complete scripting language, when scalable Layer 2s are plugged in, including EVM-compatible chains ‚Äì these barriers are effectively overcome. As a result, onchain finance on Bitcoin ‚Äì both decentralized and centralized ‚Äì is positively thriving as the following five projects show. They‚Äôre not the only ones operating on the frontlines of Bitcoin finance, but they deserve credit for doing much of the heavy lifting. The innovations they‚Äôve fostered have raised the bar for what can be done with BTC. Strike: Global BTC Payments via Lightning Network Who said Bitcoin was too slow and expensive for payments? When you‚Äôre using Lightning Network (LN), fees are nominal and confirmations are almost instant. And complexity isn‚Äôt an issue either when you‚Äôre using Strike to handle the entire process, making LN feel as easy to use as paying with credit card. The Strike app effectively transforms BTC and other assets into currencies that can be used for sending payments globally. It even allows individuals and businesses to receive payments in their local currency. One of the most promising applications for Strike is in the field of remittance ‚Äì unsurprisingly it‚Äôs proving particularly popular in LATAM countries such as Mexico, aided by partnerships with local payment providers. Strike is also ideal for saving bitcoin ‚Äì convert your fiat into BTC and start stacking sats ‚Äì and it can also be used for bill payments and lending. You don‚Äôt have to be a hardcore bitcoiner to appreciate Strike, but if you‚Äôre big on BTC, it‚Äôs the ultimate payment and savings app. Roxom: The First Bitcoin-Based Stock Exchange Imagine being able to trade stocks using bitcoin. Well stop imagining cos from September that‚Äôs exactly what you‚Äôll be able to do. There‚Äôs a lot of excitement building around Roxom as it finalizes its novel exchange that looks to bring TradFi to Bitcoin ‚Äì or is it the other way around? Whatever the case, the facts are thus: soon you‚Äôll be able to trade stocks and other traditional markets using BTC as collateral. This means the ability to go long or short on RWAs such as indices, commodities and FX, all priced in BTC. This means you don‚Äôt need to even mess around with fiat currency: you can work with the crypto you know and love the best, leveraging it to gain access to the best that TradFi has to offer. This is the evolution of Bitcoin infra: secure, versatile, and dependable. For institutions, professional traders, and experienced users with a foot in both worlds ‚Äì onchain and off ‚Äì Roxom is the real deal. Mobilum: The Bitcoin Banking App Mobilum aims to become the all-in-one bitcoin banking app, handling crypto-fiat payments within a single, user-friendly application. Sign up, get verified, order your Mobilum debit card and you can spend BTC and other cryptocurrencies anywhere Mastercard, Apple Pay, or Google Pay are accepted. The Mobilum app‚Äôs clean UX makes it easy to manage expenses, budget, and keep track of your finances. You can order multiple cards too, with the firm‚Äôs debit card soon to be complemented by a branded credit card. Crypto-based payment and spending solutions have come a long way over the last five years as Mobilum shows. It‚Äôs no longer a case of still needing to rely on a conventional neobank app to take care of real-world bills: Mobilum can handle it all. Its app is naturally also handy when it comes to buying crypto, allowing you to stock up on BTC and other digital assets with the ability to cash out at any time. Mobilum‚Äôs neobank service is being gradually rolled out this year, transforming the application into the only banking app you‚Äôll ever need. Blockstream: Bitcoin‚Äôs Infra Specialist Blockstream is one of Bitcoin‚Äôs oldest companies and few companies know their way around its codebase better than this industry OG. It‚Äôs played an outsized role in the development of Lightning Network and has its finger in many pies. Blockstream, remember, was the first company to put Bitcoin into space, using a satellite to enable anyone to sync their node and connect to its network ‚Äì even if there‚Äôs no conventional internet. While many of Blockstream‚Äôs best-known products are developer-focused, it also builds B2C solutions that allow retail users to do more with their BTC. The Blockstream app enables you to purchase BTC and securely self-custody it. The app is beautifully designed, elevating the user experience into something quite special. There might be a lot going on under the hood, but on the front end all of that complexity has been deftly abstracted. Naturally, it also integrates Lightning Network so you can use BTC exactly as you like, be it for spending or saving. Fully open source and independently auditable, the Blockstream app is as suited to beginners as it is to experienced users who‚Äôve been slinging BTC since back in the day. Stacks and Hiro Wallet: Bitcoin Smart Contracts on Layer 2 Stacks is the leading Bitcoin Layer 2, bringing powerful smart contract functionality that supports DeFi, Ordinals, and much more, all anchored by Bitcoin‚Äôs rock-solid security. For developers looking to take advantage of this capability, Hiro is the developer they turn to for tooling. Its dev solutions make it easier to get started building on Bitcoin, all enhanced by tutorials that provide full guidance from start to finish. Using Hiro, for instance, it‚Äôs possible to create a great looking and highly secure Stacks wallet that can be used to interact with the numerous dapps that are now live on Stacks‚Äô L2. Hiro provides wallet templates that can be rapidly customized and deployed, with plug-and-play add-ons such as Ordinals and Runes support. Stacks is starting to pick up real momentum now as DeFi takes root on its fast and low-cost Layer 2 and infra specialists such as Hiro are playing a major role in facilitating this. If you‚Äôve yet to seriously explore Bitcoin-based onchain finance, you‚Äôre missing out. There‚Äôs so much that can be done now within the Bitcoin ecosystem and it doesn‚Äôt require elite tech skills to get started. The learning curve has been massively reduced thanks to the efforts of projects such as the five profiled here. As a result, Bitcoin finance feels just like any other form of finance, be it web2 or web3-based but with one critical difference ‚Äì it‚Äôs backed and secured by the soundest money ever made.

This development has coincided with the recent crypto market crash, as investors choose to wait on the sidelines amid market uncertainty. Shiba Inu‚Äôs Open Interest Crashes To $190 Million Coinglass data shows that Shiba Inu‚Äôs Open Interest is currently at $190 million, down significantly from its July peak of $328 million recorded on the 22nd of last month. Since then, the OI has declined daily, indicating a drop in interest in the meme coin among traders. Open Interest refers to the number of open positions on an asset at a particular time. A plausible reason for the drop in Shiba Inu‚Äôs Open Interest is the crypto market correction , which has occurred over the last two weeks. SHIB has dropped from its local high of around $0.000016 as a result. Meanwhile, the meme coin is down over 8% in the last seven days. Notably, Shiba Inu had hit this local high on July 21, which highlights the correlation between price performance and this derivatives metric. One reason for this market correction is the Trump tariffs , which are set to take effect from August 7. The U.S. president yesterday threatened to substantially raise tariffs on India from the current proposed 25%. This is a development that could further impact the markets, including crypto assets like Shiba Inu. The tariffs have a direct impact on the global economy and could negatively impact the flow of liquidity into these assets if they lead to inflation. Furthermore, the U.S. economy already looks to be in a fragile state, thanks to the July job report , which came in lower than expectations. A weak labor market could have several ripple effects, including a recession or stagflation, which is bearish for Shiba Inu and other assets. Some Positives For SHIB The Shiba Inu long/short ratio is currently 1.09, which indicates that most traders are still bullish on the meme coin. This could help spark a market recovery, especially as the broader crypto market picks up. SHIB, alongside other crypto prices, has shown a resurgence on July 4, as the total crypto market surged as much as 2%. Thanks to this rebound, Shiba Inu‚Äôs derivatives trading volume surged as much as 20% to $161 million. Meanwhile, crypto analyst Javon Marks has again doubled down on his prediction that the foremost meme coin can record a 500% rally to reach $0.000081. This will bring SHIB close to its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845. At the time of writing, the Shiba Inu price is trading at around $0.00001233, up in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.",Shiba Inu|Coinglass|Coinmarketcap|Javon Marks|meme coin|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shiba Inu‚Äôs Open Interest|SHIBUSD|SHIBUSDT,EN,0,0,SHIB|MARKET|TRADING|MACROECONOMICS|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-08-05 14:00:04

Riot Platforms , a prominent Bitcoin mining company , recently shared an important update regarding its July operations. This announcement highlights their strategic approach to managing their digital asset portfolio. The company confirmed on its official website that it successfully offloaded 475 BTC during July. This move demonstrates a proactive strategy in managing their substantial BTC holdings , vital for investors to understand major entities‚Äô operational flow. How Does Riot Platforms Balance Bitcoin Mining and Sales? Understanding the operational rhythm of a crypto mining company like Riot Platforms involves looking at both production and sales figures. In July, while they sold 475 BTC, the company also mined an impressive 484 BTC. This indicates a near-perfect balance between production capabilities and decisions to realize profits or manage liquidity. This careful balancing act is a hallmark of sophisticated mining operations. It allows them to cover operational costs, invest in new infrastructure, and maintain a healthy balance sheet amidst fluctuating market conditions. The decision to conduct Bitcoin sales is a calculated move, influenced by market prices and operational expenses. What Are the Benefits of Strategic BTC Holdings Management? Despite the sales, Riot Platforms increased its total Bitcoin treasury. Their total BTC holdings now stand at a remarkable 19,287 BTC. This growth, even with active sales, underscores the efficiency and scale of their mining operations, positioning them strongly for future market movements. For a leading Bitcoin mining company , effective management of mined assets offers several key advantages: Operational Flexibility: Selling Bitcoin provides immediate capital for power costs, hardware upgrades, and expansion. Risk Mitigation: Realizing profits helps hedge against potential price downturns, ensuring financial stability. Liquidity Management: Maintaining healthy cash flow is essential for any large enterprise. Long-Term Growth: Reinvesting proceeds allows companies like Riot Platforms to continuously enhance infrastructure. This approach allows Riot Platforms to sustain operations and contribute to network security while optimizing financial performance. How Do Bitcoin Sales Impact the Broader Crypto Market? Operating a large-scale Bitcoin mining facility comes with challenges: fluctuating energy prices, increasing mining difficulty, and market volatility. Companies like Riot Platforms must constantly adapt to remain profitable and competitive. Their July figures suggest a robust operational model capable of navigating these complexities. The ability to mine more Bitcoin than they sold, while growing total BTC holdings , speaks volumes about their operational efficiency and long-term vision. While Riot Platforms‚Äô Bitcoin sales are significant for the company, their direct impact on the broader market is generally contained. Large institutional sales often occur over-the-counter (OTC) to minimize market disruption, ensuring substantial amounts of Bitcoin can change hands without drastic price fluctuations. This transparency helps build trust within the community, allowing investors to see how a major crypto mining company manages its assets. Riot Platforms‚Äô July operational update paints a clear picture of a well-managed and strategically sound Bitcoin mining company . Their ability to consistently mine new Bitcoin while prudently managing their BTC holdings through measured sales demonstrates a mature approach to the volatile crypto market. This balance ensures immediate operational needs are met and long-term growth objectives are pursued. As the cryptocurrency landscape evolves, their transparency and strategic maneuvers will remain key indicators of the industry‚Äôs health and direction. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1.

In a thread on X, the quantitative researcher argued that an ‚Äúoverlooked asset class‚Äù‚Äîone he says almost no-one monitors in a crypto context‚Äîconsistently pivots months before Bitcoin does, offering what he calls ‚Äúa sneak peek at major turning points.‚Äù Villaverde‚Äôs proprietary back-testing suggests the lag is approximately six months, enough lead time, he claims, to anticipate the apex of the current bull market in late November. How Gold‚Äôs Trendlines Map The Bitcoin Price ‚ÄúMany are aware that Bitcoin tends to follow global liquidity‚Äîwith a roughly twelve-week lag,‚Äù Weiss Crypto wrote, setting the stage for the reveal. ‚ÄúBut Juan Villaverde has quietly tracked a different early indicator‚Ä¶ one that can signal where BTC is headed six months in advance.‚Äù In a follow-up post he teased, ‚ÄúThat little-known indicator? [ ‚Ä¶ ]. Turns out, its price action often leads Bitcoin by several months‚Äîproviding a sneak peek at major turning points.‚Äù Related Reading: Top Analyst Says Bitcoin Is Trapped: ‚ÄòNothing To Do Until October‚Äô Villaverde‚Äôs thesis rests on a data series stretching back to the advent of modern crypto markets. He points to the trough of December 2018, which, in his reconstruction, was foreshadowed by a significant low in the mystery market some weeks earlier. ‚ÄúAfter analysing years of data, Juan spotted a consistent pattern,‚Äù Weiss Crypto stated, quoting the analyst to the effect that ‚Äúmajor lows [there] tend to precede major lows in Bitcoin.‚Äù The same lead-lag cadence, Villaverde notes, flashed red in November 2021 when Bitcoin printed its all-time high even as the benchmark asset he tracks refused to break higher‚Äîan omen that presaged the 2022 bear market. The model is not without blemishes. Weiss Crypto acknowledged ‚Äúone exception in recent years‚Äîduring the Russia‚ÄìUkraine invasion‚Äîwhere the Bitcoin relationship temporarily inverted due to macro chaos.‚Äù Yet Villaverde maintains the anomaly reinforces rather than weakens his conviction: exogenous geopolitical shocks can distort correlations, but once the shock dissipates the historic rhythm reasserts itself. Related Reading: Bitcoin Neutral Sentiment Didn‚Äôt Last Long: Investors Already Greedy Again Where does that leave the market in mid-2025? ‚ÄúAccording to Juan‚Äôs analysis,‚Äù the firm wrote, ‚Äúthe indicator is pointing to a major high in Bitcoin around late November 2025. That aligns perfectly with his Crypto Timing Model.‚Äù Villaverde cautions that the signal is dynamic, not deterministic. If the benchmark asset he watches ‚Äúrallies above its April high,‚Äù it would imply ‚ÄúBitcoin could march higher into 2026.‚Äù Conversely, any decisive breakdown would ‚Äúbe an early warning that crypto‚Äôs bull market may be nearing its end after November.‚Äù Villaverde insists the relationship he has identified is robust because it focuses on magnitude rather than direction alone. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not only the turns that matter,‚Äù he said in a direct message to this outlet, ‚Äúbut the amplitude of those turns.‚Äù By quantifying both, he argues, the signal captures investor psychology cycling from fear to greed and back again. At press time, BTC traded at $114,522.

In a new post on the social media platform X, Armstrong says that the ad is meant to point out the failures of the traditional finance system and suggests it was removed by regulators incorrectly interpreting it as political or misunderstanding cryptocurrency. ‚ÄúOur ad which got banned in the UK by the TV networks has sparked quite a reaction. If you can‚Äôt say it, then there must be a kernel of truth in it. Needing to update the system and improve society is not a political statement on either party in the UK (some have tried to turn it into this). And it‚Äôs not specific to the UK (we ran ads with similar themes in the US). It‚Äôs a statement about how the traditional financial system is not working for many people and how crypto represents a way to improve that. There are people in the UK who still think of crypto as some kind of gambling product (a very outdated view), and have completely missed the potential of crypto which is to update and improve the financial system for the benefit of everyone. We welcome the attacks and any other attempts to censor this message, as it just helps it spread.‚Äù Armstrong does not say who specifically is responsible for banning the ad, which was posted last week on X as well as YouTube. The two-minute musical ad is titled ‚ÄúEverything Is Fine,‚Äù and highlights an impoverished UK with soaring food costs, crumbling civil infrastructure, and a growing number of people relocating to Dubai. According to the Telegraph, Clearcast, which approves or rejects advertising for TV broadcast in the UK, banned the Coinbase ad. Says Clearcast, ‚ÄúClearcast reviewed a pre-production script and rough cut for this advert. We considered that it presented cryptocurrency as a potential solution to economic challenges, without sufficient evidence for this claim or any warnings about the potential volatility and risks. We concluded that it did not comply with the BCAP code [UK code of broadcast advertising] and advised that we could not approve this approach.‚Äù The top US crypto platform previously ran afoul of ad regulators in the UK when, in 2021, the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA) deemed a Coinbase ad misleading .

This positive momentum reflects a growing optimism among traders and investors, suggesting a potential stock market rally . After a period of anticipation, seeing major indices like the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all in the green provides a welcome boost. This initial surge hints at strong investor sentiment , eager to capitalize on emerging opportunities. What‚Äôs Fueling This Positive Investor Sentiment? The upward movement in U.S. stock markets is not random; several factors typically contribute to such positive openings. Often, this includes favorable corporate earnings reports, optimistic economic data releases, or even geopolitical stability. Today‚Äôs gains indicate that market participants are absorbing positive news and reacting favorably. For instance, better-than-expected jobs data or declining inflation figures can significantly uplift moods on Wall Street. S&P 500: +0.12% ‚Äì This broad market index reflects the performance of 500 large U.S. companies. Its rise suggests widespread confidence. NASDAQ: +0.15% ‚Äì Dominated by technology and growth stocks, NASDAQ‚Äôs increase indicates strength in the innovation sector. Dow Jones Industrial Average: +0.11% ‚Äì Comprising 30 significant U.S. companies, the Dow‚Äôs climb signals stability in traditional industries. Such synchronized gains across major indices underscore a broad-based positive shift in investor sentiment . This collective optimism often creates a self-fulfilling prophecy, encouraging more buying activity. Analyzing Today‚Äôs Market Performance When U.S. stock markets open higher, it sets a positive tone for the entire trading day. The early gains, even if modest, can indicate underlying strength. This initial push can often build momentum, leading to sustained upward movement throughout the session. Understanding this early market performance is crucial for both short-term traders and long-term investors. For traders, an opening surge might present opportunities for quick gains. For long-term investors, it reinforces confidence in their portfolios, especially if their holdings align with the sectors driving the rally. However, it is important to remember that early performance does not guarantee the day‚Äôs end result. Markets can be volatile, and reversals are always possible. What does this mean for your investments? A rising tide lifts all boats, as the saying goes. Many sectors are likely benefiting from this broad positive outlook. Keeping an eye on specific sectors or companies that are outperforming the indices can provide valuable insights into where the strongest conviction lies. Looking Ahead: How Economic Indicators Shape the Future The current stock market rally is certainly exciting, but what factors will sustain it? Future market movements largely depend on upcoming economic indicators and policy decisions. Reports on inflation, interest rates, consumer spending, and manufacturing output will continue to guide market participants. Central bank policies, especially regarding interest rates, hold significant sway over equity valuations. Investors closely watch these data points for clues about the economy‚Äôs health and the potential for continued growth. A strong economy typically supports higher corporate earnings, which in turn boosts stock prices. Conversely, any signs of economic slowdown could temper the current positive mood. Therefore, staying informed about these macro-economic trends is essential for making sound investment decisions. The current positive opening provides a hopeful outlook, suggesting that the underlying economic fundamentals might be stronger than previously anticipated. This encourages continued participation and potentially more capital inflow into the U.S. stock markets . In conclusion, today‚Äôs higher opening in U.S. stock markets is a testament to prevailing positive investor sentiment . While the gains are modest, they signal a hopeful start and reflect optimism concerning various economic indicators . This robust early market performance offers a promising outlook for the trading day and potentially for the weeks to come. As always, staying informed and adapting to market shifts remains key for navigating the dynamic world of finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What does it mean when U.S. stock markets open higher? A1: It means that at the start of the trading day, the major stock indices (like the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow) are trading at higher prices than their previous closing values, indicating positive investor sentiment. Q2: Why did the U.S. stock markets open higher today? A2: The specific reasons can vary daily, but common drivers include positive economic data (e.g., strong jobs reports, lower inflation), optimistic corporate earnings announcements, or a general improvement in investor confidence. Q3: How do the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow relate to the overall market? A3: These are key indices that track the performance of different segments of the U.S. stock market. The S&P 500 is broad-based, NASDAQ focuses on technology, and the Dow represents 30 large industrial companies. Their collective movement provides a snapshot of overall market health. Q4: Does a higher opening guarantee a positive trading day? A4: No, a higher opening sets a positive tone but does not guarantee the day‚Äôs outcome. Markets can be volatile, and prices can fluctuate throughout the day based on new information or shifting sentiment. Q5: What should investors do when the market opens higher? A5: Investors should review their portfolios and investment goals. A higher opening might confirm their investment thesis or present opportunities for rebalancing, but decisions should always align with individual financial plans rather than short-term fluctuations.

Here‚Äôs Why,https://timestabloid.com/pundit-to-xrp-holders-be-mentally-ready-for-the-coming-rocket-rally-heres-why/,"A bold new statement from crypto commentator Bale has sent waves through the XRP community. In a post shared on X, Bale urged XRP holders to ‚Äúbe mentally prepared‚Äù as he hinted at a coming rally that could push XRP to $5. Without disclosing full details publicly, he claimed that the information he‚Äôs come across ‚Äúwill change the landscape of XRP,‚Äù encouraging followers to message him directly for more insight. ‚ÄúI am loading up,‚Äù he added, signaling strong personal conviction. Unconfirmed Catalyst, Growing Curiosity While Bale‚Äôs remarks have triggered enthusiasm among XRP supporters, the lack of publicly available details leaves the broader community in speculation. His post didn‚Äôt cite any official development, partnership, legal resolution, or on-chain data that would support such a sharp price movement. Still, it reflects a recurring theme in the XRP space: a deep belief that major events are brewing behind the scenes. You better be mentally prepared when XRP rockets for $5 The information I have heard will change the landscape of XRP. I am loading up. DM me if you don‚Äôt know it. ‚Äî BALE (@AltcoinBale) August 4, 2025 Bale‚Äôs call-to-action‚Äîinviting private messages instead of making public disclosures‚Äîadds to the mystery. Though some might view it as hype, others interpret it as a strategic leak of sensitive, soon-to-be-revealed information. Either way, the community is paying close attention. XRP‚Äôs Current Market Standing As of report time, XRP is trading around $3.03, having shown resilience over the past several weeks. The token has held firm above the $3 psychological level , buoyed by bullish sentiment, broader crypto market recovery, and reduced regulatory uncertainty following progress in the Ripple vs. SEC case. Momentum has been building steadily. In July, XRP hit a local peak of $3.65, a level not seen since its all-time high days in early 2018. Analysts are now watching key breakout points such as $3.185, $3.33, and $3.45, with some suggesting a new all-time high could be on the horizon if current levels hold. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Market Sentiment and Realistic Targets While a leap to $5 is not impossible, it would require more than sentiment‚Äîit would need a clear, market-moving catalyst. Possibilities include: A major partnership announcement, institutional adoption via RippleNet or the XRP Ledger, a complete and final legal resolution with the SEC, and a broader market bull cycle lifting all large-cap assets. Currently, none of these have been confirmed in connection with Bale‚Äôs post. Still, the speculation underscores the level of anticipation surrounding XRP as investors await the next major move. Be Ready, But Be Grounded Bale‚Äôs message may not include hard data, but it reflects a bullish energy that continues to define the XRP community. His confidence hints at something big, even if the details remain behind closed doors. For XRP holders, it‚Äôs another reason to remain alert, informed, and mentally prepared. But until real, verifiable news emerges, it‚Äôs important to balance hope with realism. If the coming weeks deliver what Bale has hinted at, the entire XRP landscape may indeed be ready for a powerful transformation.

Pre-orders exceed 150,000; priced $450-$500 as an affordable Saga successor with improved design. Seeker offers secure key storage, built-in dApp Store, NFT access, and enhanced Web3 app support. Deliveries of the Seeker crypto smartphone from Solana Mobile began on August 4. The first batches have already been sent to customers in 57 countries, the company reported. Pre-orders for the successor to Saga have exceeded 150,000, which is expected to generate at least $67.5 million in revenue, with the device priced between $450 and $500. Seeker runs on Android and comes with several integrated blockchain features: Seed Vault: Secure hardware storage for private keys. Built-in dApp Store: Access to over 100 applications, including DeFi aggregators, payment services, and games. Genesis Token: An NFT granting access to exclusive projects and rewards in SKR tokens. The crypto smartphone is based on the TEEPIN architecture. It enables decentralized device access and app distribution using cryptographic attestation to verify software authenticity and enhance security. Solana Mobile also plans to add AI and DePin service support to Seeker. The developers position Seeker as a more affordable alternative to the Saga, which launched at $1,000 in 2023. Due to low sales (only 20,000 units), the company lowered Saga‚Äôs price to $599. Airdrops of two meme coins for device owners helped sell out the production run quickly in the US and Europe. After Saga‚Äôs launch, CertiK analysts identified a critical vulnerability that could allow users' cryptocurrencies to be stolen. However, the developers denied the existence of any security threat. Seeker launches with an improved design featuring a brighter 6.36-inch AMOLED display, a 108+32 MP camera, and enhanced battery life optimized for Web3 applications. \",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-05 14:08:02

It has officially added artificial intelligence powerhouses OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic to its esteemed list of approved vendors. This move is not just about adopting new tools; it signifies a strategic embrace of cutting-edge AI, promising to reshape how federal agencies operate and interact with advanced technology. For an industry like crypto, which thrives on technological breakthroughs and regulatory clarity, such government initiatives in AI set important precedents for digital innovation and future policy directions. What Does This Mean for Federal AI Vendors ? The inclusion of OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic as approved federal AI vendors marks a new era for government technology procurement. These companies will now offer their sophisticated AI tools through the Multiple Awards Schedule (MSA), a federal contracting platform designed to streamline the acquisition process. Previously, individual government agencies had to navigate complex, time-consuming negotiations with each vendor. The MSA platform simplifies this significantly, allowing agencies to access pre-negotiated contracts for AI services. This change is poised to accelerate the deployment of AI capabilities across various civilian federal departments, making it easier for them to leverage the latest advancements without the usual bureaucratic hurdles. Why OpenAI Anthropic Google ? The Selection Process The General Services Administration (GSA), the body overseeing the MSA, emphasized that the selection of OpenAI Anthropic Google was not arbitrary. These tech giants underwent rigorous assessment based on stringent criteria, primarily focusing on security and performance. In an age where data integrity and system resilience are paramount, especially within government operations, ensuring that AI tools are robust and secure is critical. The GSA‚Äôs approval signals a level of trust in these companies‚Äô ability to deliver high-quality, reliable, and secure AI solutions that meet the demanding standards of federal agencies. This rigorous vetting process is crucial for maintaining national security and protecting sensitive government data. Boosting AI Services for Agencies : The Benefits Ahead The immediate benefit of this approval is the enhanced accessibility of top-tier AI services for agencies . Federal departments will now have a direct pathway to deploy advanced AI models for a multitude of tasks, from automating routine processes and analyzing vast datasets to improving decision-making and enhancing public services. This streamlined access can lead to significant improvements in efficiency, productivity, and innovation within the public sector. Agencies can now more readily explore applications like natural language processing for document analysis, predictive analytics for resource allocation, and intelligent automation for administrative tasks, all powered by some of the world‚Äôs leading AI developers. Ensuring Secure AI Adoption and Ethical Use The move to integrate advanced AI into federal operations also brings a strong emphasis on responsible and secure AI adoption . This aligns with recent executive orders from President Donald Trump, which have set clear directives for AI development and deployment. A key focus of these orders is ensuring that federal agencies utilize AI that is ‚Äòfree from ideological bias,‚Äô a critical consideration for maintaining fairness and impartiality in government functions. Furthermore, the administration has addressed the infrastructure demands of AI, including adjusting environmental standards to boost the energy supply for data centers. This holistic approach aims to balance technological advancement with ethical considerations and sustainable growth, addressing concerns around energy consumption and the potential for algorithmic bias in public applications. The Broader Impact of US Government AI Initiatives The formal approval of these leading AI firms by the US Government AI program is more than just a procurement update; it‚Äôs a powerful signal to the global technology market. It underscores the U.S. government‚Äôs commitment to leveraging AI for national advantage and sets a precedent for how other nations might approach similar integrations. This initiative could also spur further innovation within the AI sector, as companies strive to meet evolving government needs and security standards. For the broader tech ecosystem, including areas like blockchain and decentralized finance, this government adoption of advanced AI can highlight the importance of secure, transparent, and high-performance digital infrastructure, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in the digital economy. The decision to onboard OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic as official AI vendors for federal agencies marks a transformative moment. It represents a strategic step towards modernizing government operations, enhancing efficiency, and ensuring that the public sector remains at the forefront of technological advancement. By simplifying access to cutting-edge AI tools and emphasizing critical factors like security and ethical use, the U.S. government is laying the groundwork for a more intelligent, responsive, and secure future. This development will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications, influencing not only government functions but also setting new benchmarks for AI integration across various industries worldwide.

In a post featuring a liquidation heatmap from Coinglass, the analyst stated, ‚ÄúNothing stops us above $5. XRP has no walls, no pause.‚Äù The chart shows a thinning distribution of liquidity beyond the $5 level. In contrast to the densely populated zones between $2 and $4, where previous trading activity and leveraged positioning remain visible, the region beyond $5 appears almost vacant. This lack of liquidation clusters implies fewer resting sell orders and minimal leveraged exposure at higher levels, which can often translate to faster price movement if bullish momentum builds. BREAKING: NOTHING STOPS US ABOVE $5. #XRP HAS NO WALLS, NO PAUSE. pic.twitter.com/NPQQyYExPX ‚Äî STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) August 4, 2025 Clear Skies Above $5 The heatmap reveals that XRP spent most of May and June consolidating close to $2, before a sharp breakout in mid-July pushed the token firmly above $3. The climb above $3 was supported by notable liquidation density, indicating that short positions were being unwound aggressively during the rally. This rally culminated in a new peak of $3.65 . What stands out most, however, is the drop-off in liquidation-based resistance after the $4 region, which corroborates the claim that structural barriers are nearly absent in that range. This resistance disappears above $5, suggesting a smooth climb once XRP breaches that level. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The technical setup, in combination with a strong trend and diminishing friction zones, supports a continuation scenario. However, this is contingent on volume expansion and sustained buying pressure, both of which have shown mixed signals in recent sessions. XRP has since pulled back from its peak but remains well above its breakout structure. This positions the asset in a consolidation phase just below critical psychological levels, with $3 acting as a short-term pivot. What to Expect from XRP Steph‚Äôs remark about the lack of walls reflects a broader optimism among market watchers who see XRP‚Äôs recent rally not as an overextension, but as a potential springboard for an epic rally . The heatmap affirms that few traders have positioned themselves for price action above $5, which is an anomaly in a typically crowded and reactive market. While this absence of sell-side pressure is not a guarantee of immediate upside, it suggests that if momentum returns, the path toward higher valuations may involve fewer obstacles.

XRP is the smartest cryptocurrency to buy with $500 right now https://t.co/yElmDCbUiC ‚Äî USA TODAY (@USATODAY) August 3, 2025 The piece was written by Will Ebiefung, a contributor to The Motley Fool, an online publication known for sharing stock market picks and tips on individual stocks to both free and paid users. Ebiefung emphasized a couple of reasons for giving XRP that title. First, the regulatory environment in the U.S. is now more favorable than ever. Moreover, he believes that the launch of Ripple USD (RLUSD), the network‚Äôs first native stablecoin, has paved the way for accelerated adoption of this blockchain as a cheap and reliable alternative to send remittances and cross-border payments. Ebiefung‚Äôs bullish XRP price prediction is aligned with that of most Ripple investors and could resonate with a large percentage of USA Today‚Äôs audience. If the article gets enough traction and receives significant attention, as it has thus far, it could drive higher trading volumes and institutional interest toward the token. XRP Price Prediction: Descending Triangle Breakout Favors a Move Toward $4 or Higher Trading volumes in the past 24 hours have increased as XRP has booked a 3.1% gain. In the 4-hour chart, XRP has broken out of a descending triangle pattern, often seen as a bullish reversal signal. The price has reclaimed the $3 level and also broken above its most recent lower high, an early sign that a new uptrend may be forming. Momentum is also building on this shorter timeframe. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has surged above the midpoint, signaling that buyers are starting to gain control again. If this breakout holds, XRP could rise to $3.30 in the coming sessions, followed by a potential push toward $4 in the coming weeks, and $10 later in the year. Meanwhile, those looking to catch earlier-stage opportunities may want to explore crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) , a new project aiming to bring speed, affordability, and smart contract capability to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin Hyper Raises $7M+ as It Builds the Fastest Way to Use Bitcoin in DeFi Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) is a new Layer 2 built to supercharge Bitcoin by bringing it to a faster, cheaper, and smarter network.

Recent SEC filings reveal that Michigan‚Äôs state pension fund has dramatically increased its holdings in the Ark Bitcoin ETF. This isn‚Äôt just a minor adjustment; it signals a growing confidence in digital assets from established financial institutions and highlights evolving crypto investment trends . Why Michigan‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF Play Matters The latest SEC filing, as highlighted by MacroScope on X, shows Michigan‚Äôs state pension fund now holds 300,000 shares of the Ark Bitcoin ETF. As of June 30, these shares were valued at a substantial $10.7 million. This figure represents a remarkable threefold increase from the 100,000 shares reported just a few months prior, on March 31. This isn‚Äôt just about numbers; it‚Äôs about a trend that could reshape investment strategies. What does this dramatic increase signify? Growing Confidence: It shows a clear and increasing trust in Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset, even from traditionally conservative entities like state pension funds. Diversification Strategy: Pension funds constantly seek ways to diversify portfolios and generate returns. Bitcoin, through ETFs, offers a new avenue. Pioneering Move: While other institutions have dipped their toes, Michigan‚Äôs bold move could encourage more state-level entities to consider similar investments. Understanding the Rise of Institutional Crypto Adoption Michigan‚Äôs decision is part of a broader narrative of institutional crypto adoption . Over the past few years, we‚Äôve witnessed a gradual but steady integration of digital assets into mainstream finance. Major banks, asset managers, and now public pension funds are exploring how cryptocurrencies fit into their investment frameworks. This growing acceptance underscores a shift in how traditional finance views digital assets. What drives this trend? Regulatory Clarity: The introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. has provided a regulated and accessible pathway for institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. Performance Potential: Bitcoin‚Äôs historical performance and its potential as a hedge against inflation or a growth asset appeal to long-term investors. Demand from Constituents: As digital assets become more prevalent, pension funds may face pressure to explore these opportunities for their beneficiaries. This trend suggests that crypto is moving beyond speculative retail trading and becoming a recognized asset class for serious investors. What Does This Mean for State Pension Fund Bitcoin Strategies? The move by Michigan‚Äôs fund raises important questions about how other state pension fund Bitcoin strategies might evolve. Pension funds manage vast sums of money, often with a mandate to ensure long-term stability and growth for retirees. Their investment decisions are typically cautious and thoroughly vetted, emphasizing risk management and long-term viability. Considerations for Pension Funds: Risk Assessment: While Bitcoin offers potential rewards, its volatility remains a key factor. Funds must conduct rigorous risk assessments to mitigate potential downsides. Fiduciary Duty: Fund managers have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their beneficiaries, balancing risk and return to secure future pensions. Public Scrutiny: Investments by public funds are often subject to public and political scrutiny, requiring transparency and clear justifications for their decisions. Michigan‚Äôs increased stake could serve as a case study, demonstrating that with careful consideration and through regulated products like ETFs, even conservative funds can embrace digital assets. The Future of Bitcoin ETF Holdings in Public Portfolios The threefold increase in Michigan‚Äôs Bitcoin ETF holdings could be a harbinger of things to come. As the digital asset ecosystem matures and more regulated investment vehicles become available, we might see a continued influx of capital from public and private institutions. The accessibility provided by ETFs simplifies the investment process for large entities, removing many operational complexities and making digital assets more palatable for traditional portfolios. Actionable Insights for Investors: Monitor Institutional Moves: Keep an eye on SEC filings and announcements from major funds; they often signal broader market trends and potential shifts in investment paradigms. Understand ETF Mechanics: Learn how Bitcoin ETFs work and their advantages for indirect exposure to the asset without the complexities of direct ownership. Diversify Wisely: While institutional adoption is positive, always conduct your own research and consider your personal risk tolerance before making any investment decisions. This institutional interest validates Bitcoin‚Äôs growing role in the global financial landscape, potentially paving the way for even wider adoption and solidifying its place as a legitimate asset class. Michigan‚Äôs state pension fund‚Äôs decision to dramatically triple its Ark Bitcoin ETF holdings marks a pivotal moment. It underscores the accelerating trend of institutional confidence in digital assets and highlights Bitcoin‚Äôs evolving role as a legitimate component of diversified investment portfolios. As more traditional financial giants embrace this new frontier, the landscape of global finance continues to transform, with digital assets firmly taking their place. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Michigan state pension fund‚Äôs recent Bitcoin ETF investment? The Michigan state pension fund recently tripled its holdings in the Ark Bitcoin ETF to 300,000 shares, valued at $10.7 million as of June 30, up from 100,000 shares on March 31. Why is the increase in Michigan‚Äôs Ark Bitcoin ETF holdings significant? This threefold increase signals growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate investment asset from a traditionally conservative institution, highlighting a broader trend of institutional crypto adoption. What does ‚Äúinstitutional crypto adoption‚Äù mean? Institutional crypto adoption refers to the increasing integration of cryptocurrencies and digital assets into the portfolios and operations of large financial institutions, such as pension funds, banks, and asset managers. Are Bitcoin ETFs a safe investment for pension funds? While Bitcoin ETFs offer regulated exposure, pension funds must conduct thorough risk assessments due to Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility and adhere to their fiduciary duties, balancing potential returns with inherent risks. Will other state pension funds follow Michigan‚Äôs lead? Michigan‚Äôs increased stake could serve as a case study, potentially encouraging other state pension funds to explore similar Bitcoin ETF holdings as they seek diversification and respond to evolving crypto investment trends.

A fascinating development is unfolding in Southeast Asia, where Indonesia is actively exploring the potential of a Bitcoin reserve . This bold consideration could mark a significant shift in the nation‚Äôs economic policy. Reports indicate that the office of the Indonesian Vice President has engaged in discussions regarding strategic Bitcoin reserve plans with key pro-crypto officials. This isn‚Äôt just a casual conversation; the idea of directly mining Bitcoin to bolster national assets has also entered the discourse, according to The Crypto Basic. This signals a serious exploration of a new financial frontier for the archipelago nation. Why is Indonesia Considering a Bitcoin Reserve? Indonesia‚Äôs interest in a Bitcoin reserve stems from several factors. The nation recognizes the increasing global acceptance of digital assets and their potential as a hedge against inflation or geopolitical instability. Holding Bitcoin could diversify Indonesia‚Äôs foreign exchange reserves, offering a novel layer of economic resilience. This strategic move aligns with a forward-thinking approach to national finance. One key benefit is the potential for long-term value appreciation. As a decentralized asset, Bitcoin operates independently of traditional financial systems, offering a unique alternative. This exploration by Indonesia Bitcoin officials highlights a growing recognition of cryptocurrency‚Äôs role in the future global economy. Furthermore, the discussion around direct Bitcoin mining suggests an ambition to not just acquire, but also produce, this digital asset. This could create new domestic industries and employment opportunities, further integrating the nation into the burgeoning digital economy. The Path to National Digital Currency Adoption While a national digital currency often refers to a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), Indonesia‚Äôs consideration of a Bitcoin reserve is a distinct yet complementary step. A Bitcoin reserve would serve as an external asset, much like gold or foreign currencies. This approach demonstrates a pragmatic view on leveraging established cryptocurrencies. The discussions also touch upon the broader implications for crypto adoption within the country. If the government embraces Bitcoin at a strategic level, it could pave the way for wider public and institutional acceptance, fostering a more robust digital economy. This could streamline international transactions and attract foreign investment. What Challenges Lie Ahead for This Cryptocurrency Strategy? Adopting a cryptocurrency strategy of this magnitude is not without its hurdles. Volatility is a primary concern. The price fluctuations of Bitcoin can be significant, posing risks to a nation‚Äôs reserves. Robust risk management frameworks would be essential to mitigate these potential downsides. Regulatory clarity also presents a challenge. Indonesia would need to establish comprehensive legal and regulatory frameworks to manage and secure such a reserve. This involves addressing issues like custody, security, and the integration of digital assets into existing financial laws. Public education and understanding of digital assets are also crucial for successful implementation. Global Precedents and Digital Asset Strategy Indonesia is not the first nation to explore significant moves in the digital asset space. El Salvador notably adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, while other countries are researching or piloting CBDCs. However, pursuing a digital asset strategy focused on a Bitcoin reserve for diversification is a unique and potentially groundbreaking approach. This initiative could position Indonesia as a leader in embracing future financial technologies, attracting innovation and talent. It signals a proactive stance in navigating the evolving global financial landscape. The discussions reflect a willingness to explore unconventional avenues for economic strength. Conclusion Indonesia‚Äôs contemplation of a Bitcoin reserve marks a pivotal moment in its economic journey. From exploring direct mining to assessing broader implications for crypto adoption , the nation is clearly looking ahead. While challenges exist, the potential benefits of diversifying national assets and fostering a digital-first economy are compelling. This strategic discussion highlights a growing global trend towards integrating digital assets into national financial frameworks, underscoring their increasing importance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is a Bitcoin reserve? A Bitcoin reserve refers to a nation‚Äôs strategic holding of Bitcoin as part of its foreign exchange reserves or sovereign wealth fund, similar to holding gold or traditional currencies. Why is Indonesia considering a Bitcoin reserve? Indonesia is exploring a Bitcoin reserve to diversify its national assets, potentially hedge against inflation, enhance economic resilience, and integrate into the evolving global digital economy. What are the potential challenges of a national Bitcoin reserve? Key challenges include Bitcoin‚Äôs price volatility, the need for clear regulatory frameworks, secure custody solutions, and educating the public on digital assets. Has any other country adopted a similar strategy? While El Salvador adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, Indonesia‚Äôs focus on a strategic Bitcoin reserve for diversification is a distinct approach, though many nations are exploring various digital asset strategies. How does this differ from a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)? A Bitcoin reserve involves holding an existing decentralized cryptocurrency, whereas a CBDC is a new digital currency issued and controlled by a country‚Äôs central bank.

For those closely watching the tech landscape, especially within the cryptocurrency and startup ecosystem, the recent developments at Cognition AI offer a stark reminder of this volatility. Just three weeks after a high-profile acquisition, the dream scenario for employees at the acquired company, Windsurf, has quickly turned into a challenging reality. The Unfolding Drama at Cognition AI : A Post-Acquisition Quake Cognition AI, the promising AI coding startup, recently made headlines with its acquisition of rival company Windsurf. However, the initial fanfare has quickly dissipated. Reports from The Information reveal a significant restructuring, with Cognition laying off 30 employees last week. Furthermore, the company is now offering buyouts to the approximately 200 remaining Windsurf employees. This move, coming so soon after the acquisition, has sent ripples through the AI community, prompting questions about the true motivations behind such deals. Windsurf Acquisition : More Than Just Talent? At the time of the Windsurf acquisition, Cognition AI publicly emphasized its excitement to welcome Windsurf‚Äôs ‚Äúworld-class people‚Äù and promised ‚Äú100% of Windsurf employees would receive financial compensation.‚Äù The narrative was clear: this was a strategic move to integrate top talent and intellectual property to develop cutting-edge coding tools. However, the subsequent layoffs and buyout offers suggest a different priority. It appears Cognition‚Äôs primary interest might have been Windsurf‚Äôs intellectual property and technology, rather than a full integration of its human capital. This pattern is not uncommon in the fast-paced world of tech mergers and acquisitions, where strategic assets often take precedence over employee retention. Navigating the Waves: The Turmoil of an AI Coding Startup Windsurf‚Äôs journey has been anything but smooth, marking a turbulent saga for an AI coding startup. Before its acquisition by Cognition, Windsurf faced a series of dramatic events: Initially, it was on the verge of being acquired by OpenAI. It then experienced a significant loss of key leadership, including its CEO, co-founder, and research leads, who departed for Google in a massive $2.4 billion ‚Äúreverse-acquihire‚Äù deal. This unique scenario saw Google hiring the talent rather than buying the entire company. Ultimately, after these near-misses and talent drains, Windsurf was acquired by Cognition. This history underscores the intense competition and rapid shifts within the AI sector, where startups are constantly navigating complex deals, talent wars, and uncertain futures. The Harsh Reality of AI Layoffs and Work Culture The recent AI layoffs at Cognition highlight a growing concern within the tech industry: the increasingly demanding work culture, particularly at leading AI firms. For those Windsurf employees considering staying, the conditions are stark. According to an email viewed by The Information, employees must decide by August 10 whether to accept a buyout equivalent to nine months‚Äô salary. Opting to stay reportedly means committing to a grueling schedule of six days a week and over 80-hour workweeks. Cognition CEO Scott Wu‚Äôs stance, articulated in the email, is unambiguous: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt believe in work-life balance‚Äîbuilding the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn‚Äôt possibly separate the two.‚Äù Such conditions, while presented as dedication, are increasingly becoming a point of contention for tech workers seeking sustainable careers. Understanding the Trend: The Rise of Tech Buyouts and Their Aftermath The current situation at Cognition and Windsurf serves as a prominent example of how tech buyouts can unfold, especially in the volatile startup ecosystem. While buyouts can offer employees a financial cushion, they often signal a strategic shift that prioritizes assets or specific skill sets over broad team integration. This trend is becoming more common as larger companies acquire smaller, innovative startups, sometimes leading to significant workforce adjustments post-acquisition. For individuals in the tech space, understanding the nuances of these deals is crucial, as they often dictate the future of their roles and the company‚Äôs direction. Beyond the Headlines: Shaping the Future of Tech Amidst these industry shifts, platforms like Bitcoin World continue to bring together key players to discuss the future. The 20th anniversary of Bitcoin World Disrupt, scheduled for October 27-29, 2025, in San Francisco, is set to feature heavy hitters from Netflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, and Sequoia Capital. These events offer invaluable insights into startup growth, investment trends, and the evolving landscape of AI and technology. Learning from top voices in tech, especially during times of industry flux, can sharpen one‚Äôs edge and provide a clearer perspective on where the market is headed. Securing tickets now offers savings before prices rise on August 7. Summary: The Shifting Sands of AI Innovation The story of Cognition AI and Windsurf is a compelling narrative of ambition, acquisition, and the harsh realities of the modern tech industry. It underscores that while the pursuit of groundbreaking AI innovation continues, it often comes with significant human cost and strategic re-evaluations. For employees, the promise of an acquisition can quickly turn into a crossroads, demanding tough decisions about their careers and work-life integration. As the AI sector matures, the industry will undoubtedly continue to grapple with the balance between rapid development, corporate strategy, and employee well-being. This episode serves as a powerful reminder for all stakeholders about the unpredictable nature of high-stakes tech deals.

Bailey stated in a post on X, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learned a lot about politics and how the game is played this year. I‚Äôm thinking about raising a $100m-$200m PAC (anchored by Nakamoto) to advance Bitcoin priorities. I have my ideas, but what do you think should be part of the Bitcoin voter platform?‚Äù Bailey outlined helping Bitcoin reach $10 million as a key goal for the PAC, positioning the asset for the long term. He also asked users to brainstorm other priorities the PAC should focus on. Some users suggested abolishing the capital gains tax on Bitcoin and protecting the right to self-custody. Strategy Doubles Bitcoin (BTC) Stash Since Trump‚Äôs Return To Office Michael Saylor‚Äôs Strategy has doubled its Bitcoin (BTC) holdings since November 2024, when President Trump won the US Presidential elections. The Bitcoin treasury company has accumulated 376,571 BTC worth over $43 billion at current market prices since Trump‚Äôs election victory. The firm had taken four years to accumulate 252,220 BTC before November 2024. This means Strategy accumulated 60% of its current stash of 628,791 BTC over the past nine months. Strategy also disclosed its latest Bitcoin purchase in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm disclosed that it bought 21,021 BTC worth 2.46 billion in the past week. This was Strategy‚Äôs third-largest purchase by dollar value since it began accumulating Bitcoin. The firm has been purchasing the asset at historically high prices. The latest purchase was made at an average price of $117,256 per coin. Strategy executive chairman called Bitcoin a ‚Äúfreedom virus,‚Äù stating, ‚ÄúWe think of it as a swarm creature because everywhere in the world, someone is supporting the Bitcoin ecosystem.‚Äù UK Man Who Lost 8,000 Bitcoin (BTC) Is Not Giving Up James Howells, a UK man who has been trying to locate his lost hard drive containing 8,000 BTC , has not given up on his lost Bitcoin. However, he clarified that he is no longer pursuing excavating the Newport landfill. The British IT engineer accidentally threw out the hard drive containing the Bitcoin in 2013. Howells sought permission to excavate the landfill as BTC‚Äôs value soared. However, his request was rejected by the regional council, forcing him to look at other avenues, including AI, to locate the lost hard drive. Howells stated, ‚ÄúNo, I have not given up. The story going around is partially true, but not in the way it‚Äôs being framed.‚Äù Howells explained that he made a formal offer of between $33 million and $40 million to acquire and excavate the Newport landfill site. The offer was sent to the Newport City Council, legal team, and a member of its parliament. However, Newport representatives are yet to respond to the offer. Howells plans to launch an Ordinals-based token to raise funds for the acquisition. ‚ÄúSo here‚Äôs where we stand ‚Äî If they won‚Äôt sell, there‚Äôs no need for a token sale to buy the landfill. I am no longer pursuing the purchase of the landfill, I am no longer pursuing excavation or remediation, I am no longer pursuing dialogue with the council or its representatives.‚Äù Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is back in the red during the ongoing session, struggling to reclaim $115,000. The flagship cryptocurrency rebounded after falling below $112,000 on Sunday, rising 1.52% to reclaim $114,000 and settle at $114,311. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 0.69% to cross $115,000 and settle at $115,097 before losing momentum during the ongoing session. BTC has steadily declined since last week, and market analysts have raised alarm bells about weak liquidity and inconsistent institutional demand. According to a popular CryptoQuant analyst, BTC began experiencing a sharp decline in its liquidity inventory ratio in mid-July, as the ratio fell to levels that indicated only three months of available supply on major trading platforms. While reduced supply generally leads to upward price pressure, the analyst highlighted a lack of new demand, which left markets susceptible to a price drop. ‚ÄúWhen liquidity is thin and there is no consistent buying activity from large investors or ETFs, even small sell orders can lead to significant price drops.‚Äù BTC‚Äôs decline can be attributed to macroeconomic uncertainty, tariffs, and the Bitcoin Working Group‚Äôs report on Digital assets failing to provide details about a Bitcoin strategic reserve. Institutional demand has also waned. Data from SoSoValue shows that spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $333 million in outflows on Monday. BTC ended the previous weekend in positive territory, rising 1.31% on Sunday and settling at $119,398. However, it was back in the red on Monday, dropping 1.11% to $118,069. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as the price registered a marginal drop and settled at $117.925. It fell to an intraday low of $115,772 on Wednesday before recovering to reclaim $117,000 and settle at $117,788, ultimately dropping 0.12%. Sellers retained control on Thursday as BTC fell 1.69% and settled at $115,800. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Friday as BTC plunged over 2% and settled at $113,365. Sellers retained control on Saturday as the price fell 0.67%, slipping below $113,000 and settling at $112,601. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered on Sunday, rising 1.52% to reclaim $114,000 and settle at $114,311. Buyers retained control on Monday as the price rose 0.69% to cross $115,000 and settle at $115,097. However, BTC is back in the red during the ongoing session, with the price down nearly 1%, trading around $114,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

(Nasdaq: SBET), has expanded its Ethereum treasury by purchasing 83,561 ETH between July 28 and August 3, 2025. NEW: SharpLink now holds 521,939 ETH Between July 28 ‚Äì August 3, SharpLink acquired 83,561 ETH for $264.5M at an average price of $3,634 ETH-per-share (‚ÄúETH Concentration‚Äù) is now 3.66, up from 3.40 last week, and has increased 83% since we began the strategy on June 2nd 100%‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/X1MFXFDj37 ‚Äî SharpLink (SBET) (@SharpLinkGaming) August 5, 2025 The weekly accumulation, valued at $264.5 million, increased the company‚Äôs total ETH holdings to 521,939‚Äîup 19% from 438,190 ETH the prior week. This marks another major leap in SharpLink‚Äôs aggressive treasury strategy , which began on June 2, 2025. Since the start of the program, the company has boosted its ETH holdings by more than 150%. Average Purchase Price Declines For the week ending August 3, the average ETH purchase price stood at $3,634, a modest decrease from the previous week‚Äôs $3,756. Despite the minor dip in price, SharpLink has accelerated its buying activity, acquiring more ETH than in any of the three preceding weeks. Since mid-July, the company has maintained a consistent pace of large-scale ETH purchases, starting with 74,700 ETH in the week ending July 13 and growing weekly, reaching 83,600 ETH in the most recent update. ETH Concentration Rises SharpLink‚Äôs ETH-per-share concentration‚Äîreferred to as ‚ÄúETH Concentration‚Äù‚Äîrose to 3.66 from 3.40 the previous week. This figure reflects the number of ETH per outstanding share and has increased by 83% since the treasury strategy was launched. The metric is a key indicator of how tightly SharpLink is tying shareholder value to Ethereum‚Äôs price performance and adoption. ATM Facility Drives Capital Growth To fund its ETH accumulation, SharpLink said it continues to rely on its At-the-Market (ATM) facility. For the week ending August 3, the company issued 13.6 million shares, generating $264.5 million in net proceeds. This follows the $279.2 million raised the prior week and the $96.6 million the week before. Cumulatively, the company has issued over 52 million shares and raised more than $1 billion since the strategy was launched. Adding momentum to the company‚Äôs evolving direction, Joseph Chalom‚Äîformer digital asset strategist at BlackRock‚Äî officially assumed his role as Co-CEO on July 24. Chalom reaffirmed SharpLink‚Äôs commitment to expanding its ETH treasury, stating, ‚ÄúSharpLink remains deeply committed to its mission of creating enduring shareholder value by building the largest and most trusted ETH treasury company.‚Äù He added that the company is evaluating additional capital formation strategies‚Äîincluding debt and equity-linked instruments‚Äîto further scale its ETH holdings and reinforce alignment with Ethereum‚Äôs role in decentralized finance. As of August 3, 100% of SharpLink‚Äôs ETH is staked, and cumulative staking rewards reached 929 ETH, further strengthening the company‚Äôs crypto-native yield generation strategy.

Executive Order to Counter ‚ÄòOperation Chokepoint 2.0‚Äô Former U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing to sign a sweeping executive order aimed at protecting cryptocurrency companies and conservative-aligned organizations from what his allies describe as politically motivated banking restrictions. The move is widely viewed as a response to what critics have called ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 2.0,‚Äù a term used to describe the alleged systematic exclusion of certain customers, particularly in the digital asset space, under the Biden administration. According to a Wall Street Journal report, the draft order would compel federal banking regulators to investigate instances where financial institutions terminated customer accounts in potential violation of equal credit access, antitrust, or consumer protection laws. Regulatory Oversight and Penalties If enacted, the executive order would direct agencies to dismantle internal banking policies perceived to have enabled debanking based on ideological or reputational risk assessments. Institutions found in breach could face regulatory enforcement actions and financial penalties. The Justice Department may also be tasked with reviewing suspected violations, while the Federal Reserve's role in determining access to banking infrastructure would come under additional scrutiny. Notably, the Small Business Administration would be required to review its partnerships with financial institutions to ensure they do not engage in politically discriminatory practices. Political and Legal Context The draft order highlights prior cases that have drawn political attention, including a 2023 incident where Bank of America closed the account of a Christian charity operating in Uganda. While the bank cited internal policies against servicing overseas small businesses, the closure was perceived by critics as ideologically motivated. The order also references the role of certain banks in federal probes following the January 6 Capitol riots, pushing for a regulatory review of whether institutions excluded customers for political reasons rather than legal or financial risks. Trump, in a June interview with Decrypt, claimed that major banks acted ‚Äúvery nasty‚Äù toward his business interests during Biden‚Äôs term, attributing the decisions to pressure from federal regulators rather than bank executives themselves. Industry Response and Legal Challenges In anticipation of federal scrutiny, some banks have reportedly revised internal guidelines to explicitly prohibit political discrimination and have begun cooperating with Republican-led states to demonstrate compliance. However, legal experts have raised concerns about the scope and enforceability of the executive order. Alex Chandra, a partner at Indonesia-based IGNOS Law Alliance, emphasized that executive orders can only enforce existing laws. He warned the order could face judicial challenges if it attempts to create new legal protections without congressional authorization. Chandra also pointed out the lack of legal clarity around ‚Äúpolitical discrimination,‚Äù suggesting the absence of political affiliation as a protected class under U.S. anti-discrimination law could complicate enforcement and invite lawsuits. He added, ‚ÄúEven if the orders are enacted, the banks will find a way to drop customers.v ‚Äù Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While traditional DeFi platforms stagnate and sentiment in the market grows restless, Mutuum Finance is picking up speed with its revolutionary approach to decentralized lending and making one wonder if the $10 benchmark is within view. Sitting at $0.035, the new DeFi project has caught the eye of traders. investors who get in on phase 6 presale of MUTM will experience a 71.43% return on investment as the project takes off at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has now surpassed over $14 million and over 14,800 investors. Bitcoin Stabilizes Near $113K as Outlook Toward $200K Remains Intact Bitcoin remains around $113,678, holding itself above critical support in the $112K‚Äì$114K range after recent tariff-driven volatility had it flirting with a low below $115K, triggering a slight 2‚Äì3% drop. Institutional demand, while volatile in the short term, continues to be strong, and analysis still forecast a long-term increase to $200,000 by 2025 on the basis of trends like rising ETF inflows, corporate treasury accumulation, and rising investor confidence. However, investors also track shifting momentum as capital flows increasingly move into newer DeFi platforms like Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance Launches Phase 6 of Token Presale Mutuum Finance has recently introduced Round 6 of its presale with tokens now live at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the last round. The next price increase will take the token up by another 14.29% to $0.04, so members will now be able to make 71.43% when it finally goes live at $0.06. The presale itself has already garnered over 14,800 investors and raised over $14 million, demonstrating the belief that the market has placed on the potential of MUTM. Dual-Lending: Empowering Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance adopts a twin-model approach of facilitating flexibility and efficacy in Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Peer-to-Contract makes use of autonomous smart contracts that carry out the lending independently without any participation of human beings whatsoever. They have been designed to operate on dynamic rates in the market with an unpredictable rate of interest as guided by existing demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model reduces intermediaries and allows market to be in direct interaction with borrowers and lenders. Mutuum Finance Boosts Stability Focus Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a stablecoin to be USD-pegged on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be sound and secure investment product to remove risk and uncertainty that can be attributed to algorithmic stablecoins. The project is audited with a 95.0 trust score by Certik. That is a key milestone as much as Mutuum Finance‚Äôs goal is to become an institutional-grade and transparent DeFi protocol.

There are four severity levels in the program. They include critical, major, minor, and low. All the probable bugs are hence found and rewarded. It is in line with the vision of the team to establish a secure, open, and quality DeFi protocol. While Bitcoin‚Äôs journey to $200,000 will capture long-term headlines, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is creating actual momentum in the present moment. At just $0.035 in phase 6 of presale, early adopters are poised for a 71.43% return on investment upon token launch at $0.06. Over $14 million raised, 14,800+ investors, and strong fundamentals like dual lending mechanisms, a USD-pegged stablecoin, and a CertiK-audited 95.0 trust score, MUTM is set to be one of the hottest DeFi tokens of 2025.

While BetMGM and Hard Rock Bet expand with big-name sponsorships and extensive ad campaigns, Spartans is standing apart by offering faster transactions, true crypto support, and user-friendly promotions like a 300% bonus and Lamborghini prize draw. Success in today‚Äôs betting market depends not just on odds, but also on bonus transparency, withdrawal efficiency, and platform flexibility. Even as BetMGM grows in iGaming and Hard Rock Bet secures exclusivity in Florida, Spartans is building momentum with its crypto-first approach and features tailored to active users, not just media attention. This comparison takes a close look at all three platforms‚Äô core features, including their payout methods, bonus accessibility, and player-focused perks, highlighting why Spartans is emerging as the go-to sportsbook for today‚Äôs crypto-savvy bettor.

And when it comes to withdrawing? Spartans delivers instantly. With support for BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, DAI, USDC, and USDT, users typically receive their winnings right away, something traditional platforms like BetMGM and Hard Rock Bet can‚Äôt consistently match. Its sportsbook experience is equally strong. Spartans includes up to 8x combo bets, live match betting, and flexible betslips that allow quick changes during live events. From NBA to Premier League and IPL, the platform includes real-time data tools for smarter betting decisions. Additional perks go beyond the standard. Spartans is offering an ongoing Lamborghini giveaway, daily deposit rewards, and a solid affiliate program. These bonuses are designed to reward engaged participants rather than one-time users. The goal is utility, value, and consistent play. BetMGM Stays Big But Still Lacks Crypto and Speed As a major player backed by MGM Resorts and Entain, BetMGM continues to build its name in the U.S. sports betting scene. In 2025, it raised projections to $2.7 billion in yearly revenue, driven by a 35% rise in H1 earnings, mostly through online gaming and sportsbook growth. It excels in states with clear mobile betting regulations and uses celebrity tie-ups to maintain visibility. Still, the user journey feels tied to legacy banking. Payments go through traditional systems with longer verification times and no real crypto options. Regional differences affect bonus availability, and terms are often hard to track due to layered fine print. For those prioritizing speed and digital asset compatibility, BetMGM‚Äôs size doesn‚Äôt necessarily translate to a better experience. The platform still feels structured around growth rather than fluid usability. Hard Rock Bet Rules in Florida, But Crypto Players Get Left Out Operating as Florida‚Äôs exclusive online sportsbook, Hard Rock Bet benefits from a tribal compact that gives it full control. Its collaboration with the Miami Dolphins brings unique fan experiences, including themed promotions and live betting lounges during games. It presents a clean, unified platform for placing legal bets within the state. That exclusivity, however, means users can‚Äôt shop around for better odds or features. Its promo offers are mostly Florida-centric, and account options are quite limited. There‚Äôs no crypto integration, and payout consistency is still an issue. While it fits local fans well, Hard Rock Bet lacks the variety, fast payouts, and crypto features that modern users now expect from a global-ready sportsbook. Final Words Being big or exclusive isn‚Äôt enough to lead the sportsbook race. BetMGM is scaling fast, and Hard Rock Bet has Florida under its wing, but neither delivers the quick access, clear offers, and crypto functionality that define Spartans. With a 300% bonus, instant crypto withdrawals, and prize incentives like a Lamborghini, Spartans sets a new standard. It doesn‚Äôt need special licenses or old payment systems. Everything revolves around real access, user control, and smart betting features. From casual punters to seasoned users, Spartans delivers what 2025 platforms should offer: reliable rewards, fast transactions, and a system that puts the player first. Tired of outdated platforms with hidden terms? Spartans is where the game changes.

The White House is working on a new order to stop banks from refusing service based on someone‚Äôs political beliefs. This rule will also protect businesses in certain industries, especially those in crypto. This action is expected to impose strong penalties on financial institutions that violate the law. Ending Biased Banking Practices in the U.S. The executive order, expected to be signed soon , targets a practice known as Operation Chokepoint 3.0. Crypto companies have been the most affected by this situation. During the Biden administration, crypto firms like Gemini reportedly said they were debanked by popular banks JPMorgan. Big names like Elon Musk and Ripple‚Äôs CTO, David Schwartz, have spoken out against the move. Schwartz even said it is like the government is quietly trying to control crypto. Many believe this will slow down new ideas and unfairly hurt growing industries. Furthermore, the Operation Chokepoint debate is not just about the crypto industry. In the past, banks also cut off businesses in areas like firearms and fossil fuels, raising concerns about political bias. Several public figures and lawmakers have spoken out against this trend. Many believe the U.S. financial banking system should treat all legal businesses fairly. The new order aims to make sure they do. The order will enforce laws like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and antitrust regulations. This is to make sure all legal businesses and people are treated fairly. Also, banks that break the rules could face fines or other penalties. Trump‚Äôs Push for Financial Reform President Trump‚Äôs administration is taking a strong stance on financial fairness, a different approach from the previous one. Since taking office in January 2025, Trump has voiced support for bridging the gap between traditional finance and digital assets. He has accused banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America of making politically charged decisions. However, both banks have denied these claims. Trump‚Äôs broader reform plan includes changing capital requirements and other banking rules. He believes these changes will support economic growth, drive innovation, and make room for emerging industries like crypto. Growing Support from Tech and Crypto Leaders The move to end ‚ÄúOperation Chokepoint 3.0‚Äù has received strong backing from major players in the tech and crypto world. Binance founder Changpeng Zhao said the order could open banking for crypto internationally. Meanwhile, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) has warned that new bank policies like JPMorgan‚Äôs added fees for data aggregators could hurt fintech companies. a16z added that firms like Venmo, Robinhood, and Coinbase may be among those affected. These industry voices stress that fair banking access is crucial for innovation and could help the economy grow.

No one wants to wait hours‚Äîor even worse, days‚Äîfor their winnings, no matter how great the bonuses or game selection might be. That‚Äôs why the demand for fastest-payout crypto gambling sites in 2025 has skyrocketed. Players now look for platforms that send crypto straight to their wallets with no delays or extra checks. This guide ranks the six fastest-paying sites, with Spartans coming out on top thanks to its true instant payout system and smooth withdrawal process. 1. Spartans: Crypto Reaches Your Wallet Instantly Spartans holds the top spot among the fastest-payout crypto gambling sites in 2025 . The platform‚Äôs standout feature is its ability to process withdrawals instantly. Whether you‚Äôve won $10 or $10,000, your funds arrive in your crypto wallet within moments of making a request. There‚Äôs no approval queue, no support tickets, and no waiting in a pending status. Spartans uses a crypto-native setup that supports major tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDT, ensuring speed and efficiency. While many sites rely on outdated internal systems, Spartans is built for quick, automated transactions. The same system used for user payouts also applies to affiliate commissions, reinforcing Spartans‚Äô strong track record of transparency. That consistency has helped turn new players into regulars, especially those who prioritize fast access to their earnings. With more than 5,963 games, sports betting options, and a mobile-friendly design, Spartans doesn‚Äôt just offer fast cashouts‚Äîit sets the standard. 2. Stake.com: Payouts Usually Land Within Hours Stake.com is a well-established name in the crypto gambling scene, known for its reliability and broad range of games. Although it doesn‚Äôt offer instant payouts, most withdrawals are processed within a few hours. Large withdrawals can sometimes take slightly longer, but for the majority of users, Stake ensures same-day access to funds. It‚Äôs a strong performer on speed, though not the quickest overall. 3. Roobet: Good Speed, But Slows for High Withdrawals Roobet is popular for its games and crypto support. Most users report getting their payouts within one to four hours, depending on blockchain congestion and withdrawal size. However, larger wins may be delayed due to extra checks. It‚Äôs not the fastest option, but Roobet strikes a reasonable balance between safety and speed. 4. BC.Game: May Require Manual Approval on Bigger Wins BC.Game handles many crypto withdrawals within 24 hours, but some users report manual reviews, particularly with bigger amounts. These checks can cause delays that frustrate players expecting quick access. While the site is praised for its community features and bonuses, withdrawal speeds depend on factors like amount and user verification status. 5. Betano: Slowest Payouts Among Crypto-Friendly Sites Betano is a trusted name in traditional sports betting, but its crypto payout system lags behind. Users often wait hours‚Äîand sometimes more than a day‚Äîfor their funds. Since crypto isn‚Äôt the main focus here, Betano is better for casual players who don‚Äôt need instant access to their winnings. 6. Gamdom: Speed Varies Based on Token and ID Check Gamdom supports crypto and offers a wide selection of games, but its withdrawal times are inconsistent. Some players get their funds the same day, while others face waits of up to 48 hours depending on the cryptocurrency used and the level of identity verification. If quick payouts are your main concern, Gamdom may not always deliver. Evaluating the Fastest-Payout Crypto Gambling Sites in 2025 In 2025, payout speed has become a must-have for crypto gamblers. While several sites now manage to process withdrawals within a day, Spartans stands out for delivering truly instant transfers. Whether it‚Äôs smooth crypto flows or immediate wallet credits, Spartans leads the way as the fastest-payout crypto gambling site. If you‚Äôre tired of waiting for your money, Spartans offers the quick and dependable service today‚Äôs players demand. As the industry moves toward real-time experiences, platforms that can‚Äôt keep up will be left behind‚Äîwhile instant-pay sites like Spartans set the new benchmark.

After weeks of aggressive buying activity and bullish momentum, the market is now showing signs of fatigue. Analysts are growing cautious, with many warning that a deeper correction could be imminent if Ethereum fails to reclaim key support zones. Related Reading: Bitcoin Demand Holds Strong Despite Price Drop: Accumulation Trend Remains Intact Adding to these concerns, fresh data reveals a significant shift in market dynamics. The taker buy/sell ratio ‚Äî a key indicator that tracks the aggressiveness of buyers versus sellers ‚Äî has sharply declined into negative territory today. This signals that sellers are currently dominating the order books, applying sustained pressure on ETH‚Äôs price action. While some view this as a typical cooldown phase after a major rally, others believe Ethereum is entering a riskier phase where bearish sentiment could intensify if support fails to hold. The coming days will be critical in determining whether ETH stabilizes around current levels or slides further into correction territory. Ethereum Faces Short-Term Selling Pressure According to top analyst Darkfost, Ethereum‚Äôs taker buy/sell ratio has dropped sharply into negative territory today, reaching 0.87‚Äîone of the lowest levels recorded since the start of the year. This metric, which measures the ratio of aggressive buyers to sellers in futures markets, reveals that selling pressure is now firmly in control of ETH‚Äôs order books. Although today‚Äôs data is still incomplete, the current reading already indicates a dominance of sell orders on Ethereum futures. Darkfost notes that this shift has been developing for several weeks. Since July 18th, the taker buy/sell ratio has been mostly negative, which correlates with Ethereum‚Äôs recent inability to break through key resistance levels and its transition into a short-term consolidation phase. While this may seem concerning for bullish traders, Darkfost emphasizes that such consolidations are a normal part of market cycles, especially after a strong rally. He suggests that Ethereum could face a challenging period in the short term, as market sentiment remains fragile and sellers continue to control intraday movements. Related Reading: Bitcoin Investors Selling More Aggressively As Bull Cycle Matures: Risk Appetite Fades? However, this phase might offer a healthy foundation for the next leg up. If Ethereum manages to stabilize and consolidate above critical support zones, the broader trend remains favorable. Long-term fundamentals, including on-chain accumulation and growing institutional interest, still point toward upside potential once this phase of selling pressure eases. Price Analysis: Bulls Attempt Recovery After Sharp Decline Ethereum is currently trading at $3,654.60, attempting to stabilize after a sharp correction from its recent highs around $3,940. The 4-hour chart shows a recovery bounce that met resistance near the 50-period SMA (currently at $3,668.28), signaling that bulls are facing strong selling pressure at this level. Despite the bounce, ETH remains below the key horizontal resistance at $3,860.80, which has capped multiple upward attempts in recent weeks. The bullish attempt to reclaim momentum earlier today was rejected near this level, leading to a quick retracement back into the $3,600-$3,650 zone. The 100-period SMA (green line) at $3,695.32 is acting as dynamic resistance, while the 200-period SMA (red line) at $3,303.42 serves as a longer-term support level should the correction deepen. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows To Binance Accelerate: Investor Behavior Shifts After Months Of Decline Volume spikes indicate that buyers are stepping in aggressively on dips, but overall, Ethereum remains in a short-term consolidation phase between $3,850 and $3,350. A decisive breakout above $3,860.80 is required to regain bullish momentum, while failure to hold above $3,600 could expose ETH to another retest of lower support levels around $3,300-$3,350.

The lightweight SDK allows projects to add a wallet offering swaps, rewards and other Web3 features. Developer teams can now embed Coinbase wallets with full features, gaining access to all of the available infrastructure. The Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) Embedded Wallets is a new service allowing all teams to give end users a seamless wallet onboarding experience. The embedded wallet will have full access to Coinbase DEX, including swaps, 4.15 USDC rewards, and access to Web3 assets and activities. For developers, the embedded wallets experience includes a lightweight SDK with minimal code required. The SDK is the only tool targeting developers with built-in USDC passive income. The new wallet offers expanded DeFi features following the recent introduction of the GENIUS bill , introducing more clarity for stablecoins and DeFi. This allows end users to retain self-custody wallets with full connectivity features. The wallet will also expand the reach of Coinbase DEX directly through the developer package. Coinbase allows app builders to avoid issues with custody App developers face a tradeoff between offering a simple app experience, but with a form of third-party custody, or a feature-rich self-custodial wallet. Not all teams are capable of securing a good user experience, hence Coinbase‚Äôs decision to offer embedded wallets. With the SDK, all app developers can build their product without thinking about asset custody. The wallet allows multiple sign-in paths, including email, SMS or other authentication, with instant access to all features. The wallet requires a secure login, but no extensions or seed phrase storage. Coinbase noted that embedded wallets are currently available, but not all packages are developer-friendly. Users still demanded an ‚Äúeverything wallet,‚Äù combining multiple elements of the DeFi experience, including on-ramps for purchases, swaps, and access to yield with no additional setup for developers or end users. New wallet offers access to all Coinbase features The new embedded wallets offer all the elements used in Coinbase‚Äôs own products. Native rewards bring 4.1% annualized on any USDC balance inside the wallet, with no extra steps for staking. Developers can choose to pass the earnings to end users or retain them to finance the project. The wallet will also offer MagicSpend, Swap, and data APIs. This allows developers to build a full-feature Web3 app without the need to stitch together multiple services. The wallet also keeps its encrypted private key secure while offering recovery backed by Coinbase , as well as support to export the keys and keep them in custody. The wallet package also includes smart wallet support with sponsored gas and spending permissions. Developers can access all those features without backend setup, while retaining full control of their app interface. The wallet launch is part of the drive to boost mini-app creation on Base , simplifying the path for all teams. The wallets are thus suitable for social apps, on-chain gaming, DeFi frontends and other types of experiences. Use cases also include fintech and payments, tapping the existing Coinbase infrastructure . The wallet ensures end users do not think about the storage, but use any app seamlessly. The new kit is also expected to boost development on Base, its native L2 chain. Want your project in front of crypto‚Äôs top minds?

Price action follows momentum, and momentum follows early capital. This isn‚Äôt about predictions. It‚Äôs about watching which coins are pulling real traction, showing strong volume, and building ecosystems that are already running. Here are four picks that stand out not for what they claim but for what they‚Äôre already doing. 1. Cold Wallet (CWT): $5.7M Raised and 500x Buzz Builds Fast Cold Wallet crypto is more than just another project. It‚Äôs a live ecosystem built around a $270 million acquisition of Plus Wallet. That move brought in over 2 million users in only seven months, shifting CWT from a presale concept to a full-scale platform in motion. People aren‚Äôt guessing if this will launch. It already has. Now in presale stage 16, CWT is priced at $0.00942. More than $5.7 million has been raised so far, showing real traction. Thousands are jumping in early after seeing what‚Äôs already working. The system rewards user activity with cashback in tokens, use-to-earn mechanics, DAO governance, and privacy features using zero-knowledge proofs. The appeal lies not in promises, but in progress. CWT runs on a fully integrated wallet network that‚Äôs active right now. Some early participants are expecting up to 500x ROI after launch, especially if demand spikes. With 16 stages already completed and prices rising at each phase, the entry window keeps shrinking. Cold Wallet leads the list of top trending cryptos for 2025 because it‚Äôs proving itself in real time. 2. Near Protocol (NEAR): Quiet Moves with Bold Expansion Ahead Near Protocol is quietly drawing strong interest from developers and institutions, thanks to its simple yet scalable design. Its edge comes from a long-term structure using sharding and an easy experience for developers. Lately, Near has been in the news for its connection to mainstream apps and a growing DeFi presence with rising TVL. But the real shift is happening in its developer base. Builders aren‚Äôt testing and leaving, they‚Äôre sticking around. NEAR‚Äôs price has been climbing steadily, without the usual volatility seen in other coins. It isn‚Äôt the loudest project out there, but it‚Äôs now landing on the radar of big institutions. That momentum earns it a place among the top trending cryptos for 2025. 3. Internet Computer (ICP): ICP Flips the Script in 2025 Internet Computer (ICP) has taken plenty of hits since its launch, but this year, it‚Äôs catching attention for all the right reasons. 2025 is looking more like a comeback than a footnote. What changed the tone was ICP‚Äôs big tech move: Bitcoin integration and smart contracts are now live. That gives ICP a door into cross-chain apps and positions it as a serious player among Layer 1 chains. It may not be a meme favorite, but ICP is now on the radar of those seeking undervalued projects. Influencers are talking again, and wallet data shows more large-scale accumulation. That trend puts ICP firmly on the list of top trending cryptos for 2025. 4. Render (RNDR): At the Center of AI, 3D, and Web3 Energy Render isn‚Äôt just making noise; it‚Äôs building a critical service as AI, gaming, and 3D content demand grow fast. Its decentralized GPU network delivers compute power where it‚Äôs needed, when it‚Äôs needed. RNDR‚Äôs value is in its use. From solo creators to AI-focused firms, Render powers real workflows. The user base includes working artists, metaverse designers, and 3D developers who rely on it. As the lines blur between AI and Web3, RNDR is sitting right at the intersection. This isn‚Äôt a niche bet anymore. It‚Äôs becoming a key piece of the decentralized future. That‚Äôs why it ranks high on any list of top trending cryptos for 2025. Momentum Is Already Here, Don‚Äôt Wait for Headlines Big shifts rarely shout in the beginning. Cold Wallet is one of those moves happening right now. It has a working product, a growing user base, and a crypto presale price still at $0.00942. It has already raised $5.7 million and is moving fast. Meanwhile, projects like NEAR, ICP, and RNDR are proving their place in the public market. Cold Wallet, though, is still early and full of upside. The trend is clear. Look where the activity is. These are the top trending cryptos for 2025, not because they promise growth, but because the signs of growth are already here. You just have to act before the wave hits full speed.

He‚Äôs going to have no choice because his economy stinks,‚Äù Trump said during a live interview on Squawk Box . He made it clear that he believes oil revenue is the backbone of Russia‚Äôs war in Ukraine, and if it dries up, the war ends. This is part of Trump‚Äôs long-running one-man feud with Putin, who has refused to even acknowledge Trump‚Äôs existence for over a month. Putin hasn‚Äôt responded once, not even with a passing comment. Instead, it‚Äôs been Dmitry Medvedev, his closest confidant and former president, doing the talking, on X no less. Medvedev called Trump‚Äôs demands dangerous and said they‚Äôre pushing the U.S. closer to war with itself. He also reminded the world that Putin doesn‚Äôt see Trump as an equal, so he will never take the bait. Trump cuts deadline, threatens tariffs, deploys subs Tensions between Washington and Moscow got worse when Trump shortened the timeline for a Ukraine peace deal. Last Monday, he announced that the original 50-day window was now less than two weeks. If Putin doesn‚Äôt agree to stop the war, Trump plans to slap harsh secondary tariffs on countries still trading with Russia. It‚Äôs his way of forcing others to choose sides. Medvedev responded quickly. ‚ÄúEach new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war,‚Äù he wrote on X. ‚ÄúNot between Russia and Ukraine, but with his own country.‚Äù Trump followed up on Friday by saying he had ordered two U.S. nuclear submarines to be moved to ‚Äúthe appropriate regions,‚Äù clearly referring to Russian-controlled waters. Trump has also been attacking New Delhi and PM Narendra Modi for buying discounted Russian oil and reselling it for big profits. ‚ÄúIndia has not been a good trading partner,‚Äù he said Tuesday on CNBC. ‚ÄúSo we settled on 25%, but I think I‚Äôm going to raise that very substantially over the next 24 hours, because they‚Äôre buying Russian oil, they‚Äôre fueling the war machine, and if they‚Äôre going to do that, I‚Äôm not going to be happy.‚Äù Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Trump‚Äôs tariff threats were just ‚Äúattempts to force countries to stop trade relations with Russia.‚Äù He also backed India directly, saying sovereign countries ‚Äúhave the right to choose their own trade partners.‚Äù Russian economy under pressure, but not broken Oil prices are falling, though, and that‚Äôs a problem for Putin. On Tuesday, Brent crude dropped 83 cents to $67.92 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate went down 87 cents to $65.41. This came after OPEC and its partners announced on Sunday that they would increase output, which made markets worry about weakening demand. Russia‚Äôs finance ministry is already bracing for less revenue. It expects oil and gas income this year to be 24% lower than previously estimated. The ministry cut its oil price forecast from $69.70 to $56 per barrel. It also raised next year‚Äôs budget deficit target from 0.5% of GDP to 1.7%. Russia‚Äôs own Economic Development Ministry sees slower growth ahead. They project the economy will expand by only 2.5% this year, down from 4.3% in 2024. Inflation is officially sitting at around 10%, but independent analysts believe it‚Äôs higher‚Äîpossibly over 15%. Food and production costs have soared. Putin even admitted the situation was ‚Äúalarming.‚Äù The International Monetary Fund added more bad news in July. They revised Russia‚Äôs 2025 GDP growth down to 0.9%, from 1.5% in April. That change came after data showed weak retail activity and reduced industrial output. Despite all this, the Russian economy hasn‚Äôt been stunted, though sanctions have clearly slowed it down. Domestic pressures have increased. Oil revenue is down. Growth is falling. But the Kremlin hasn‚Äôt shown any signs of panic. Trade with countries like India and China continues. Putin hasn‚Äôt blinked. And Trump is still waiting for a reaction that hasn‚Äôt come, and probably never will. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

The SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance has issued a detailed statement recognizing certain fiat-backed stablecoins‚Äîlabeled ‚ÄúCovered Stablecoins‚Äù‚Äîas cash equivalents rather than securities. The move marks a major regulatory shift that could unlock institutional capital and reshape the digital asset landscape. According to XRP Governor, a prominent voice in the community, ‚ÄúThe U.S. SEC just dropped a BOMB on the markets‚Ä¶ Compliant stablecoins are now being recognized as cash equivalents ‚Äî a historic shift that could unleash billions in institutional capital. This is massive for adoption, and XRP and RLUSD are perfectly positioned to lead the charge.‚Äù BREAKING: The U.S. SEC just dropped a BOMB on the markets. Compliant stablecoins are now being recognized as cash equivalents ‚Äî a historic shift that could unleash billions in institutional capital. This is massive for adoption and #XRP + RLUSD are perfectly positioned‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/nd3npXFhiS ‚Äî XRP Governor (@xrpgovernor) August 5, 2025 SEC Acknowledges Covered Stablecoins as Cash Equivalents The SEC‚Äôs statement outlines specific conditions that must be met for a stablecoin to qualify as a ‚ÄúCovered Stablecoin.‚Äù These include being pegged one-to-one to a reference asset such as the U.S. dollar, backed by highly liquid, low-risk reserves, and redeemable at par on demand. Crucially, the SEC affirms that issuance and redemption of such stablecoins do not constitute the offer or sale of securities under U.S. law . This recognition elevates compliant stablecoins into the same financial category as cash equivalents, aligning them with traditional financial instruments rather than speculative crypto assets. The agency further clarified that minting and redeeming Covered Stablecoins, under these strict criteria, do not require SEC registration or qualify as regulated securities activity. For the crypto market, this distinction brings long-needed clarity‚Äîand with it, the potential for large-scale institutional participation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 RLUSD: A Model for Regulatory Alignment Ripple‚Äôs stablecoin, RLUSD, launched in December 2024, appears tailor-made for this new regulatory environment. RLUSD is fully backed, dollar-pegged, and redeemable at a 1:1 ratio. Designed from inception with compliance and transparency in mind, it aligns squarely with the SEC‚Äôs criteria for Covered Stablecoins. Moreover, RLUSD is available across the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, offering flexibility for financial institutions, payment providers, and on-chain liquidity providers. Now, with the SEC‚Äôs endorsement of this stablecoin structure, RLUSD is better positioned to serve as a trusted bridge between traditional finance and blockchain-based systems. A Path Forward for Utility and Adoption The XRP community views this development not just as a win for Ripple, but as a gateway to broader utility. By confirming that compliant stablecoins function legally as cash equivalents, the SEC has created the foundation for real-world use cases‚Äîfrom remittances and enterprise payments to tokenized finance and treasury management. ‚ÄúRegulatory clarity has arrived,‚Äù XRP Governor wrote. ‚ÄúNow comes utility, dominance, and liftoff.‚Äù For XRP, RLUSD, and the broader ecosystem Ripple has built, this isn‚Äôt just a regulatory update‚Äîit‚Äôs the green light for institutional-scale innovation.

Price Analysis,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/08/bitcoin-btc-breakout-or-breakdown-ahead-price-analysis,"Bitcoin (BTC) is currently at around $114,000 after a big dip down to a local low of $112,000. Was that the time to buy the dip, or is there more trouble ahead? Calling a market top It can be argued that as long as the US stock market is going up Bitcoin will continue to rise as well. The only issues along the way are that various economic shocks happen, the stock market takes a hit, and Bitcoin steps on a banana skin that gets everyone predicting that the end of the bull run is nigh. Economic analysts as well as Bitcoin analysts come up with theses and charts that prove that on one hand we are entering what could be a depression, and on the other hand that Bitcoin is already declining into its next bear market. The reality is of course that no one knows. Calling a market top is akin to guessing the name of the teddy bear at the school fete. Yes, there are good analysts out there, but all they can really do is look at the probabilities and then try to make an educated guess. Investors who are looking to start selling their positions might have their heads in a complete spin if they listen to this and that ‚Äòexpert‚Äô on social media. Wildly differing opinions are claimed, and often with bags of conviction. Who should they listen to? The only thing that isn‚Äôt in doubt is that both the US stock market and Bitcoin are in uptrends. The old adage of ‚ÄúThe trend is your friend until the end‚Äù still applies. If you are looking to trade Bitcoin by trying to guess and sell the market top, you are either in the 1% of highest performing traders, or you will be just extremely lucky. Finally, one has to consider this. When you sell your Bitcoin, you are in fact buying dollars (or another fiat currency) with it. You are swapping the soundest and scarcest form of money available for something made out of paper, with no backing, and that is likely to be printed like there is no tomorrow. Dwell on that. W bottom pattern forming? Source: TradingView The short-term chart for $BTC reveals that the bounce from $112,000 has run out of steam and that now the price is trying to hang on to the bottom trendline of the bull flag. Given that the short-term Stochastic RSI still needs to come down and reset, there may be another dip below. However, this could form a W pattern which has the potential to send the price back towards the highs. If the price does sink further and makes a lower low, there is the possibility that the big support at $109,000 could be tested. Daily time frame signalling decent upward movement? Source: TradingView The daily chart puts things into a clearer perspective. It can be seen that the $112,000 horizontal support is also bolstered by the 50-day SMA. If the W pattern does play out, it could be that the price comes down to retest the 50-day SMA before bouncing from there. At the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI indicators are shaping to cross above the 20.00 level. Once they both cross above, this is the signal for upside price momentum. Looking left at previous daily cross-ups from the bottom, it can be seen that they have all signalled decent price rises. Near a top, or is it already in? Source: TradingView The weekly chart for $BTC gives some cause for concern, due to the fact that the Stochastic RSI indicator lines are currently coming down hard from the top. The weekly chart would normally presage what is going to happen on the 2-week chart, so it is interesting to see what this can tell us. The 2-week chart shows that the indicator lines are crossing into very bullish territory. That said, there could be the beginnings of a roll-over of these indicators unless some positive price action comes into Bitcoin soon. Looking back over the last two bull markets it should be noted that these Stochastic RSI indicator cross-ups from the bottom are quite rare. Since the top of the 2017/2018 bull market there have only been 7 of them. We are currently on the eighth. If there was a cross-down from here, would there be time left in the bull market for another cross-up? Given that they generally take the best part of a year to come all the way down and then all the way back up again - it‚Äôs unlikely. At the bottom of the chart the RSI illustrates that the indicator line was rejected at the downtrend line. Unless it breaks through here it will be unquestionably bearish, not to mention the bearish divergence that could be about to play out, with the price action heading upwards while the RSI and possibly the Stochastic RSI, are dropping. However, there is no green-shaded top area for the apex of the bull market? Be that as it may, if one goes back to the last bull market, the green-shaded area occurred at the first peak of the double top. The second, higher peak, took place as the RSI indicator was already well on the way back down to the bottom. Much food for thought.

Falcon‚Äôs Yapper leaderboard has gone live with the initial Yap2Fly campaign, awarding $50,000 USDf per month. This will be shared among the top 50 yappers according to the quality of their mindshare contribution as well as their level of onchain activity. These metrics will be combined to ensure a fair distribution of the monthly rewards pool. The Yap2Fly campaign is designed to support the creation of quality content across X that educates and informs DeFi users about key components of Falcon‚Äôs synthetic dollar protocol. This will make it easier for onchain users to make informed decisions and to explore opportunities for generating yield through staking USDf. To further incentivize community members and support long-term growth, Falcon has allocated future rewards for the top 200 yappers within the Kaito community. Developed by Kaito, Yapper leaderboards provide a quantifiable way for projects to measure community contributions and to reward participants. Users who contribute mindshare that elevates the discussion about Falcon will earn Yap points. The initiative aligns with the existing Falcon Miles program, whose Pilot Season rewards DeFi users for onchain activities ranging from trading to lending. Falcon‚Äôs Yap2Fly dashboard is now live at https://app.falcon.finance/yap2fly . Users who participate in the campaign can rack up Miles, boost their mindshare, and climb the leaderboard. The higher they climb, the greater the token rewards and monthly USDf drops they will be eligible for. Kaito‚Äôs mindshare engine tracks how far Falcon insights that are shared on X travel, scoring them for originality, thoughtful engagement, and genuine reach. In the Falcon app, activities such as minting USDf, staking sUSDf, or providing DeFi liquidity will additionally earn Falcon Miles and unlock new badge tiers. After linking their X account to their Falcon wallet, users can start sharing content, using Kaito to track the reach of their posts. Content that is suggested includes walkthrough threads that demonstrate how to mint USDf; data-backed comparisons with other stablecoins; and concise tutorials guiding new users through staking or partaking in USDf‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem. Instead of rewarding quantity, Kaito‚Äôs gamified framework focuses on quality and originality, encouraging users to let their personality and knowledge shine. The launch of Falcon‚Äôs Yapper leaderboard arrives at a time when interest in the stablecoin protocol is riding high. Falcon‚Äôs TVL has now surpassed $1.2B, driven by growing demand for USDf, which has been widely integrated across a wide range of DeFi applications, and by the yield available for staking the stablecoin, which currently offers an APY of 12.5%. The Yap2Fly program will help to grow the Falcon community while rewarding existing members for the value they add both onchain and on social media.

The token recovered during the weekend and trimmed its 7-day losses. However, it is still the second-worst-performing token of the top 10 on a year-to-date basis as it has shed 11% of its value. High volumes at these low prices may indicate whale accumulation at a point when favorable regulations in the United States could propel the price of ADA in the future. Recently, Cardano‚Äôs founder, Charles Hoskinson, said that ADA was a better investment than BTC as the former offers a much higher upside potential due to its smaller market cap and progressively developing use cases. $ADA monstrous cup and handle! whales are done accumulating #Cardano Breakout target: $0.92 ‚Üí $4.00+ pic.twitter.com/kb4rghM3G4 ‚Äî Smith (@CryptoSmith0x) July 29, 2025 Meanwhile, Crypto Trader CryptoSmith0x, whose X account is followed by more than 28,000 users, sees the token rising to $4 as ADA has broken a long-standing accumulation. This period of consolidation has been going on for nearly 5 years and ended in 2025 as ADA jumped to $1. A breakout could set off a move toward the $3 level over the next 3 to 6 months. This trader‚Äôs bullish Cardano price prediction sees the token retesting its all-time high from September 2021 at some point during that period. Cardano Price Prediction: ADA Recovers Upon Hitting Key Support at $0.69 ADA has been on a downtrend since it hit $0.935 back in late July. The price has made multiple consecutive lower highs and now seems headed to retest its trend line resistance from below. The token has also entered a key area of resistance at $0.75 that will be critical to determine where the price could be headed next. With trading volumes rising alongside buying interest, the odds favor a bullish Cardano price prediction that pushes the asset above this key level and toward a breakout of this descending triangle. If ADA hits $0.80, that would confirm a trend reversal is occurring and would set things in motion for a much stronger move toward $0.86 and $0.95 afterward. As top cryptos like ADA eye new highs, storing these assets safely is a key priority.

Discover why Mantle , Cronos , and Litecoin are capturing attention and showing potential for significant growth. Peek into the factors driving their momentum and what makes them stand out in the crowded crypto space. Dive into the article to uncover the trends that could shape their future. Mantle (MNT): Recent Movement and Critical Price Levels Mantle experienced noticeable shifts over the past month and six months. The coin surged approximately 48% in one month, followed by a pronounced uptrend that faced a 27% pullback over a six-month period. Price action varied widely, marked by a steady weekly gain of about 4%, hinting at underlying momentum amidst broader volatility. Price levels largely remained confined within a range from $0.58 to $0.88, reflecting a market responding to dynamic changes and intermittent investor interest. Oscillators and momentum figures suggest shifts between bullish bursts and temporary corrections, showcasing a market that tests both upward and downward pressures. Current price levels anchor tightly between support and resistance boundaries. The coin trades in a defined band with immediate resistance at $1.01 and a secondary barrier at $1.31, while support sits near $0.42 and a lower cushion at $0.12. Price consistently finds footing at these support levels, facing pressure when approaching resistance. Bulls appear cautiously optimistic with a rising moving average recommendation near $0.93, though oscillators indicate some lingering hesitation. Trading within these levels suggests a strategy of buying on dips near support and considering scaled exits around $1.01, especially given recent momentum. The current lack of a clear trend calls for vigilant monitoring of these key boundary levels. Cronos: Month Surge and Bullish Pivot Amid Support and Resistance Levels Cronos experienced a remarkable 71.15% gain over the past month and a 36.48% rise in the last six months, showing impressive short-term increase and steady long-term progress. The coin‚Äôs price moved significantly in recent weeks, indicating heightened trader interest and swift market response. The notable one-month surge points to renewed confidence in the asset, while the six-month growth reflects underlying strength developed over time. These changes suggest that Cronos has been capitalizing on market opportunities, with rapid price action in the short run and consistent gains over a longer period. The current trading arena sits between $0.0956 and $0.1663, with immediate resistance around $0.1935 and firm support established at $0.0521. A secondary resistance appears at $0.2642, while another support level lies at zero. Technical indicators show a slight upward thrust with the Awesome Oscillator at 0.0174, though a nearly flat Momentum Indicator at -0.003 and a minor negative Oscillators Recommendation of -0.182 suggest mixed signals. A Relative Strength Index of 61.431 hints that buyers are active, yet caution is warranted as price action remains balanced. Traders might consider entering long positions near the support level, and a confirmed break above $0.1935 could ignite further bullish momentum. Litecoin's Strong Momentum and Key Price Levels Over the last month, Litecoin experienced a strong upward move with a notable monthly gain of 38.55% and a weekly increase of 11.35%. The coin posted a 17.33% rise over the past six months, showing consistent strength throughout both short-term and intermediate periods. Price action has attracted trader attention and provided momentum that hints at a bullish outlook. Market activity has maintained a steady pace as indicated by these sharp increases, pointing to a market responsive to recent catalysts and investor interest. The current trading range for Litecoin sits between $84.91 and $124.80, with the nearest support at $63.72 and resistance at $143.51. A second resistance is noted at $183.40, while a lower support is observed at $23.83. The Relative Strength Index hovers near 69.48, signaling overbought conditions. Momentum stands at 7.51 and the Awesome Oscillator registers a positive reading of 8.63, indicating bullish forces pushing prices higher. Although buyers have driven prices upward, the range-bound action suggests no clear trend. Traders might watch for a breakout above $143.51 for further gains, while pullbacks to support levels could offer potential entry points. Conclusion MNT , CRO , and LTC are gaining significant attention today. MNT shows strong potential with its innovative technology. CRO is growing due to increased use in transactions. LTC remains a reliable choice for many due to its longevity and dependability. Keeping an eye on these cryptos could be beneficial as they continue to develop and attract interest.

A rounding bottom breakout puts $745 as key support and potential targets at $790 to $1,000. Institutional players like Nano Labs are adding BNB to treasuries, signaling rising corporate interest. Price Near Record Levels BNB changed hands at $760 at press time, with over $1 billion in 24-hour volume. Prices dipped slightly in a day and 9% over the past week. In the last 24 hours, BNB traded between $755 and $770. Its seven-day range was $735 to $833. The token is still only 12% below its record high of $858 (CoinGecko data), set on July 28, 2025. Crypto analyst Crypto Patel pointed out that BNB has outperformed most major altcoins during this market downturn. Many tokens have fallen 60‚Äì80% from their peaks, but BNB never slipped beyond 30%.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has provided a much-anticipated clarification regarding liquid staking activities. This development, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, confirms that these activities are not considered securities under current regulations. This announcement brings immense clarity and potentially paves the way for greater innovation in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space. What Exactly is Liquid Staking and Why Does This Matter? Many in the crypto community have eagerly awaited guidance on various aspects of digital assets. So, what is liquid staking , and why is the SEC‚Äôs statement so crucial? Liquid staking allows users to stake their cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum) to support a blockchain network while still retaining a liquid token representing their staked assets. This liquid token can then be used in other DeFi protocols, offering flexibility and additional yield opportunities. Previously, uncertainty existed about whether these liquid staking tokens, or the activities themselves, might fall under securities laws. This ambiguity created a cloud of regulatory risk, hindering growth and participation. The SEC‚Äôs recent stance provides a welcome sigh of relief. The SEC‚Äôs Stance: A Breakthrough for Digital Asset Regulation? The U.S. SEC‚Äôs statement signifies a pivotal moment for digital asset regulation . By explicitly stating that liquid staking activities are not classified as securities, the commission offers a clearer framework. This move distinguishes liquid staking from other crypto offerings that the SEC has previously deemed securities, such as certain initial coin offerings (ICOs). This clarification suggests a more nuanced approach from the regulator, potentially indicating a willingness to understand and differentiate various blockchain-based activities. It empowers developers and users within the DeFi ecosystem to proceed with more confidence, reducing the fear of unforeseen legal challenges. This positive development could foster a new wave of innovation. Boosting DeFi Innovation and Blockchain Securities How will this clarification impact the broader landscape of DeFi innovation and the perception of blockchain securities ? The positive ripple effects are substantial across the industry. Increased Participation: More users might feel comfortable engaging in liquid staking protocols, knowing the regulatory uncertainty has lessened significantly. Enhanced Development: Developers can now build more robust and integrated DeFi applications that leverage liquid staking without the looming threat of being classified as unregistered securities. Market Confidence: This clarity could attract institutional investors who typically shy away from unregulated or ambiguous areas, potentially bringing more capital into the DeFi space. The distinction between liquid staking and traditional securities could set a precedent for future regulatory discussions concerning other decentralized protocols. This move is a crucial step towards fostering a more predictable environment for the digital asset economy. What Are the Next Steps for Crypto Enthusiasts and Developers? While this news is overwhelmingly positive, it is important to remember that the regulatory landscape is always evolving. What should crypto enthusiasts and developers consider moving forward? Stay Informed: Continue monitoring SEC statements and broader crypto regulations. Regulatory clarity can be incremental and subject to further interpretation. Due Diligence: Always conduct thorough research on any liquid staking protocol or DeFi platform before participating. Understand the risks involved, including smart contract vulnerabilities and market volatility. Advocate for Clarity: Support initiatives that promote clear, sensible regulation for the digital asset space. This ongoing dialogue is crucial for sustainable growth and further DeFi innovation . This clarification on liquid staking is a significant step towards fostering a more predictable and innovative environment for decentralized finance. In conclusion, the U.S. SEC‚Äôs recent statement confirming that liquid staking activities are not classified as securities marks a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency industry. This announcement provides much-needed regulatory clarity, significantly reducing uncertainty for participants and paving the way for accelerated DeFi innovation . It reinforces the idea that not all digital asset activities fit neatly into existing regulatory boxes and encourages a more nuanced approach. As the crypto ecosystem continues to mature, such distinctions are vital for fostering growth and ensuring a robust, compliant future. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. What is liquid staking? Liquid staking allows users to stake their cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum) to secure a blockchain network while receiving a liquid token representing their staked assets. This liquid token can then be used in other decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. 2. Why is the SEC‚Äôs clarification on liquid staking significant? The SEC‚Äôs statement confirms that liquid staking activities are not considered securities under current regulations. This provides crucial regulatory clarity, reducing uncertainty and fostering greater participation and innovation in the DeFi sector. 3. Does this mean all crypto activities are not securities? No, this clarification specifically applies to liquid staking activities. The SEC has previously deemed other crypto offerings, such as certain initial coin offerings (ICOs), as securities. Each crypto activity is assessed individually. 4. How does this impact DeFi projects? This clarity is highly beneficial for DeFi projects.

While the asset‚Äôs technical indicators show the move may be overheating, the broader picture reveals a network gaining serious traction. With major upgrades rolling out and key partnerships forming, Mantle appears to be hitting its stride at just the right moment in Ethereum‚Äôs scaling race. Source: Coingecko Mantle Hits $2.95B Market Cap: Can It Overtake Top L2s? Mantle is a modular Layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, built on Optimistic Rollups and integrated with EigenDA to enhance data availability and security. Since its mainnet launch in July 2023, Mantle has rolled out OP-Stack upgrades, including meta-transactions and fee optimizations, and launched the Mantle Ecofund, allocating $200 million for developer grants to drive DeFi, gaming, and AI innovation. As a utility and governance token, $MNT pays for transaction fees and on-chain voting and currently has a market cap of more than $2.953 billion . A flurry of partnerships and product launches has put Mantle Network squarely in the spotlight in the last few months. Since its February 2025 integration with Chainlink Scale , Mantle has operated live Data Feeds and Data Streams on mainnet, allowing decentralized oracle data at high throughput for smart contracts. Under the hood, Mantle‚Äôs technical architecture has made strides in both throughput and security. In March 2025, Mantle became the first major L2 to fully integrate EigenDA, expanding its data availability operators from just 10 to over 200 and slashing trust assumptions in favor of economic security. EigenDA is now the LARGEST alternative DA provider in the world (in TVL secured). Meet the new blueprint for scaling the next decade of crypto infrastructure.

June‚Äôs Yapperboard Challenge Phase 2 doled out 50,000 MNT in weekly Discord rewards, and July 8 kicked off the $1.2 million MNT Reward Booster Season 3 ‚Äîlocking MNT allows users to earn proportional shares of the prize pool through time-weighted snapshots. This spurred further on-chain activity, reflecting robust adoption: Q1 2025 recorded about 650,000 daily active users and over 30 million transactions, according to Mantle‚Äôs own progress review , showing a vibrant developer and user base. DeFi TVL stands at $233 million, up 2.4% in 24 hours, while bridging TVL exceeds $1.7 billion. As Mantle pushes toward its v2 roadmap with ZK proofs and expanded DA bridges, the coming months are expected to be another proving ground for this fast-moving Layer 2. Mantle Breaks Out Above $0.91, But Aggressive Sellers Return Near Session Highs $MNT has extended its upward streak on the back of sustained demand, pushing to a high of $0.9207 before retreating slightly. What‚Äôs interesting with this move is the shift in volume dynamics across the 1-hour footprint and how the price responded to it. During the early phase of the session, buy volume rose aggressively between $0.8650 and $0.8800 with supportive deltas in excess of 600K, which is indicative of committed spot and perpetual buyers lifting offers across multiple price levels. $MNT/USDT price chart, August 5 (Source: TradingView) This laid the groundwork for the impulsive move toward the $0.91 zone. However, the character changed in the final two candles. The volume footprint showed that while total traded volume exceeded 3.9 million in the last hour, delta flipped sharply negative to -1.07M. This goes beyond passive distribution; it was more of a direct selling into bids after a vertical rise. Such behavior often implies profit-taking or renewed supply entering the market, especially when it coincides with key round numbers like $0.9200. The 4-hour price chart backs up the strength of the rally, as $MNT pushed well above its 20, 50, and 100 SMAs, all now stacked in proper bullish order. The asset‚Äôs price has broken out of a falling structure and left behind a V-shaped recovery. That said, the RSI is approaching overheated territory, reading at 73.81, which historically warns of potential pause or pullback. The MACD remains supportive of trend continuation, with the lines widening and histogram building upwards, but it‚Äôs already extended. Momentum remains strong overall, but it‚Äôs worth noting the shift in effort versus result. Buyers had to expend more volume to push the price just a few cents higher toward the close. Unless fresh demand steps in above $0.9150, the risk of a local pullback grows. $MNT‚Äôs price may revisit the $0.8800‚Äì$0.8850 area again to test whether recent buyers are willing to reload. If they do, the way toward $0.94 remains open. If not, we could see today‚Äôs high as a temporary ceiling.

What explains this high confidence level? 1. Legal Clarity Surrounding Ripple In March 2025, the SEC formally dropped its longstanding lawsuit against Ripple, removing a major overhang for ETF issuers. This legal resolution reduced regulatory uncertainty and significantly bolstered confidence in XRP-based investment vehicles. 2. Growing Number of Institutional Filings Leading asset managers, including Bitwise, Grayscale, Franklin Templeton, 21Shares, CoinShares, ProShares, and more, have all submitted spot XRP ETF proposals to the SEC. The sheer volume and caliber of these filings suggest sustained institutional conviction in XRP‚Äôs long-term viability. 3. Futures ETFs Demonstrate Market Maturity CME Group launched XRP futures ETFs in mid-May this year, drawing more than $542 million in the first month More recently, ProShares introduced the Ultra XRP ETF (UXRP), a leveraged product on NYSE Arca, which surged on debut and re‚Äëenergized the narrative for spot approval. These developments signal demand and infrastructure maturity that regulators often seek. 4. Policy Developments and Framework Shifts Regulatory momentum has also shifted in favor of crypto ETFs. New legislation, such as the GENIUS Act and SEC commentary from commissioners, especially Hester Peirce, suggest an evolving framework that reduces operational complexity for altcoin ETF issuers through in‚Äëkind creation and redemption mechanisms. 5. Market Behavior and Prediction Dynamics Polymarket‚Äôs 86% figure is underpinned by real money bets with total wagered volumes recently exceeding $114,000, reflecting serious investor conviction. Historically, Polymarket‚Äôs prediction accuracy has exceeded 90% in betting markets shortly before resolution dates. The high odds also reflect growing sentiment that the SEC will complete the approval process before the December 31,‚ÄØ2025 resolution deadline. Market implications An 86% approval probability indicates widespread optimism. If a spot XRP ETF is approved: Institutional capital may flow into XRP as showcased by Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which saw tens of billions in inflows post‚Äëapproval. Liquidity and accessibility are set to improve because retail investors will gain regulated exposure to XRP via traditional brokerage accounts, without managing crypto wallets. Price upside could be significant with some analysts anticipating XRP might rise toward the $20‚Äì$27 zone, driven by ETF approval momentum, though volatility remains high. Ripple Officially Files Bank Charter Application with OCC Ripple Labs has formally submitted its application to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) seeking to establish Ripple National Trust Bank, a limited-purpose national trust bank fully owned by the company. Consequently, Ripple has made Volume‚ÄØ1 of its interagency charter application publicly available, offering stakeholders an initial window into the entity‚Äôs proposed structure and intended operations. This first volume outlines foundational details, such as the proposed headquarters in New York City, contact information, and a public notice announcing the filing. Volume‚ÄØ1 makes clear that Ripple is pursuing a national trust bank charter , which would empower the entity to undertake fiduciary duties, stablecoin reserve management, and institutional custody services, rather than traditional deposit-taking or consumer lending activities. Strategic Goals & Broader Context Ripple aims to secure a Federal Reserve Master Account, which would allow it to directly settle payments, hold reserves for its stablecoin RLUSD at the Federal Reserve, and bypass traditional intermediary banks, resulting in faster, more cost-effective settlement systems. Reactions & Implications The American Bankers Association and other banking groups, including the Independent Community Bankers of America, have formally opposed Ripple‚Äôs charter bid, citing concerns that a crypto-affiliated trust bank might erode consumer protections and destabilize traditional banking structures. However, industry observers note that under Comptroller Rodney Hood, the OCC has adopted a more crypto-friendly posture, rescinding prior restrictive guidance and historically rarely denying new charter applications. As majors like Circle and BitGo pursue similar charters, Ripple‚Äôs bid puts it at the forefront of a broader effort by crypto firms to bridge into regulated finance. Conclusion With Volume‚ÄØ1 public and the charter filing formalized, Ripple is set to redefine how stablecoins operate under U.S. federal oversight, turning ambition into architecture and innovation into institutional integration. Meanwhile, Polymarket‚Äôs 86% approval probability for a spot XRP ETF reflects a convergence of legal progress, institutional filings, market infrastructure maturity, and evolving regulatory sentiment. Therefore, this probability underscores a broad expectation that a US-based spot XRP ETF is increasingly viewed not as a question of if, but when.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,XRP|FIAT|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-08-05 17:26:48

He previously claimed that over 400 million people across the globe used USDT. The use of USDT also increased quarterly by 35 million wallets. The U.S. Treasury Department‚Äôs statistics showed that Tether held over $127 billion in U.S. treasuries as of the second quarter of 2025. The holdings compared it to sovereign nations like Germany, South Korea, and the UAE. Bernstein analysts expect USDT to continue dominating with a 65% share of the stablecoins market. They also claimed that stablecoins would soon evolve from the ‚Äúmoney rail of crypto markets‚Äù to the ‚Äúmoney rail of the internet.‚Äù The analysts believe the stablecoin market cap will grow 16x to over $4 trillion in the next ten years, up from the current $249 billion. They said this ‚Äútransformative growth‚Äù would be driven by the extensive use of crypto in payments through stablecoin-native financial services and tokenized capital markets. According to the GasFeesNow platform, sending USDt on Ethereum costs $0.5619, $0.0021 on BNB, $0.0002 in Polygon, and $3.94 to $8.01 on Tron. It also costs $0.0427 to send USDT on Ton, $0.001 to $0.1 on Solana, $0.0001 on Aptos, $0.0006 on Avalanche, and $0.0062 on Polkadot. However, the platform disclosed that estimating gas fees for the Tron network was a bit tricky. Tether plans to launch a new stablecoin Ardoino said in early April that Tether was considering developing a new stablecoin that would comply with pending U.S. stablecoin laws. He pointed out that his company had no problem with the USDT being banned in the U.S. due to regulatory restrictions. The Tether CEO claimed that a new stablecoin would help circumvent the ongoing regulatory issues. However, Ardoino clarified that his company had ‚Äúthe highest level of compliance‚Äù regarding cooperation with regulators. He stated that the theories and rumors about Tether staying out of the U.S. market due to regulatory issues were just competitor desperation. The Tether boss said his company did not have any issues with the pending stablecoin legislation in the United States. ‚ÄúWe believe that our main stablecoin is perfected for emerging markets, but we can craft a payment stablecoin that works for the U.S‚Ä¶.We need to have two products with two different value propositions.‚Äù ‚Äì Paolo Ardoino , CEO of Tether The Tether CEO was optimistic that the USDT would remain listed on secondary markets in the U.S. He pointed out that global access to USDT was critical for remittances.

For those closely following the rapid advancements in AI and its potential impact on various sectors, including the burgeoning blockchain and cryptocurrency space, this development signals a fascinating shift in strategy. These new OpenAI AI models are designed to be freely accessible, potentially democratizing advanced AI capabilities and fostering collaborative AI development . What Are These New OpenAI AI Models and Why Are They Important? OpenAI, a company often associated with its powerful proprietary systems, made a notable announcement on Tuesday: the launch of two open-weight AI reasoning models . These models are comparable in capability to their ‚Äòo-series‚Äô counterparts but come with a crucial difference ‚Äì they are freely available for download on Hugging Face, a popular online platform for developers. Here‚Äôs a quick look at what makes these models stand out: State-of-the-Art Performance: OpenAI describes these models as ‚Äòstate-of-the-art‚Äô when measured against several benchmarks for comparing other open models. Two Sizes for Versatility: The larger, more capable GPT-OSS-120b model can operate on a single Nvidia GPU. The lighter-weight GPT-OSS-20b model is designed to run efficiently on a consumer laptop with just 16GB of memory. First ‚ÄòOpen‚Äô Model Since GPT-2: This release marks OpenAI‚Äôs first ‚Äòopen‚Äô language model in over five years, signaling a potential shift back towards a more collaborative approach after years of focusing on proprietary, closed-source development. These models are designed to be highly versatile. They can even send complex queries to more powerful cloud-based AI models, meaning developers can connect an open model to OpenAI‚Äôs more capable closed models if a specific task, like image processing, is beyond the open model‚Äôs current scope. Why the Shift Towards Open Source AI? OpenAI‚Äôs history has seen it move from an early open-source advocate to a largely proprietary model. This shift helped them build a substantial business by selling API access to their advanced AI models. However, the landscape is changing, and this new release suggests a strategic pivot. Several factors appear to be driving OpenAI‚Äôs renewed interest in open source AI : CEO Sam Altman‚Äôs Perspective: Sam Altman, OpenAI‚Äôs CEO, stated in January that he believes the company has been ‚Äòon the wrong side of history‚Äô regarding open-sourcing its technologies. This sentiment likely reflects a re-evaluation of their long-term strategy. Rising Competition: Chinese AI labs, including DeepSeek, Alibaba‚Äôs Qwen, and Moonshot AI, have rapidly gained prominence by developing highly capable and popular open models. While Meta‚Äôs Llama models once dominated this space, they have recently fallen behind. This competition is pushing OpenAI to re-engage with the open-source community. Political Pressure: The Trump Administration has also urged U.S. AI developers to open source more technology. The goal is to promote the global adoption of AI that aligns with American values, a geopolitical angle that cannot be overlooked in the high-stakes world of AI. By releasing GPT-OSS , OpenAI aims to foster goodwill with both developers and policymakers, addressing concerns about the dominance of non-U.S. entities in the open-source AI arena. As Sam Altman stated, ‚ÄòOpenAI‚Äôs mission is to ensure AGI that benefits all of humanity. To that end, we are excited for the world to be building on an open AI stack created in the United States, based on democratic values, available for free to all and for wide benefit.‚Äô How Do These AI Reasoning Models Perform in Practice? OpenAI has set high expectations for its new open models, aiming for them to lead among other open-weight AI reasoning models . Here‚Äôs how they stacked up on some key benchmarks: Competitive Coding Test (Codeforces with tools): GPT-OSS-120b: Scored 2622 GPT-OSS-20b: Scored 2516 Both models outperformed DeepSeek‚Äôs R1 but underperformed OpenAI‚Äôs own o3 and o4-mini models. General Knowledge Test (Humanity‚Äôs Last Exam with tools): GPT-OSS-120b: Scored 19% GPT-OSS-20b: Scored 17.3% Again, these models underperformed o3 but surpassed leading open models from DeepSeek and Qwen. A Note on Hallucinations: It‚Äôs important to acknowledge that OpenAI‚Äôs new open models exhibit significantly higher hallucination rates compared to their latest proprietary models (o3 and o4-mini). For instance, on PersonQA, OpenAI‚Äôs in-house benchmark for knowledge accuracy about people: GPT-OSS-120b: Hallucinated in response to 49% of questions. GPT-OSS-20b: Hallucinated in response to 53% of questions. This is more than triple the hallucination rate of OpenAI‚Äôs o1 model (16%) and higher than o4-mini (36%). OpenAI explains this is ‚Äòexpected, as smaller models have less world knowledge than larger frontier models and tend to hallucinate more.‚Äô Unpacking the Training Behind GPT-OSS and Future AI Development The training processes for these new GPT-OSS models share similarities with OpenAI‚Äôs proprietary models, incorporating advanced techniques to enhance efficiency and capability. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE): Both models leverage MoE architecture, meaning they activate fewer parameters for any given question, which boosts efficiency. For example, the GPT-OSS-120b model, with 117 billion total parameters, only activates 5.1 billion parameters per token. High-Compute Reinforcement Learning (RL): The models were trained using high-compute RL, a post-training process that teaches AI models ‚Äòright from wrong‚Äô in simulated environments, often utilizing large clusters of Nvidia GPUs. This technique was also used for OpenAI‚Äôs o-series, giving the open models a similar ‚Äòchain-of-thought‚Äô process where they take additional time and computational resources to work through answers. AI Agent Capabilities: As a result of this post-training, OpenAI‚Äôs open models excel at powering AI agents, capable of calling tools like web search or Python code execution as part of their reasoning process. Text-Only Focus: It‚Äôs worth noting that these open models are currently text-only. They cannot process or generate images and audio, unlike some of OpenAI‚Äôs other models. Licensing and Safety Considerations in AI Development OpenAI is releasing GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b under the Apache 2.0 license, one of the most permissive open-source licenses available. This allows enterprises to monetize these OpenAI AI models without needing to pay or seek permission from the company. However, unlike some fully open-source offerings, OpenAI will not be releasing the training data used to create these models. This decision is understandable given ongoing lawsuits against AI model providers regarding the use of copyrighted works in training data. Safety has also been a significant concern, leading to delays in the release. OpenAI conducted thorough investigations, including third-party evaluations, into whether bad actors could fine-tune GPT-OSS models for malicious purposes, such as cyberattacks or creating biological/chemical weapons. While they found a marginal increase in biological capabilities, they concluded that these models would not reach a ‚Äòhigh capability‚Äô threshold for danger in these domains, even after fine-tuning. What‚Äôs Next for Open Source AI Development? The release of GPT-OSS marks a significant moment for open source AI , but the competitive landscape continues to evolve rapidly. Developers are eagerly anticipating the release of DeepSeek R2, its next AI reasoning model, and a new open model from Meta‚Äôs superintelligence lab. This dynamic environment suggests a future where open-source contributions will play an increasingly vital role in shaping the trajectory of artificial intelligence. A New Era of Collaborative AI OpenAI‚Äôs decision to re-engage with the open-source community through these new OpenAI AI models is a powerful statement. It acknowledges the growing importance of collaboration, competition, and ethical considerations in the rapidly advancing field of AI. By making these advanced AI reasoning models freely available, OpenAI is not only fostering broader innovation but also attempting to steer the future of AI development towards more transparent and globally beneficial outcomes. This move could redefine the pace and direction of AI progress, making sophisticated tools accessible to a wider range of developers and researchers worldwide.

His recent post on X hinted at a new phase in the long-awaited Midnight airdrop project. Many believe the claim portal for Midnight‚Äôs native token NIGHT could open on August 5, ahead of its official announcement. This has triggered fresh excitement among Cardano, XRP, and Bitcoin holders, who stand to gain the most from the upcoming distribution. Hoskinson‚Äôs Hint Fuels Midnight Airdrop Speculation Although there has been no direct confirmation, Hoskinson‚Äôs brief post quickly caught attention across the crypto space. The post has led many to believe that a new stage of the airdrop process is about to begin. Many believe it points to the opening of the Midnight airdrop claim portal. Some also suspect that other updates related to the Glacier Drop snapshot may be announced soon. Charles Hoskinson had earlier said that more details would be announced during the Rare Evo conference, taking place from August 6 to 10. He also assured the community that the airdrop would still take place in the second half of 2025, as planned. Cardano Midnight Glacier Drop Sets Stage for Massive Multi-Chain Airdrop Hoskinson previously confirmed the completion of the Midnight Glacier Drop snapshot. This marks a major step toward the airdrop of both NIGHT and DUST tokens. The Midnight Foundation shared details showing that over 37 million users across eight different blockchains will be eligible to receive tokens. Holders of Bitcoin, XRP, and Ethereum will receive tokens based on the amount they held at the time of the snapshot. The value will be based on a fixed exchange rate. XRP holders are reportedly among those set to receive the largest share of rewards. Over 2.2 million wallets holding more than 62 billion XRP will receive 1.2 billion worth of NIGHT tokens. Meanwhile, Cardano (ADA) users have the highest number of wallets eligible for the airdrop. This cross-chain approach has drawn a lot of attention from many in the crypto community. It highlights the growing focus on multi-chain integration and privacy in Web3. Hoskinson Responds to Critics Early reports suggest that the NIGHT token may be worth about $0.41. If more people use and adopt the token, it could become one of the top 20 crypto assets. Many believe this project could support the growth of privacy tools in Web3 and help build stronger links between different blockchain systems . Meanwhile, some critics have accused Hoskinson of delaying Cardano‚Äôs progress. In response, he pointed to the strong interest Midnight has already received, including attention from financial institutions. Hoskinson made it clear that Midnight is a core part of Cardano‚Äôs future. He emphasized that both projects share a long-term vision and will grow together. This initiative is part of Hoskinson‚Äôs broader plan to make Cardano more competitive in the blockchain industry .

With the Altcoin Season Index holding below 40, the market is not yet in full rotation. Still, Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Cardano are showing that selective flows can define this stage of the cycle. Shiba Inu: Ecosystem Resilience in a Cooling Market The Shiba Inu price stands at $0.000012 , with a market cap of about $7‚ÄØbillion and daily volume near $210‚ÄØmillion, according to CoinMarketCap. Unlike earlier cycles, SHIB‚Äôs relevance is no longer tied only to social energy. Shibarium, its Layer‚Äë2 network, continues to settle DeFi transactions and NFT activity, while DAO proposals seek to broaden governance participation. Although SHIB is down roughly 8% over the past week, its on‚Äëchain participation suggests a more sustainable footing than prior meme cycles. Whale wallet growth of over 600% in recent weeks supports the idea that longer‚Äëterm holders are active. Dogecoin: Liquidity Anchor for Risk Appetite The Dogecoin price trades around $0.20, giving it a $30‚ÄØbillion market cap and $1.7‚ÄØbillion in daily turnover. DOGE has eased about 5% from late‚ÄëJuly highs but remains one of the most liquid altcoins. DOGE Price (Source: CoinMarketCap) For traders, DOGE functions as a liquidity anchor when speculative appetite rises. Analysts forecast near‚Äëterm resistance around $0.215 and possible extension toward $0.30 if risk flows deepen. Its ongoing retail base and integration into payment platforms make it unique among meme coins in sustaining consistent volume across cycles. DOGE‚Äôs behavior reinforces the argument that altseason need not mean new projects alone‚Äîit often revives legacy tokens that still capture liquidity quickly. Cardano: Testing Institutional Narratives The Cardano price is holding near $0.73 , with a market cap close to $26‚ÄØbillion and daily volume above $1‚ÄØbillion. Cardano‚Äôs technical roadmap remains active. Hydra scaling and Mithril sync upgrades are operational, while Voltaire governance steps continue. But what sets ADA apart in this phase is its appeal to institutional and regulatory‚Äëfocused investors. Stablecoins such as USDA and Djed are expanding on‚Äëchain liquidity, and Total Value Locked has reached around $470‚ÄØmillion. Analysts argue that these developments could give ADA an edge if broader inflows return later in 2025, even as short‚Äëterm sentiment remains soft. A Selective Altcoin Season The Altcoin Season Index ‚Äôs current level indicates that Bitcoin is still outperforming most altcoins. Yet SHIB, DOGE, and ADA show that rotation does not have to be broad to matter. Each token demonstrates a different path: community sustainability, liquidity resilience, and institutional alignment. Rather than a sweeping altseason, this period looks defined by selective positioning into tokens with clear liquidity or utility anchors. Traders appear willing to allocate where there is structure and participation, even while mid‚Äëcaps remain muted. Shiba Inu, Dogecoin, and Cardano together reflect the layered nature of this altcoin season debate. SHIB leans on ecosystem sustainability, DOGE continues to anchor speculative liquidity, and ADA appeals to regulatory‚Äëaligned growth narratives. Whether this expands into a full altseason remains uncertain, but these tokens are already shaping how traders view capital rotation in mid‚Äë2025.

49594381,https://invezz.com/?p=2827299,1754415814,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Jito Labs proposes full revenue control for DAO in JIP-24 governance proposal,https://invezz.com/news/2025/08/05/jito-labs-proposes-full-revenue-control-for-dao-in-jip-24-governance-proposal/,"In a bold step toward deepening decentralisation and empowering token holders, Jito Labs has introduced a governance proposal, JIP-24 , that seeks to reroute all protocol-generated fees directly to the Jito DAO treasury. The initiative has generated significant buzz across the Solana ecosystem, as it signals a potential shift in how value is captured and redistributed within one of the network‚Äôs largest DeFi protocols. If approved, the proposal will not only eliminate Jito Labs‚Äô share of fees but will also grant the DAO full control over revenue management. This could have long-term implications for the JTO token value and the financial sovereignty of the community. Jito DAO to receive 100% of fee revenue At the heart of the JIP-24 proposal is a restructuring of how protocol fees are distributed. Currently, 6% of the rewards from Jito‚Äôs Block Engine, an infrastructure component responsible for extracting and routing MEV (maximal extractable value), is split evenly between Jito Labs and the DAO. However, under JIP-24, this fee split will be scrapped entirely. Instead, the full 6% will flow directly into the Jito DAO treasury. Moreover, all future revenue generated by the recently launched Block Assembly Marketplace (BAM) will also be directed to the same treasury address. This transition is aimed at ensuring that all economic value created within the Jito ecosystem accrues to the DAO and, by extension, to JTO token holders. It also reflects a growing trend across decentralised finance, where protocols are increasingly shifting fee ownership to community-led entities. The launch of BAM transaction sequencing layer Notably, the JIP-24 proposal arrives alongside the launch of BAM, a new transaction sequencing layer that brings verifiability, programmability, and privacy to Solana‚Äôs blockspace economy. BAM introduces ‚Äúplugins‚Äù that allow developers to embed custom logic into block building, opening up new monetisation channels for the network. Revenue from these plugins is expected to be substantial. Officials estimate that, when combined with existing Block Engine fees, the DAO could generate up to $15 million annually in recurring revenue. With the adoption of BAM still in its early stages, that figure could grow over time. This potential windfall places the DAO in a stronger financial position and could enhance its ability to fund initiatives that drive long-term protocol value. Jito DAO treasury to be steered by Cryptoeconomics SubDAO JIP-24 also defines a strategic roadmap for deploying the incoming funds. Revenue will be managed by the Cryptoeconomics SubDAO (CSD), an autonomous governance body established under a previous proposal, JIP-17. The CSD is tasked with designing and executing token value-accrual strategies. These may include buybacks, staking incentives, fee-switch mechanisms, and grants aimed at ecosystem expansion. Its mandate is both technical and economic, aiming to align capital deployment with the long-term interests of the network. With a sub-treasury already funded with $7.5 million in JitoSOL and 5 million JTO tokens, the CSD is positioned to begin deploying programs within the next two quarters. Transparency measures, including updated dashboards and annual reporting, will ensure that all fund usage is publicly accountable. Potential risks While the benefits of JIP-24 are clear, the proposal also acknowledges potential risks. The reconfiguration of fee routing involves technical steps such as Revenue Routing Transactions (RRTs) and updates to on-chain addresses. Delays in these processes could slow implementation. Additionally, managing multiple revenue streams introduces accounting complexity. However, the DAO plans to address this through robust financial reporting and monitoring tools, aiming to maintain transparency and efficiency. Despite these challenges, early sentiment within the Jito community appears strongly supportive. With the DAO poised to become the sole recipient of all protocol revenues, many see JIP-24 as a defining moment in the network‚Äôs journey toward full decentralisation. Implications for JTO token holders For crypto traders and investors, the passage of JIP-24 could have meaningful implications for the value of JTO. By centralising all revenue within the DAO and empowering tokenholder-driven governance, the proposal enhances the economic case for holding JTO. As capital flows increase and strategic programs roll out, demand-side pressure on the token could rise. This may be especially impactful in a market where protocol value capture increasingly drives token valuations. Moreover, the structure proposed in JIP-24 creates a more transparent, data-driven framework for aligning revenue growth with tokenholder benefit. This aligns with broader DeFi trends and positions the Jito DAO as a revolutionary, revenue-generating collective.

Among the pinnacle contenders are Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA), two properly set up altcoins with sturdy ecosystems. But there‚Äôs also a growing potential project in the AI-crypto region‚ÄîOzak AI ($OZ)‚Äîpresently in its presale stage, yet already gaining main traction for its innovation and upside potential. Let‚Äôs break down what each of these projects gives and which one really has the capability to turn modest investments into life-changing profits. Solana (SOL) Solana has made a remarkable comeback due to the fact it dipped in 2022. Known for its lightning-fast transactions and low prices, Solana has positioned itself as a high-performance alternative to Ethereum. The network has seen an explosive boom in NFT projects, DeFi apps, and memecoin trading. With a current price hovering around $164, many analysts consider SOL may want to revisit or maybe surpass its preceding all-time excessive close to $260. A 10x gain from right here would place SOL at around $1,600, which, while not impossible, could require large institutional capital and broader crypto market growth. While Solana has strong fundamentals, it may not offer the kind of early-stage upside that smaller-cap tokens like Ozak AI can. Cardano (ADA) Cardano has long been known for its scientific approach to blockchain development. With peer-reviewed protocols and steady upgrades through the Hydra and Basho phases, ADA is aiming to become one of the most scalable and interoperable blockchains in the space. Currently priced around $0.72, a 10x from here would bring ADA to $7.20, close to its long-term price projections. Many Cardano holders are bullish on its ability to attract more dApps and DeFi protocols as the ecosystem matures. However, Cardano‚Äôs slow development pace has often frustrated investors, and in a bull market where speed and hype matter, ADA could underperform compared to more agile projects. Ozak AI ($OZ) Ozak AI ‚Äîa newcomer that‚Äôs quickly establishing itself as one of the hottest presale tokens of 2025. With the world turning toward AI-driven tools and automation, Ozak AI blends crypto and artificial intelligence in a way that‚Äôs directly usable by traders and analysts. Currently in its 4th Ozak AI presale stage at just $0.005 per token, Ozak AI has already raised over $1.5 million and sold more than 65 million tokens. The platform offers: Exclusive AI Agents for predictive market analysis Real-Time Analytics through the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) Performance-Based Rewards for using high-accuracy models The utility is clear, the tokenomics are strong (only 10% unlock at TGE, followed by a 6-month vesting), and upcoming listings are confirmed on both a top centralized exchange and a leading DEX post-TGE. A move from $0.005 to just $0.50 would be a 100x gain‚Äîand even a smaller post-launch rally to $0.05 would offer 10x upside, far more than what‚Äôs expected from SOL or ADA in the same time frame. So, which one will 10x by 2025? Let‚Äôs compare: Solana: Solid fundamentals, could 2x‚Äì4x realistically, but 10x requires extreme market conditions. Cardano: Has potential for 5x‚Äì8x with ecosystem growth, but still facing headwinds due to slow execution. Ozak AI: Low market cap, huge hype, and real AI use cases‚Äîeasily has the clearest path to 10x and beyond, especially if it gains traction post-listing. Solana and Cardano remain strong long-term plays for those seeking relatively stable growth in the altcoin space. But if you're hunting for true early-stage moonshot potential, Ozak AI could be the token to watch. With its AI-powered tools, growing presale success, and aggressive listing roadmap, $OZ might just be the breakout crypto that defines the 2025 bull run.

Gabriel Rey, CEO of licensed crypto exchange Triv, and Anthony Leong, Deputy Secretary General of the Indonesian Young Entrepreneurs Association (HIPMI), both argue that it is time for Indonesia to explore the possibility, and proposed that Bitcoin be included as one of BPI Danantara‚Äôs investment options. Leong says if BPI Danantara allocated IDR 300 trillion (about $18.3 billion) to Bitcoin, it could lock up up to 200,000 BTC. The profits generated could help reduce some of the national debt if the digital asset‚Äôs price increases significantly. The Daya Anagata Nusantara Investment Management Agency (BPI Danantara) was officially launched by the President of the Republic of Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto, on February 24, 2025, and is tasked with managing state assets independently to accelerate long-term development. The purpose of the Bitcoin reserve would be to diversify state assets, protect national wealth from inflation, and keep up with the trend of developed countries that are starting to include crypto assets in their portfolios. The proposal triggered support and opposition across various circles, and among those that spoke up was Indonesia‚Äôs financial regulator, Financial Services Authority (OJK). OJK was cautious in its response, expressing a willingness to entertain the discourse further, while emphasizing the need for strong regulations and governance if it were to happen. If the discourse becomes a reality, it could make Indonesia one of the first countries in Southeast Asia to adopt Bitcoin as part of its sovereign wealth fund.

With $1B in daily trading volume, the payments-focused cryptocurrency is testing key resistance levels while institutional interest grows. As one of the most widely used payment cryptocurrencies, Litecoin‚Äôs fundamentals continue to strengthen even as price action turns volatile. Source: CoinGecko From Mining Apps to Mainstream Payments: Why Litecoin is 2025‚Äôs Dark Horse Litecoin is a crypto network designed for daily use. People and businesses frequently use the blockchain and its underlying asset for daily transactions and point-of-sale payments. The Litecoin network validates transactions faster, utilizing a block time of 2.5 minutes and low transaction fees, which gives it a triple combination of speed, security, and affordability. This appeal has seen Litecoin grow into a quiet powerhouse in the crypto payment sector, where it now leads as the second most-used digital asset for transactions, just right behind Bitcoin.

For instance, California-based pharmaceutical company MEI Pharma made headlines recently when it allocated $100 million to Litecoin as part of its corporate treasury strategy, a major vote of confidence in the asset‚Äôs long-term value. Additionally, speculation around a spot Litecoin ETF is gaining traction. Analysts are putting the odds of approval as high as 90% by 2025. Although the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on Grayscale‚Äôs application until October, such procedural steps are common and not necessarily negative. Looking ahead, analysts are eyeing a price range of $160 to $170 in the short term. Can $LTC break through? Let‚Äôs consider the TA below. Litecoin Pauses After Strong Recovery, But Buyers Still Show Up Around $122 After several sessions of steady price appreciation, $LTC is experiencing a cooling-off phase near $123‚Äì$124. The 1-hour chart reveals that the pair recently climbed from below $111 to touch a local high of $127.50. However, the price has started pulling back, and a closer look at the volume footprint shows that sellers attempted to regain control around the $126‚Äì$127 area, where aggressive selling volume began to outweigh bids. Despite this, buyers are still defending the $122.50‚Äì$123.00 region with decent absorption. The volume footprint confirms strong interest during the breakout candle around 08:00 UTC, with over 800K contracts traded and a slightly negative delta, indicating that sellers were pressing but failed to halt the move. A second burst occurred around 11:00, with 1.4M in total volume but a large negative delta of -72.6K, showing that sellers overwhelmed the tape in that period. Yet, there was no dramatic follow-through afterward, implying that while the bears were active, they didn‚Äôt drive the price much lower. On the price chart, $LTC remains above its 20, 50, and 100-period SMAs, confirming that the short- to mid-term structure is still intact. The 20-SMA has begun moving upward, providing intraday support during the pullback. However, momentum has slowed. Another indicator of interest is the Relative Strength Index, otherwise known as the RSI. The RSI has fallen from overbought levels and is now around 58. This gives it some breathing space, but without instilling any form of bearish divergence. Nonetheless, we expect the broader market trend to remain as it is, unless the bears unexpectedly push $LTC below the 20-SMA line around $122.5. On the other hand, a forward and decisive nudge towards $127.50 would continue the bullish structure.

The product, called the Global USD Account, is aimed at companies seeking U.S. dollar access and cross-border payments without a U.S. bank account. It introduces Slash‚Äôs own stablecoin, USDSL, which lets users store, send and receive dollars or stablecoins in one account, the company announced. The setup aims to shorten settlement times and remove foreign exchange fees for cross-border payments to U.S. suppliers, the company said in an interview with CoinDesk. Stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrencies pegged to external assets like the U.S. dollar, have grown into a $250 billion market, often touted as a faster, cheaper option for international payments. Interest in the sector has accelerated since U.S. President Donald Trump signed the GENIUS Act into law, setting new federal standards for stablecoin issuers. Global banks and retailers including Amazon and Walmart are reportedly exploring stablecoin products, and payments firms like PayPal and Stripe have made significant moves in the space. Stripe acquired stablecoin infrastructure firm Bridge last year for $1.1 billion. Slash's first foray into stablecoins allowed customers to send and receive USDC (USDC) and USDT (USDT) payments on the platform without having to hold the tokens, converting them automatically to U.S. dollars. ""It's super interesting because we were very much not a crypto company,"" Cardenas said, adding that he personally didn't know much about blockchain technology. ""But then we had these wholesalers and marketing agencies telling us we need to have stablecoin payments to accept money from customers at lower cost."" ""So we shipped it for them,"" he said. Launched in December, that feature now already processes nearly $1 billion annualized volume and inspired the firm to go bigger with stablecoins, Cardenas said. The firm now targets crypto companies that want to consolidate their treasury management that previously needed separate accounts at traditional banks, exchanges and custody providers. With the new slate of products, clients can convert between stablecoins, manage balances and off-ramp to U.S. bank accounts through ACH, wire or SWIFT transfers. They can also earn yield on their balances without triggering securities rules, the company said. Future plans include launching a card that lets businesses spend their stablecoin balances and potentially a wallet for holding other crypto assets, Cardenas said. In May, Slash raised $41 million in a Series B round led by Goodwater Capital, valuing the company at $370 million.

The data highlights USDT‚Äôs deep, systemic importance to the on-chain economy. The company also posted a massive $5.7 billion in profit in the first half of 2025. Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino disclosed that transfers of USD‚ÇÆ (USDT) now account for 40‚ÄØpercent of all blockchain transaction fees paid across nine major blockchain networks.

49594359,548170,1754416807,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/49594359.jpeg,Bitcoin Spot Market Dries Up: Relentless Buying Off Exchanges Powers Growth,https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-market-dries-up-buying-off-exchanges/,"Bitcoin is trading at a pivotal level after losing key support zones, triggering concerns among investors about a potential deeper correction. After spending over two weeks consolidating in a tight range, BTC broke down sharply, reaching lows around $112,000. This sudden drop has shaken market sentiment, with some analysts warning of further downside if demand fails to absorb the recent selling pressure. However, not all indicators are flashing red. Top analyst Axel Adler shared compelling data revealing that, starting from the end of February 2024, the average Exchange Netflow on centralized exchanges (CEXs) has been predominantly negative. In fact, Netflows were positive on only two occasions since then, indicating that demand has consistently outpaced supply during this period. This sustained outflow of Bitcoin from exchanges signals strong accumulation trends, as investors continue to withdraw BTC for long-term holding rather than selling into the market. While the current price action has sparked fear of a bearish reversal, the underlying demand dynamics suggest that the broader uptrend may still be intact. Whether Bitcoin can defend the $112K support zone and recover in the coming sessions will be crucial in determining the next phase of its market cycle. Supply Shortage Deepens As Bitcoin Accumulation Persists According to analyst Axel Adler, Bitcoin‚Äôs supply dynamics continue to paint a bullish long-term picture despite recent price volatility. Adler highlights that coins have been consistently bought off exchanges for nearly a year and a half, significantly reducing the available liquidity in the spot market. This persistent outflow has gradually created a supply shortage, which has been a key driver behind Bitcoin‚Äôs impressive growth over the past months. This accumulation trend remains active, with investors ‚Äî particularly long-term holders and institutional players ‚Äî continuing to withdraw BTC from exchanges at a steady pace. As liquidity dries up, even moderate demand can trigger outsized price moves, which has fueled much of Bitcoin‚Äôs upward trajectory. However, Adler also points out a growing challenge: as Bitcoin approaches historically overvalued levels, selling pressure is beginning to surface. Short-term holders and profit-takers are becoming more active, especially as BTC tests key psychological price levels. This friction between dwindling supply and increasing profit-taking behavior could lead to heightened volatility in the coming weeks. If accumulation continues to outpace supply inflows, the broader uptrend could remain intact. Yet, the overvaluation signals suggest a period of consolidation or corrective moves is necessary to reset market conditions before Bitcoin attempts another push toward new highs. Price Analysis: Key Levels To Watch Bitcoin is currently trading at $114,937 after facing a sharp correction from its recent all-time high of $123,000. The daily chart shows that BTC lost the critical $115,724 support level, which has now turned into immediate resistance. The price is attempting to retest this level, but the rejection from the 50-day moving average around $115,100 suggests that bulls are struggling to regain momentum. The price structure reveals a clear breakdown from the tight range formed between $115K and $122K, followed by a lower high formation that indicates weakening bullish strength. Volume has been declining during this rebound attempt, signaling a lack of strong buying interest at current levels. The 100-day moving average at $108,100 serves as the next major support if BTC fails to reclaim $115K. On the upside, reclaiming the $115,724 level with strong volume would be a bullish sign, potentially triggering a move back toward the $120K-$122K resistance zone. However, failure to break above this level could confirm a bearish retest and increase the likelihood of BTC revisiting the $112K-$110K support range in the coming sessions.

With so many new and growing projects, knowing the top performing cryptos can help avoid short wins and aim for bigger gains. One name now drawing attention is Cold Wallet, offering buyers a strong price advantage before its public launch. Below are four of the top performing cryptos that stand out in today‚Äôs market, starting with a project that‚Äôs showing results before even hitting exchanges. Cold Wallet (CWT): Early-Stage Value Backed by Real Users Cold Wallet stands out as one of the top performing cryptos with a strong mix of rewards, real-world function, and growth potential. It is in presale stage 16 and priced at $0.00942. Compared to its set listing price of $0.3517, that gives buyers a 37x head start. Some even see a 100x gain possible with more traction. This project doesn‚Äôt rely on hype. Cold Wallet is a working self-custody wallet that gives users CWT tokens as cashback for gas fees, swaps, and even for moving money in or out. The more CWT you hold, the more you earn. At the highest level, gas fees are fully refunded. Fueling this growth is the $270 million purchase of Plus Wallet, which added over 2 million users. This boosts both transaction volume and token demand. The reward system, paid in CWT, helps strengthen usage and engagement. So far, Cold Wallet has raised $5.7 million in its crypto presale. With working systems, user rewards, and even USDT referral payouts, Cold Wallet is gaining momentum quickly. Cardano‚Äôs Careful Build Keeps It on the Radar Cardano has long been one of the top performing cryptos for those focused on the long term. Its design is based on peer-reviewed work and formal methods, appealing to those who value structure and dependability. ADA avoids fast spikes, instead building slow momentum through smart contract support and new tools for governance. With more dApps launching and Layer 2 projects like Hydra rolling out, Cardano still draws attention from those who prefer steady growth. If tools like smart contracts and digital ID services expand in usage, ADA may still have room to prove early support was worth it. Dogecoin Still Stands Thanks to Its Loyal Base Dogecoin remains on the list of top performing cryptos mostly because of its wide reach and strong online following. First created as a joke, DOGE got a serious push from Elon Musk and big-name platforms. With its low fees and easy use, it‚Äôs often the first coin that new users buy. Even though its design is basic compared to newer coins, the value of Dogecoin lies in its community. There are even plans to link it with Starlink for off-grid payments, keeping ideas flowing. If meme coins return to the spotlight in 2025, DOGE could once again ride that trend. Solana Gains Speed and Real-World Reach Solana is counted among the top performing cryptos due to its speed and low cost. It has become a key network for NFTs, fast DeFi tools, and apps built for daily use. Solana Pay, its Shopify plug-in, and retailers accepting SOL show how it is moving beyond just digital trading. After facing tech issues in 2022, Solana has bounced back with better performance and more active development. With strong backers and ongoing upgrades, SOL could benefit again if user-heavy apps keep growing. Closing Thoughts While Cardano, Dogecoin, and Solana have all secured their spot among the top performing cryptos, none provide the same crypto presale upside and built-in demand cycle as Cold Wallet. With a live product, active users, and a pricing gap that is difficult to overlook, CWT offers early buyers something uncommon in crypto: real space for large ROI. If you are aiming to place yourself for possible 100x returns before wider attention arrives, Cold Wallet could be the one you regret passing up.

With multiple major projects building momentum, choosing the best-performing cryptos in 2025 can mark the gap between minor returns and life-changing gains. Among these, Cold Wallet has started gaining traction for offering early participants an entry point that few projects can currently match. Below is a breakdown of four of the best-performing cryptos in 2025 that are worth watching closely, beginning with a lesser-known name already showing strong performance. Cold Wallet (CWT): Presale Gem Set to Deliver Huge Gains Cold Wallet stands out among the best-performing cryptos in 2025 due to its rare combination of utility, user rewards, and strong growth. In presale stage 16, CWT trades at $0.00942, a figure that becomes notable when compared to its confirmed listing value of $0.3517. This translates into a 37x potential even before market launch, with some projections suggesting the upside could extend to 100x based on projected traction. What gives Cold Wallet its real edge is not just pricing. It is a self-custody crypto wallet that pays its users back in CWT for every transaction, including swaps, gas fees, and entry/exit actions. There are no complex rules or lock-ins‚Äîusers simply earn while they use. The cashback amount increases with how much CWT is held, with some users eligible for up to 100% gas refunds. The upside also gets a serious push from Cold Wallet‚Äôs $270 million takeover of Plus Wallet, which instantly brought in over 2 million users. More people using the platform means more activity. More activity leads to increased demand for the coin. As the rewards are given in CWT, it creates a loop of activity and demand that fuels growth. Having a functioning product, an effective reward model, and a referral program already paying in USDT, Cold Wallet is gaining traction fast. Its presale has already crossed over $5.7 million, selling more than 683 million coins. Cardano (ADA): Long-Term Growth Rooted in Academic Design Among the best-performing cryptos in 2025, Cardano remains a steady choice for those focused on consistency and technical depth. Its foundations are built on peer-reviewed principles and formal verification methods, which appeal to those who value reliability. While ADA may not deliver fast price spikes, its gradual rollout of smart contracts and governance tools continues to build a sustainable DeFi base. Ongoing developments like Layer 2 scaling through Hydra and increasing numbers of decentralized applications contribute to Cardano‚Äôs ongoing appeal. For those favoring solid growth over hype, ADA remains a solid contender. If decentralized identity and smart contract usage expand, Cardano could move past many current expectations. Dogecoin (DOGE): Still Powerful Thanks to Its Community and Reach Dogecoin keeps its spot on the list of best-performing cryptos in 2025 due to strong community backing and wide recognition. It started as a meme but quickly evolved into a recognized digital currency after being supported by Elon Musk and major exchanges. Known for its ease of use, very low fees, and strong online presence, it continues to appeal to a wide audience. Though newer digital assets have more advanced features, Dogecoin thrives because of its loyal user base. Plans to connect DOGE with Starlink for off-grid payments add a level of speculation that keeps the community involved. If we see another retail-driven cycle in 2025, DOGE could see a fresh wave of gains. Solana (SOL): High-Speed Chain With Strong Institutional Ties Solana secures a place among the best-performing cryptos in 2025 by combining high speed, low costs, and increasing real-world adoption. The network is known for fast transactions and has become a top choice for NFTs, consumer-facing applications, and high-speed DeFi protocols. Integration with Shopify through Solana Pay and increasing acceptance among physical retailers shows its practical appeal. Although the project encountered performance setbacks in 2022, it has recovered significantly due to growing developer contributions and better system reliability. With continuing upgrades and funding from major backers, Solana is in a strong position to grow, especially if apps requiring rapid processing become popular. To Sum Up! Cardano, Dogecoin, and Solana each represent solid choices among the best-performing cryptos in 2025. But none present the same early-stage growth window and built-in value loop that Cold Wallet does. With a strong product, working utility, and over 683 million coins already sold, CWT token presale gives users a chance to benefit from one of the rarest factors in crypto: time on their side. For those searching for 100x possibilities before mainstream entry, Cold Wallet might be the one that sets a new benchmark among the best-performing cryptos in 2025 .

Although some analysts have forecasted a blow-off top in October or November, Quinten Francois, a respected crypto market commentator, strongly disagrees. Drawing from historical data and market psychology, Francois believes that the current bull market is far from over and that expectations for a Q4 2025 top are ‚Äújust not going to happen.‚Äù November Is Too Soon For A Bitcoin Peak Taking to the social media platform X, Bitcoin commentator Quinten argued that any expectations for a full market peak by November completely overlook how previous cycles have unfolded. He pointed out that in both 2017 and 2021, the altseason, the period when altcoins outperform Bitcoin, began in Q1 of those respective bull market years. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Loading As Bitcoin Dominance Crashes Toward 60% From that point, the retail-driven psychological cycle took roughly 9 to 12 months to fully play out. This time around, the analyst suggests that altseason hasn‚Äôt even started in earnest. The ETH/BTC ratio, often used as the criteria for altseason momentum, is only just beginning to reverse. Given this timing, Quinten noted that a cycle top occurring within the next two or three months is nearly impossible. The moment altseason begins marks the entry of broad retail participation, and from that point onward, it typically takes 9 to 12 months for euphoria and market excess to reach a crescendo. If history is any guide, the current psychological cycle is still in its early stages because the retail cycle hasn‚Äôt properly kicked in yet. This would push a market peak into the second or third quarter of 2026 at the earliest. Altcoin Cycle Will Determine If Peak Is Possible The only condition that could allow for a major top this year, Quinten admitted, would be an absence of an altcoin cycle altogether. That scenario, or a catastrophic black swan event, could short-circuit the retail cycle and lead to an earlier-than-usual top. However, the possibility of this happening is very low, and this psychological cycle simply cannot play out much quicker than 9-12 months. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Index Spikes Above 30, But Bitcoin Dominance Remains High, What Next? As such, Bitcoin‚Äôs price action is most likely to play out like it has always done. ‚ÄúIf things unfold as they historically have (we can only count on this), then it‚Äôs just not going to happen,‚Äù he said. Although the analyst did not give a price target for the expected Bitcoin top for this cycle, other technical analysts have pointed to targets between $140,000 and $200,000. In another post on the social media platform, Quinten noted that Bitcoin is currently playing out its biggest bullish setup in history. This outlook is based on a current retest of an ascending trendline of all-time highs, which Bitcoin broke above in July. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $114,460, having declined by about 3.7% in the past seven days.

BounceBit confirmed the integration on August 5 through its BounceBit Prime product, making the Blockchain Capital and YZi Labs-backed platform a new destination for structured yield strategies. Improving Capital Efficiency with Tokenized Assets Under the integration, Franklin Templeton‚Äôs fund is collateral and settlement on BounceBit Prime‚Äôs platform. The move enhances capital efficiency since investors can not only hold the yield-bearing asset but also use it in yield-bearing strategies across exchange venues. The tokenized fund offers a current yield of approximately 4.5%, offering double benefits to investors: a baseline yield from the fund itself as well as additional yield opportunity within the BounceBit ecosystem. BounceBit stated: This launch paves the way for what BB Prime will become: A venue for execution of tokenized RWA ‚Äî backed by institutional-grade collateral and governed by programmable logic.‚Äù Franklin Templeton‚Äôs Onchain Growth Franklin Templeton launched the OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund in 2021, offering tokenized shares through the BENJI token. As of August 4, the fund is also supported by Anchorage Digital Bank and operates on Ethereum, Solana, Stellar, Avalanche, and VeChain. The fund holds $692 million in assets, rendering it among the biggest onchain institutional products of its kind. The Broader RWA Ecosystem BounceBit is among a growing number of players introducing tokenized RWAs to broader accessibility . Some of the other big names in the space include BlackRock, Fidelity, Janus Henderson, and Guggenheim Treasury. They are helping to grow the onchain market for a wide variety of assets, from U.S. Treasury debt to tokenized stocks, private credit, and corporate bonds. BounceBit is looking to launch its tokenized stock product in the U.S., Europe, Hong Kong, and Japan. That puts it in direct competition with the integration of platforms like Robinhood, which launched tokenized U.S. stocks on Arbitrum in July, and eToro, which made a similar announcement as well. Conclusion The integration of Franklin Templeton‚Äôs tokenized fund into BounceBit represents a watershed for the growth of the RWA market. As more and more institutional-grade assets move onchain, platforms like BounceBit are positioning themselves at the leading edge of capital-efficient crypto investing.",Blockchain|Sticky|Web3,EN,0,0,MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ASIA|MACROECONOMICS,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-08-05 18:02:42

Known for accurately forecasting XRP‚Äôs rise from $0.50 and its previous crash to $0.28, JD now says the token is headed into double-digit territory ‚Äîbut warns a devastating 90% crash will follow once the peak is confirmed. JD‚Äôs Proven Track Record and New Forecast JD has earned credibility in the XRP community for calling key market turns. His latest update projects that XRP is on course to surge into the two-digit price range, potentially targeting levels around $17 . This outlook is based on historical technical patterns and market structure signals. According to JD, the same strategy that helped him call XRP‚Äôs 70% crash to $0.28 is now guiding his plan for the coming rally and subsequent collapse. His warning is clear: take calculated profits as XRP climbs. Once the top is confirmed, he expects a violent retracement similar to previous bear markets. My top is in the 2 digits for $XRP But make sure to take calculated profits! Once we confirmed TOP.. I'm calling the 90% crash! Will use exact same strategy when I called the bottom 70% crash to 0.28! But will use a PINK BOX instead of ORANGE #xrparmy #XRPCommunity https://t.co/UHcWik6dP2 ‚Äî JD (@jaydee_757) August 4, 2025 Technical Setups Point to Explosive Upside JD‚Äôs forecast is anchored in strong technical analysis. He highlights a newly formed hidden bullish divergence on XRP‚Äôs two-week chart‚Äîsomething he previously identified before XRP‚Äôs massive 2017 rally. He also points to a breakout from a long-standing symmetrical triangle, a pattern that historically signals the start of major price expansions. If the current trend mirrors previous cycles, JD believes XRP could exceed its all-time high and enter the $10‚Äì$20 range before topping out. However, he emphasizes that such a move will likely be followed by a steep collapse, wiping out up to 90% of those gains for unprepared holders. Emphasis on Profit-Taking and Risk Management A central message in JD‚Äôs post is the importance of profit-taking. Rather than holding blindly for extreme highs, JD encourages traders to secure gains gradually as XRP climbs. This measured approach is based on hard lessons from previous cycles, where traders who failed to exit near the top faced crippling losses in the aftermath. His strategy includes watching for top confirmation signals and scaling out of positions before the broader market turns. JD warns that ignoring these signs could leave investors trapped in a brutal correction that may push XRP back to low single-digit prices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 ‚Äî TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Wider Market Views and Analyst Consensus JD‚Äôs outlook aligns with other analysts forecasting dramatic moves for XRP. EGRAG Crypto has suggested a peak as high as $27 before a possible 85%‚Äì97% retracement. Meanwhile, others caution that despite the recent surge past $3, XRP still faces bearish signals such as the MVRV ‚Äúdeath cross,‚Äù which could indicate cooling momentum. While predictions vary, most experts agree: XRP is entering a high-volatility phase, and only those with disciplined strategies will navigate it successfully. Final Thoughts JD‚Äôs call carries weight, not just because of his past accuracy, but because it reflects the cyclical nature of crypto markets. XRP may be poised for a historic rally, but with extreme upside comes equally severe downside risk. For traders, the message is simple: enjoy the rally, but don‚Äôt forget to take profits. Because if JD is right again, the crash that follows could be just as epic as the rise. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

In a statement, the SEC said the guidance seeks to help crypto participants understand whether these arrangements fall under U.S. securities laws. BREAKING from @SECGov : Liquid staking activities and tokens are not considered securities pic.twitter.com/POcFywU6X7 ‚Äî Solana (@solana) August 5, 2025 According to the Division, under specific conditions, liquid staking activities and the associated receipt tokens do not involve the offer or sale of securities and therefore do not require SEC registration. Understanding Liquid Staking and Receipt Tokens In a liquid staking setup, crypto holders deposit their assets with a third-party or protocol-based provider and receive ‚Äústaking receipt tokens‚Äù in return. These tokens serve as proof of ownership for the deposited crypto and any rewards earned through staking. Unlike traditional staking, liquid staking allows users to retain liquidity‚Äîthe receipt tokens can be used in other crypto applications or redeemed later, subject to protocol conditions such as ‚Äúunbonding‚Äù periods. These arrangements can be facilitated either programmatically through self-executing code (protocol-based) or via custodians who manage wallets and interact with staking protocols on behalf of users. In either case, users maintain ownership of their deposited assets throughout the staking process. SEC‚Äôs Position: No Securities Involved in Liquid Staking The SEC‚Äôs Division explains that the actions undertaken in these liquid staking arrangements‚Äîincluding the minting, issuing, and redeeming of staking receipt tokens‚Äîdo not meet the legal definition of a securities offering, as long as the deposited assets themselves are not securities or part of an investment contract. This determination hinges on the absence of entrepreneurial or managerial efforts by the Liquid Staking Provider. Providers are not seen as actively managing the user‚Äôs investment but merely performing administrative or ministerial functions such as staking the assets or selecting node operators. Therefore, the economic benefits to users arise directly from the staking activity itself, not from the provider‚Äôs business efforts‚Äîa key distinction under the Howey Test used to identify investment contracts. Howey Test Analysis and the Role of the Provider The SEC applies the Howey Test to evaluate whether an arrangement constitutes an investment contract. The test looks for three elements: an investment of money, in a common enterprise, with an expectation of profits derived from the efforts of others. In the case of liquid staking, the Division stresses that the provider‚Äôs role is limited to technical facilitation rather than strategic decision-making. Receipt Tokens Are Not Securities The SEC also addressed the nature of staking receipt tokens themselves. While they are receipts that confirm ownership of deposited crypto, they are not receipts for securities unless the underlying assets qualify as such. These tokens do not independently generate rewards; instead, their value reflects the performance of the staked assets. As long as the structure avoids reliance on managerial efforts and adheres to the described protocols, the SEC does not consider these tokens to be part of a securities offering. The agency cautions, however, that any deviation from these parameters‚Äîparticularly where providers play a larger, more entrepreneurial role‚Äîcould change the regulatory outcome. This statement, therefore, offers a framework for compliance but not a blanket exemption. SEC Launches ‚ÄòProject Crypto‚Äô Initiative SEC Chairman Paul Atkins announced the launch of ‚Äú Project Crypto ‚Äù on July 31, a comprehensive initiative designed to modernize securities regulations and allow America‚Äôs financial markets to move on-chain.

Arctic Pablo‚Äôs 1,026% ROI Tempts Investors‚ÄîTop New Meme Coin to Invest in Now as Shiba Inu and Fartcoin Spike",https://timestabloid.com/final-presale-rounds-arctic-pablos-1026-roi-tempts-investors/,"Could missing this meme coin presale mean skipping a life-changing opportunity? With the crypto spotlight swinging back to community-driven tokens, the market is buzzing once again. In this frenzy, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC) is lighting up discussions with a powerful presale surge and head-turning features. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu holds its ground with an impressive 24-hour volume, and Fartcoin‚Äôs price breakout is adding fire to meme coin conversations. But in the middle of these movers, Arctic Pablo Coin is climbing with unmatched momentum‚Äîand the presale is inching toward its final stages. Acting late might mean entering too high. Are you really willing to risk watching another coin 10x without you? This article will cover the developments and updates of all 3 coins: Arctic Pablo Coin, Shiba Inu, and Fartcoin. Battle for the Blockchain Spotlight: Community Challenges Spark Buzz One of the most exciting features of Arctic Pablo Coin is its Community Competitions, where users can earn APC tokens or even USD rewards by participating in engaging tasks. But here‚Äôs what makes it different‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt just some referral system in disguise. It‚Äôs a gamified, reward-based model that drives true community engagement and growth. Think about it: what other project gives real-world value just for showing off your meme skills or sharing a tweet? Whether you‚Äôre a digital artist, trader, or content wizard, these competitions make Arctic Pablo Coin a platform to earn while you engage. Could this be the crypto that finally merges fun with function? Many believe it‚Äôs more than just a token‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement. And as Arctic Pablo shines among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now , early backers are already reaping the rewards. How many projects reward you before launch? That‚Äôs the kind of question APC answers daily. $3.23M Raised and Climbing: Just One More Stage Before Arctic Pablo‚Äôs Price Launches The meme coin presale momentum around Arctic Pablo Coin is electrifying. The project has now hit Stage 35 (Firefrost Flats) with a price of just $0.00071 per APC. Over $3.23 million has been raised‚Äîan unmistakable signal of investor trust and growing excitement. Let‚Äôs run the numbers: Buy 1,760,000 APC for just $1,250. When APC hits the listing price of $0.008, your investment turns into $14,080. That‚Äôs a clean ROI of 1,026.76%‚Äîand it doesn‚Äôt stop there. If analysts‚Äô predictions of a $0.10 valuation hold true, the ROI shoots up to 13,984.50%. Even those who entered in earlier stages have already seen 4,633.33% gains, making it one of the most profitable meme coin presales this year. So ask yourself: Are you buying before the breakout or waiting to chase it at the top? There are only a few stages left. Entry at this point could be the closest thing to catching lightning in a bottle. Arctic Pablo shines among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now‚Äîbut not for long. Shiba Inu Price Action Holds Strong: Market Liquidity Says It All The live Shiba Inu price today stands at $0.000013, accompanied by a staggering 24-hour trading volume of $162,625,397. While price movements remain within tight bands, this massive liquidity points to one thing: strong community interest and whale attention. Shiba Inu may not be launching a new token, but the steady pulse of its ecosystem makes it a resilient force in the meme economy. It‚Äôs the kind of token that‚Äôs not trying to win the race‚Äîbut still keeps finishing among the leaders. With volume this high, could a breakout be on the cards? In the crypto jungle, those who hesitate miss the lion‚Äôs share. As Shiba keeps drawing eyes, don‚Äôt sleep on what this momentum might signal. Time waits for no trader. Blink, and you might miss it. Fartcoin Fires Up: Price Hits $1.03 as Trading Volume Explodes Past $205M Fartcoin is laughing at the blockchain. Currently priced at $1.03, its daily volume has rocketed to $205,402,324, signaling a roaring uptick in market participation. Though the name might raise eyebrows, the numbers demand respect. The Fartcoin community isn‚Äôt just large‚Äîit‚Äôs loyal and loud. A combination of viral marketing and timed announcements is keeping the momentum high, making Fartcoin a standout in meme coin circles. Can it maintain this surge? Possibly. It‚Äôs already proven its resilience through volatile swings. And now, with traders piling in, the question becomes: will you ride the wave or watch it crash into profits without you? Opportunities like these pass by like a gust of wind‚Äîstrong, sudden, and easy to miss. Final Verdict: Arctic Pablo‚Äôs Presale is the Lightning Strike All three coins‚ÄîShiba Inu, Fartcoin, and Arctic Pablo Coin ‚Äîare making waves. Shiba‚Äôs volume remains unshakable, and Fartcoin‚Äôs market presence is undeniable. But Arctic Pablo Coin stands in a class of its own, not just for what it offers now, but for what it promises tomorrow. Its community-powered competitions, ultra-low presale pricing, and jaw-dropping ROI potential have created a perfect storm of investor interest. And with just a few stages left, the time to move is vanishing. The $0.008 listing price is around the corner. Those who wait might enter at the peak, while others will have already locked in life-altering returns. Arctic Pablo shines among the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now, and this presale may be the last golden window. Don‚Äôt just observe‚Äîact before the page turns on this chapter of gains.
