Dogecoin, the meme coin that continues to defy expectations, is aiming for a $1 valuation, fueled by its recent price surge and growing adoption. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is making waves with its innovative approach to decentralized e-commerce, attracting significant interest with its presale, which has now surpassed $970,000 in just four stages. This article explores the contrasting narratives of these two crypto contenders, highlighting their unique strengths and potential for growth in 2025. Dogecoin Price Dynamics: Is a Surge Around the Corner? Dogecoin has been a fascinating phenomenon in the crypto space, defying skeptics and delivering impressive returns for its supporters. Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has gained mainstream recognition, thanks to its vibrant community. Currently trading at around $0.35, Dogecoin has experienced a recent surge in price, fueled by positive market sentiment and increased adoption. Analysts are optimistic about Dogecoin’s potential to reach $1 by the end of 2025, especially if its utility as a payment method continues to grow. Despite its meme-based origins, Dogecoin is increasingly being recognized for its practical applications. Its use for tipping, microtransactions, and even merchandise purchases at Tesla highlights its growing acceptance as a legitimate form of currency. However, it’s important to remember that Dogecoin’s price is heavily influenced by market sentiment and social media trends. This volatility can lead to significant price fluctuations, making it a higher-risk investment compared to more established cryptocurrencies. Web3Bay: A Marketplace Built for Buyers & Sellers, Not Middlemen While Dogecoin captures headlines with its meme-fueled price movements, Web3Bay is quietly building a revolution in the e-commerce space. This blockchain-powered platform is designed to address the limitations of traditional online marketplaces, offering a more secure, transparent, and user-centric experience. Web3Bay’s presale has generated significant interest, raising over $970,000 in just four stages. This strong performance reflects the growing confidence in Web3Bay’s vision and its potential to disrupt the e-commerce industry. At the heart of this ecosystem is the 3BAY token, currently priced at $0.004562625 in stage 4 of the presale. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early investors could see returns exceeding 6,430%. This, combined with the platform’s innovative features and community-driven governance model, makes Web3Bay a compelling investment opportunity. Web3Bay’s roadmap includes exciting developments such as the integration of NFT marketplaces, staking opportunities, and Layer-2 scaling solutions for faster and cheaper transactions. The platform also plans to transition into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), giving users a direct say in its future development. Dogecoin vs. Web3Bay: A Tale of Two Cryptos Dogecoin and Web3Bay represent two distinct approaches to cryptocurrency. Dogecoin thrives on community enthusiasm and market sentiment, while Web3Bay focuses on solving real-world problems and delivering tangible value to its users. Dogecoin’s price is heavily influenced by external factors, such as social media trends and endorsements from influential figures. This makes it a volatile asset, with the potential for both significant gains and losses. Web3Bay, on the other hand, offers a more predictable investment thesis. Its presale success and robust roadmap suggest that it’s well-positioned for sustained growth. As blockchain adoption increases, Web3Bay’s utility-driven model could become a standard for decentralized marketplaces, making it a compelling choice for risk-averse investors. Diversifying Your Crypto Portfolio For those seeking to navigate the crypto market effectively, diversification is key. Including both Dogecoin and Web3Bay in your portfolio can provide a balanced approach, allowing you to capitalize on Dogecoin’s potential for rapid growth while also benefiting from Web3Bay’s long-term potential and stability. By diversifying your holdings, you can mitigate risk and position yourself to benefit from the diverse opportunities that the crypto market offers. Whether you’re seeking short-term gains or long-term growth, a balanced portfolio can help you achieve your investment goals. The Crypto Landscape in 2025 The crypto market is constantly evolving, and projects like Dogecoin and Web3Bay are at the forefront of this exciting landscape. Dogecoin’s ability to capture the imagination of the masses and Web3Bay’s potential to revolutionize e-commerce demonstrate the diverse applications of blockchain technology. As we look ahead to the rest of 2025, both Dogecoin and Web3Bay offer compelling reasons for investors to take notice. Whether you’re drawn to the meme-fueled excitement of Dogecoin or the practical utility of Web3Bay, these two projects represent the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the crypto world.

Analyst Weighs In,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-prolonged-consolidation-what-is-really-going-on-analyst-weighs-in/,"Ethereum performance has lagged behind the broader cryptocurrency market in recent months, with the asset failing to capitalize on the bullish momentum recently seen in the market. While Bitcoin has repeatedly reached new all-time highs, Ethereum has struggled to break past $4,000 and remains well below its 2021 peak of $4,800. Amid this slow recovery, a crypto analyst known as ProjectW has shared insights on the potential for Ethereum’s resurgence, urging investors to consider the long-term picture. In a detailed post on X, ProjectW outlined several factors that could drive Ethereum’s next breakout. The analyst highlighted Ethereum’s years of accumulation within a broad trading range, suggesting that such prolonged consolidation often precedes significant price expansions. Despite the negative sentiment around Ethereum and narratives favoring other networks like Solana, ProjectW emphasized that Ethereum’s long-term upward trend remains intact. A possible retest of the sub-$ 3,000 range could serve as a catalyst, providing the liquidity needed to push Ethereum past $4,000 and set the stage for a broader recovery. Related Reading: Ethereum Foundation Sells Another 100 ETH, But There’s Still ‘Hopium’ For Holders ETH/BTC Performance And Outlook A key point in ProjectW’s analysis is Ethereum’s ongoing underperformance against Bitcoin. So far, Ethereum has struggled to match Bitcoin’s gains during market rallies and has often faced steeper declines during market corrections. This trend is reflected in the ETH/BTC trading pair, which remains in a bearish structure on higher timeframes. However, the analyst identified a potential reversal zone around $2,700 for Ethereum, which could coincide with a structural shift if ETH/BTC stabilizes at these levels. THE BIG COMEBACK OF ETHEREUM: An Unbiased Evaluation “Ethereum is dead. Solana stole the show.” You’ve probably heard this take a hundred times. The sentiment around ETH has never been worse. And yet – if we strip away emotions and narratives – Ethereum’s long-term… pic.twitter.com/ipkXvuXbnj — ProjectW (@fitforcrypto_) January 29, 2025 The analyst also touched on the role of market makers and institutional players in shaping Ethereum’s price trajectory. According to ProjectW, recent negative coverage of Ethereum—ranging from concerns about the Ethereum Foundation to repeated comparisons with Bitcoin—may not be coincidental. Instead, it could represent a deliberate effort by major market participants to accumulate Ethereum at lower prices, a pattern observed in past market cycles. The involvement of institutional players, such as Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial reportedly acquiring significant amounts of Ethereum, adds another layer of complexity to the current market dynamics. The analyst wrote: We know how this game works. MMs move price where they want – especially to areas with high liquidity. And how do they do it? Media narratives. Recently, we’ve seen an aggressive push of ETH FUD in major publications. – The Ethereum Foundation being questioned – ETH’s underperformance against BTC being highlighted everywhere Is this really a coincidence? Or is it the same old SM playbook? Flood the market with FUD → Retail panic sells at the bottom → Institutions accumulate. Ethereum’s Core Strengths and Future Outlook Despite recent underperformance, the analyst argued that Ethereum’s core fundamentals remain strong. ProjectW wrote: Despite all the noise, Ethereum remains the most important smart contract network. – The deepest liquidity in DeFi – The highest security & decentralization – It has the strongest developer ecosystem While sentiment is at rock bottom, the actual fundamentals suggest ETH is still the backbone of the space. So where does this leave us? Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forms Flag And Pole Pattern For Possible Breakout, New Targets Emerge While no rally is guaranteed, ProjectW suggested that Ethereum’s long-term conditions are aligning for potential growth. The analyst concluded with a call to closely monitor Ethereum’s progress in the coming weeks, as market participants await signs of a sustained upward trend.

The proposal, which will be presented on January 30, could see the central bank allocate up to 5% of its €140 billion ($146 billion) reserves into Bitcoin, amounting to a potential investment of approximately €7 billion. If approved, the Czech National Bank would become the first European central bank to hold Bitcoin as part of its reserve assets. Michl stated that Bitcoin has zero correlation to bonds and is an interesting asset for a large portfolio. However, he noted that while Bitcoin is under consideration, there is no imminent decision.

Here’s Why Crypto Whales Are Betting On WLTQ For 60,000% Gains Over XRP",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/is-wallitiq-wltq-the-next-dogecoin-heres-why-crypto-whales-are-betting-on-wltq-for-60000-gains-over-xrp/,"While Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a crowd favorite and Ripple (XRP) continues to garner attention for its resilience in legal battles, a new kid on the blockchain has captured the imagination of crypto whales: WallitIQ (WLTQ) . With predictions of a staggering 60,000% price spike, the WLTQ presale is being hailed by crypto whales as the opportunity of a lifetime. WallitIQ (WLTQ): Takes Heavy Bets To Lead Bull Market The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform enters the crypto space with a comprehensive solution for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi). The platform maximizes cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology to address some of the most pressing issues in crypto asset management. A standout feature is the Escrow Connect system , which combines biometric and facial recognition authentication to safeguard transactions and protect assets. For crypto whales and everyday investors alike, this security-first approach is a game-changer. At the heart of WallitIQ’s ecosystem is its WLTQ token, a utility-packed altcoin designed to generate incredible returns. One of its most attractive features is its staking rewards program, which offers up to 180% APY, making it one of the most profitable opportunities in DeFi. With crypto whales forecasting a 60,000% price surge, the token’s potential is undeniable. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also introduces AI-driven predictive analytics and real-time market notifications through Push Protocol technology, helping users deal with the volatile crypto market with confidence. Its MVP crypto wallet app is another standout feature, offering live market data, real-time sentiment analysis, and advanced security measures like biometric authentication. For frequent travelers, users in restrictive financial environments, or anyone seeking secure, borderless asset management , WallitIQ (WLTQ) with its CoinMarketCap listing and a SolidProof smart contract audit , stands out as the better option over tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) The WLTQ presale is a golden ticket for investors aiming to secure life-changing returns. Priced at just $0.0420 , early adopters have the chance to lock in massive gains before the token skyrockets. Imagine investing $1,000 today—at a 60,000% increase, that would yield $600,000. A $10,000 investment would turn into $6 million, while $100,000 could grow to a staggering $60 million. This is the kind of wealth-generating potential that crypto whales are racing to capitalize on, and you can too. Now is the time to act. WallitIQ‘s (WLTQ) AI-driven trading strategy and unique utility are primed to catalyze a price explosion once the presale ends, setting the stage for altcoin season. Don’t miss this once-in-a-lifetime chance to transform your financial future. Dogecoin (DOGE): A Favorite with Limited Upside Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin with a loyal community, has a special place in the crypto market, However, Dogecoin’s (DOGE) lack of tangible utility limits its long-term growth potential. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) value largely depends on market sentiment and social media buzz. Although Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a key player in past bull markets, analysts believe Dogecoin (DOGE) may struggle to maintain its momentum as more innovative altcoins like WallitIQ (WLTQ) enter the scene. XRP: A Resilient Contender with Lingering Uncertainty Ripple (XRP) has proven its resilience despite ongoing legal challenges with the SEC. Ripple’s (XRP) technology allows fast and cost-effective cross-border transactions, making it a popular choice among financial institutions. However, the uncertainty surrounding Ripple’s (XRP) legal status has kept many investors on edge. While Ripple (XRP) remains a viable altcoin, crypto whales agree that Ripple’s (XRP) potential upside pales in comparison to the explosive 60,000% growth projected for WLTQ. Conclusion: WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is the Clear Choice for 60,000% Gains In a market crowded with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP), WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out for crypto whales as a revolutionary project poised to lead the next bull market. Its AI-powered security features , unparalleled staking rewards, and innovative ecosystem make it a must-have for any investor. The presale, priced at an accessible $0.0420, is your gateway to life-changing returns. With crypto whales predicting a 60,000% price surge, now is the time to join in the act. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by; invest in WallitIQ (WLTQ) today and position yourself for massive gains by 2025.

In a new press release , TMTG – the firm behind social media platform Truth Social and the video streaming service Truth+ – says it’s collaborating with Charles Schwab to launch Truth.Fi, a fintech firm with crypto services. As a means of diversifying the firm’s reserves, TMTG’s board has approved an investment of $250 million to be custodied by Charles Schwab, which could go toward investment vehicles, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), separately managed accounts (SMAs), as well as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital assets, according to the press release. As stated by TMGT chief executive and chairman David Nunez, “Truth.Fi is a natural expansion of the Truth Social movement. We began by creating a free-speech social media platform, added an ultra-fast TV streaming service, and now we’re moving into investment products and decentralized finance. Developing American First investment vehicles is another step toward our goal of creating a robust ecosystem through which American patriots can protect themselves from the ever-present threat of cancellation, censorship, debanking, and privacy violations committed by big tech…” Last year, Trump announced the launch of his own DeFi network – World Liberty Financial (WLFI) – as a means of helping those who have been disenfranchised by banks. Last week, it was found that WLFI has become a top 0.1% holder of staked Ethereum ( stETH ) as the firm is staking $33 million worth of the leading altcoin.

According to AP, this is the first-of-its-kind international report, released on Wednesday ahead of the AI summit in Paris in February, cataloging the dangers posed by the fast-growing technology. Countries back the International Scientific Report The report details some of the dangers that could arise as a result of advanced AI and these include enabling terrorism and widespread job losses. This has already been experienced especially within the tech where thousands of jobs have been cut off as the companies automate, thanks to AI. According to AP , the report has the support of 30 countries including the US and China, a rare instance that the two biggest economies in the world are in cooperation. The two have been at each other’s throat as they fight for supremacy in AI. This week, Chinese startup DeepSeek stunned the world with its budget chatbot, although the US imposed stringent export controls on China. Prominent AI scientist Yoshua Bengio led the study, which is a fusion of already existing studies meant to guide authorities on drawing up guardrails for the fast-growing tech. “The stakes are high,” says the report, noting that a few years ago AI systems could barely produce a coherent paragraph. However, with recent development the AI can now generate realistic images, computer programming as well as hold extended conversations with users. According to the researchers, the dangers of advanced AI are already slowly being witnessed such as misinformation and disinformation, deepfakes, scams, and biases. “We need to better understand the systems we’re building and the risks that come with them so that we can take these better decisions in the future.” Bengio. This comes “as general-purpose AI becomes more capable, evidence of additional risks is gradually emerging,” according to the report. This also comes during the same week that the Vatican has warned against the technology together with group behind Doomsday Clock . The report focuses on general purpose AI, which is typified by models such as ChatGPT by OpenAI. The report categorized the advanced AI risks The International Scientific Report groups the risks into three, that is malicious use, malfunctions, and widespread “systemic” risks. The researchers looked at how easy it is for AI to learn to use chemical or biological weapons posing huge risks to humans. Additionally, the report notes that general purpose AI can also transform the job market, displacing some employees, although other researchers agree that AI could create more employment than it takes it away. The report also expressed fears over AI systems running out of control for two possible reasons, the first being either because they undermine human oversight or humans pay less attention. Bengio revealed that the 100 experts who came together for the report did not always agree on what to expect from AI in the future. One of the disagreement was on when AI would surpass human capabilities on different tasks. “They disagree also about the scenarios,” said Bengio. “Of course, nobody has a crystal ball. Some scenarios are very beneficial. Some are terrifying. I think it’s really important for policymakers and the public to take stock of that uncertainty.” Bengio. The report, which several countries have backed, also has the support of the European Union. It comes as world leaders, tech leaders and experts as well as civil society are expected to gather again at the Paris AI Action Summit. The countries will sign a “common declaration” on AI development.

Qubetics is revolutionizing blockchain interoperability, VeChain is solidifying its position as a leader in supply chain solutions, and Hedera faces uncertainty as bearish predictions loom. These developments put them in the spotlight as some of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025, offering investors varying levels of risk and reward. Qubetics: Driving Blockchain Interoperability with a Game-Changing Vision In today’s fragmented blockchain ecosystem, most networks operate in isolation, limiting seamless data exchange and cross-chain transactions. This lack of interoperability restricts decentralized applications from reaching their full potential, creating roadblocks for blockchain adoption. Qubetics aims to resolve this issue by becoming a Web3-aggregated chain , bridging multiple networks into a unified framework. By enabling seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and cross-chain functionality, Qubetics is set to revolutionize how developers, enterprises, and users interact with blockchain technology. Investor enthusiasm for Qubetics remains at an all-time high, with the project reaching its 19th presale phase. The $TICS token is currently priced at $0.0606, pushing total presale funds to an impressive $11.3 million. Over 17,100 holders have collectively acquired 450 million tokens, further reinforcing confidence in Qubetics’ long-term potential. Looking ahead, $TICS is projected to hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a remarkable 312.18% ROI for early investors. Crypto analysts anticipate a major price surge post-mainnet, with forecasts ranging between $10 and $15 per token. With this trajectory, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025, offering both strong fundamentals and explosive growth potential. VeChain: Poised for a Breakout as Supply Chain Adoption Grows VeChain has emerged as one of the most promising blockchain projects in supply chain management, offering businesses an efficient and transparent way to track goods and streamline operations. As companies seek reliable solutions to enhance logistics, VeChain’s blockchain technology is becoming an essential part of real-world applications. Currently priced at $0.048, VeChain has seen an 80% increase in the past six months, showcasing strong momentum. It is approaching a key resistance level of $0.0717, signaling a potential breakout. Experts predict that if this trend continues, VeChain could surpass $0.095 by the end of the year, making it a strong contender for further gains. What sets VeChain apart is its real-world utility, which goes beyond speculation. Major corporations have already integrated VeChain’s blockchain into their supply chains, further strengthening its market position. With growing adoption and a bullish price outlook, VeChain is among the best cryptos to buy for January 2025, particularly for investors seeking projects with tangible use cases. Hedera: Facing Bearish Sentiment Amid Market Uncertainty Hedera (HBAR), known for its high-speed, low-cost, and scalable blockchain alternative, has been a strong competitor in crypto. However, the latest February 2025 forecast suggests a potential 20% decline in Hedera’s value as market conditions become increasingly challenging. The bearish outlook is driven by increased competition from newer blockchain projects and concerns over Hedera’s ability to attract developers and investors. With the crypto market becoming more selective, projects with strong use cases and scalability are gaining favor, while others may struggle to maintain relevance. Although Hedera still boasts impressive technology, investors are closely watching whether the project can overcome this downturn and regain its bullish momentum. HBAR could present an opportunity at lower entry prices for risk-tolerant investors, but caution is warranted given the current predictions. Conclusion: Which Crypto Should You Buy in January 2025? As the crypto market continues to evolve, Qubetics, VeChain, and Hedera present diverse opportunities for investors. Qubetics is breaking new ground in blockchain interoperability, making it a top contender for massive gains. VeChain’s strong supply chain use cases and bullish price trends position it as a solid investment with real-world adoption. Meanwhile, Hedera’s uncertain price outlook raises questions about its future performance, requiring a cautious approach. For investors looking for the best cryptos to buy for January 2025 , Qubetics and VeChain stand out as strong candidates with clear growth potential. Hedera remains a watchlist asset for those willing to navigate market uncertainty.

However, the company appears to be safe from a Habeas Corpus lawsuit. The case raised “ethical” concerns at the nation’s supreme court. Is Worldcoin ‘Flouting’ Brazil Ban? G1 , the digital arm of the O Globo newspaper, has reported that Tools for Humanity appears not to be heeding a ruling from Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority (ANPD). https://t.co/l8Qj5lR5h2 — Alexandre Pimenta (@alexandrepim) January 28, 2025 The ANPD ruling forbids Tools for Humanity from offering people crypto or financial incentives in exchange for their biometric data on Brazilian territory.

BITCOIN, XRP, and OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM Are in the Spotlight!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/turn-1000-into-a-fortune-bitcoin-xrp-and-officialmagacoin-com-are-in-the-spotlight/,"THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN: The Standout Crypto of 2025 Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) have long been regarded as market leaders, but THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven itself to be a dominant force in the crypto landscape. With its record-breaking presale raising $1 million in minutes, it has captured the attention of both experienced and new investors. Analysts agree: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has firmly established itself as a standout token, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) in their early days. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Outshines Its Rivals Ethereum (ETH): As a leader in DeFi, ETH remains strong but lacks the explosive appeal of this newly dominant token. Polygon (MATIC): While MATIC focuses on scaling Ethereum, it hasn’t achieved the same market enthusiasm or record-breaking performance. TRON (TRX): Known for its content-sharing applications, TRX’s growth has been steady but cannot compare to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s transformative impact. Arbitrum (ARB): Though a promising Layer-2 solution, ARB doesn’t command the same attention or investor trust. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Ahead of the Pack 1. Unmatched Presale Success Few cryptocurrencies can claim the level of demand seen by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . The presale’s $1 million milestone within minutes is a testament to its strong market position and widespread investor confidence. 2. Scarcity Drives Demand With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures sustained demand through its deflationary model. Unlike ETH or MATIC, which face high token circulation, this scarcity gives investors a tangible advantage. 3. Exclusive Market Access Available only at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , this token’s exclusivity gives early adopters an edge that other widely available cryptos like TRX and ARB can’t replicate. This controlled distribution solidifies its reputation as the go-to investment for those seeking proven opportunities. Are You In? THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven itself as the standout crypto of 2025, setting a new benchmark in the market with its record-breaking presale. Its limited supply, exclusivity, and overwhelming demand position it as the go-to choice for investors.

The firm led a $16 million funding round for Sign, a blockchain startup focused on improving token distribution and on-chain credential verification. The company now represents the family office of Zhao and Binance co-founder Yi He. This shift marks a major change, with Zhao now taking a more active role in crypto investments. The branded firm is moving away from its previous focus on the exchange’s capital ventures, setting its sights on foundational blockchain infrastructure. YZi Lab’s $16 Million Investment into Sign YZi Labs made its debut investment with a $16 million funding round into Sign. This startup aims to simplify the token distribution process while verifying credentials on-chain. Its goal is to provide a more trustworthy infrastructure as more people shift their activities to blockchain. In a recent statement, Zhao emphasized the importance of proper distribution and verification to build trust. As blockchain adoption grows, such infrastructure becomes increasingly vital for the industry’s success. Remarkably, Sign has seen rapid growth, with revenue surging from $1.7 million in 2023 to $15 million in 2024. This achievement came after its integration with the TON blockchain. The platform aims to use its new funding to expand globally and assist governments in embracing blockchain technology. A Fresh Start for YZi Labs Zhao was released in September after serving four months for violating the Bank Secrecy Act. As part of his guilty plea, he resigned as Binance CEO and paid a whopping $50 million fine. However, this has not slowed his ambitions. With the rebranding from Binance Labs to YZi Labs, the focus has shifted to investments led by Zhao and Yi He, with the firm now serving as their family office. This move aligns with Zhao’s vision of taking a hands-on approach to shaping the future of blockchain and cryptocurrency. He is focusing more directly on ventures that interest him and his co-founder. This new direction signals that YZi Labs will likely be more selective in its investment choices. The firm plans to shape the blockchain space beyond Binance. CZ’s Legal Woes Continues Even though Zhao has regained his freedom, his legal troubles, including Binanceare, are not over. In a fresh lawsuit, investors have accused the exchange of selling unregistered tokens that later lost value. The exchange initially filed to appeal these allegations. However, the U.S. Supreme Court regulators refused to hear the exchange and its founder’s plea. Because the appeal was rejected, the case will continue in lower courts. The lawsuit argues that U.S. laws apply to Binance since American investors used its platform. Even though Binance claims it operates outside the U.S., courts ruled that its activities fall under U.S. jurisdiction.

With Dogecoin on the verge of an ETF and Popcat securing a major foothold in the Solana ecosystem, it’s clear that meme coins are transforming into serious assets. Even ANDY, an Ethereum-based meme token, is making headlines with its growing market cap and community traction. Among these rising stars, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is crafting an entirely new genre of meme coins. Instead of following traditional presale stages, it takes investors on an extraordinary journey across mythical and hidden locations, creating a sense of adventure and urgency. The blend of mystery, storytelling, and financial opportunity makes Arctic Pablo one of the most exciting meme coins to watch. Let’s dive deep into the top meme coins to join for long term, analyzing their unique selling points, potential returns, and the frenzy they’re stirring up in the crypto world. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Adventurer’s Treasure with Insane ROI Arctic Pablo is on a quest unlike any other in the frozen landscapes of the unknown. He’s not just collecting relics; he’s uncovering the secrets of hidden wealth and mystical lands. His journey has now reached Glacier Grove, the 7th location, where early investors are reaping the benefits of their trust in his expedition. So far, over $600,000 has been raised, and the presale price stands at $0.000043. But here’s the kicker: by the time Arctic Pablo reaches his destination, the launch price is set at $0.008, meaning an astonishing 18,546% ROI potential for early backers. For those wondering what that means in real numbers, investing just $100 at the current presale price would yield 2,325,567 APC tokens. At launch, this investment balloons to $18,604.54. That’s not just an investment; that’s a ticket to life-changing gains. But Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about price speculation. The project introduces an ecosystem built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring low transaction fees and secure, scalable operations. A weekly token burn mechanism further increases scarcity, permanently eliminating unsold tokens. All burn transactions are fully recorded on BSC for transparency. Staking enthusiasts aren’t left out either. With a massive 66% APY staking program, holders can lock in their tokens for two months post-launch and watch their investment grow. This staking model ensures long-term sustainability while rewarding the most loyal adventurers in Pablo’s journey. If there’s one meme coin making waves in both storytelling and financial growth, it’s Arctic Pablo Coin. With no ordinary presale stages, each location discovery adds a layer of exclusivity and urgency. Don’t miss out on the adventure—Arctic Pablo is rewriting meme coin history. It is one of the top meme coins to join for long term . Popcat ($POPCAT): The Solana Powerhouse Taking Over the Internet The internet thrives on viral trends, and Popcat has become one of the most iconic internet sensations. Built on the Solana blockchain, Popcat ($POPCAT) is more than just a meme; it’s an ever-growing ecosystem fueled by community engagement and massive trading volumes. Currently trading at $0.378482, Popcat has witnessed incredible traction, boasting a market cap of $370,902,653. Despite a slight 0.96% drop in the last 24 hours, the project continues to dominate meme coin discussions. What makes it special? It rides the wave of Solana’s blazing-fast transactions, ensuring smooth and cheap trades compared to Ethereum-based rivals. Beyond its hilarious origins, Popcat has embraced NFT integration, staking rewards, and decentralized governance, setting it apart from the average meme coin. The meme-based utility ensures organic virality, drawing in new investors daily. ANDY ($ANDY): The Ethereum Meme Coin with Explosive Market Growth Ethereum-based meme coins have always been strong contenders in the crypto space, and ANDY ($ANDY) is rapidly climbing the ranks. Currently priced at $0.000103, ANDY has witnessed a 15.42% drop, but that hasn’t stopped it from amassing a market cap of $103,296,738. Ethereum meme coins historically bounce back stronger, making this dip a potential buying opportunity for those looking for long-term gains. ANDY’s growth can be attributed to its solid tokenomics and rising demand among Ethereum users. With the Ethereum network thriving due to NFT and DeFi adoption, meme coins like ANDY are reaping the benefits of increased blockchain activity. Community involvement has also played a major role in ANDY’s success. From social media hype to community-driven marketing efforts, the token continues to attract new investors looking for the next big meme coin explosion. If Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have proven anything, Ethereum meme coins hold their ground against even the biggest market swings. With its growing adoption and Ethereum’s scalability upgrades, ANDY is well-positioned for long-term price appreciation. Experts suggest that a rally toward $0.0003 or beyond is possible, especially as more investors look for Ethereum-based meme coins with real growth potential. Final Thoughts: The Best Meme Coins to Hold for Long-Term Gains Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, Popcat, and ANDY are among the top meme coins to join for long term. Each brings a unique blend of viral appeal, community engagement, and real investment opportunities.

But as CZ looks ahead, regulators in France are looking back. Table of Contents From Binance to YZi Labs Binance’s never-ending troubles YZi Labs’ expanding investment portfolio What’s CZ up to? From Binance to YZi Labs Changpeng Zhao , more commonly known as “CZ,” once the most influential figure in crypto, is back — but this time, in a different role. After stepping down as Binance ’s CEO in 2023 and serving a four-month prison sentence in the U.S. for compliance failures, CZ has returned with YZi Labs — a rebranded version of Binance Labs that is expanding its focus beyond the crypto world. Unlike its predecessor, which primarily nurtured blockchain startups, YZi Labs is broadening its scope , venturing into artificial intelligence and biotechnology. The initiative will be led by Ella Zhang, a familiar face from Binance Labs’ early days, and will reintroduce a 12-week, in-person residency program for startup founders. CZ will also be involved, offering mentorship to the next generation of entrepreneurs. YZi Labs has already made its first major investment, leading a $16 million funding round for Sign, a platform aiming to improve on-chain credential verification and token distribution. The sign has developed TokenTable, a tool designed to address common issues with airdrops, such as token supply mismanagement and fraudulent claims from fake accounts. CZ has signalled that blockchain infrastructure and trust mechanisms remain core to his vision, stating in a Fortune report , “Proper distribution builds trust, and verification is an essential part of it.” But while CZ is looking ahead, Binance is still tied up in regulatory battles. French authorities have launched a new probe into alleged fraud and money laundering, adding to the exchange’s history of legal troubles. CZ may have stepped away from Binance, but will regulators and the industry let him move on that easily? And as Binance fights for its future, how far will its past pull CZ back in? Let’s try to decode. Binance’s never-ending troubles On Jan. 28, French authorities escalated their investigation into Binance, launching a judicial probe into alleged money laundering, tax fraud, and the provision of unauthorized digital asset services, Reuters reported . The Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office confirmed that the investigation covers Binance’s activities between 2019 and 2024, with a particular focus on money laundering linked to drug trafficking. This marks a key development in a case that began as a preliminary investigation in June 2023, prompted by complaints from users who claimed to have lost money due to misleading information provided by the platform. The allegations now also extend to Binance’s operations in France and across the European Union, where the company is accused of operating without proper regulatory approvals. In response, Binance has denied the allegations, describing them as “several years old.” The company has stated, “Binance fully denies the allegations and will vigorously fight any charges made against it.” Binance further clarified that it has since strengthened its compliance measures, aligning with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer standards, and enhanced employee training programs. This investigation is the latest in a series of legal and regulatory challenges for Binance amid growing scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges following the collapse of FTX in 2022. In 2023, U.S. authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, took legal action against major platforms like Binance and Coinbase, alleging violations of securities laws and other regulatory failures. While Coinbase pushed back against the SEC’s claims, Binance settled with the DOJ in November 2023, agreeing to pay a historic $4.3 billion — marking the largest corporate compliance penalty ever imposed. U.S. prosecutors accused Binance of operating with a “Wild West” approach, allegedly facilitating illicit activities and failing to report over 100,000 suspicious transactions tied to terrorist organizations and other criminal groups. As part of the settlement, CZ stepped down as CEO, with Richard Teng appointed as his replacement. However, the legal troubles did not end there. Binance also faced regulatory action in other regions, including in December 2024, when Australia’s financial regulator sued the company’s local derivatives business, alleging misclassification of retail clients as wholesale investors — thereby denying them essential consumer protections. YZi Labs’ expanding investment portfolio As Binance grapples with mounting legal challenges, CZ is pushing forward with YZi Labs, backing projects that signal a clear break from his past role as an exchange operator. In 2024, YZi Labs (previously Binance Labs) actively expanded its investment portfolio, focusing on emerging technologies. Throughout the year, the firm invested in 46 projects across various sectors, including decentralized finance, AI, gaming, and DeSci. In August 2024, YZi Labs announced investments in two AI-focused companies to support the development of AI-powered decentralized applications. One of these was Sahara AI, a startup that integrates blockchain and AI technologies. Sahara AI enables users to maintain intellectual property rights through on-chain attribution and earn rewards for contributing to the decentralized AI’s infrastructure, knowledge base, and maintenance. The company secured $43 million in a Series A funding round led by Pantera Capital, YZi Labs, and Polychain Capital, with participation from Samsung NEXT and others. Another notable investment was in MyShell, an AI startup that allows users to build and share AI-powered applications, empowering developers to create customizable AI solutions. In November 2024, YZi Labs also ventured into the decentralized science sector by investing in BIO Protocol, an accelerator program focused on capital formation for biotechnologies. BIO Protocol supports a collection of decentralized autonomous organizations committed to developing pharmaceutical drugs and life-saving treatments. But while YZi Labs is expanding in new directions, CZ’s past is never far behind. His financial backing and continued presence in blockchain-related ventures keep him connected to an industry still dealing with the fallout of Binance’s legal troubles. What’s CZ up to? CZ began shaping his next steps even before serving his four-month U.S. prison sentence in March 2024. Just days before reporting in, he tweeted, “Launching a new project. No, no new tokens. Education project. More details soon…” Launching a new project. No, no new tokens. Education project. More details soon… — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) March 18, 2024 The following day, he unveiled Giggle Academy, describing it as a free, gamified, and adaptive learning platform for students in grades 1–12. “No revenue. Gamified. Adaptive,” he wrote, sharing a link to the project’s concept paper and announcing he was hiring a small team to work directly with him. My next project. @GiggleAcademy (No logo yet) Free basic (grade 1-12 ish) education, for all. No revenue. Gamified. Adaptive. Read the Concept Paper at https://t.co/knqmZF0sQ8 We are HIRING. Small team, work directly with CZ. — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) March 19, 2024 In September 2024, after completing his sentence, Zhao returned to social media with a personal update. “gm, the food tastes so good… And what a luxury to be able to have more than one piece of fruit per day!” he shared, offering a throbbing glimpse into his time in prison. gm, the food taste so good… And what a luxury to be able to have more than one piece of fruit per day! I know some of you may have a lot of questions. I won't have all the answers. Let me chill for a bit. Then figure out the next steps. There are always more opportunities in… https://t.co/9hvgp8Bo97 — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) September 29, 2024 In the same post, he outlined his next priorities: “Giggle Academy is going well and will be a big part of my life for the next few years. I will continue to invest in blockchain/decentralized technologies, AI, and biotech. I am a long-term investor who cares about impact, not returns.” The following month, in October 2024, Zhao made his first public appearance at Binance Blockchain Week, where he was greeted with a packed room and a standing ovation. Moderator Austin Arnold opened with, “First question, how was your summer?” Zhao responded candidly, “It’s not good. It’s less fun than now. I think the whole experience is just very limiting in a lot of ways, right? Your freedom is taken away and you have nothing to do, so it gives you a lot of time to reflect.” While he avoided directly criticizing his case, he noted that he was “the first person to go to prison over a Bank Secrecy Act violation,” contrasting his situation with that of large financial institutions where executives faced settlements but not jail time. More importantly, CZ confirmed that he has no plans to run another crypto exchange. In December 2024, CZ announced the launch of the Giggle Academy iOS app, inviting parents with young children aged 2–6 to test it out, further expanding the project’s reach. The @GiggleAcademy iOS app is live now. Test it out if you have young kids in the 2-6 age range. https://t.co/kZRb0DDTP0 https://t.co/ho7NXcavuG — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 18, 2024 Meanwhile, talking about the rise of meme coins, including Donald Trump’s recent launch of his own meme coin Official Trump ( TRUMP ), CZ jokingly tweeted, “No, I currently have no plan to make a meme coin. But I am guessing a few other country leaders might be thinking about it.” No, I currently have no plan to make a meme coin.

Trump Buys SUI (TRUMPSUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys SUI launched with over $29,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Buys SUI by entering its contract address (CA) – 7chY3Yw9cArR4CGQQ2N6mciszZvWB3rW6WoBNTfwyitu – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|SUI|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-29 23:49:00

Each project is based on distinct concepts—Dogecoin continues as the ever-resilient meme coin, while Web3Bay serves as a practical innovator in decentralized e-commerce. These projects exemplify the range of possibilities within the crypto universe. This article delves into the 2025 Dogecoin price prediction and examines how Web3Bay might redefine the use of utility tokens by investors. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Harnessing Meme Popularity Dogecoin continues to impress in the cryptocurrency sphere, surpassing expectations since its start as a humorous venture. Endorsed by celebrities like Elon Musk, Dogecoin has gained significant traction. As of January 2025, its trading price is around $0.35. With the recent inauguration of Donald Trump and his new department initiative, sentiment around Dogecoin has grown positive. Experts are optimistic about Dogecoin’s short-term growth, backed by technical strengths and significant acquisitions by large holders, who have recently bought over 100 million Dogecoin tokens. This reflects a strong belief in its market stability, with some foreseeing a surge to $0.50 soon. In the long term, it might even surpass the $1 mark by year-end, especially if it continues to expand as a payment method. Though Dogecoin started as a meme, its real-world payment utility is increasingly acknowledged. For instance, Tesla now accepts Dogecoin for merchandise purchases, and its use in online donations is growing. However, potential investors should be wary of its price volatility and market mood swings. Web3Bay: Pioneering Decentralized E-Commerce While Dogecoin makes news with its community-driven value surges, Web3Bay introduces a different opportunity—focusing on practicality and foresight. Web3Bay is a blockchain-based e-commerce platform that eliminates traditional market inefficiencies. Unlike Dogecoin, which thrives on community excitement, Web3Bay addresses real issues like high fees, data security, and regional barriers. Currently, in its fourth presale stage, Web3Bay’s token, $3BAY, is priced at $0.004562625, with over $960,000 raised, selling more than 255 million tokens. Early investors could see a return of 6,430% when the token price will be $0.1959, indicating strong market confidence in Web3Bay’s approach. Web3Bay aims to transform e-commerce through NFT markets, staking opportunities, and Layer-2 solutions for efficient transactions. Its future as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) will allow token holders to direct its growth, positioning Web3Bay as a significant player in the digital transaction realm. Web3Bay vs. Dogecoin: Which Crypto Offers Better Long-Term Value? Comparing Dogecoin with Web3Bay is akin to contrasting two entirely different fruits; both have distinct strengths that appeal to varying investor preferences. Dogecoin suits those who thrive on high-risk, high-reward opportunities fueled by community support and market buzz. Conversely, Web3Bay attracts those prioritizing functionality and enduring growth. The 2025 Dogecoin price outlook is optimistic, with experts predicting that its unique charm and robust community backing will propel it to greater heights. Nonetheless, its dependency on factors like celebrity shout-outs and general market moods adds an element of unpredictability. For instance, a single tweet from Elon Musk might boost Dogecoin’s value, whereas a slowdown in regular updates could hinder its progress. Web3Bay presents a more stable investment rationale. Its successful presale and comprehensive strategy indicate that $3BAY is poised for long-term success. The anticipated 6,430% ROI reflects the genuine potential for capturing a significant portion of the e-commerce sector . As more people embrace blockchain, Web3Bay’s pragmatic approach could set a new standard for decentralized marketplaces, appealing especially to those cautious of risk. Dogecoin Price Prediction & How Web3Bay Helps Diversify Portfolios A crucial lesson for investors in 2025 is the significance of diversification. While prospects for Dogecoin look promising, solely depending on a meme coin carries risks. Integrating utility tokens like Web3Bay into an investment portfolio mitigates these risks and introduces exposure to ventures with real-world applications. Imagine a scenario where Dogecoin climbs to $1, offering swift financial benefits. Simultaneously, Web3Bay might rise as a key figure in decentralized e-commerce, providing both capital appreciation and staking benefits for the long haul. This two-pronged strategy allows investors to leverage Dogecoin’s market fluctuations while benefiting from Web3Bay’s consistent expansion. Wrapping Up! Looking towards 2025, both Dogecoin and Web3Bay offer enticing prospects for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Dogecoin’s potential for significant rallies, driven by community engagement and sentiment, presents an exciting choice for those who can handle swings in the market. Meanwhile, Web3Bay, with its focus on practicality and innovation, stands as a reliable investment promising considerable growth potential. Dogecoin’s forecast for the year is bullish, potentially surpassing the $1 mark. However, its reliance on external influences means it might also experience sharp declines. On the other hand, Web3Bay, backed by a solid plan and presale achievements, promises a different kind of future—one dedicated to addressing real challenges and generating value for its stakeholders. In conclusion, Dogecoin and Web3Bay exemplify the two facets of the cryptocurrency spectrum—hype versus utility, fleeting gains versus sustainable development. For astute investors, the optimal approach might involve incorporating both into their portfolios, balancing risks against possible rewards. Whether you’re an experienced trader or just starting, keeping an eye on these two projects in the coming year is advisable.

XRP news highlights its recent regulatory milestones, with Ripple securing key licenses that could expand adoption, while Ethereum (ETH) price action shows promise, rebounding from challenges with a 3.89% gain this week. These updates have put both projects in the spotlight, attracting interest from traders and crypto enthusiasts alike. However, a less conventional yet exciting development is unfolding with BlockDAG . Partnering with the iconic football club Inter Milan, BlockDAG represents a bold step into merging blockchain technology with legacy sports. This collaboration not only signals blockchain’s growing mainstream acceptance but also showcases how innovative startups and established institutions can create new standards for fan engagement and digital transformation. BlockDAG and Inter Milan: Bridging Tradition and Innovation BlockDAG’s partnership with Inter Milan is a significant step in connecting blockchain technology with legacy sports. Inter Milan, one of the most storied clubs in football history, brings global recognition and a passionate fanbase, while BlockDAG offers cutting-edge solutions for secure and scalable digital transactions. This collaboration highlights blockchain’s growing relevance beyond tech-savvy circles, signaling its potential for widespread adoption. Legacy brands like Inter Milan adopting blockchain reinforce the idea that traditional industries are ready to embrace innovation. By integrating blockchain into their fan engagement strategies, the club is setting an example for others in the sports world. Initiatives like fan tokens, digital collectibles, and NFT-based memberships offer fans tangible value while maintaining transparency and security. BlockDAG is also gaining traction through its highly successful presale. Having raised $185 million so far and selling over 18 billion BDAG coins, the presale reflects significant interest in the project. Currently priced at $0.0248 per BDAG, this represents a 2,380% ROI from its starting price, positioning BlockDAG as one of the top trending crypto projects in 2025. This partnership and presale success have the potential to set a precedent for other sports organizations. Clubs worldwide could adopt similar blockchain-driven models for fan interaction and revenue generation. With BlockDAG’s advanced architecture and Inter Milan’s influence, this partnership could become the blueprint for the intersection of sports and technology. XRP News: Ripple’s Latest Wins and Market Movement XRP news recently spotlighted Ripple’s success in securing Money Transmitter Licenses in New York and Texas. These licenses could significantly boost adoption, as Ripple can now legally offer its services in two of the most stringent regulatory markets in the United States. This development positions XRP for wider usage in cross-border payments and digital asset solutions. On the market front, XRP is trading at $3.15, with a recent intraday low of $2.91. The modest upward movement reflects market confidence following regulatory clarity. Additionally, analysts suggest this could be the start of broader acceptance for XRP as Ripple continues to strengthen its foothold in the U.S. financial landscape. The news surrounding these licenses has also reinforced XRP’s status as one of the top trending cryptos to watch in 2025. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action: Market Trends and Recent Updates Ethereum (ETH) price action has caught attention with a 3.89% increase, bringing its value to $3,191.58. The rise comes as Ethereum stabilizes after recent market fluctuations. Analysts suggest this rebound could be linked to renewed interest in Ethereum’s roadmap for improving scalability and security, with Vitalik Buterin hinting at structural changes to the Ethereum Foundation to address growing competition. Another factor influencing Ethereum (ETH) price action is the pressure from alternative platforms like Solana. With Solana gaining developer traction due to lower transaction costs, Ethereum faces challenges maintaining dominance. However, Ethereum’s versatility in supporting DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 solutions continues to provide strong fundamentals. As these updates unfold, Ethereum remains one of the top trending cryptos to watch, reflecting its resilience and potential for sustained growth. Summing Up XRP news highlights key regulatory advancements, with Ripple’s licenses in New York and Texas paving the way for broader adoption. Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) price action shows resilience, with recent gains signaling potential recovery despite mounting competition from other blockchains. Both projects maintain their status as top trending crypto assets to watch this year. Amid these updates, BlockDAG takes a unique path with its collaboration with Inter Milan. This partnership merges a legacy sports brand with cutting-edge blockchain technology, demonstrating how blockchain can enhance fan engagement and digital interactions. BlockDAG’s approach sets a precedent for industries exploring blockchain’s transformative potential.

Investors saw their hopes crash as three of the biggest tech giants struggled on multiple fronts—electric vehicles, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Shares of all three companies saw immediate hits in extended trading. Let’s break down the chaos, who got hurt, and why it’s making headlines everywhere. Tesla warns of higher production costs Tesla missed expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings, reporting 73 cents per share compared to Wall Street’s expected 75 cents, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG. Revenue came in at $25.71 billion, much lower than the anticipated $27.27 billion. The stock took a 3.4% dive in after-hours trading at 4:14 p.m. in New York, proving investor frustration with the electric vehicle giant’s performance. Tesla told investors its goal to build more affordable cars remains on track, with production for new models starting in the first half of 2025. The Cybercab, Tesla’s latest project, is also expected to roll out by 2026. But here’s the thing, Tesla admitted it won’t be cutting production costs as much as previously planned. Instead, the company will rely on a combination of its current production methods and a next-gen platform to ramp up volumes during what it called “uncertain times.” Analysts didn’t love that message. The mix of slower cost reductions and missed revenue left Wall Street skittish. Still, Tesla’s loyal fan base came through, pushing the stock up 2% in later after-hours trading. Meta struggles to meet growth expectations Meta Platforms, the company behind Facebook and Instagram, projected a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for the first quarter of 2025, ranging between $39.5 billion and $41.8 billion. The midpoint of that forecast, $40.65 billion, came in below the $41.7 billion analysts had predicted, according to Bloomberg. Shares rose 5% in after-hours trading, but that optimism wasn’t about the future, it was about Meta narrowly beating its fourth-quarter numbers. For the last quarter of 2024, Meta posted $48.39 billion in revenue and $8.02 in earnings per share, outperforming Wall Street’s expected $47.04 billion in revenue and $6.77 per share in earnings. Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse ambitions and AI investments continue to weigh heavily on Meta’s balance sheet, and the company isn’t generating ad revenue fast enough to offset those costs. And the company got hit with more drama. According to a Wall Street Journal report, President Donald Trump signed settlement papers that require the company to cough up $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit. Microsoft investors lose patience with AI rollout Microsoft Corp. disappointed investors when it reported slower growth in its Azure cloud computing business. The division posted a 31% revenue gain during the quarter, a drop from the 34% growth it recorded the previous quarter. Analysts had projected a 32% gain, and Microsoft’s miss triggered a 4% drop in its stock during after-hours trading. Total revenue for the company hit $69.6 billion, with profit coming in at $3.23 per share. Both figures surpassed Wall Street’s estimates of $68.9 billion and $3.12 per share, but the Azure slowdown was enough to overshadow the overall positive results. Microsoft has been pouring billions into AI, banking on its close relationship with OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT. Over the last year, the company has launched many AI-powered products under the Copilot brand. But the returns have been slow, and investors aren’t thrilled. Meanwhile, AI king Nvidia saw a slight recovery, gaining 1% after a brutal 17% drop earlier in the week. The stock had been rattled after Chinese AI startup DeepSeek sparked concerns about US dominance in AI tech.

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN to dominate the market. With limited supply, overwhelming demand, and exclusive availability, it’s the ultimate choice for investors seeking the next big win.

Whether it’s a bullish breakout, a legendary presale, or a dip-buying opportunity that has investors lining up to snatch the next big thing, there’s never a dull moment in the meme coin space. And speaking of opportunities, BTFD Coin is turning heads with its scorching-hot presale, while Popcat and Brett are making waves on their respective chains. BTFD Coin’s presale just hit an eye-watering $5.78 million, and the Bulls Squad is charging full speed ahead. But what makes this stage of the presale exciting? The team has burned unsold tokens from Stage 13 and skipped straight to Stage 14, making way for a massive opportunity. And here’s where it gets even wilder: the LAUNCH100 promo code is here, giving investors a 100% token bonus. That’s right—every dollar you spend gets you double the $BTFD. But what’s even more bullish? BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game could change the way meme coins operate forever. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Powering Up P2E Gaming BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s a movement. The Bulls Squad (Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull) is leading a revolution, and with the staking system, token burns, and a high-energy P2E game, the potential is massive. The game integrates BTFD tokens directly, meaning players can grind, level up, and earn real crypto rewards. The more you play, the more you earn. Now, suppose you invest $1,000 in BTFD Coin today at its Stage 14 price of $0.00016 per token. That gets you 6,250,000 $BTFD tokens. But with the LAUNCH100 bonus code, that amount doubles to 12,500,000 tokens—absolutely insane. If $BTFD hits $0.0006, your investment would be worth $7,500. But if it climbs to $0.006, your initial $1,000 would skyrocket to $75,000. With staking rewards offering a juicy 90% APY , that’s an extra layer of gains on top. Aside from gaming, BTFD Coin’s roadmap is packed. With a locked liquidity pool, low presale allocation, and aggressive marketing, the Bulls are playing for keeps. Now’s the moment to BTFD or get left behind. How to Claim the LAUNCH100 Bonus Code Right Now Want to double your BTFD Coins? Follow these steps: Go to the presale page first. Click “Connect Wallet” and select MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or your preferred wallet. In the bonus code field, type LAUNCH100 (in all caps) and click “Apply.” Confirm the message in your wallet. Input how much $BTFD you want to buy. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction. Act fast—this 100% bonus is a limited-time deal! Popcat: A Meme Coin with a Legendary Comeback Play Popcat isn’t just an internet meme—it’s a cultural icon. And as a Solana-based token, it’s benefiting from low fees and lightning-fast transactions. Despite dropping 5.06% in the last 24 hours, the current price of $0.3735 could be an elite dip-buying opportunity for those looking to stack up on a trending meme coin. With a market cap of $366 million and a circulating supply of nearly 980 million tokens, Popcat has a strong community and a real shot at reclaiming its bullish momentum. As Solana continues to explode in popularity, expect Popcat to ride that wave. If meme coin season keeps heating up, Popcat could be one of the top new meme coins to buy today. Brett: Base Chain’s Meme King Brett is the mascot of Base Chain, which is rapidly expanding with new projects, developers, and growing liquidity. With a market cap of $793 million and over 9.9 billion coins in circulation, Brett is solidifying itself as one of the leading meme coins in 2025. At a current price of $0.0801, Brett presents an opportunity for those who believe in the long-term success of Base Chain’s ecosystem. As Base Chain grows, so does Brett’s influence. It’s easy to see why this token is grabbing attention and making its way onto the list of top new meme coins to buy today. Conclusion: BTFD or Regret Later BTFD Coin is in Stage 14, the presale tally has soared past $5.78 million, and the token supply is shrinking thanks to a massive burn event. With the LAUNCH100 bonus, there’s no better time to get in. Popcat and Brett also have strong cases, with major ecosystems backing them, but BTFD’s gaming ecosystem and insane token bonus offer unmatched upside. The Bulls are charging—are you in?

However, breaking through the persistent $4,000 resistance level remains a key hurdle for the cryptocurrency, before it goes on to create new highs. Ethereum On The Brink Of A Massive Rally? While frustration may be getting the better of ETH holders due to the digital asset’s below par price performance over the past two years, there could still be a chance to witness a complete turnaround in ETH’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Foundation Sells Another 100 ETH, But There’s Still ‘Hopium’ For Holders In a post on X, Titan of Crypto shared the following ETH weekly chart, illustrating how the digital asset has been consistently forming higher lows since 2022. If ETH maintains this trend, it could soon break through the crucial $4,000 level and potentially set new all-time highs (ATH) later this year. The analyst also applied Fibonacci extensions to estimate potential price targets, with the most optimistic projections reaching as high as $13,000 in 2026. Crypto trader Ted shared a similar outlook on ETH’s price action. According to Ted, once ETH reclaims the $4,000 mark, it could soon surpass its previous ATH. He further predicted that ETH could surge to $9,000 within 3 to 4 months. Additionally, he noted that US President Donald Trump’s recent ETH purchases could provide further upside momentum for the digital asset. Indeed, Trump’s decentralized finance (DeFi) project dubbed World Liberty Financial (WLF) has been on an ETH buying spree. In December 2024, WLF bought 722 ETH, worth $2.5 million at the prevailing market price. Technical analysis trader Alex Clay also sees ETH’s current downtrend as a potential buying opportunity. Clay highlighted that ETH has not only completed its falling wedge pattern but also successfully defended the $3,000 support level. He added: Time to reverse the short-term trend! Send $ETH to $4,000, $4,500, $5,000. ETH: An Overcrowded Trade? While the above analyses may offer hope to ETH traders, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez cautions that the bullish head-and-shoulder pattern on ETH’s daily chart could be turning into an overcrowded trade. He added: If the pattern holds, any dip to $2,900 could be a buying opportunity, but keep your stop-loss tight between $2,700 and $2,500. Related Reading: Ethereum Struggles As Bitcoin Dominance Pushes ETH/BTC Pair To 4-Year Low That said, crypto analyst Mister Crypto recently remarked that Ethereum has “likely bottomed out” and could be on the verge of a breakout to the upside.

As of January 27, 2025, Cronos (CRO), a dynamic layer one blockchain backed by Crypto.com, has experienced a significant dip, dropping over 35% since early December to trade around $0.128. Despite this downturn, technical indicators suggest potential bullish trends on the horizon, making it a focal point for investors eyeing the top crypto coins to buy now. Similarly, Stellar (XLM) has showcased impressive growth. Since January 2024, its price has surged by over 300%, with a notable 16% increase in the past week alone. Trading at $0.473 as of January 15, 2025, Stellar continues to be a strong contender among the top crypto coins to buy now, especially for those interested in facilitating global transactions. Enter Qubetics ($TICS ), a groundbreaking player in the crypto space. Positioning itself as the world’s first Layer-1, EVM-compatible, aggregated multichain blockchain, Qubetics aims to tackle real-world challenges that its predecessors have struggled with. By enhancing scalability, security, and interoperability, Qubetics is not just keeping up but is poised to lead the future of blockchain and digital finance. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Digital Finance Qubetics isn’t just another name in the crypto world; it’s a game-changer. As the first Layer-1, EVM-compatible, aggregated multichain blockchain, Qubetics is setting new standards in the industry. But what does that mean for you? Imagine a platform where multiple blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana work together seamlessly. That’s Qubetics for you. This integration isn’t just a tech marvel; it’s a practical solution for businesses, professionals, and individuals. For instance, a freelancer working with clients across different platforms can manage payments effortlessly without juggling multiple wallets. Or consider a business aiming to streamline transactions across various blockchain networks; Qubetics makes it possible with ease. Now, let’s talk about the Qubetics presale. Currently in its 19th stage, it has already sold over 450 million tokens to more than 17,100 holders, raising upwards of $11.3 million. At this stage, anyone can purchase $TICS tokens at $0.0606. Analysts are buzzing with excitement, predicting that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a 312% return on investment. And that’s just the beginning. Post-presale projections suggest $TICS could soar to $1, marking a staggering 1,548% ROI. Looking further ahead, some forecasts even see $TICS hitting $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch, translating to an eye-popping 16,387% to 24,630% ROI. It’s no wonder that Qubetics is topping the list of top crypto coins to buy now. Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multichain Wallet: A Game Changer One of Qubetics’ standout features is its non-custodial multichain wallet . But what makes it so special? In simple terms, a non-custodial wallet means you’re in full control. Unlike custodial wallets, where a third party holds your private keys, non-custodial wallets ensure that only you have access to your funds. This setup offers enhanced security and peace of mind. Now, add multichain capabilities to the mix. This means the Qubetics wallet supports multiple blockchains, allowing you to manage various cryptocurrencies all in one place. No more hopping between different wallets or platforms. Whether you’re dealing with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other major cryptocurrency, Qubetics has got you covered. Consider this scenario: You’re a business owner who accepts payments in multiple cryptocurrencies. With traditional wallets, you’d need to manage each currency separately, which can be a logistical nightmare. But with Qubetics’ multichain wallet, all your assets are accessible under one roof, simplifying transactions and accounting. Or think about an individual investor looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Instead of juggling multiple wallets and remembering countless passwords, you can use the Qubetics wallet to manage all your investments seamlessly. It’s convenience and security rolled into one. Qubetics Partners with 1inch: Enhancing the Trading Experience In a move to further elevate the user experience, Qubetics has integrated with the 1inch Network, a leading DeFi aggregator. This partnership is a big deal. The 1inch Network connects users to hundreds of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), ensuring optimized trades, unmatched liquidity, and the best possible rates. For Qubetics wallet users, this means access to trades across numerous DEXs, optimized pricing through 1inch’s advanced aggregation technology, and a seamless, efficient trading experience suitable for both newbies and seasoned traders. With this integration, the Qubetics wallet isn’t just a place to store your crypto; it’s a gateway to the decentralized future. It combines intuitive usability with exceptional performance, redefining the trading experience for DeFi enthusiasts worldwide. Cronos: Powering the Next Wave of DeFi Cronos (CRO), backed by Crypto.com, has been a powerhouse in the DeFi space. Although its price took a hit recently—dropping over 35% since early December—its underlying fundamentals remain strong. As of January 27, 2025, CRO is trading at $0.128, a potential buying opportunity for those looking at the top crypto coins to buy now. Cronos has been forming a rising channel since late 2023, and in the daily timeframe, it’s developing a falling wedge pattern, which often signals a bullish reversal. For those who know their technical analysis, this could mean CRO is gearing up for a major breakout. But let’s talk about what makes Cronos unique. Unlike many blockchains that struggle with high fees and slow transactions, Cronos offers lightning-fast processing speeds and low costs, making it an ideal choice for developers and users alike. The blockchain is deeply integrated with the Crypto.com exchange, further solidifying its position in the crypto space. Beyond its technical aspects, Cronos is making waves in the regulatory landscape. Crypto.com executives have been working closely with Donald Trump’s crypto team to shape digital asset regulations. This could have long-term positive implications, as clearer regulations often lead to wider adoption and increased investor confidence. Moreover, Cronos’ DeFi ecosystem is thriving, with over $479 million locked in smart contracts and a stablecoin market cap exceeding $18 million. Whether you’re into staking, lending, or yield farming, CRO provides an array of opportunities to generate passive income. For those seeking undervalued projects with solid fundamentals, Cronos remains a top contender among the top crypto coins to buy now. Its current dip might just be the perfect entry point before the next rally. Stellar: The Future of Global Transactions Stellar (XLM) has been on an absolute tear, surging over 300% since January 2024. As of January 15, 2025, it’s trading at $0.473, nearly half of its all-time high of $0.938. With its mission to make financial services accessible to everyone, Stellar remains a top crypto coin to buy now, especially for those interested in cross-border payments. Stellar is more than just a blockchain—it’s a lifeline for the unbanked. Founded by Jed McCaleb and the Stellar Development Foundation, the network is designed to facilitate instant, low-cost global transactions. Whether you’re sending money to family overseas or handling international business payments, Stellar makes it seamless and affordable. Unlike traditional banking systems, which can take days to process transactions and charge hefty fees, Stellar’s network completes transactions in seconds. It’s already being used by major financial institutions and governments looking to modernize their payment infrastructure. But what’s got investors excited is Stellar’s long-term potential. With the increasing demand for fast, cost-efficient cross-border payments, Stellar is positioned to be a major player in the global financial system. Many investors are accumulating XLM now, betting on its continued adoption. As one of the most promising digital assets, Stellar remains a top crypto coin to buy now for those looking at long-term gains. XLM’s price is expected to increase by 62%, potentially reaching $0.7366 by February 13, 2025. However, short-term projections for next week indicate the price could hover between $0.4718 and $0.42. If the price meets the lower estimate, a 10.87% drop is expected, bringing it to $0.42 by January 26, 2025. As of January 15, 2025, the overall sentiment for Stellar remains bullish, with 27 technical analysis indicators signaling bullish trends and only 2 showing bearish signals. This strong momentum further supports the case for XLM as a top cryptocurrency investment in 2025. Why Non-Custodial Multichain Wallets Are the Future If you’ve been in crypto long enough, you know the risks of centralized wallets. Exchange hacks, government crackdowns, and frozen accounts—it’s happened too many times to count. That’s why non-custodial multichain wallets, like the one Qubetics offers, are becoming the gold standard. With a non-custodial wallet, you hold your private keys, meaning you’re the sole owner of your assets. There’s no middleman, no third-party risk, just pure control over your crypto. Multichain functionality takes things a step further. Instead of juggling multiple wallets for different blockchains, you get a single interface to manage everything. Whether you’re dealing with Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana, a multichain wallet allows seamless interaction across ecosystems. For traders, this means faster transactions, lower fees, and more liquidity. For everyday users, it simplifies crypto management, making it easier to spend, save, and invest. And for businesses, it’s a game-changer—streamlining operations and reducing transaction costs. With the increasing adoption of DeFi and cross-chain interoperability, non-custodial multichain wallets aren’t just a trend; they’re the future of blockchain technology. Final Thoughts: The Best Time to Invest Is Now With Qubetics pioneering multichain interoperability, Cronos strengthening its DeFi foothold, and Stellar revolutionizing global payments, it’s clear that these three projects are among the top crypto coins to buy now. Each brings something unique to the table, whether it’s scalability, security, or real-world utility. And if you’re looking for an opportunity that could deliver massive returns, the Qubetics presale is where you want to be. With $TICS currently priced at $0.0606 and analysts predicting a surge to $10-$15 post-mainnet launch, the potential ROI is staggering. But as with any investment, timing is everything. The crypto market moves fast, and opportunities like these don’t last forever. If you’re serious about securing your spot in the next wave of blockchain innovation, now’s the time to take action. Don’t just watch from the sidelines—get in on the action and make your move today!

Cronje claims on the social media platform X that Sonic, formerly known as Fantom, is the “only actual decentralized stage 3 L2.” “No fee extraction, all submits 100% to ETH, no ‘centralized value extraction’. Decentralized sequencing. Decentralized bridges. While the rest of the L2s continue to fake pretend to ‘decentralize’ (why would they when they get millions of fees per year?), we already did it. Scaled transactions per second to 16,000+ on the L1. Decreased storage by 98% even on archival nodes. Scaled L1 and jumped to the ‘golden standard’ of L2. Not even mentioning FeeM, FeeSub, and Dynamic Fees.” A South Korean computer scientist launched Fantom (FTM) in 2018. The project aimed to serve as a tool to aggregate smart contracts into decentralized applications (dApps). Last year, the development team behind the blockchain announced a rebrand to Sonic as a way to improve transaction efficiency. Investors can trade in their FTM tokens at a 1:1 rate for S tokens, which will have multiple functions within the Sonic ecosystem. S is trading at $0.453 at time of writing. The 85th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 8.5% in the past 24 hours.

The Ethereum price has shown price instability and low returns, leaving investors questioning its potential. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is breaking through with unstoppable momentum as investors and whales rush to purchase its presale tokens, eager to cash in on massive profits. Experts forecast a 1000x value surge , with million-dollar stakes betting it could flip their portfolios into generational fortunes. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is Gaining Traction With 1000x Gains And Whale Interest in Its Presale WallitIQ (WLTQ) is quickly gaining traction as one of the most popular new wallets in the cryptocurrency market. Investors and whales are flocking to its presale as analysts predict a 1000x increase in value within weeks. With nearly $6.5 million already raised, the presale could hit $7 million before the month ends. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale token is off to a promising start in 2025, with ambitious goals to outshine the Ethereum price gains this Q1. Its rising presale demand has drawn whales’ attention, moving it closer to selling out completely. Analysts believe it could rank among the top-performing presale this quarter, leaving popular coins like Ethereum (ETH) behind. Missing out on its wallet means making your trading less efficient and more vulnerable to market challenges like low security and increased risks. Advanced security features like biometric and facial authentication offer a smooth physical-to-digital wallet experience, automated transactions , optimal liquidity, 180% APY, governance rights, and referral bonuses . The WallitIQ (WLTQ) wallet empowers new and experienced investors to make smarter investment decisions while gaining expert-level insights into crypto market activities. It recently unveiled its crypto wallet mobile app, offering customizable alerts, instant payments via a QR code scanner , and an AI-powered interface for smooth portfolio tracking and management. While the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale price is currently $0.042 , experts predict its value could surge to $3 by Q2 2025. Already listed on CoinMarketCap , the presale token’s 1000x potential has drawn significant whale interest, with its price expected to skyrocket further upon listing on major centralized exchanges. Ethereum Price Struggles Lead Whales To Shift Focus Towards WallitIQ (WLTQ) The market report on Ethereum price shows a 5.85% gain in the daily chart but a 3% decline over the past week. This fluctuation has left whales reconsidering their strategies to start 2025 with stable investments. With the Ethereum price instability, many whales have turned to its rival, whose presale is positioned to deliver steady 1,000% gains. The decline in Ethereum price has continued on its monthly chart, sliding 4% from its $3,500 high to a current value of $3,398. Its rival, WallitIQ (WLTQ), has emerged as a standout choice, reporting impressive stability and unparalleled adoption rates in its presale. Whales Are Moving To WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale For 1000x ROI With the Ethereum price movement showing volatility, many investors seek more stable opportunities to maximize returns this Q1 2025. As the Ethereum price trends discourage further investment, attention is shifting to WallitIQ (WLTQ), which performs impressively in presale and promises 1000x stable gains. WallitIQ (WLTQ) users have praised its impressive wallet features, including liquidity options, referral bonuses, and high-yield rewards from utility token staking. The wallet makes payments quicker with modern methods like its Scan & QR system. It also incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning, with its smart contract audited by SolidProof. Whales have recognized the potential of WallitIQ (WLTQ), moving away from Ethereum (ETH) to stake in it, showing that they value future growth over current popularity. You can join the ranks of future millionaires by investing in its stable presale with massive potential. To capitalize on a potential 1000x gain, buy its affordable presale tokens at $0.042 before the price rises to $0.062 in the next stage.

While Cardano and XRP have long been major players, experts argue that RCOF presents a safer and more lucrative investment opportunity, potentially delivering a staggering 50,000% ROI. But what makes RCO Finance stand out from giants like XRP and Cardano? Let’s dive in. XRP vs. Cardano vs. RCO Finance: The Emerging Power Shift XRP and Cardano have solidified their presence in the market, each offering unique blockchain capabilities. However, recent developments have highlighted their challenges. XRP continues to grapple with regulatory hurdles, while Cardano has faced network upgrades and adoption delays. In contrast, RCO Finance is gaining momentum due to its innovative AI-driven approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). The project has already raised over $12 million in its presale, attracting investors looking for a safer, high-growth opportunity in the evolving crypto landscape. With the price currently at $0.10 in its fifth presale stage, investors are eager to lock in their positions before it rises to $0.13 in the next round. Experience RCO Finance’s Beta Platform Firsthand The beta version of RCO Finance is now live, offering early access to its advanced AI-driven tools before the full launch. Users can experience firsthand how the powerful AI-powered Robo Advisor and asset tokenization features function in real market conditions. The beta platform continuously evolves, with enhancements to refine performance and integrate new features. As one of the few projects providing a beta version during its presale, RCOF sets itself apart by allowing investors to test and familiarize themselves with its cutting-edge DeFi solutions early on. RCO Finance’s AI-Powered Edge Over XRP and Cardano in the Market Unlike traditional investment platforms that provide one-size-fits-all solutions, RCO Finance’s Robo Advisor delivers fully customized strategies tailored to each investor’s goals and risk tolerance. The AI engine continuously processes market data, optimizing portfolios based on shifting trends to benefit seasoned and novice investors. Imagine receiving early alerts on promising tokens before they explode, like $MELANIA , which quickly surpassed $10.1 billion in market capitalization after its launch, outpacing its predecessor, $TRUMP. Without sophisticated AI-driven tools, many traders miss out on these monumental gains, losing the opportunity to maximize their portfolios. With RCO Finance’s Robo Advisor, investors receive real-time insights and early alerts, allowing them to position themselves ahead of the market and capture such rapid surges early on. The Robo Advisor also prevents traders from incurring losses in the market. For example, Nvidia lost over 16% of its market value in the past 24 hours, wiping out $560 billion of investors’ funds, the highest in United States history. With the Robo Advisor, you will be notified before such a ‘bloodbath’ to exit your position on the asset. RCOF is advancing the future of AI-powered trading with cutting-edge monitoring features for its Robo Advisor. These features are currently in the alpha phase and undergoing internal testing to help the team consistently improve the Robo Advisor’s performance, ensuring it delivers optimal service to users at all times. Cardano and XRP have made strides in blockchain applications, but RCOF takes innovation further by integrating real-world asset tokenization. RCO Finance allows investors to enter traditionally illiquid markets by converting tangible assets like real estate and commodities into blockchain-based tokens. The tokenization approach enables fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy portions of high-value assets without requiring huge capital commitment. RCO Finance offers a KYC-free ecosystem, ensuring privacy and anonymity for its users. This frictionless onboarding process makes DeFi more accessible to global investors who value financial privacy. Users can seamlessly enter the crypto market without cumbersome and intrusive identity verification, RCOF allows access to 120,000+ assets across 12,500 categories, including cryptocurrencies, tokenized stocks, and ETFs. Investors can build diversified portfolios that balance risk across multiple asset classes. This extensive selection ensures that traders never run out of lucrative opportunities. RCO Finance offers up to 1000x leverage for traders looking to amplify their gains. Investors can engage in leveraged trading across multiple asset classes, maximizing their capital efficiency. The ability to trade with 10x, 50x, or even 100x leverage positions RCOF as one of the most powerful tools in the financial market. Additionally, RCOF token holders enjoy discounted trading fees, incentivizing long-term engagement and ensuring users extract the most value from the platform. The platform’s tier-based reward system further enhances profitability for committed investors. With over 10,000 users already engaging with the platform, the rapidly growing community reflects the trust and confidence in RCOF’s AI-driven approach to DeFi trading. This momentum is a key reason why analysts, including Dogecoin (DOGE) experts, have predicted RCOF to experience a significant surge. Explore the beta platform and be part of the future of AI-powered investing. 50,000% Presale: Your Golden Ticket to Massive Gains With RCO Finance’s presale price at $0.10, investors are rushing to secure tokens before the price increases to $0.13 in the next stage. The project has already raised over $12 million, and analysts predict a surge past $10 per token post-launch, giving early investors a realistic chance at 50,000% returns. Adding to the excitement, RCOF runs an exclusive 30% bonus for early adopters using the code RCOF30, further amplifying potential gains. Moreover, a $100,000 giveaway is on the horizon and will likely launch once the platform hits its $250,000 milestone, making it even more rewarding for early investors. For traders looking to expand their portfolios, RCOF tokens also offer leverage up to 1000x, allowing for exponential portfolio growth beyond what XRP or Cardano currently provides. RCOF is backed by the $450 billion DeFi market and has also undergone a comprehensive audit by SolidProof to ensure its security as an investment. With security, innovation, and AI-driven market insights, RCO Finance is becoming the next big thing in crypto. Join the presale now to capitalize on this potentially life-changing opportunity.

Traders snapped back to riskier assets after five straight days of losses. The surge puts Bitcoin just $4,000 shy of its all-time high, which it hit last week on ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump’s first day in office. The sudden price hike came as markets tried to shake off the chaos caused by a Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, which had sent stocks and crypto spiraling. Bitcoin has been moving more in step with stock markets in recent weeks. The correlation tightened after inflation worries pushed both Wall Street and crypto into a risk-off mood earlier this month. Stephane Ouellette, CEO of FRNT Financial Inc., said Bitcoin’s bounce wasn’t just about the Fed’s announcement. “Rather than a direct response to today’s Fed announcement, we view the move as more related to recovering from the nonsensical sell-off earlier in the week and putting the Fed announcement behind us,” he explained. For traders, the Fed’s pause gave markets the breather they needed. Powell’s crypto remarks turn heads At the press conference that happened after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting today, Powell made a pro-crypto comment, or at least the closest thing to it. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks,” Powell said , which is a huge change in attitude from the Biden era’s hardline approach. Under Biden, crypto businesses struggled to maintain relationships with banks, often being dropped for reasons shrouded in secrecy. Now, Powell is telling banks that they don’t need to shut out crypto, as long as their operations are “safe and sound.” The comment is also a huge departure from the debanking drama of recent years, where major institutions cut off access to financial services for crypto companies. Powell addressed the issue head-on, saying: “We certainly don’t want to take actions that would cause banks to terminate customers who are perfectly legal just because of excess risk aversion.” Senate hearing to investigate debanking On February 5, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing to investigate debanking practices targeting the crypto industry. Republicans on the committee have confirmed three witnesses: Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital; Evan Hafer, founder of Black Rifle Coffee; and Stephen Gannon, a partner at DWT Law. Their testimonies are expected to pull back the curtain on specifically how and why banks were severing ties with crypto businesses. Hafer, known for running a conservative-owned business, has also faced account closures. The committee’s investigation seeks to determine if banks are selectively cutting off clients for political or regulatory reasons. And the banks have gone into full-on damage control mode. Bank of America told Fox Business, “We never close accounts for political reasons. We are required to follow strict government rules and regulations, which sometimes lead to decisions to exit certain relationships.” JPMorgan took a similar line, saying, “We follow the law. Full stop. Political bias has no place in our policies.” Still, those reassurances aren’t sitting well with crypto insiders. Many have long accused Wall Street of playing favorites, cutting off access to crypto businesses to protect their dominance. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s CEO, weighed in on the issue during his company’s podcast, The Unshakeables . He admitted that banks are often forced to shut accounts but can’t legally disclose the reasons to their clients, saying: “We should be allowed to tell clients why. There should be far clearer rules about what we have to do and what we don’t have to do.” Last week, Donald Trump blasted Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan in a speech at the World Economic Forum. The president accused Bank of America and JPMorgan of locking out conservative businesses. “They don’t take conservative business,” Trump said. “I don’t know if the regulators forced that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody—I hope you open your banks to conservatives because what you’re doing is wrong.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",News,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-30 01:07:37

Musk Buys Solana (MUSKSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Buys Solana by entering its contract address (CA) – HZgXdFhQK1KTn8wM6hfRPtyGuKskETTzWM31qAdXJVRV – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|DOGE|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-30 01:20:00

The rule permits companies to value digital assets at market prices each quarter. According to Arkham Intelligence data , the electric vehicle maker holds 11,509 BTC, estimated at $1.19 billion based on current market prices. Tesla reports a $600 million Bitcoin gain under new accounting rules. The automotive company did not disclose its Bitcoin holdings in its Q4 2024 report . Instead, it disclosed a $600 million mark-to-market gain on “digital assets.” Still, according to Bitcoin Treasuries, Tesla holds 9,720 BTC, making it the sixth-largest publicly traded company with Bitcoin on its balance sheet. This gain stems from an accounting adjustment under new reporting rules, which increased Tesla’s reported digital asset value to $1.076 billion, up from the previously impaired value of $184 million recorded under older accounting methods. In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board introduced a new rule update, requiring companies to report digital assets at their fair market value and not at the lowest price for which they have been recorded since they were purchased. Tesla adopted the rule early before the 2025 deadline, which is a requirement for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Previously, Tesla could only report losses if Bitcoin’s price declined but was not allowed to record gains unless the asset was sold. Under the new standard, companies must recalculate the value of their crypto holdings from the market every quarter, as they do with other financial assets like stocks. Tesla reports a 23% drop in operating profit despite rising sales and Bitcoin revaluation gains. Tesla’s profit during the last three months of 2024 was $2.3 billion. This was a decline compared with $7.9 billion a year earlier, but 2023’s profit included a one-time tax benefit of $5.9 billion. Tesla’s operating profit, excluding that special gain, fell 23% in the year’s final three months. Conversely, sales rose 2% to $25.7 billion in the fourth quarter from $25.2 billion in the same period in 2023. The company missed Wall Street’s estimate of $0.78 for adjusted earnings per share; It reported $0.73. However, investors are happy with the Bitcoin revaluation, and Tesla shares are up 4.3% in after-hours trading at $406.25. According to Google Finance data , this followed a 2.25% decline in regular trading, bringing Tesla’s stock price to $389.10. With 11,509 BTC, Tesla continues to be one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin holders. Some investors seem to be hopeful that Musk’s close ties with President Trump will benefit Tesla, such as by helping to remove regulatory obstacles for self-driving vehicles. However, Trump and the Republicans in Congress have vowed to eliminate tax credits and other incentives for electric vehicles, including Tesla. Tesla’s CEO has stated that the removal of these incentives would impact rivals more than Tesla. Other firms with crypto exposure, including MicroStrategy and Coinbase, may also see their reported asset values increase under the new accounting rule this year.

The token swam against the current as most of the top memecoins recorded red numbers, leading analysts to suggest a possible breakout for the token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Preparing For A February Rally? Analyst Says New High Is Two Weeks Away Las Vegas Sphere About To Be WIF Hat Dogwifhat has recovered from yesterday’s drop below the $1 mark following its team’s tease of the long-awaited Las Vegas Sphere project. On Tuesday night, the official Dogwifhat X account shared a picture of its mascot in Las Vegas. The image included the cute dog with the Las Vegas Sphere as its hat and an old Nokia phone with “01.2025” on its screen. Additionally, the account stated that the “hat stays on,” explaining that dates will be shared “as soon as we are allowed.” The bullish tease propelled the token back to its recently lost support of $1.30 and reignited the broader community’s interest in the memecoin. WIF became the memecoin sensation of 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.88 last March. The token also led the memecoin narrative during Q2 and recovered some of its early glory during the December pump. However, WIF’s spotlight was eclipsed by the oversaturated memecoin sector and the rise of many other market sensations like PNUT and CHILL, dropping 40% in the last six months and 75% from its ATH. During its 2,000% growth phase, many crypto investors put their hats on, which prompted a massive fundraising campaign to display the memecoin in the Las Vegas Sphere, the world’s largest LED screen, for a week. The community raised $700,000 to achieve this dream but was left in the dark over the last several months. In July 2024, many investors expressed concern and frustration about the project after Crypto.com displayed Bitcoin’s logo on the Sphere. Some community members questioned the project, calling the initiative an alleged scam. However, the organizer repeatedly assured the WIF community that they were working to make “wif on Sphere” happen soon. Is the Dogwifhat Bottom In? Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared his outlook on WIF’s recent performance. He suggested that the pump doesn’t seem “actually real/sustainable” based on the “overall chart/market conditions.” However, he considers that if Dogwifhat shows some consolidation above the $1.23 mark, it could see another leg up. Meanwhile, crypto trader Bluntz stated that its current levels could potentially be WIF’s bottom. According to the post, “the major A wave has now been swept” and there are some “nice signs of life forming” in the lower timeframes despite the retrace lasting longer than he anticipated. The trader previously forecasted an “inevitable” fall to the $1 range, arguing that WIF was headed for a large retrace before the next parabolic run, which could lead to a new ATH. Related Reading: ‘No Need To Panic’: Cardano (ADA) Holding Key Level Despite 14% Drop After the recent performance, Bluntz warned that it is a “very early day, and we haven’t seen a 5-wave rise from the lows ‘yet’, but I think there’s a decent chance one has begun to form.” Another market watcher also pointed out a one-month falling wedge pattern on WIF’s chart, which targets $1.90 at a “minimum and quickly” if the memecoin breaks out of the upper downtrend line at around $1.40. As of this writing, dogwifhat trades at $1.21, a 14.4% surge in the daily timeframe.

SOL Whale Activity Surges & BNB Token Burn Strengthens Market,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-is-now-the-best-crypto-to-mine-with-500k-x1-users-sol-whale-activity-surges-bnb-token-burn-strengthens-market/,"The cryptocurrency landscape is abuzz with significant developments that continue to shape the industry’s trajectory. Despite a recent market pullback, Solana (SOL) is witnessing persistent whale activity, a strong indication that large investors remain confident in the blockchain’s long-term potential. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) has once again reinforced its deflationary model with a staggering $1.16 billion token burn, permanently removing over 1.6 million BNB from circulation. However, one of the most remarkable milestones in the crypto space today is the meteoric rise of BlockDAG (BDAG) mining, with the X1 mobile mining app surpassing 500,000 active users. This unprecedented growth underscores the massive demand for accessible crypto mining, positioning BDAG as the best crypto to mine on mobile. As BlockDAG’s presale continues to break records, the industry is witnessing a paradigm shift in how digital assets are mined, stored, and utilized. Solana Whale Activity Remains Strong Despite Market Pullback Solana has been at the center of attention following a 22.93% decline in its price, dropping from its all-time high of $294.33 to $227. While this significant price correction might typically signal bearish sentiment, the actions of large investors tell a different story. Solana whale activity remains robust, with wallets holding 10,000+ SOL reaching a peak of 5,137 before slightly retreating to 5,128. This continued interest from whales suggests that institutional and high-net-worth investors are still optimistic about the blockchain’s long-term potential, despite the temporary price downturn. Market analysts have noted that technical indicators paint a mixed picture of Solana’s trajectory. The Average Directional Index (ADX), a key metric used to assess trend strength, has fallen from 66.2 to 27.2, signaling a weakening upward trend. However, the persistence of whale accumulation suggests that large investors might be positioning themselves for future gains. Some experts believe that if whale activity continues at this rate, Solana’s price could stabilize and even stage a strong recovery in the coming months. BNB Token Burn: Strengthening Binance’s Deflationary Model BNB has once again demonstrated its commitment to a scarcity-driven value model with its latest token burn. The 30th quarterly burn event saw the permanent removal of 1,634,200.95 BNB, reducing the total circulating supply and reinforcing Binance’s long-term deflationary strategy. This massive $1.16 billion reduction includes 110,000 BNB lost during the recent BNB Chain Fusion, further solidifying the asset’s limited supply mechanism. The impact of these burns cannot be understated. Binance’s Auto-Burn system, which calculates the number of tokens to be removed based on market performance and network activity, ensures a transparent and systematic approach to reducing supply. As demand for BNB grows, this mechanism could lead to a significant price appreciation over time. Investor sentiment surrounding BNB remains overwhelmingly positive, especially given Binance’s long-term goal of burning a total of 42 million BNB tokens. BlockDAG Mining Soars: Is it the Best Crypto to Mine on Mobile? While Solana and BNB continue to command attention, the most exciting development in the industry is the rapid rise of BlockDAG (BDAG) mining. The X1 mobile mining app has now surpassed 500,000 active users, reflecting an unparalleled surge in demand for decentralized and user-friendly mining solutions. Unlike traditional crypto mining, which often requires expensive hardware, high electricity costs, and complex technical setups, BlockDAG’s X1 app enables seamless mobile mining, allowing users to earn up to 20 BDAG coins per day. The simplicity of the system has made it incredibly popular among crypto enthusiasts looking for a low-barrier entry into digital asset mining. The potential profitability of BDAG mining is another driving factor behind its adoption. If BDAG reaches its projected value of $1 per coin, miners could earn $20 per day, $600 per month, and an impressive $7,200 per year. This substantial earning potential, combined with bonus incentives through referrals, makes BDAG mining one of the most attractive opportunities in the crypto space. BlockDAG’s success is also evident in its ongoing presale, which has raised over $186 million and sold a staggering 18.2 billion BDAG coins. Early investors have already seen a 2,380% return on investment (ROI), as BDAG’s price has surged from $0.001 to $0.0248. This explosive growth has fueled increased demand for BDAG mining, leading to a dramatic rise in X1 app users. Crypto’s Most Exciting Era Yet: Key Takeaways Solana’s ongoing whale activity signals continued institutional confidence, suggesting that long-term investors remain bullish on its prospects. BNB’s deflationary model has been further strengthened by its latest $1.16 billion token burn, reinforcing its position as a valuable and scarce asset. However, the most significant shift is happening in the mining sector, where BlockDAG’s X1 app is reshaping the landscape of decentralized mining. By surpassing 500,000 active users, BlockDAG has proven that there is immense demand for accessible, profitable, and mobile-friendly mining solutions. As BDAG’s presale continues to gain momentum, early adopters are positioning themselves to capitalize on one of the most promising mining ecosystems in the industry. Now is the perfect time for traders, miners, and crypto enthusiasts to explore the BlockDAG ecosystem and take advantage of its mining rewards.

Experts Recommend Considering Web3Bay,https://thecoinrise.com/tron-kaspa-are-not-worth-it-in-2025-which-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-experts-recommend-considering-web3bay/,"Donald Trump’s return to office has sparked a surge in the crypto market, prompting investors to search for the most promising assets. Among key players like TRON, Kaspa, and Web3Bay, it is Web3Bay that emerges as the best crypto to buy in 2025. It offers a unique take on decentralized e-commerce which could revolutionize how we shop online. With growing enthusiasm and increased institutional focus on blockchain, Web3Bay’s successful presale underscores its capacity to transform global commerce. Having raised $970,000 and sold over 255 million tokens, Web3Bay is quickly becoming the preferred choice for investors aiming for substantial returns in the digital economy. TRON: Expanding Applications Yet Struggling with Centralization Issues TRON is known for its rapid blockchain solutions, handling vast transactions at low costs. It has become a central hub for decentralized apps, gaming, and content sharing, highlighted by its TRUMP memecoin launch, which captured widespread interest. However, the centralization of TRON, with few super representatives, sparks debates over its decentralization and durability. In contrast, Web3Bay champions full decentralization with a community-based governance structure, giving all token holders a say in its operations. Unlike TRON, which mainly focuses on blockchain capabilities, Web3Bay tackles the inefficiencies in traditional e-commerce by removing middlemen, lowering fees, and offering a transparent platform for global transactions. Kaspa: Cutting-Edge Technology with a Limited Application Range Kaspa has been acknowledged for its blockDAG technology, enhancing fast transaction confirmations and scalability. It attracts blockchain enthusiasts who prioritize speed and decentralization. Kaspa has experienced notable price increases over the last year, securing its status as a noteworthy market contender. Yet, Kaspa’s appeal is predominantly technical with restricted practical applications, which may hinder broader market penetration. Web3Bay proposes a more dynamic solution aimed at the expansive $5 trillion e-commerce sector. It supports small businesses and consumers worldwide by eliminating high transaction fees, offering diverse payment methods, and preventing data centralization. With features like NFT integration, staking rewards, and a hybrid payment system, Web3Bay is positioned for widespread use and enduring success, presenting a more comprehensive investment opportunity compared to Kaspa. Web3Bay Positioned as the Best Crypto To Buy Now Web3Bay isn’t just a digital currency, but a response to the deep-rooted issues of e-commerce. Platforms such as Amazon and eBay often impose high fees, limit payment methods, and control user data. Web3Bay changes this, offering a clear, affordable market where buyers and sellers meet directly. The 3BAY token is vital to this ecosystem, providing tangible benefits and rewards for its holders. Those who own tokens receive a 5% discount on purchases, staking rewards, and governance rights via the platform’s DAO. Web3Bay’s mixed payment system accepts both crypto and traditional methods like PayPal, making it accessible worldwide. Web3Bay’s presale has excelled, amassing $970,000 in its fourth stage at a token price of $0.004562625. Early investors have witnessed price rises in each presale phase. With a forecasted launch price of $0.1959, early backers could see a 6,430% ROI. Consider this: A $1,000 investment in 3BAY tokens now could surge to $42,939 by its launch. This potential for high returns, coupled with the real-world use of Web3Bay, highlights it as a top pick for investors aiming for wise investments in 2025. Web3Bay Dominates TRON and Kaspa While TRON and Kaspa are notable in the crypto world, Web3Bay surpasses them with its adaptability and potential for growth. TRON’s centralization may deter blockchain enthusiasts, and Kaspa’s emphasis on transaction speed misses out on wider applications that attract a general audience. Web3Bay, however, meets a global demand: fair and reachable commerce. Its roadmap is packed with promising features like an NFT marketplace, compatibility across different chains, and expandable Layer-2 solutions, preparing it to expand with its users. This positions Web3Bay not just as a cryptocurrency but as a fundamental part of the evolving digital economy. For small companies, Web3Bay eliminates traditional banking dependencies, allowing them to access worldwide markets without hefty fees or limiting conditions. For shoppers, it ensures a safe, unlimited buying experience with genuine savings. Which One is the Best Crypto To Buy Today? The cryptocurrency market is embracing a new era of expansion, driven by positive market trends and wider acceptance. TRON and Kaspa hold their ground in specific areas, but Web3Bay shines with its usability, scalability, and visionary outlook. With $970,000 collected in its crypto presale , an anticipated ROI of 6,430%, and a system set to transform worldwide commerce, Web3Bay stands as the most exciting investment for 2025. Its decentralized commerce model introduces a just, open, and collective marketplace benefiting all participants—buyers, sellers, and investors.

With Bitcoin flirting with new all-time highs and institutional investors diving headfirst into the blockchain space, the race to find the top cryptos to buy for 2025 is hotter than ever. But let’s be real—not every project makes it to the top. Aptos was one of the hyped ones, and those who got in early made a killing. But what about the ones who missed out? That “what if” feeling is the worst, right? Well, here’s the good news—there’s another rising star, and this time, there’s still a chance to get in before the fireworks start. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) —the world’s first Web3 aggregator that’s solving problems the big-name cryptos haven’t figured out yet. The future isn’t just about faster transactions or lower fees; it’s about making different blockchains actually talk to each other. That’s where Qubetics comes in. Whether it’s businesses struggling with multi-chain compatibility, freelancers juggling payments across different networks, or regular users tired of swapping tokens every time they want to use a new dApp—Qubetics is making it all seamless. And with its presale heating up, investors are eyeing $TICS as a golden ticket to massive gains. Qubetics: The Future of Interoperability For those who missed out on Aptos, Qubetics presale presents an enticing opportunity. Currently in its 19th presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $11.3 million, with more than 450 million $TICS tokens sold to over 17,100 holders. The token is priced at $0.0606, offering an accessible entry point for potential investors. Qubetics distinguishes itself through its focus on interoperability—the seamless interaction between different blockchain networks. This capability is crucial in a landscape where numerous blockchains operate in isolation. By enabling cross-chain transactions, asset transfers, and data sharing, Qubetics is set to revolutionize how various blockchain platforms communicate and collaborate. Imagine a tech startup in Silicon Valley that utilizes Ethereum for smart contracts and Solana for swift transactions. Traditionally, integrating these platforms would be complex and resource-intensive. However, with Qubetics’ interoperability solutions, the startup can effortlessly manage operations across both blockchains, streamlining processes and reducing costs. Similarly, a freelance graphic designer in New York could use Qubetics to manage payments received in different cryptocurrencies. Instead of juggling multiple wallets and conversion processes, the designer can consolidate transactions through Qubetics’ platform, simplifying financial management. Analysts are bullish on $TICS, predicting significant price appreciation. By the end of the presale, $TICS is expected to reach $0.25, translating into a 312.18% return on investment for early participants. Post-presale projections are even more optimistic, with forecasts of $1 per token, equating to a 1,548.71% increase. Following the mainnet launch, some experts anticipate the token reaching $15, which would mean a staggering 24,630.58% return. Aptos: A Rising Star in the Crypto Space Aptos has been making waves with its innovative approach to blockchain technology. As of January 29, 2025, Aptos is trading at approximately $7.42, experiencing a slight dip of 2.89% from the previous day. Despite this minor setback, analysts remain optimistic about its future. Projections suggest that Aptos could reach $9.44 by February 2, 2025, indicating a potential increase of around 27%. Aptos aims to enhance scalability and security within the blockchain ecosystem. Its unique consensus mechanism and focus on user-friendly applications have attracted a growing community of developers and investors. The platform’s commitment to continuous improvement and adaptability positions it as a strong contender among the top cryptos to buy for 2025. Conclusion: Seizing the Opportunity The cryptocurrency market is dynamic and ever-evolving, presenting both challenges and opportunities. While Aptos continues to develop its platform and expand its user base, Qubetics offers a compelling alternative, especially for those who may have missed earlier investment opportunities. With its groundbreaking focus on interoperability and impressive presale performance, Qubetics stands out as one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025. The potential for substantial returns, coupled with real-world applications across various industries, makes $TICS a token worth considering. Don’t let this chance slip by. Participate in the Qubetics presale today and position yourself at the forefront of the next wave in blockchain innovation.

Trump Fuks DeepSeek (TRUMSEEK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMSEEK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Fuks DeepSeek can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fuks DeepSeek could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fuks DeepSeek launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fuks DeepSeek on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fuks DeepSeek by entering its contract address (CA) – 3QtYU6QPQPGbzHX9evKdxVHsoTnXyjUwY8xkaVnZ9QPc – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMSEEK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-30 02:45:00

Dogecoin’s earliest days are a prime example. What started as a joke quickly became a financial revolution, turning those who took it seriously into millionaires. But here’s the thing—history has a way of repeating itself. Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC)is making waves in the meme coin space, and those who seize the moment could be the ones telling their own success stories in the coming years. Dogecoin: The Missed ICO That Could Have Made You a Fortune Dogecoin was never supposed to be taken seriously. When software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer launched it in December 2013, it was a fun, satirical response to the increasingly serious crypto scene. No one expected that this Shiba Inu-inspired meme coin would one day skyrocket to global fame. Back then, Dogecoin traded at a fraction of a cent—literally worth almost nothing. In early 2014, its price hovered around $0.0002 to $0.0003, with barely any attention from major investors. Fast forward to today, and Dogecoin has hit highs of over $0.70, making early believers jaw-droppingly rich. A mere $100 investment in Dogecoin in its early days would have turned into six-figure wealth at its peak. That’s the kind of moonshot opportunity that makes or breaks crypto millionaires. Yet, most people didn’t take it seriously. They laughed. They dismissed it. And then, they regretted it. The biggest question now is: Will you make the same mistake again? Because right now, another meme coin is gaining traction, and the window of opportunity is still wide open. Enter Arctic Pablo, one of the top new meme coins to invest in now that is rewriting the rules of presales. Arctic Pablo: The Meme Coin Presale That’s Turning Heads Unlike Dogecoin, which had no structured presale, Arctic Pablo is offering an exclusive chance for early adopters to jump in before the market does. And this isn’t just any typical ICO—this is a revolution in meme coin presales. Rather than traditional stages, Arctic Pablo’s presale is mapped out as a journey. Right now, the presale is at Glacier Grove, with the price sitting at just $0.000043. This is still insanely early, but here’s the kicker—the final presale price is set at $0.0008, and the launch price is projected at $0.008. Do the math, and early investors at this stage could be looking at a staggering 18,546% ROI by the time it officially hits the market. Think about that. Imagine turning a modest investment into a life-changing windfall, just like the earliest Dogecoin investors did. People always say they wish they had a time machine to go back and buy Dogecoin in 2013. But Arctic Pablo is right here, right now, and this could be your moment to grab hold of the next viral meme coin phenomenon. The Perks That Set Arctic Pablo Apart Beyond just price potential, Arctic Pablo is built for longevity. It’s not just another hype-driven meme coin—it’s creating an ecosystem that rewards its community in multiple ways. Investors can stake their tokens at an APY of 66% during the presale, meaning they’re already making gains before the coin even launches. The project also offers referral incentives so those who spread the word about Arctic Pablo can earn even more. And let’s not forget the community competitions, where participants can score additional rewards in APC tokens or even USD. This is the kind of active, engaging, and rewarding ecosystem that meme coin lovers crave—and it’s happening now, not months or years down the road. Why Arctic Pablo Is One of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now The meme coin market is constantly evolving, but one thing remains true: the best time to invest in a meme coin is before the mainstream catches on. Arctic Pablo is generating massive buzz, with over $600,000 already raised in the presale, and momentum is only growing. This isn’t a situation where you’ll be looking back years from now, wondering why you didn’t take action. This is a live opportunity, and it’s still in its early days. With a launch price of $0.008, the potential for massive early gains is undeniable. And let’s be real—who doesn’t want to be part of the next big crypto success story? The Final Chance to Be an Early Investor Every crypto cycle has its defining moments—the projects that started small but exploded into global sensations. Dogecoin had its moment, and those who caught it early made fortunes. But the next big story? It’s unfolding right now with Arctic Pablo . The presale won’t last forever. Each new location brings a price increase as Arctic Pablo continues its journey. The top new meme coins to invest in now aren’t the ones that have already peaked—they’re still in their infancy, flying under the radar, and giving early believers a once-in-a-lifetime chance. So, will you let another meme coin moon while you sit on the sidelines? Or will you secure your spot in Arctic Pablo before it skyrockets? The choice is yours—but the window is closing fast.

As the digital asset space braces for new opportunities, three tokens are emerging as potential leaders – Lightchain AI , a platform revolutionizing blockchain and AI integration; Bitcoin (BTC), the original and most trusted cryptocurrency; and Ethereum (ETH), the backbone of decentralized applications. Among these, Lightchain AI’s presale success, raising $12.3 million at $0.005625 per token, signals its rise as a groundbreaking contender in this golden era for crypto. Bitcoin and Ethereum – Leaders of the Crypto Market As of January 24, 2025, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to dominate the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin is trading at approximately $102,378, reflecting a slight decrease of 1.42% from the previous close, with intraday highs and lows of $104,430 and $102,378, respectively. Ethereum is priced at around $3,218.67, down 0.85%, with intraday highs and lows of $3,262.94 and $3,216.28. The market is influenced by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies, including proposals for a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve and the appointment of crypto advocate Paul Atkins as SEC chair. Analysts predict Bitcoin could surpass $150,000 in 2025, driven by increased institutional adoption and favorable regulations. Ethereum’s growth is supported by network upgrades and the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, with price forecasts suggesting it could reach $6,563 by 2025. Both cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth amid evolving market dynamics and supportive regulatory environments. Lightchain AI Next Big Thing in Blockchain Innovation Lightchain AI is making waves with its innovative approach to blockchain and artificial intelligence integration. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which focus on financial transactions and general-purpose computation, Lightchain AI introduces features tailored for AI-powered decentralized applications. The platform also incorporates a regenerative economic model, where transaction fees are reinvested into ecosystem development and rewards for contributors. This approach fosters a self-sustaining ecosystem that supports long-term growth and innovation. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s developer-centric environment provides tools and incentives to accelerate the creation of decentralized applications. These features, combined with its successful presale, position Lightchain AI as a frontrunner in the blockchain space. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out While Bitcoin and Ethereum are well-established giants, Lightchain AI’s focus on innovation and real-world applications sets it apart. Its $12.8 million presale is a clear indicator of investor confidence in its vision.

This Top Meme Coin Presale to Buy Today Could Be Your Big Shot at 100x Gains!,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bomes-explosive-surge-this-top-meme-coin-presale-to-buy-today-could-be-your-big-shot-at-100x-gains/,"Imagine waking up one day to realize that a $300 investment in a meme coin a year ago is now worth over a thousand dollars. Sounds ridiculous? Well, that’s exactly what happened with early Book of Meme (BOME) investors when this Solana-based memecoin skyrocketed to a $1 billion market cap within 48 hours of its launch. But if you missed that train, don’t worry—history is handing you a second chance with BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the latest and most exciting top meme coin presale to buy today. Meme coins aren’t just internet jokes anymore—they’re turning everyday traders into overnight success stories. The hype around these digital assets has only intensified, and BTFD Coin is leading the next wave. The presale has already raised a staggering $5.78 million, selling over 68 billion tokens to enthusiastic investors. With over 9,800 holders already securing their bags, BTFD Coin is moving fast, currently in its 14th presale stage at just $0.00016 per token. But here’s the kicker: once the presale wraps up, BTFD is set to list at $0.0006, offering a 275% return on investment before it even hits the open market. Think about it: if you put in $30,000 today, your BTFD stash could be worth $112,500 by the time it goes live. And if this coin follows the meteoric path of past meme legends like BOME, we’re talking life-changing money. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Meme Coin Taking Over 2025 BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem packed with rewards, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and an industry-leading referral program designed to reward its most loyal supporters. On January 1, 2025, BTFD launched its P2E game, allowing users to earn real rewards simply by playing. Whether you’re a casual gamer or a hardcore competitor, this adds an extra layer of value to holding BTFD. Meanwhile, staking rewards are through the roof, with an eye-watering 90% APY for those who lock in their tokens early. With such high returns, staking BTFD could become a passive income machine for smart investors. But the real showstopper? BTFD’s viral referral program. BTFD’s Referral Program: Your Ticket to Massive Crypto Rewards If you’ve ever regretted not being an early influencer in a meme coin’s rise, this is your redemption arc. BTFD’s Referral Rewards Program is one of the most lucrative in the industry, and here’s how it works: Get Your Code – Connect your wallet on the BTFD buy page to generate your unique referral link. Share and Earn – Send your code to friends, family, and crypto communities. Double Bonuses – Anyone who buys $50+ in BTFD using your code gets an extra 10% in tokens. Leaderboard Perks – If you land in the top 20 referrers by the end of the month, you’ll score 10% of the total raised amount in BTFD tokens . Track Your Gains – Monitor your referral rewards in real time through your connected wallet. With this system, top referrers could potentially rake in thousands of dollars in free BTFD tokens every month. If you’ve got a network, this is an easy way to stack up your holdings before BTFD even lists. Book of Meme (BOME): The $1 Billion Rocket You Missed If you were around in early 2024 and didn’t buy Book of Meme (BOME), you probably still regret it. This memecoin exploded from obscurity to a $1 billion valuation in just two days, making its early investors filthy rich. Launched in March 2024 by digital artist Darkfarms, BOME set out to preserve meme culture on the blockchain. It caught fire immediately, with Binance, KuCoin, and Gate.io rushing to list it. Within 48 hours, its price skyrocketed, minting a new generation of meme coin millionaires. By October 2024, BOME surged another 88%, reaching $0.021 before retracing to its current price of $0.0033. But let’s be real—most people weren’t early enough to catch those massive gains. If you missed BOME’s launch, you likely watched in horror as others cashed out life-changing profits. That’s exactly why BTFD Coin’s presale is the chance you don’t want to miss. While BOME required timing perfection, BTFD is handing investors a golden ticket on a silver platter. With the presale still open, you can buy at the ground floor price before the masses flood in. Final Call: Will You Ride the BTFD Wave or Miss Out Again? Let’s be honest—regret stings. If you’ve ever wished you jumped into Dogecoin in 2013, Shiba Inu in 2020, or BOME in 2024, this is your moment of redemption. BTFD Coin is the top meme coin presale to buy today , and with its P2E game, staking rewards, and game-changing referral program, it’s got everything needed for a parabolic run. With a $5.78 million presale tally, 68 billion tokens already sold, and an ROI of 275% locked in before launch, the question isn’t whether BTFD will explode—it’s whether you’ll be holding when it does. Don’t be the one reading stories of BTFD millionaires a year from now, kicking yourself for missing out. Sign up now, grab your BTFD tokens, and get ready for the ride of your life!

In recent weeks, the company has started to replicate MicroStrategy's business model of selling overvalued shares into the open market and using the proceeds to accumulate Bitcoins. While MicroStrategy is currently valued at approximately 2x its Bitcoin holdings, KULR Technology's multiple is closer to 9x. Even when assigning a very generous valuation to the company's tiny core business, downside could be north of 40%. Given KULR Technology's massive overvaluation and considering the risks associated with the company's Bitcoin accumulation strategy, I am reiterating my ""Sell"" rating on the shares. Note: I have covered KULR Technology Group, Inc. ( KULR ) or “KULR Technology” previously, so investors should view this as an update to my earlier article on the company. Last month, I initiated coverage of KULR Technology with a "" Sell "" rating due to the tiny, money-losing company trading at an eye-watering valuation of 30x estimated 2025 revenues. In recent months, management's persistent efforts to position KULR Technology as an investment into several of the biggest hype themes in today's market (Space, AI, Defense, Energy Storage, Nuclear, Bitcoin) have attracted hosts of speculative investors and momentum traders. While the company has continued to celebrate its alleged progress in a series of press releases , the recent decision to effectively replicate MicroStrategy's ( MSTR ) business model of financing large-scale Bitcoin purchases by raising additional equity might soon result in the stock price becoming more closely correlated to movements in the world's leading cryptocurrency. KULR Technology also adopted ""BTC Yield"" as a key performance indicator: KULR has introduced “BTC Yield” as a key performance indicator (""KPI"") for its Bitcoin Treasury strategy. This metric evaluates the Company’s ability to increase its bitcoin holdings per share, offering investors a transparent measure of the per share accretive impact of its bitcoin acquisitions. BTC Yield is calculated as the percentage change period-to-period in the ratio of the Company’s bitcoin holdings to its Assumed Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding. This KPI helps assess the effectiveness of KULR’s bitcoin acquisition strategy in driving shareholder value. As of last week, the company had utilized $50 million in cash to acquire 510 bitcoins with a current market value of $52.6 million. KULR last updated on its share count in a SEC-filing on January 17. At that time, total outstanding common shares had increased to 273.6 million, up by almost 30% over the past six weeks alone. On January 24, the company increased its existing At the Market Offering Agreement (""ATM Agreement""), with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC by another $50 million and with 500 million authorized shares, further increases to the ATM Agreement seem to be likely. So far, KULR Technology has increased the original $20 million ATM Agreement three times: Regulatory Filings Until last week, the company had raised $96 million in gross proceeds under the ATM Agreement, of which $50 million had been invested in Bitcoin. Adjusted for commissions and assumed cash burn from operations, I would expect the company's current cash position to be at least $35 million. Using the last disclosed share count, KULR Technology's enterprise value calculates to approximately $468 million, or 26x the company's estimated 2025 revenue. Regulatory Filings / Author's Estimates Perhaps more important, KULR Technology is trading at 9x the market value of its Bitcoin holdings and 5.3x the combined value of its cash and Bitcoin holdings. In comparison, MicroStrategy is currently changing hands at slightly below 2.0x the market value of its Bitcoin holdings, which apparently isn't exactly cheap either. However, the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder looks like a real bargain when compared to tiny KULR Technology. Quite frankly, rather than buying shares of overvalued Bitcoin players like MicroStrategy and particularly KULR Technology, investors with a bullish view of the cryptocurrency should rather consider an investment in ETFs from the likes of IBIT , FBTC , ARKB or HODL which trade close to their net asset value. In addition, with KULR Technology trading at a massive premium to net asset value, there's a huge incentive for the company to facilitate further Bitcoin purchases by selling large amounts of newly-issued shares into the open market. Even assigning a valuation of 10x estimated 2025 revenues for the company's tiny core business and using MicroStrategy's valuation of 2x its Bitcoin holdings would only result in a price target of $1.17: Author's Calculations / Regulatory Filings Given KULR Technology's massive overvaluation and considering the risks associated with the company's Bitcoin accumulation strategy, I am reiterating my "" Sell "" rating on the company's shares. Even under generous valuation assumptions, current downside potential is exceeding 40%. Bottom Line Given KULR Technology's eye-watering valuation, I can't blame management for its efforts to replicate MicroStrategy's business model of selling expensive common shares into the open market and invest the proceeds into additional Bitcoins. However, investors looking for exposure to the world's leading cryptocurrency should rather consider investing in Bitcoin ETFs which tend to trade around net asset value rather than buying overvalued shares of companies like MicroStrategy and particularly KULR Technology. Even when using very generous valuation assumptions, there's still plenty of downside in KULR Technology's common shares. Consequently, I am reiterating my "" Sell "" rating on the company's shares.",MSTR|KULR,EN,0,0,BTC|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-30 03:27:31

ETH is now consolidating losses and might face resistance near the $3,220 zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,120 zone. The price is trading below $3,180 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,220 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another decline if it stays below the $3,200 level. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum price started a fresh decline below the $3,220 and $3,180 levels, like Bitcoin . ETH even declined below the $3,050 level before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $3,021 and the price recently corrected some losses . There was a move above the $3,120 and $3,150 levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,425 wing high to the $3,020 swing low. However, the bears were active below the $3,200 resistance. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,220 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,180 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,200 level and the trend line. The main resistance is now forming near $3,220 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,425 wing high to the $3,020 swing low. A clear move above the $3,220 resistance might send the price toward the $3,320 resistance. An upside break above the $3,320 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,200 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,0750 level. The first major support sits near the $3,050. A clear move below the $3,050 support might push the price toward the $3,020 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,000 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,950. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

BTC now sits just above $101,000 and is up ~7% year to date. Ether's closing price dropped over 7% this week to its lowest level in over two months. ETH is currently down ~8% year to date. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and has continued that momentum into 2025. XRP is currently up ~32% year to date. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price hit an all-time high last week but has since fallen nearly 5%. BTC now sits just above $101,000 and is up ~7% year to date. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price dropped over 7% this week to its lowest level in over two months. ETH is currently down ~8% year to date. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and has continued that momentum into 2025. XRP is currently up ~32% year to date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead, just edging out XRP. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

Powell was asked whether speculation in this unregulated asset class could harm individuals’ financial well-being, especially in contrast to the broader concerns about the financial system. Powell said that the Federal Reserve’s primary role is to oversee how banks interact with cryptocurrencies. He noted that banks can serve cryptocurrency customers as long as they understand and manage the associated risks, ensuring their operations remain safe and sound. Many banks under the Federal Reserve’s supervision are already engaging with crypto in a secure manner. However, Powell pointed out that banks face higher thresholds when it comes to crypto activities due to the relatively new nature of digital assets. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they understand and can manage the risks. And it’s safe and sound, as a good number of our banks that we regulate and supervise do that. The threshold has been a little higher for banks engaging in crypto activities. And that’s because they’re so new,” he explained. He explained that if a bank decides to offer crypto services, it must ensure the activity is fully safe, as it operates under the federal safety net, including deposit insurance. The Fed’s cautious approach aims to prevent risks to the broader financial system while supporting innovation. Powell reiterated that the Fed is not opposed to cryptocurrency innovation, but it seeks to prevent overly cautious regulations from unduly disrupting legitimate business activities.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-30 03:46:01

While Solana’s strong rally and potential for a 200% surge captivate investors, PropiChain , a rising AI-driven low-cap altcoin, is gaining attention with its projected 50,000% market growth. PropiChain’s innovative AI and blockchain features position it as a standout competitor, challenging Solana’s dominance. Investors are closely watching PropiChain’s rapid ascent, which is overshadowing Solana’s 200%. Here is a closer look at what is driving PropiChain’s numbers. What is Driving Solana’s 200% Rally? Solana’s recent price surge has captured market attention, with several factors contributing to its upward trajectory. The U.S. political shift under Donald Trump’s administration has created anticipation for crypto-friendly regulations. Analysts speculate that Solana ETFs could gain approval, further boosting investor sentiment. Solana’s Firedancer project, designed to achieve one million transactions per second, enhances scalability and efficiency. This technological innovation strengthens Solana’s position as a blockchain leader. Additionally, Bitcoin’s surge past $100,000 has sparked broader market optimism, propelling Solana and other altcoins into the spotlight. PropiChain’s 50,000% Gains Overshadows Solana PropiChain is emerging as a compelling alternative to Solana, capturing investor interest with its AI platform. While Solana faces market fluctuations, PropiChain integrates AI and blockchain to transform the $300 trillion real estate market with practical applications. PropiChain integrates NFTs and Real-World Assets (RWA) to revolutionize real estate investments. By tokenizing physical properties into NFTs, PropiChain enables fractional ownership, making high-value assets accessible to a broader audience starting as low as $100. Each NFT represents a share in a property, allowing investors to diversify portfolios with minimal capital. This innovative approach enhances liquidity in the $300 trillion real estate market by addressing inefficiencies in traditional systems. PropiChain’s focus on RWAs positions it as a practical low-cap altcoin for investors seeking tangible, asset-backed opportunities with growth potential. This innovation democratizes access to high-value properties, increasing liquidity and lowering entry barriers. Investors seeking utility beyond speculative trends are turning to PropiChain for solutions. PropiChain’s AI optimizes transactions through automation and predictive analytics. Investors can rely on virtual assistants and chatbots for real-time support, helping them easily make informed decisions. These tools streamline complex processes, ensuring efficiency and precision, which cements PropiChain’s position as a leader in AI-powered blockchain technology. Its metaverse integration goes further by offering virtual property tours and 3D visualizations. Investors can explore properties in detail without needing physical visits, removing geographical barriers. Beyond visualization, the metaverse platform facilitates direct interactions between buyers, sellers, and agents, creating a seamless and immersive transaction experience. PropiChain’s AI analytics provide investors with insights into market trends, property values, and risk factors, enabling data-driven investment strategies. Combined with its metaverse tools, PropiChain is a comprehensive platform for global real estate transactions. By blending AI and the metaverse, PropiChain stands out as an innovative low cap altcoin reshaping property investment. With a security audit by BlockAudit , a security blockchain firm, PropiChain delivers reliability and innovation. Its CoinMarketCap listing further boosts investor confidence in its security and reliability. As Solana’s volatility persists, this low-cap altcoin stands out for its utility and potential market stability. Invest in PropiChain Presale for Massive Gains PropiChain’s presale is gaining significant traction. Phase 1 raised over $1.3 million, and Phase 2 has already brought in over $1 million from eager investors. With limited token supply and strategic positioning, demand for PropiChain tokens continues to grow.

Web3Bay is becoming more than just a token; it’s a gateway to the future of decentralized trading platforms. Ready to join? What’s Driving Web3Bay’s Presale to $1M? Web3Bay’s presale is shining brightly in the crypto market. As projects like TRON and Chainlink remain in the spotlight, Web3Bay is attracting its own audience by merging practicality, easy access, and promising financial returns. Having collected over $970,000 already, the presale provides an appealing opportunity for those looking to engage with a revolutionary decentralized e-commerce network. At the heart of this excitement is the Web3Bay token, 3BAY, currently priced at $0.004562625 in its fourth phase. With an expected launch price of $0.1959, early participants could achieve a remarkable 6,430% ROI. But it’s not all about the numbers. Web3Bay’s blueprint for a blockchain-driven e-commerce system, incorporating NFTs and decentralized governance, is driving community participation. This is a crypto presale with genuine, practical uses, not mere speculation. Web3Bay stands out for its accessibility and focus on user needs.

If you’re looking to invest in an innovative presale with a clear vision, Web3Bay is a project to consider before it’s too late. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis: Signs of Consistent Growth Chainlink is increasingly becoming a key player in the decentralized oracle space. The latest Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis shows steady growth, with LINK now trading at $24.64. This increase in value corresponds to broader adoption driven by the launch of CCIP 1.5 on the mainnet. This update improves secure communication across chains for decentralized apps, solidifying Chainlink’s crucial role in blockchain networks. Apart from technological advancements, Chainlink’s strategic partnerships are also gaining attention. Its collaborations with Ripple for RLUSD stablecoin pricing and BTguru to promote tokenized securities in Turkey illustrate its practical impact.

For those considering presale opportunities like Web3Bay or looking into established networks, Chainlink remains a fundamental element of blockchain innovation. TRON Whale Accumulation Signifies Rising Interest TRON (TRX) is capturing the attention of significant investors, with Tron Whale Accumulation now over $7.5 million.

These advancements are in line with the network’s impressive daily transfer volume of $3.6 trillion, indicating increased activity and wider adoption. From a technical standpoint, analysts predict a possible 50% surge in TRX value if it overcomes the $0.26 resistance level, aiming for $0.37. This potential increase makes TRON an appealing choice for those looking to diversify with established assets like Chainlink and promising crypto presale projects such as Web3Bay. As TRON continues to enhance its ecosystem, its growing allure among whales and casual investors suggests a strong belief in its long-term worth. Key Insights Chainlink (LINK) continues to excel with ongoing utility enhancements and partnerships, while Tron Whale Accumulation indicates increased faith in its network’s progress.

Trump Buys SUI (TRUMPSUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys SUI launched with over $29,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Buys SUI by entering its contract address (CA) – 7chY3Yw9cArR4CGQQ2N6mciszZvWB3rW6WoBNTfwyitu – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|SUI|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-30 04:07:00

SEC Closed-Door Meeting Stirs Ripple Case Rumors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A closed-door meeting of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 30 has sparked new speculation about the future of the ongoing Ripple case. This marks the fifth such meeting of the year, and it has grabbed the attention of the XRP community, which is hopeful for potential developments regarding the lawsuit. The meeting, scheduled in advance and disclosed via a Sunshine Act notice on the SEC’s website, will feature SEC acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce. Uyeda’s leadership is drawing particular attention, as he is known for his critical stance on using enforcement actions to regulate cryptocurrency. The subject matter of the closed meeting will consist of the following topics: Institution and settlement of injunctive actions; Institution and settlement of administrative proceedings; Resolution of litigation claims; and Other matters relating to examinations and enforcement proceedings. As he continues serving as interim chair, awaiting confirmation from the U.S. Senate for a permanent successor, many believe his leadership may favor clarity and fairness for the crypto industry. Ripple’s Potential Breakthrough Adding to the anticipation is the recent development that the SEC has reportedly removed all references to Ripple from its litigation releases section on its website. This has led to speculation that the lawsuit involving Ripple may be nearing its end. Although this change is not conclusive proof that the case is over, it has certainly fueled excitement within the XRP community. The situation remains fluid, and while there is no official confirmation, the XRP community is hopeful that this is a sign of progress. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, recently spoke about the dangers of crypto maximalism, advocating for a more inclusive approach to the industry.

As altcoin season draws closer, the next couple of weeks could mark the final chance to accumulate high-potential safety net assets like XRP at discounted prices before momentum inevitably shifts upward and newer investors start becoming exit liquidity later this year. For those aiming to muster greater gains beyond 10x, focusing on projects with strong utility and explosive hype potential is essential. The gaming sector, poised for a major surge in 2025, presents a lucrative avenue for investors, with standout projects like Rollblock leading the charge. With its cutting-edge approach to GameFi, Rollblock is positioned to deliver 25-100x returns as soon as Q2, making it one of the most compelling opportunities today. Here’s The Rundown On RBLK’s Bullish Potential Rollblock is redefining GameFi with a forward-thinking approach to blockchain-powered gaming. With a diverse catalog of over 7,000 games, spanning classic favorites like blackjack and poker to blockchain-exclusive experiences, the platform delivers entertainment at an unprecedented scale. The recent launch of sports betting has added another layer of engagement, while a packed 2025 roadmap is set to introduce even more exciting titles, solidifying Rollblock’s leadership in the space. At the core of Rollblock’s ecosystem is the RBLK token, designed for sustainable growth and community rewards. Up to 30% of the platform’s weekly profits are allocated for token buybacks, with 60% permanently burned to reduce supply.

Audited by SolidProof and backed by an Anjouan Gaming license, the platform adheres to strict regulatory requirements. With advanced encryption and AI-powered security features in place, Rollblock ensures a safe and reliable environment for both users and investors, setting a new standard in the GambleFi sector. Bullish Factors Weigh In Favour Of Ripples’s XRP Despite Some Expedited Controversy Ripple (XRP) is maintaining relative stability during a wider market downturn, declining by 3% on the daily and weekly charts as institutional accumulation intensifies in the background. Over a billion XRP tokens have been purchased in just ten days, signaling renewed confidence in Ripple’s ecosystem and strong enthusiasm for XRP amongst retail investors and the “XRP army”. Speculation about an XRP spot ETF continues to build, with former Ripple executive Sean McBride hinting at major upcoming announcements that could reshape XRP’s market outlook. Meanwhile, regulatory clarity appears to be on the horizon as the SEC undergoes a leadership shift under the pro-crypto Trump administration, with Paul Atkins replacing Gary Gensler as Chair. Additionally, the launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin further cements XRP’s growing role in cross-border finance, positioning it as a potential leader in the next wave of blockchain adoption. Despite its positive trajectory, XRP remains a point of contention in the crypto space, often criticized by Bitcoin maximalists for its perceived centralization. The debate has escalated as Ripple pushes for inclusion in a potential US digital asset stockpile, challenging Bitcoin’s dominance as the preferred institutional crypto asset. Regardless, for investors seeking minimal 5-10x returns from here, XRP may present an ideal opportunity today. Don’t Miss This Chance To Get Into Rollblock Early!

Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the benchmark for cryptocurrency investments, delivering consistent value and stability over the years. However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly stealing the spotlight, with analysts projecting a potential 50,000% breakout. This groundbreaking token has already proven its worth, raising $1 million in just minutes during its presale. With momentum building and investor interest surging, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is positioning itself as the most promising crypto of 2025. What’s Driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Momentum? Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes. This strong presale performance demonstrates overwhelming investor confidence, rivaling early excitement around XRP and SOL. Exclusive Availability Unlike XRP and SOLANA, which are widely available on major exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand and ensures that early adopters stand to gain the most from its projected breakout. Growing Investor Confidence With predictions of a 50,000% return, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has become a magnet for investors seeking exponential growth. Its strong performance and limited supply are fueling speculation that it could redefine the crypto market. How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN .

According to a January 27 statement from the research university, his focus will now shift to artificial intelligence (AI), fintech, finance, and public policy. Gensler’s New Role “I am honored to return to MIT, whose faculty, staff, and students have long been at the cutting edge of research and technology,” Gensler said following his appointment. He added that he looks forward to collaborating with scholars at the institution to drive innovation and create a better future through AI, finance, and tech. Before leading the SEC, Gensler worked at Goldman Sachs and later became a professor at MIT, where he studied the impact of AI on financial systems and published research on the risks it could pose to global finance. In his new role, the 67-year-old will co-direct the FinTech AI @CSAIL initiative alongside Professor Andrew W. Lo. This program connects companies with MIT researchers to explore AI’s role in the financial industry. Additionally, the academic will collaborate with Nobel laureate Simon Johnson to teach a course on economic topics billed as being “of great importance to the global economy.” While Gensler’s new position lacks the regulatory authority he held as the financial watchdog’s head, it is expected to be influential. MIT maintains strong partnerships with U.S. tech firms and policymakers, potentially allowing him to continue shaping discussions around finance, AI, and crypto regulations in an academic capacity. Criticism and Concern However, the ex-chair’s return to the institution has not been well received by all. Devin Walsh, executive director and co-founder of the Uniswap Foundation, condemned the decision, stating she was “incredibly embarrassed and disappointed” by the school’s rehiring of Gensler. She highlighted that her introduction to crypto happened through MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative (mitDCI), suggesting that any student of his would be wasting their time, tuition, and energy if they hoped to learn about and support new and innovative technologies. During his tenure at the SEC, Gensler shaped crypto policy through a regulation-by-enforcement approach. Under his leadership, the agency initiated over 125 enforcement actions against crypto firms, classifying many cryptocurrencies, save for Bitcoin and Ethereum , as securities and thus falling under the regulator’s purview. His actions received much criticism from the industry, with some saying that they stifled innovation and created regulatory uncertainty. However, one of the bright lights of his reign was the approval last year of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum.

According to a Bloomberg report , information from sources participating in the discussions indicates the Japanese firm plans to make an investment between $15 billion and $25 billion. Details about the investment are at the initial stage and may not go through. OpenAI requires additional data centers immediately to improve its AI capabilities during increased competition. Chinese firm DeepSeek, among other emerging competitors, captured market share by providing equivalent AI capabilities with reduced expenses. At present, OpenAI depends extensively on Microsoft for its cloud computing infrastructure. Led by Masayoshi Son, SoftBank seeks an advantageous moment to enter the AI hardware business. SoftBank shares decreased by 1% in Tokyo’s market on Thursday Sam Altman of OpenAI introduced himself to SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son in 2019 when Son proposed a $1 billion investment that subsequently collapsed. The companies grew closer over their economic worries about semiconductor shortages which threaten AI development. The Vision Fund committed $500 million to OpenAI and introduced a $1.5 billion executive share buyback offer last month. The potential investment news from SoftBank provided a boost to Asian chip stocks, including Advantest Corp., but SoftBank shares decreased by 1% in Tokyo’s market on Thursday. While semiconductor-related stocks gained momentum from the news, Takehiko Masuzawa, head of equity trading at Phillip Securities Japan predicts “SoftBank, which is putting up the money, isn’t going to see the same buying momentum”.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/entrepreneur-bet-on-xrp-pays-off-one-year-later-heres-how/,"Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, recently shared a clip from an old interview he and Vandell Aljarrah conducted with entrepreneur Gary Cardone. In his post, Versan highlighted Cardone’s perspective on Ripple and XRP, emphasizing how his calculated investment decision aligns with XRP’s growing use case in global payments. A year ago, we interviewed Gary Cardone about Ripple. He shared that he bought XRP as an option call, betting that global institutions and banks managing the world’s capital would adopt #XRP for their payment rails. Guess what? His bet paid off. The use case speaks for itself. pic.twitter.com/nILuubWbtr — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) January 28, 2025 Cardone’s Strategic View on XRP During the interview, Gary Cardone admitted to having limited knowledge of Ripple and XRP but revealed a pragmatic approach to his investment. “I literally bought XRP as a call option that the institutional payment system will want to use rails they’re familiar with, and that that could be a benefit,” he stated. Cardone explained that his XRP holdings are not significant enough to impact him financially but represent a calculated bet on adopting Ripple’s technology by major financial institutions. This perspective highlights how investors with minimal exposure to XRP still recognize its potential in transforming global payment infrastructures. Cardone’s outlook reflects a broader belief that Ripple’s solutions could appeal to institutions already managing vast amounts of capital. Ripple’s Expanding Role in Payment Systems Ripple’s payment protocol continues to gain traction worldwide, with integrations aimed at streamlining the movement of digital value. According to Versan, Ripple’s technology is being adopted by payment providers, central banks, and financial institutions to enhance cross-border transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 “We believe it’s going to play a big role in where all of this is going,” Versan noted in the interview, highlighting the growing relevance of Ripple’s solutions in addressing inefficiencies in the global financial ecosystem. The adoption of XRP as a bridge currency for these payment rails further reinforces its utility, demonstrating how blockchain technology can reduce costs and improve transaction speeds across borders. A Reflection on Cardone’s Bet Aljarrah stated in his post, “Guess what? His bet paid off. The use case speaks for itself,” highlighting XRP’s increasing adoption as validation of Cardone’s calculated decision. Over the past year, Ripple has strengthened its partnerships with financial institutions, showcasing the practical application of its payment protocol. The digital asset has also grown significantly, trading at $3.13, surging 495% from its price last year. As XRP continues to gain traction, its utility as a bridge currency and role in transforming the financial landscape becomes increasingly evident. This will be reflected in the asset’s price, as many experts have predicted massive price surges in the immediate future.

DOGE is now rising and might aim for more gains above $0.350. DOGE price started a decent increase above the $0.315 and $0.320 levels. The price is trading near the $0.3320 level and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $0.330 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The price could start another increase if it clears the $0.340 and $0.3480 resistance levels. Dogecoin Price Aims Higher Dogecoin price started a fresh decline from the $0.3850 resistance zone, unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum . DOGE dipped below the $0.3500 and $0.3350 support levels. It even spiked below $0.320. A low was formed at $0.3052 and the price is now rising above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3599 swing high to the $0.3052 low. There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $0.330 on the hourly chart of the DOGE/USD pair.

Immediate resistance on the upside is near the $0.3390 level and 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.3599 swing high to the $0.3052 low. The first major resistance for the bulls could be near the $0.3480 level. The next major resistance is near the $0.3550 level. A close above the $0.3550 resistance might send the price toward the $0.3660 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.3880 level. The next major stop for the bulls might be $0.40. Another Decline In DOGE? If DOGE’s price fails to climb above the $0.340 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.3250 level. The next major support is near the $0.3150 level. The main support sits at $0.3150. If there is a downside break below the $0.3150 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.3020 level or even $0.300 in the near term.

The following altcoins are being tipped to lead the way, as Rollblock ($RBLK), Ethereum, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Solana are all showing signs of phenomenal potential in the coming months. These tokens deserve an allocation in any well-balanced crypto portfolio. Here’s why Rollblock in particular is experiencing massive growth that could cause its token price to 50x this year. Rollblock ($RBLK) Ready To Change The Game In 2025 Rollblock ($ RBLK ) is a brand-new Web3 take on traditional gaming platforms that is entering a period of rapid growth. The price of $RBLK recently hit a new high of $0.052 as this revolutionary DeFi project remained unfazed by the recent crypto dip. This has come about due to the insatiable demand for $RBLK among both retail and institutional investors. The $RBLK presale has raised more than $9.7 million since its inception as it recently smashed into stage 10 of its ICO token launch. Word has spread about the revolutionary blockchain-backed approach that Rollblock offers. Since all transactions are immortalized onto the steadfast Ethereum blockchain, there can be no risk of the house manipulating any bids to their advantage. Rollblock gamers are spoiled for choice with a range of more than 7,000 classic games, from Monopoly to slot machines and poker. A sports prediction league has also gone over incredibly well with the community and added yet another lucrative revenue stream. $RBLK holders also benefit from its bullish deflationary supply. Each week, up to 30% of the platform’s profits are used to purchase $RBLK on decentralized exchanges. 60% of these tokens are immediately destroyed, which potentially removes millions of tokens from the overhanging supply each week. The remaining tokens fund a generous staking reward scheme through which committed community members can earn an attractive APY of up to 30%. $RBLK supply will continue to shrink as demand ramps up in 2025. In December alone, Rollblock detected a 600% spike in new registrations , meaning that Rollblock is one of the fastest-growing projects in the gaming space. Ethereum ($ETH) DeFi Activity On The Rise Ethereum has crashed by nearly 6% this week and is attempting to find support at $3,100 at the current time. The past month has seen a 7% drop, as trading volume has also fallen on the Ethereum chain. Just today this fell by 13% as just $20.3 billion of Ethereum changed hands in the last 24 hours. The Ethereum DeFi ecosystem is coming back to life after it was revealed that the network saw its supply of stablecoins increase by over $2 billion. This reveals a rising demand for Ethereum services, including staking and lending on-chain. Ethereum is the leading provider of DeFi services and will likely remain so for the remainder of this cycle. This uptick in demand could send the price of ETH upward of $4k in the coming weeks. Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Rolls Out Upgrade To Shib.io Shiba Inu has tumbled this week along with the rest of the highly volatile meme coin market. Shiba Inu’s price fell by 11% in the last seven days to reach $0.000018. This remains the second largest meme coin in the space behind Dogecoin. Recently developers rolled out a swap and bridge protocol on the Shib.io platform. This is the latest update of the Shiba Inu OS operating system and is set to improve the UI for users of Shiba Inu. This follows hot on the heels of the release of the TREAT airdrop for $SHIB holders. Clearly there is much innovation on this meme chain and Shiba Inu could easily become a top 10 coin in the coming months. Pepe ($PEPE) Whales Spook Holders Pepe’s value has declined by 2.3% in the last 24 hours as its price fell to $0.0000123. This has sent Pepe down to 28th position in the CoinMarketCap top crypto index and follows Pepe’s recent trend. This meme is down by more than 20% in a month. Pepe has been more volatile than usual recently as the market was spooked by the movement of over 1.1 trillion Pepe tokens, which were sent to Binance in a single transaction. Pepe’s concentration of large holders is particularly high, meaning that whales have the ability to move the market with their moves. Once the selling stops, then Pepe should see a decent bounce and could well regain the important $0.000017 price point. Solana ($SOL) Trumps Its Rivals With Presidential Nod Solana has fallen by 11% in the last week, having faced significant selling pressure after its recent sprint to all-time highs. Solana is currently trading at $227, which still represents a 21% gain on the monthly time frame. Much of Solana’s recent rally was attributed to the Trump effect, as the incoming president used the Solana chain to launch his very own meme coin last week. Trump’s coin was a huge vindication for Solana, which now enjoys the presidential stamp of approval. Solana is likely to remain the chain of choice for PoliFi tokens, as politicians of all parties are now likely to follow suit and launch a token. Many analysts are confident that Solana could see a four-figure price tag this cycle. Rollblock Will Deliver Life-Changing Gains This Year Heading into 2025 and what is likely to be the most parabolic stage in the crypto cycle, investors should consider allocating to Ethereum, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Solana before the coming blow-off top. However, Rollblock ($RBLK) stands out as a golden opportunity thanks to its rapidly rising adoption and comparatively smaller size, which will enable it to grow many multiples from its current bargain-bin valuation. Experts have recently doubled down on their 50x price predictions for $RBLK, as many now see the $1 level as a lock.

Musk Buys Solana (MUSKSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Buys Solana by entering its contract address (CA) – HZgXdFhQK1KTn8wM6hfRPtyGuKskETTzWM31qAdXJVRV – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|DOGE|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-30 05:28:00

As long as XRP holds above the $3levels, the current bullish scenario remains plausible, with the expectation of moving towards the upside. While the primary scenario is bullish, there is a possibility that the market could still be in a corrective phase. In the short term, XRP has shown a strong reaction to support and is currently in a pullback phase. After a 20% move up from a support area, the price has encountered a minor pullback. It is important to monitor the micro-level support and the potential for the price to continue its upward trajectory. Micro Support Levels: $2.76 – $2.97: These are the immediate support levels for the current pullback. XRP should ideally not break below $2.76 in the short term to maintain the bullish outlook. If the price holds within this range and forms a higher low, it will signal a continuation of the bullish trend. Upside Price Targets: Breakout and Bullish Continuation Should the pullback hold and the price find support above the $2.76 level, the price could see a potential breakout to the upside. The following price targets are critical for confirming the continuation of the bullish trend: Resistance and Target Levels: $3.40: A breakout above this level would be a key signal for further upside movement. This level has already proven to be a significant resistance point in recent price action. $3.42: This level represents the 138% retracement of the previous wave and acts as a crucial resistance point. $4.20: The next Fibonacci resistance level above $3.40. A successful breakout above $3.40 would likely bring XRP to test this level. $5.00: The ultimate upside target for XRP, based on larger Fibonacci extensions.

The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has announced its expansion into financial services and cryptocurrency under the brand Truth.Fi, offering managed accounts, ETFs, and digital asset services. At the same time, President Donald Trump’s official meme coin, TRUMP, is now accepted for purchases of branded merchandise, marking a new step in integrating crypto into his business ecosystem. These moves show the administration’s growing embrace of digital assets, a notable shift from Trump’s earlier skepticism toward cryptocurrencies. However, they have also raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given the Trump family’s significant holdings in the sector. Trump Expands Crypto Footprint: Official Meme Coin TRUMP Now Accepted for Merchandise In a move that further integrates cryptocurrency into his business ventures, US President Donald Trump has tied his official meme coin, Official Trump (TRUMP), to a range of merchandise, allowing holders to purchase sneakers, watches, and fragrances using the token. This shift not only strengthens Trump’s crypto presence but also marks a stark contrast to his earlier stance, when he dismissed crypto as being “based on thin air.” According to a Jan. 29 Bloomberg report, three websites —GetTrumpSneakers.com, GetTrumpWatches.com, and GetTrumpFragrances.com—now accept payments in TRUMP and Bitcoin (BTC). These platforms, reportedly owned by CIC Ventures LLC, a Trump-linked company, represent a significant push by the 47th president into digital assets. The Trump meme coin (TRUMP) initially emerged as a speculative asset, primarily traded as a political statement or a show of support. However, by incorporating direct utility—enabling TRUMP holders to buy branded products—President Trump is taking a step further into the crypto-commerce sector. Blockchain data from Solscan indicates that TRUMP currently has around 700,000 holders, though reports suggest that 80% of the total supply remains in the hands of Trump Organization affiliates. This level of control over a major cryptocurrency asset raises questions about potential market influence and financial implications. Trump’s involvement in digital assets extends beyond meme coins. His Web3 initiatives date back to 2022, when he released a series of non-fungible token (NFT) collections, capitalizing on blockchain-based collectibles. Since then, his ventures have grown significantly. Most notably, the Trump family has been linked to World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that has been on a cryptocurrency buying spree in recent months. Additionally, First Lady Melania Trump has debuted her own meme coin, MELANIA, further signaling the family’s strategic commitment to digital assets. Trump’s crypto-friendly stance appears to be resonating with the digital asset community. He has already taken several steps to legitimize and support the crypto industry, including: Pardoning Ross Ulbricht, the creator of Silk Road, the infamous dark net marketplace. Launching a working group to explore the feasibility of a national digital asset reserve. Directing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to form a dedicated crypto task force, a shift away from the enforcement-heavy approach seen during the Biden administration. The shift marks a profound change in federal regulatory policy toward crypto assets, positioning Trump as the first US president to actively promote and integrate cryptocurrency into the mainstream economy. Despite the enthusiasm from the crypto sector, critics warn that Trump’s deepening involvement in digital assets could present a serious conflict of interest. Danielle Brian, head of the watchdog group Project On Government Oversight, voiced concerns over the president’s financial entanglement with the industry. Watchdogs have also highlighted that the Trump family’s control over the majority of TRUMP’s supply raises ethical concerns about potential price manipulation or policy decisions that could benefit their personal holdings. Crypto’s Growing Political Influence Trump’s embrace of cryptocurrency comes at a time when digital assets are playing an increasingly significant role in US politics. With the industry growing in influence, both Democrats and Republicans are beginning to adopt clearer positions on regulation, taxation, and institutional adoption of blockchain technology. Earlier this month, Senator Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers called for an investigation into Trump’s crypto-related financial dealings, further intensifying the scrutiny on how digital assets intersect with politics and governance. With meme coins, NFTs, DeFi, and now a crypto-friendly regulatory push, Trump’s administration is undeniably steering the US towards a new digital asset economy. However, how crypto regulation under Trump will unfold remains to be seen. Will his administration continue to encourage crypto adoption, or will concerns over conflicts of interest and centralization lead to increased oversight? One thing is certain—crypto is no longer a niche market; it’s a mainstream economic and political force. Trump Media and Technology Group Expands Into Crypto and Finance With Truth.Fi In related news, the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), a media conglomerate partially owned by US President Trump , has officially announced its expansion into financial services and cryptocurrency under the brand Truth.Fi. The move signals a growing commitment by Trump and his inner circle to the digital asset industry and aligns with the administration’s broader push to reshape financial regulations around crypto. According to the Jan. 29 announcement , Truth.Fi will provide: Separately managed accounts in partnership with Charles Schwab, Customized exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tailored for investors, and Cryptocurrency services integrated into the platform. This expansion marks another bold step in Trump’s post-presidential business empire, further embedding digital assets within the economic landscape of his presidency. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes, who also serves as chairman of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, framed the expansion as a mission to protect Americans from financial censorship and “debanking.” The move comes amid increased government scrutiny over digital assets, as well as growing concerns about financial exclusion in the traditional banking sector. By positioning Truth.Fi as an alternative, TMTG appears to be capitalizing on Trump’s pro-crypto stance while challenging Big Tech and centralized financial institutions. The launch of Truth.Fi follows months of speculation that Trump-linked enterprises would enter the cryptocurrency space. In September 2024, President Trump unveiled World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, which has since become a major crypto investor. A $394 Million Crypto War Chest According to Arkham Intelligence , World Liberty Financial has already accumulated over $394 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including: 62,000 ETH (~$3,151 per ETH) 646 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) (~$101,928 per WBTC) 19,000 Lido Staked Ether (stETH) (~$3,147 per stETH) On Jan. 20—the day of Trump’s second inauguration—World Liberty Financial purchased over $100 million in ETH and WBTC, doubling down on its crypto holdings. The Trump family's deepening ties to Ethereum have not gone unnoticed. The DeFi platform has also acquired Trump-related Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains, such as: barrontrump.eth erictrump.eth trumpcoin.eth worldliberty.eth These acquisitions have sparked speculation that Trump and his family may eventually launch new business ventures on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin commented on the Trump family's strategic focus on ETH, suggesting they could be building Ethereum-based applications. However, no official announcements have been made about specific Ethereum-based projects from the Trump family. Trump's deepening involvement in cryptocurrency, financial services, and decentralized finance has sparked a range of reactions across the political and financial sectors. For crypto enthusiasts, Trump’s push into digital assets and blockchain technology represents a pivotal moment for the industry. Under his administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shifted away from enforcement-driven regulation, forming a dedicated crypto task force to create a comprehensive regulatory framework. For critics, Trump’s expanding financial empire presents conflict of interest concerns. With Truth.Fi offering crypto services and Trump-affiliated businesses holding significant stakes in major digital assets, some watchdog groups are raising alarms over potential policy influence. Despite the controversy, Trump’s continued embrace of digital assets has resonated with a large base of crypto investors and entrepreneurs. With Truth.Fi and World Liberty Financial now fully operational, it’s evident that Trump is positioning cryptocurrency at the center of his economic strategy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ETH|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-30 05:30:00

Tesla, one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders, has reported a massive $600 million gain on its holdings in Q4 2024, thanks to a new accounting rule that allows firms to reflect the market value of their crypto assets. Tesla’s Bitcoin Value Surges Tesla’s financial report for Q4 2024, released on Jan. 29, shows that its Bitcoin holdings are now worth over $1 billion. This is a major jump from the previously recorded $184 million. The company currently holds 9,720 BTC, according to Bitcoin Treasuries . Bitcoin Holdings by Category: Who Holds What? Tesla first bought Bitcoin in 2021, accumulating 42,902 BTC before selling 75% of its holdings in 2022 for $936 million. Other companies, such as Semler Scientific, Genius Group, and Rumble, have adopted Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategy. However, MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 471,000 BTC worth around $48 billion. Now let’s dive into the different categories. Bitcoin’s 21 million total supply , around 1.34 million BTC is held by ETFs, ETFs hold the largest share, followed by governments, public companies, and Private firms, along with BTC mining companies and DeFi platforms. Bitcoin Holdings by Category Source : Bitcoin Treasuries New Rule Changes How Bitcoin Is Recorded However this new rule by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), introduced in December 2023, now allows companies to report the market value of their crypto holdings. Before this, firms had to record losses if Bitcoin’s price dropped but couldn’t recognize gains unless they sold the asset. This change provides a more accurate picture of companies’ financial positions and has significantly benefited Tesla. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Senator Lummis Urges US Action as Czech Republic Moves to Adopt Bitcoin Reserve , Tesla’s Q4 Earnings Fall Short Despite the Bitcoin boost, Tesla’s total Q4 revenue came in at $25.71 billion, a 2% increase from last year but below analyst expectations of $27.22 billion. The company also reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.73, slightly missing the projected $0.76. Operating expenses rose to $2.59 billion, marking a 9% increase from the previous quarter. After the earnings release, Tesla’s stock (TSLA) dropped by 2.26%. However, after-hours trading saw a rebound of 4.44%, bringing the stock to $406.36. Over the past year, Tesla’s share price has surged by 103.79%, reaching an all-time high of $479 in December. This massive accumulation by companies is a sign of growing interest in the asset which created a global interest in adding Bitcoin to their mainstream finance to support their economy. Moreover, many US regions have already passed Bitcoin Strategic Reserve plans like Utah and Arizona. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The narrative, however, differs in the crypto market, where such selling indicates bullishness, according to analysts observing historical trends in the supply held by long-term investors or wallets holding coins for at least 155 days or over five months. ""Based on our analysis, sharp declines in long-term holder supply (purple line) have frequently coincided with strong bitcoin rallies (white line), as seen in Q1 and Q4 of 2024. As long as long-term holders continue reducing their balances, Bitcoin remains at risk of a short squeeze to the upside,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research , said in a report shared with CoinDesk. The total supply held by these wallets has dropped to roughly 13 million BTC. According to analytics firm Glassnode, over 1 million BTC have changed hands during the recent price rise above $100,000 as short-term traders snapped up the long-term holder distribution. ""During the recent rally above $100K, 1.1M BTC have transferred from long-term to short-term holders, representing an impressive inflow of demand to absorb this supply at prices above $90K,"" Glassnode said in its weekly report. Note, however, that the pace at which long-term holders are selling has slowed. This slowdown is evident from the monthly rate of change in the long-term to short-term holder supply ratio. It's no longer as harmful as it was earlier this month, indicating a more measured approach to selling by long-term holders. Exchange balance slides The number of BTC held in wallets tied to centralized exchanges has declined to 2.7 million BTC from over three million about six months ago, according to Glassnode. The exodus of BTC from exchanges, which results in reduced availability of coins for quick sales, is widely viewed as a bullish indicator. The dynamics, however, have changed since the debut of spot ETFs in the U.S. a year ago. ""While many interpret this as a form of supply shock caused by a mass of coins being withdrawn by individual investors—potentially creating upward price pressure—we believe the majority of this decline stems from coins reshuffling into ETF wallets managed by custodians like Coinbase,"" Glassnode said. In other words, these coins have ended up in an ETF, an alternative investment vehicle that is liquid or active and can be bought and sold just as quickly as actual coins. Per Glassnode, the exchange balance adjusted for coins that have been moved to alternative vehicles is over 3 million BTC.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Blockchain,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-30 05:57:32

The milestone comes amid growing investor interest and an evolving crypto landscape shaped by technological advancements and market dynamics. Bitcoin ($BTC) recently experienced a dip to a weekly low of $100,768 following Donald Trump’s return to office, with no mention of cryptocurrency in his opening remarks. However, it has since recovered to $104,000 at the time of writing. Despite this initial market reaction, analysts remain optimistic, projecting that Trump’s second term could pave the way for a new “golden era” of cryptocurrency growth. No-one actually listened to what Trump said. Instead they’re all tweeting “Trump doesn’t know much about Trump coin” when: > He acknowledges it > Knows he launched it > Says 7 billion is peanuts Watch $TRUMP remain very bullish imo. pic.twitter.com/Ltr7FNzUJt — hoeem (@crypthoem) January 21, 2025 Amid these changes, having a state-of-the-art crypto wallet is more essential than ever, and Best Wallet is quickly emerging as a top choice for investors.

Furthermore, industry leaders like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Senator Cynthia Lummis continue to advocate for the development of a US-based Bitcoin reserve, which could drive global competition and increase Bitcoin’s valuation.

The SEC will now officially begin the review process. Before rendering a decision, the regulatory body will take into account market risks, investor protections, and other compliance with financial rules. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, says the SEC will open a public comment period, have several review phases to finish, and can approve, reject, or postpone the decision for up to a combined 240 days. He also notes that just the LTC ETF received the temporary acknowledgement on the ETF among all the other filings. First alt coin 19b-4 to be acknowledged, rest were told to withdraw by Genz SEC.

In 2018 and 2022, it also showcased -73.3% and -64.3% changes, respectively. This implies that the Bitcoin market follows a four-year boom and bust cycle. In short, every fourth year, the market experiences a crash. In that sense, the year 2026 may be a tough year for BTC. A recent statement from Matt Hougan, the Global Head of Research for Bitwise Asset Management, indicates that not many experts believe BTC would experience a severe crash in 2016. Why? Curious to know more? Read on! Bitcoin’s Traditional 4-Year Cycle Explained The -57.6% change that the Bitcoin market recorded in 2014 was the lowest in the first cycle. In 2011 and 2012, the market experienced +1,435% and +183.5% change, respectively. In 2013, the third year of the cycle, the market demonstrated a massive growth of +5,435%. Likewise, the -73.3% decline that the BTC market registered in 2018 was the lowest in the second cycle. In 2015 and 2016, the market saw +34.4% and +123.8%, respectively. In 2017, the market reported an impressive growth of +1,369%. The scenario was not different in the third cycle, in which the market reported a change of -64.3% in the fourth year (2022), except for the market’s inability to perform better than second year’s +304.1 in the third year (+59.6%). Causes of the Past Crypto Market Crashes One of the primary reasons for the Bitcoin market’s collapse in 2014 was the failure of Mt. Gox. In 2018, the main reason was the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crackdown on Initial Coin Offerings. In 2022, the cause was the bankruptcies of major players like FTX, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius and BlockFi. Could the Bitcoin Cycle Change? Considering the historical trend, it is reasonable to expect a crash in 2026. Then, why do experts like Matt Hougan disagree? Well! Hougan’s primary argument is that the crypto market is far more mature than it was in 2014, 2018 or 2022. The political climate in the US shifted in favour of the crypto industry after Donald Trump’s victory last November . Soon after assuming office as the president of the United States, he signed an executive order , aimed at bringing more clarity to the crypto regulation framework and exploring the possibility of creating a digital assets reserve for the country. Experts like Hougan believe that this development could bring trillions of dollars into the Bitcoin market. Highlighting the favourable environment created by the withdrawal of the controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 rule , which required financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets, Hougan, in a recent statement, shared his extreme optimistic view about the BTC market. However, he added that Bitcoin may not see the impact of these developments immediately. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Tesla Bitcoin Holding Sees Explosive Growth, Boosting Q4 Earnings by $600 Million , Bitcoin’s Price Prediction Hougan forecasted that the Bitcoin market will reach as high as $200,000 before the end of this year 2025. Interestingly, he claimed that the creation of a Bitcoin reserve by the US is not a prerequisite to achieving this price milestone. Bitcoin’s four-year cycle has been a strong pattern in the past, but Trump’s crypto-friendly policies and Wall Street’s increasing involvement may change the game.

""President Trump has asked us to study that issue, so we are not ready to comment on it yet. But it's one of the things our working groups are going to look at,"" Sacks said in a recent appearance on Fox. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican who is known for her bitcoin-friendly policy stance, has submitted a bill proposing the creation of a reserve, but this is a separate measure from the White House's efforts. The bill proposes establishing a ""Bitcoin Purchase Program"" of up to 200,000 BTC a year over a five-year period, and will be partially funded by revaluing Federal Reserve's gold, CoinDesk previously reported . Right now the bill is before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Among the supporters of such a move is MicroStrategy's (MSTR) Michael Saylor, who said the plan will protect the dollar. “The best way to protect the dollar is make sure you retire the debt and become rich,"" said the MicroStrategy (MSTR) executive chairman during a November conference . ""The next best way to protect the dollar is to make sure that if anybody ever considers a different capital asset other than the treasury bill, you own it.""

The legislative change comes as part of the country’s commitment to conditions set in its $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF. According to Reuters , lawmakers passed the bill just minutes after President Nayib Bukele sent it to the Legislative Assembly on Jan. 29. El Salvador Drops Bitcoin Mandate for Businesses The reform, approved by 55 votes in favor and only two against, eliminates the legal requirement for businesses to accept Bitcoin as payment, making its use optional for private merchants. Elisa Rosales, a ruling party lawmaker, emphasized that the amendment ensures Bitcoin’s “permanence as legal tender” while refining its practical implementation. Despite the IMF-driven policy shift, El Salvador continues to expand its Bitcoin holdings, recently acquiring 12 BTC for its national reserves. An official from the country’s Bitcoin Office told Cointelegraph last month that the government intends to continue purchasing Bitcoin, with an intensified strategy planned for 2025. El Salvador's Congress has quickly approved legislation to amend its Bitcoin laws to comply with an agreement with the IMF to adjust its cryptocurrency exposure.

The portfolio has reportedly yielded a 127% profit. El Salvador made history in 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Meanwhile, on the same day Congress passed the amendment, former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez—who had opposed El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption—was sentenced to 11 years in prison for bribery involving gold bars and cash, according to the Associated Press. FBI agents reportedly discovered $480,000 in cash and gold bars worth $150,000 at his home. Notably, El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office Director, Stacy Herbert, indicated in a Dec. 19 social media post that the country could accelerate its Bitcoin acquisitions. The government has also clarified it has no plans to sell its holdings, reaffirming that Bitcoin remains central to its economic strategy. The Chivo wallet, El Salvador’s official Bitcoin wallet, will reportedly be sold or phased out, with private-sector wallets expected to fill the gap. New Hampshire and North Dakota Latest U.S. States to Propose Bitcoin Reserves New Hampshire and North Dakota have introduced legislation to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves, marking a growing trend among U.S. states to diversify their treasuries with cryptocurrency. Previously, Ohio proposed adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves , following the introduction of a new bill by House Republican leader Derek Merrin. Likewise, on 12 December 2024, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which proposes that the state comptroller hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset for at least five years. Pennsylvania took a similar step in November, with Representative Mike Cabell proposing a bill to allow its treasury to allocate up to 10% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin, citing the asset’s potential to hedge against economic uncertainty.

The local media reports that a person referred to by the initials “JL” sued the exchange platform for refusing to return his €67,550 investment. Judge María Ángeles Velázquez, who presided over the case, was satisfied that JL presented sufficient criminal motive in his arguments on Binance . Spanish judge opens investigation into Binance over €67,550 misappropriation claim Binance is facing court claims of market manipulation, and it is supposed to comply with the responses to these claims. The head of the 27th Court of Instruction of Madrid, María Ángeles Velázquez, stated that there are enough criminal motives. Because of the circumstances, the court has not commented further on the case. Velázquez granted the wishes of JL, a Spanish businessman who had filed a case against Binance in 2023. JL was aggrieved that the exchange stole his €67,550 investment in their platform. The businessman claims he deposited money on the exchange platform, but it never issued him an access code. He said he resorted to court two years after attempting to retrieve his money in vain. The Judge’s order is a progressive step for JL, who now must present sufficient evidence in 10 days and request penalties. After the evidence is presented, the Judge will determine if it is sufficient to institute a legal battle in the Spanish courts. However, the ruling may be entirely dismissed if JL offers insufficient evidence. Binance faces several lawsuits across the globe The Spanish judge launched a new investigation into Binance just a day after a French court ordered inquiries into the exchange platform for money laundering. On Tuesday, Paris prosecutors said investigators would check whether Binance failed to fulfill its know-your-client obligations and, therefore, allowed laundering to take place on its platform. The exchange denied the claims and stated that it would vigorously fight any charges against it. Paris prosecutors also said in their statement that the investigation will also focus on whether Binance unlawfully acted as a digital-asset service provider before it secured regulatory approval from France in 2022. The allegations under examination began as early as 2019 in France and throughout the European Union. A few weeks ago, Binance faced a similar case in the US, where the Supreme Court allowed a class action lawsuit to proceed. Former investors accused the exchange of illegally selling unregistered tokens. Binance had argued that the lawsuit was invalid since the US didn’t have jurisdiction over the case. Despite its legal challenges, Binance is striving to rebuild. Binance Labs has rebranded as an “independent” research institution, enabling CZ to join despite his official lifetime ban from the exchange.

Trump Buys SUI (TRUMPSUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys SUI launched with over $29,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Buys SUI by entering its contract address (CA) – 7chY3Yw9cArR4CGQQ2N6mciszZvWB3rW6WoBNTfwyitu – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|SUI|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-30 06:55:00

This massive flow came right after Gensler’s exit which shows institutions are back in action. Is this the start of a regulatory breakthrough? Institutions are gearing up for the next big move—bullish sentiment is through the roof! Let’s get into the details of the first-ever altcoin ETF prospect. A New Chapter for Crypto ETFs? Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF is the first altcoin ETF filing to be officially reviewed, according to Bloomberg’s Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. If approved, it would let investors buy Litecoin without needing to deal with crypto wallets or security keys. Instead, they could trade it like a regular stock, making Litecoin investing much easier. First alt coin 19b-4 to be acknowledged, rest were told to withdraw by Genz SEC. Throw in the comments from SEC on the S-1 and this filing is by far the furthest along checking all the boxes. Q now is will this SEC wait the full 240 days or approve more rapidly. Unknown. https://t.co/iXwq9PkLGr — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 29, 2025 This initiative follows Canary Capital’s previous attempt to launch an XRP-based ETF. Meanwhile, other companies are also pushing for crypto ETFs , including funds for Solana and XRP. Some firms have even proposed ETFs for memecoins linked to Donald Trump and Melania Trump, as interest in crypto investment grows. SEC’s Changing Leadership and Crypto Outlook The SEC has been strict on crypto in the past, especially under former Chair Gary Gensler . But now, with Mark Uyeda as the acting Chair and Hester Peirce leading a new crypto task force, things might be changing for betterment. The fact that the SEC is even considering a Litecoin ETF could mean they are becoming more open to crypto investments. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Gensler’s Exit Opens Door for XRP, Solana ETFs, But Litecoin May Lead the Way , The ETF Approval Process Nasdaq filed a 19b-4 application for the Canary Litecoin ETF on January 15, marking a crucial phase in the approval process. This filing allows self-regulatory organizations like Nasdaq to propose rule changes for new financial products. The SEC now has up to 240 days to approve or reject the ETF, though some speculate the decision could come sooner. How the Canary Litecoin ETF Works The ETF is designed to track the CoinDesk Litecoin Price Index (LTX) and would hold Litecoin through a secure custody framework. Instead of buying Litecoin directly, investors would own shares in the ETF, making it simpler and safer to invest. Special financial firms would handle large purchases and redemptions using cash, keeping things smooth and regulated. If approved, this Litecoin ETF could be a big step for crypto, making it easier for regular investors to get involved without dealing with the complexities of digital wallets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to Reuters , El Salvador Congress has approved the reforms within minutes of receiving them from President Nayib Bukele, aligning the country’s Bitcoin policies with the terms of its $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF. El Salvador, once locked out of traditional financial markets due to its high debt and unconventional Bitcoin experiment, had little choice but to seek a lifeline. With soaring bond yields and limited access to fresh capital, the IMF deal became a necessary pivot to support the government’s economic overhaul agenda The move was necessary to ensure Bitcoin’s “permanence as legal tender” while facilitating its “practical implementation,” said ruling party lawmaker Elisa Rosales as the amendment was passed with 55 votes in favor. Under the amended legislation, businesses are no longer mandated to accept Bitcoin as payment, thereby making its use voluntary. It also restricts tax payments to U.S. dollars and paves the way for scaling back government-led crypto initiatives, including the state-backed Chivo wallet . Nevertheless, Bitcoin remains a legal tender in the nation as it continues to accumulate more of the flagship currency. According to data from the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador currently holds 6,049 BTC, valued at approximately $633 million, with an unrealized profit of 127%.

At the time, the National Bitcoin Office’s director, Stacy Herbert, said the country plans to accumulate Bitcoin at an “accelerated pace.” As a part of its latest purchase, the country added 12 BTC on Jan. 21. El Salvador adds another 11 BTC to our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve! 🇸🇻🚀 https://t.co/6NnNIdJtY5 — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) January 20, 2025 El Salvador became the first nation to accept Bitcoin as legal tender on Sept. 6, 2021, and has since launched several crypto-focused initiatives to integrate Bitcoin into its economy. The government has installed over 200 Bitcoin ATMs, making the country one of the most Bitcoin-friendly regions for transactions. Other initiatives include Volcano Energy , a Bitcoin mining project that uses renewable energy from volcanic sources to mine Bitcoin, and Volcano Bonds , a Bitcoin-backed bond initiative designed to raise funds for infrastructure projects and the development of Bitcoin City—a proposed tax-free crypto hub powered by geothermal energy. On January 13, crypto industry giant Tether Group said it would relocate its entire operations to El Salvador after it secures a Digital Asset Service Provider license in El Salvador via Bitfinex Derivatives, its Seychelles-based affiliate. The announcement came less than a week after Bitfinex Derivatives secured the said license.

In a lengthy blog post , Paradigm CTO and General Partner Georgios Konstantopoulos, Managing Partner Matt Huang, and General Partners Dan Robinson and Charlie Noyes argue that by deliberately slowing updates, Ethereum endangers its ability to stay competitive. “It’s easy to forget that the first version of the Ethereum protocol shipped in less than two years—a pace that drew many of us to the project as a developer platform in the first place,” they write. “But today, we think Ethereum’s core protocol could be improving much faster… without sacrificing its values.” To continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io",,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'The Defiant', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/101/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thedefiant,2025-01-30 07:05:40

Nearly 5% of all tokens launched across various networks in 2024 year had patterns similar to pump-and-dump schemes, blockchain forensic firm Chainalysis claims. In a blog post on Jan. 29, the New York-based firm revealed that more than 3 million tokens were launched in 2024, with nearly 1.3 million (over 40%) listed on decentralized exchanges. Monthly number of tokens associated with pump-and-dump schemes on select blockchains | Source: Chainalysis Despite the figure, only a small fraction — just 1.7% — has been actively traded in the last 30 days. Chainalysis suggests the gap could be because many tokens were “abandoned shortly after creation,” possibly due to lack of interest. The analysts also note that some of these tokens could have been part of short-lived schemes such as pump-and-dumps or rug pulls. “It is also possible that some of these tokens facilitate intentional short-lived schemes designed to exploit initial hype before fading away, also known as pump-and-dumps or rug pulls.” Chainalysis You might also like: Over 72% of PENGU holders dump all tokens immediately after launch On top of that, nearly 90% of decentralized exchange pools suspected of being involved in pump-and-dump schemes were “rugged” by the address that created the DEX pool, Chainalysis note. The rest were rugged by addresses funded by the pool or token creator. In some cases, the pool creator and the address that rugged the pool seemed to be funded by the same source, suggesting a coordinated effort to exploit users. The analysts point out that the wash trading volume across Ethereum , BNB Chain , and Coinbase’s Base reached about $2.57 billion in 2024, though the firm acknowledges using “different methodologies” to detect various types of wash trading.

The historical correlation between Bitcoin’s bull rally and the altseason has continued to grow negatively due to the extreme dilution of liquidity by thousands of new altcoins in the market. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and spot ETH ETFs in the United States last year has made it more difficult for the crypto cash rotation to thrive akin to previous macro bull markets. As a result, the next altcoin season , led by Ethereum, will be fueled by new cash inflows to projects with better fundamentals and prospects of real-world utility. Ethereum Whales Remain Timid in the Short Term Since the beginning of 2025, the overall supply of Ether on centralized exchanges has increased from 15.39 million to about 16.04 million at the time of this writing. The notable increase in Ether supply on CEXes has continued to weigh down on bullish sentiment. Furthermore, the overall cash flow to the US spot Ether ETFs has continued to shrink in the past few weeks. Since the beginning of this week, the US spot Ether ETFs have registered a net cash outflow of about $141 million. According to on-chain data analysis by Glassnode , long-term Ether investors have started to feel anxious after depicting belief and denial in the last three months. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin, Ethereum, & XRP Price Today: Will the Bulls Maintain Dominance? , What’s Next for ETH? As Bitcoin dominance continues to gain more ground against the majority of the altcoins, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has predicted a major downturn for Ether before a bullish recovery in the near future. Moreover, Cowen noted that the Federal Reserve did not kick start its Quantitative Easing (QE) program akin to the Canadian counterpart. One risk for #ETH is if the Fed comes out this week and says no QE, maybe that would cause ETH to finally go home on its USD pair, leading the Fed to reverse course in March 2025 causing a quick recovery.

However, its macro bullish trend remains intact but the market is still under correction. The past week marked another major milestone for Ray as it exploded significantly to a new high of $8.7 after taking a little break. It later failed to advance above the mentioned high and cooled off at once. This led to a sharp decline and the price entered a pullback mode. Up till now, the asset is still yet to find a solid ground. Although the $6.2 level has provided a temporary support since the start of the week, there’s no assurance if it will hold. A strong hold above this temporal support could bring buying pressure back in the market while the bulls slowly regroup. If that happens, we can expect another bullish phase until the market reaches an overbought condition on the daily chart. On the other hand, Ray may continue to lose momentum daily. A drop below the $6 level should set the market for a bigger loss until the asset finds a strong threshold to initiate a buy. Ray’s price may look weak daily, but it is important to note that its long-term structure remains bullish. RAY’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As it stands now, Ray is facing down, eyeing the minor $5.85 level. Losing this minor level could drag the price down to the $4.78 support and potentially $3.8 in the near term before bouncing back. While there’s currently no move to the upside, the potential resistance level for a test is $7.42 and $8.7. If those level flips, a new high may come around $10 or even beyond.

BTFD Coin: Unlocking High Returns with 90% APY Staking BTFD Coin is gaining significant traction as one of the best new meme coins to join now. Unlike many meme tokens that rely purely on hype, BTFD is integrating a broader ecosystem that includes high-yield staking, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and a dedicated community known as the Bulls Squad. This multi-faceted approach ensures that the project has real value beyond short-term speculation. One of BTFD’s biggest selling points is its 90% APY staking reward. Staking allows investors to earn passive income while contributing to the network’s stability. The high staking rewards set BTFD apart from many other meme coins, offering holders the opportunity to significantly grow their holdings simply by locking up their tokens. Additionally, the project’s P2E game provides another avenue for earning rewards, further strengthening its ecosystem. BTFD Coin’s presale numbers demonstrate its strong investor confidence. Currently in its 14th presale stage, BTFD is priced at $0.00016 per token. The presale has already raised over $5.78 million, attracting more than 9,800 investors. Over 68 billion BTFD tokens have been sold, signaling a growing adoption rate and strong market enthusiasm. To maximize their holdings, investors can take advantage of the LAUNCH100 bonus code, which doubles the number of tokens purchased. For instance, an investor buying 25 million BTFD tokens for $4,000 would receive an additional 25 million tokens, totaling 50 million. If the price of BTFD rises to $0.0006 per token, that initial $4,000 investment would be worth $30,000. With its attractive staking rewards, successful presale, and engaged community, BTFD is one of the best new meme coins to join now. Dogs: A Growing Contender in the Meme Coin Arena Dogs (DOGS) is making its mark in the meme coin landscape, standing out as a project that is working to integrate decentralized finance (DeFi) elements into its ecosystem. While many meme coins struggle with sustainability beyond the initial hype, Dogs aims to provide real utility by allowing its token to be used in various Web3 applications. This approach has helped it gain traction among both speculative traders and long-term investors looking for meme coins with added value. At present, Dogs is trading at approximately $0.00028073, reflecting a minor 0.03846% decline from the previous close. The token’s intraday high reached $0.00029338, while its low sat at $0.0002589. Despite minor fluctuations, Dogs has maintained steady trading volume, suggesting that investors remain engaged. The ability of Dogs to sustain interest amid market corrections makes it an interesting token to watch, especially as the broader meme coin market experiences waves of volatility. However, meme coins are known for their unpredictable price swings, and investors should approach them with careful consideration. While Dogs shows promise, success in the meme coin market often depends on community engagement, sustained hype, and strategic partnerships. With the growing interest in new meme coins, Dogs could see further upside, but as with any speculative investment, risk management is essential. Pudgy Penguins: A Community-Driven Meme Coin with Recent Market Challenges Pudgy Penguins has long been one of the most recognizable brands in the NFT space, known for its unique artistic appeal and strong community support. However, recent market conditions have presented significant challenges for both the PENGU token and the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection. The introduction of Abstract, an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by Igloo Inc., appears to have shifted investor attention away from Pudgy Penguins, resulting in substantial losses across the ecosystem. The PENGU token has suffered a 24% decline in a single day and a 49% drop over the past month, currently trading at $0.0173. Meanwhile, Ethereum-based Pudgy Penguins NFTs have seen a 20% decrease in one day and a 39% drop over the past week, bringing their floor price down to $37,950. This sharp decline highlights the risks associated with NFT-linked meme coins, especially when external developments influence market sentiment. Despite these setbacks, Pudgy Penguins still maintains a loyal following, and the brand’s popularity in the NFT space could provide a foundation for a future recovery. If the project can introduce new incentives or adapt to shifting market conditions, there is potential for a rebound. However, in the short term, its performance has been affected by broader market movements, making it a more volatile investment option. Conclusion The best new meme coins to join now offer a mix of high-reward opportunities, strong community engagement, and market momentum. Among them, BTFD Coin stands out due to its 90% APY staking program, successful presale, and investor incentives like the LAUNCH100 bonus code. For those looking to maximize returns while benefiting from staking rewards, BTFD presents a compelling choice. Meanwhile, Dogs continues to hold its ground as a meme coin with real-world utility, while Pudgy Penguins is currently navigating a challenging market downturn. While both projects have their own strengths, BTFD Coin’s strong fundamentals and growing community support make it the most attractive option for investors seeking short-term and long-term gains. As always, market conditions can shift rapidly, so conducting thorough research before making any investment decisions is crucial.

A recovery above the previous monthly high should set the stage for a big increase. Last week, Jup showed signs of strength and went offensive after seeing a notable increase in the volume level. Things escalated positively fast as many traders became optimistic about a possible rally, but the asset faced rejection and the buying pressure faded off quickly. Interestingly, the $1 level provided support in the past few days and became a critical trading level for Jup since it faced rejection last weekend. Though, like many altcoins, the price currently appears weak. Losing this critical trading level could cause a serious decline in the price. This could roll the price back to the $0.7 range before picking up again. Failure to bounce back might result in a heavy loss, which may slide the price to a yearly low. However, Jup’s next move is still indecisive. A push above the previous weekly high should give room for more positive actions daily. Apart from that, we can expect a new high to surface before rallying hard. It is currently gathering momentum for another major swing. JUP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview On the daily chart, the bulls are still having the upper hand. If they regroup back, the $1.28 level would be their target before charging at the $1.44 resistance on the way up. The $1.6 level is the next resistance to watch. Losing $1, there’s a minor support at $0.9. A further drop from there could pull us to a low of $0.8, followed by $0.71. Key Resistance Levels: $1.28, $1.44, $1.6 Key Support Levels: $0.9, $0.8, $0.71 Spot Price: $1.1 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

The watches will be made-to-order and start shipping from October onward, an FAQ on the website shows. As such, these official products are not sold by Trump directly but are part of a licensed agreement with CIC Digital LLC - one of the companies that helmed the issuance of TRUMP tokens. The move bumps utility and usability for the TRUMP token, which launched on Jan. 17 and has since entered the top-thirty tokens with a market cap above $5.5 billion as of Thursday.

Cardano has just completed a major milestone: the Plomin Hard Fork, which means it is now fully decentralized. This is a big deal because Cardano is now fully governed by ADA token holders, who will vote on important decisions like upgrades and treasury spending. This makes Cardano one of the few top 10 cryptos with true decentralization. Even though the price of Cardano isn’t seeing much action at the moment, the fundamentals behind the project are stronger than ever. More and more whales are buying ADA, and institutions like grayscale Investment grayscale Investment - Investment platform are showing interest in Cardano. As more people see the value of Cardano’s decentralized system, demand could increase, which may lead to higher prices in the future. Price Action: Consolidation Phase Looking at the price chart, Cardano is currently in a consolidation phase. After a previous surge of over 300%, it’s normal for ADA to experience this type of sideways movement. However, there’s still clear momentum on the weekly chart, showing higher highs and higher lows since the spring of 2024. The current key levels to watch are $1 : The 20-day moving average is at this level. ADA needs to break above this to signal any further upside. $1.25 : The next resistance level is just above $1.20, with significant price action happening around this zone. If Cardano can break through these levels, a major bull move could be in play. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Analysis: Will ETH Bounce Back After Recent Outflows? , A Comparison with Ethereum’s Previous Cycle Looking at Ethereum’s cycle as a reference, it’s clear that Cardano is primed for similar gains.

The comments came as the Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at 4.25% to 4.5% following last week’s CPI data that showed inflation was not as high as many anticipated. Don’t Debank Crypto Customers Powell also said the central bank was “not against innovation” with regard to cryptocurrencies. Speaking about banking restrictions, he added, “We certainly don’t want to take actions that would cause banks to, you know, terminate customers who are perfectly legal just because of excess risk aversion, maybe related to regulation and supervision.” Powell’s remarks at the first FOMC meeting under the Trump administration came as concerns about so-called “debanking” efforts have risen to the highest ranks of government. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers, as long as they understand and can manage the risks, and it’s safe and sound,” Powell said before adding, “The threshold has been a little higher for banks engaging in crypto activities, and that’s because they’re so new.” He noted that individual investors needed better protection as the risks may not be fully understood. He also compared crypto to stocks and mutual funds, saying that similar consumer safeguards should apply. No Disagreements With Trump The central bank chair has avoided responding directly to comments made or actions taken by Donald Trump in recent weeks. He said there has been “no contact” with the new president, noting that disagreements would undermine the Fed’s credibility. “We stand ready to take appropriate action to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy, including adjusting the details of our approach for reducing the size of our balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments,” he said. More economic data is expected this week, with fourth-quarter GDP Growth Annualized advance estimates due on Thursday and December’s Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report due on Friday.

Co-founder of Gemini , Tyler Winklevoss, said in a recent X post that the crypto exchange will stop hiring graduates from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The decision came shortly after it was announced that former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler will return to MIT’s Sloan School of Management as a professor and co-director of FinTechAI at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. “As long as MIT has any association with Gary Gensler, Gemini will not hire any graduates from this school. Not even interns for our summer intern program,” wrote Winklevoss in his post. Ranked as the second-best university in the U.S. in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025, MIT is known as the alma mater of many crypto figureheads, including Executive Director & Co-Founder of Uniswap ( UNI ) Devin Walsh, co-founder of the Bitcoin ( BTC ) Foundation Patrick Murck and former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried . According to RootData , there are at least 54 projects in the crypto sphere that were founded by MIT alumni. As long as @MIT has any association with Gary Gensler, @Gemini will not hire any graduates from this school. Not even interns for our summer intern program. https://t.co/fi0WMIVCLp — Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) January 30, 2025 You might also like: Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler returns to MIT and alumni are incredibly embarrassed On Jan. 29, MIT announced that former SEC Chairman and infamous crypto enemy Gary Gensler will be returning to the MIT’s Sloan School of Management as a Professor of the Practice in the Global Economics and Management Group and the Finance Group. He will be teaching artificial intelligence , finance, financial technology, and public policy. He will have a specific role in the academic institution’s FinTech and AI research, as he will also be filling in as co-director of the FinTechAI at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT’s largest research lab. Many crypto industry players have labeled Gensler as antagonistic towards crypto, due to his harsh stance on crypto. The SEC under Gensler’s leadership has been accused of waging war against the crypto industry by insisting all tokens distributed fall under securities. Crypto industry’s crackdown on Gary Gensler’s SEC Gemini is not the first crypto firm to cut ties with institutions associated with former officials linked to the Biden Administration. In early December, Coinbase said that it would stop working with firms that hire people linked to the Biden Administration’s “bad deeds” after law firm hired ex-SEC chief Gurbir Grewal as a partner. “It’s an ethics violation in my book to try and unlawfully kill an industry while refusing to publish clear rules. If you were senior there, you cannot say you were just following orders,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote in his post, encouraging other firms to do the same. As Gary Gensler will be teaching a new generation of innovators and influencing their views on fintech, AI and most definitely crypto, many crypto traders see his return to MIT as a major disappointment. UniSwap executive and MIT graduate Devin Walsh said that she felt “incredibly embarrassed and disappointed to see them rehire Gensler” and that joining the program would be “a waste of time, tuition funds, and energy” for students hoping to learn about new technologies in the finance field.

With $1 million raised in minutes during its presale and unmatched momentum, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming the most sought-after token, even as MATIC, ADA, SEI, and APT aim for their share of the spotlight.

He also confirmed that the exchange would exclude MIT students from its summer internship program. Gemini Settled SEC Case for $21 Million The conflict between Gemini and the SEC dates back to at least March 2023 , when Gemini settled with the SEC by paying $21 million in fines over allegations that it sold unregistered securities through its Gemini Earn program. The now-bankrupt Genesis, which partnered with Gemini on the program, was also implicated. Gensler spearheaded the regulatory action before stepping down on Jan. 20, when former President Donald Trump was re-inaugurated. Following his exit from the SEC, Gensler returned to MIT to teach and research artificial intelligence in finance, financial technology, and regulatory policy. As long as @MIT has any association with Gary Gensler, @Gemini will not hire any graduates from this school. Not even interns for our summer intern program. https://t.co/fi0WMIVCLp — Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) January 30, 2025 Winklevoss’ decision gained support from notable crypto advocates, including Bitcoin proponent Erik Voorhees, who urged crypto firms to boycott MIT graduates until Gensler is removed. This is not the first time the crypto industry has taken a stand against SEC-affiliated professionals. In December 2023, Coinbase cut ties with the law firm Milbank after it hired former SEC official Gurbir Grewal. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated that his firm would avoid working with law firms that hire individuals who tried to “unlawfully kill” the crypto industry while failing to establish clear regulations. He also encouraged other companies to adopt a similar approach. However, not everyone in the industry agrees with Gemini’s blanket policy against MIT graduates. Axelar Network co-founder Sergey Gorbunov criticized the move, saying there was “no reason to punish students” for the actions of one professor and even offered to hire MIT graduates himself. Arkham’s head of UK legal, Preston Byrne, also called the decision excessive, arguing that while boycotting law firms that employ SEC enforcers is reasonable, blacklisting an entire institution’s graduates is too extreme. I actually think a university is a perfectly fine place for Gensler to land. Was he bad for our industry? Yes. Will he be able to teach students a hell of a lot about how government works? Also yes — Preston Byrne (@prestonjbyrne) January 30, 2025 Others, such as George Mason University associate professor Jiasun Li, suggested a more targeted approach, proposing that the boycott focus solely on students who enroll in Gensler’s classes rather than all MIT graduates. Winklevoss: Gensler’s Actions Are Unforgivable Winklevoss has remained vocal in his criticism of Gensler, arguing that any organization hiring him is betraying the crypto industry. In a Nov. 16 post on X, he stated that no amount of apology could undo the damage Gensler inflicted on both cryptocurrency and the United States. Following Gensler’s departure, the SEC is now led by Mark Uyeda, who was among the three commissioners who voted in favor of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024. Hester Peirce, another commissioner who voted in favor, has since taken the lead in the SEC’s newly established crypto task force unit.

Analyst Explains the Latest Situation,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-latest-on-ethereum-are-the-bulls-in-analyst-explains-the-latest-situation/,"Cryptocurrency analyst IT Tech has provided insight into the current market conditions of Ethereum, explaining the key trends in whale activity and price movements. According to IT Tech, Ethereum’s large trading volume (LTV) remains lower compared to previous bull cycles in 2017 and 2021. This suggests that the market is currently driven more by retail investors rather than institutional-scale transactions that usually signal speculative swings. While small increases in whale activity have been observed, these are not at levels that typically precede a major rally or significant sell-off. However, IT Tech warns that sudden increases in whale transactions are often a sign of impending price changes, making on-chain activity an important metric to watch. Related News: Howard Lutnick, Donald Trump's Nominee for Secretary of Commerce and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Speaks on Tether (USDT) in the Senate Ethereum has successfully reclaimed the $3,000 level, but the analyst notes that a move towards $3,500 and beyond would require rising LTV as confirmation. Without this, Ethereum could consolidate or experience a pullback. IT Tech warns that if whale activity suddenly increases amid price weakness, it could signal dispersion and lead to a correction towards the $2,800-$2,500 range. *This is not investment advice.

This is an important step in determining whether the agency will approve the exchange-traded fund. The SEC opened a 21-day public comment period after the proposal was published in the Federal Register, according to a published document. The move signals that the agency is actively evaluating the product and invites market participants to provide feedback. Nasdaq officially kicked off the second phase of the regulatory process by filing Form 19b-4 for Canary’s spot Litecoin ETF on Jan. 16. The 19b-4 filing is a key step in which exchanges submit proposals on behalf of ETF issuers. Once approved by the SEC, the document is published in the Federal Register, triggering the agency’s formal review. Related News: Howard Lutnick, Donald Trump's Nominee for Secretary of Commerce and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Speaks on Tether (USDT) in the Senate Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas touched on the importance of the application, noting that this is the first altcoin ETF to reach this stage. “When we include the SEC’s comments on the S-1, this filing is by far the furthest along in terms of checking all the boxes,” Balchunas wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). However, he questioned whether the SEC would take the full 240-day review period or move forward with a quicker decision. The Canary Litecoin ETF is one of several crypto-related funds seeking regulatory approval.

Fund CIO Explores New Market Reality,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/no-more-bitcoin-bear-market-fund-cio/,"In a new investor note published on January 29, 2025, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, questioned whether the historical four-year market cycle of Bitcoin could finally be coming to an end. His reasoning is rooted in seismic shifts in US policy toward crypto, highlighted by a recent executive order from President Trump aimed at solidifying the nation’s leadership in digital assets. Could 2026 Buck The Bitcoin Bear Trend? Hougan’s note begins with an explanation of the so-called “four-year cycle,” where Bitcoin has typically seen three years of substantial gains followed by a pullback. This cycle, he explains, mirrors broader boom-bust patterns in traditional markets:“The four-year cycle in crypto is driven by the same forces that drive broader cycles of growth and recession in the general economy,” he wrote. Related Reading: Bitcoin Preparing For A February Rally? Analyst Says New High Is Two Weeks Away These expansions, fueled by technological breakthroughs or increased investor interest, often lead to over-leverage, occasionally resulting in fraud or industry-wide strain. Eventually, something “breaks” and triggers a market correction—such as the 2014 Mt. Gox collapse or the 2018 SEC crackdown on ICOs. Hougan describes the current crypto upswing as the “Mainstream Cycle,” emerging out of 2022’s “massive deleveraging” caused by failures like FTX, Three Arrows Capital, and others. According to him, the latest bull phase took off in March 2023, when Grayscale convincingly “won the opening argument” in its legal challenge against the SEC over a spot Bitcoin ETF. “Bitcoin was trading at $22,218 when Grayscale mounted its argument. It’s trading at $102,674 today. The mainstream era has arrived.” Once a spot Bitcoin ETF was approved and launched in January 2024, investor inflows surged, further cementing Bitcoin’s acceptance among both retail and institutional players. The most striking component of Hougan’s analysis is his examination of last week’s executive order issued by President Trump. The order not only deemed the development of the US digital asset ecosystem a “national priority,” but it also set in motion a clearer regulatory framework for crypto. Related Reading: DeepSeek Predicts Bitcoin Bull Run Peak At $500,000 – Here’s When “Last week, President Trump issued an executive order that was so overwhelmingly bullish for the space that it’s making me wonder,” Hougan wrote, noting how the document outlines plans for a potential “national crypto stockpile” and encourages banks and financial institutions to accelerate their adoption of digital assets. Combined with a now more welcoming stance from the SEC, Hougan believes these measures could unleash trillions in new investment over the coming years, far surpassing the hundreds of billions that an ETF-driven market was already expected to generate. Hougan’s analysis acknowledges that Bitcoin has historically followed its pattern of eventual pullbacks after surging bull runs. But with Wall Street behemoths and major banks preparing to integrate crypto at every level, there’s a growing possibility that the market may not face the traditional plunge in 2026: “If it’s not until next year that we feel those impacts, will we really have a new ‘crypto winter’ in 2026?” he posited. “If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is calling for $700k Bitcoin, are we really going to see a 70% pullback?” While he concedes that leverage continues to build in the system—citing an uptick in Bitcoin-backed lending programs, derivatives, and levered exchange-traded products—he also highlights an increasingly diverse pool of crypto investors. This diversity, he argues, could dampen severe drawdowns. “My guess is that we haven’t fully overcome the four-year cycle. Leverage will build up as the bull market builds. Excess will appear. Bad actors will emerge. And at some point, there could be a sharp pullback when the market gets over its skis,” Hougan argued. However, Hougan expects that any future market correction will be “shorter and shallower” than previous cycles. With the industry’s infrastructure now significantly more robust and mainstream participants treating crypto as a legitimate asset class, a dramatic bear market akin to those of 2014 or 2018 may be less likely. “As for now, it’s full steam ahead,” he concluded. “The crypto train is leaving the station.” At press time, BTC traded at $105,275.

Recently Indiana has joined the list with the introduction of House Bill 1322, to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, this bill will allow the state’s pension funds to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. Indiana Pension Funds To Invest in Bitcoin ETFs Indiana is taking a slightly different approach with the introduction of House Bill 1322 , authored by state Representative Jake Teshka and co-authored by Representatives Shane Lindauer and Cory Criswell, that could potentially allow state pension funds to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. The proposal, currently under review, aims to diversify the investment options for Indiana’s pension funds. These funds are crucial for the retirement savings of many public employees, including teachers, firefighters, and government workers. By allowing investments in Bitcoin ETFs, the state could tap into the growing cryptocurrency market, which has gained significant attention in recent years. While the bill’s specifics remain under legislative review and if the bill is approved, it will go into effect on July 1, 2025, as this could be a big step for Indiana. Taping Into Blockchain for Better Government Apart from this Indiana’s HB 1322 doesn’t just focus on Bitcoin ETFs it also looks at how blockchain technology could help the government work better. The bill asks the Department of Administration to study how blockchain can improve things like cost efficiency, data security, and even the experience of people using government services. Supporters Praise the Bill Meanwhile, many supporters of the bill believe that adding Bitcoin ETFs to the mix could help diversify investments. Diversification is important because it spreads risk and can lead to better returns over time. Well-known crypto expert MMCrypto said in an X post that this is one of the huge move by Indiana states.

As its presale garners attention from investors, early entrants are perfectly positioned to benefit from unprecedented ROI and the highly anticipated staking rewards launching on Valentine’s Day this year. It’’s a project for serious financial gains. For those who act now, the rewards could be monumental. With the right timing, Doge Uprising has the potential to multiply your investments in ways that rival the most explosive crypto success stories. Why Early Action Is Key Cryptocurrency rewards those who seize opportunities before the masses catch on. Take a moment to reflect on Dogecoin, which transformed early investments of just a few hundred dollars into fortunes worth millions. Doge Uprising is poised to follow a similar trajectory, but the key is getting in now, while prices are still low and the potential for exponential returns remains untapped. As momentum builds, demand for $DUP tokens is set to surge, and with it, the price. Investing during the presale phase ensures the lowest entry point, offering early buyers the chance to maximize returns before the token hits major exchanges. The Power of Staking Rewards A major highlight of Doge Uprising is its staking rewards program, launching on February 14th. While the specific APY is yet to be announced, the very concept of staking opens up an avenue for passive income. Investors can lock their tokens and earn additional rewards simply for holding onto their investment, creating a compounding effect that enhances overall returns. Consider the possibilities: by staking your $DUP holdings, you not only benefit from the token’s price appreciation but also see your total number of tokens increase over time. This creates a dual income stream that amplifies your financial growth. While other cryptocurrencies offer staking, Doge Uprising’s rapidly growing community and unique momentum make it one of the most attractive staking opportunities on the market today. Unmatched ROI Potential For those aiming for life-changing gains, Doge Uprising stands out as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The combination of presale pricing, staking rewards, and projected market demand positions it as a coin with 1000X potential. Imagine turning a modest $500 investment into half a million dollars, or a $5,000 stake into a cool $5 million. These aren’t just numbers plucked out of thin air; they’re grounded in the historical performance of other meme coins that exploded onto the scene with much less strategic planning than Doge Uprising. Doge Uprising benefits from a robust roadmap, a dedicated community, and a staking system designed to reward investors handsomely. For those who act early, the financial possibilities are virtually limitless. The Cost of Hesitation Every moment spent waiting is a missed opportunity. Crypto markets move at lightning speed, and the window to secure a position in Doge Uprising’s presale is narrowing with each passing day. The difference between those who invest now and those who wait could mean missing out on millions. Unlike speculative projects with no real value proposition, Doge Uprising offers a clear path to sustainable growth. Early action not only secures your position at the lowest price but also gives you the chance to benefit from staking rewards as soon as they launch. Your Opportunity to Build Wealth Starts Now With Doge Uprising’s staking program offering passive income and its explosive growth potential, it’s clear why early buyers are rushing to secure their stake. Don’t let hesitation hold you back. Take action today, and position yourself to reap the rewards of one of the most exciting crypto opportunities of 2025. Doge Uprising is your chance to turn ambition into reality, and the time to act is now.

Simultaneously, The Graph (GRT) bullish pattern suggests an imminent breakout, with experts predicting a 15% upswing supported by robust technical indicators. Yet, the most captivating news this week is about BlockDAG (BDAG) and its LAUNCH300 bonus, giving enthusiasts a chance to get 300% extra BDAG coins for the next 2 days only. Enthusiasts are quickly grabbing this unique offer, projecting BDAG’s potential to reach $20 by 2027. The window to participate in this excitement is closing fast, as experts suggest BDAG is the best crypto to buy now! The Graph Bullish Pattern: 15% Surge Points to Upswing The Graph bullish pattern signals a potential breakout, with experts forecasting a 15% increase as prices near the upper trendline. Recent figures show $15.77 million in GRT outflows from exchanges, indicating accumulation by long-term holders. Additionally, 55% of leading traders are adopting long positions, supported by a Long/Short Ratio of 1.20, reflecting a positive outlook. Technical analysis reveals a falling wedge pattern, typically a precursor to upward movements. If The Graph’s price exceeds $0.22, the GRT bullish pattern may amplify up to 50%, potentially reaching $0.34 soon. Ethereum Grabs Institutional Focus: $5B on ETF Ethereum ETFs have achieved a new milestone, drawing over $5 billion in inflows since November 2024, highlighting increasing institutional focus. Trading volumes in December topped $1 billion on peak days, demonstrating strong confidence in Ethereum as a growth asset. Market watchers, like @CenkCrypto, are reviewing Ethereum’s historical Q1 outcomes, including rises of 518% in 2017 and 160% in 2021, raising expectations for another possible 100% increase in Q1 2025. Significant advancements like the Shanghai upgrade, facilitating efficient staked ETH withdrawals, and blockchain’s role in asset tokenization, have made Ethereum ETFs a top pick. Although Bitcoin ETFs are prevalent, Ethereum ETFs’ embrace of DeFi and scalability features are altering institutional investment patterns. Countdown on BlockDAG’s Triple Bonus Offer: LAUNCH300 Ends in 2 Days As the clock winds down, BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 bonus enters its final 48 hours, offering an unprecedented opportunity for participants to receive triple the BDAG coins at checkout. By applying the code LAUNCH300 in the BlockDAG dashboard , participants are granted 300% extra BDAG coins instantly. This is the most significant bonus ever provided by BlockDAG, and with its conclusion imminent, there is a rush among enthusiasts to secure this unique offer before it disappears. BlockDAG’s presale has been extraordinary, amassing $186 million and distributing over 18 billion coins thus far. The coin’s value has soared impressively by 2380%, from $0.001 in the initial batch to $0.0248 in the latest batch 27. Given these remarkable statistics, it’s clear why BDAG is acclaimed as the best crypto to buy now . The presale continues to accelerate, and the dwindling supply is only heightening the anticipation. In these closing moments of LAUNCH300, enthusiasts are capitalizing on the last chance to enhance their holdings, setting the stage for potential substantial returns. Projections already suggest BDAG could reach $20 by 2027, driven by its growth and broader acceptance. Missing these final moments means forgoing a pivotal opportunity to be part of one of the most promising ventures in the crypto world before the price escalates further. Wrapping Up Ethereum ETFs have become a cornerstone for sophisticated participants, with $5 billion in inflows demonstrating Ethereum’s expanding influence in decentralized finance and asset tokenization. The Graph is also creating excitement, with The Graph bullish pattern indicating a breakout that could yield substantial gains. However, the focus remains on BlockDAG, as enthusiasts rapidly acquire BDAG coins through the LAUNCH300 bonus. With only two days left to secure 300% extra coins, the buzz around the project and its ongoing presale is intensifying. The presale’s groundbreaking success, achieving $186 million and a boost in enthusiast activity as the bonus offer concludes, coupled with BDAG’s prospects of reaching $20 by 2027, solidifies BlockDAG as the best crypto to buy this week.

Pseudonymous analyst The Flow Horse tells his 259,500 followers on the social media platform X that many Bitcoin investors who are now contributing to its strong performance are unlikely to move profits into alts. He says Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy massive purchases of Bitcoin and those investing in Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are major bullish catalysts for the flagship crypto this cycle. However, he believes these entities are not going to rotate their profits into alts. “The money that bought and is responsible for moving Bitcoin is fragmented away from this market. It’s ETFs and Saylor. Most people here jumped into alts thinking this flow would follow, meanwhile it is on IBKR (electronic trading firm Interactive Brokers) and ThinkorSwim [trading platform]. Market structure has changed, adapt or die.” He previously said that another reason there won’t be an altseason when altcoins outperform Bitcoin is because there are now more digital assets than prior cycles and not enough liquidity to go around. “The idea of altseason is just like these rotations that are happening and they’ll get more concentrated. But a rising tide just isn’t happening. It’s just not happening. There’s too much garbage and there’s not enough money to go around to lift it.” The analyst keeps an eye on the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) chart, which currently sits at 59.88%. Traders use BTC.D to track if altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin as the metric calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. Lastly, the trader suggests that dogwifhat ( WIF ) may be gearing up for a breakout after a severe correction, dropping below $1. “To be honest, if there was a place to take a shot at WIF it is probably around here. Study retracements to Binance spot listing prices.” WIF is trading for $1.18 at time of writing, up 9.9% in the last 24 hours.

Built on a foundation of security, transparency, and usability, it simplifies digital asset management while supporting integration with ICP’s decentralized applications (dApps). Let’s take a look at what NFID Wallet is, how it works, and our final thoughts on the wallet. What Is NFID Wallet? NFID Wallet is a decentralized, non-custodial wallet built on ICP . It provides a secure and user-friendly platform for managing digital assets and interacting with decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike traditional wallets, NFID eliminates the need for recovery phrases by default, opting instead for passkey-based authentication, a forward-looking approach that reduces risks like phishing and key mismanagement. For those seeking additional flexibility, recovery phrases remain optional, but passkey authentication is designed to replace them entirely, reflecting the wallet’s commitment to secure and modern authentication methods. The wallet’s browser-based design simplifies access, allowing users to log in with email verification while maintaining privacy—applications only receive wallet addresses, not personal data. Additionally, NFID’s robust token registry system ensures transparent classification of assets, enhancing user trust and security. More interestingly, it’s the first Web3 wallet whose revenue is governed by a DAO instead of the centralized organization that builds and maintains today’s wallets. Like others, NFID Wallet takes a fee of all in-wallet swaps, but unlike orders, deposits it to a treasury under DAO control. Any code change approvals must also go through DAO consensus rather than deployed without consensus by a centralized organization. NFID Wallet Review: The Web3 Wallet For You? Security and Transparency NFID Wallet prioritizes user security with its open-source code, audited by third parties for transparency. Within the ICP ecosystem, NFID Wallet stands out as the only fully open-source wallet, providing unparalleled trust for users. Its passkey-based system ensures security against common vulnerabilities like phishing, while self-sovereign mode offers advanced users complete control over their cryptographic keys. The DAO-controlled governance model is another key differentiator. NFID Wallet users can actively participate in decision-making processes, influencing updates, fee distribution, and treasury management, creating a unique sense of community ownership and empowerment. While recovery phrases remain an option for users who prefer them, passkey authentication and email-based recovery make NFID Wallet harder to lose and easier to recover. These features, coupled with robust encryption, ensure that private keys are securely managed, even in third-party data centers. Ease of Use NFID Wallet’s standout feature is its email-based authentication system, which replaces traditional seed phrases with a straightforward and secure login process. This makes the wallet particularly attractive to Web3 newcomers, who may find conventional recovery mechanisms intimidating. To bolster security further, users are encouraged to enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on their email accounts and the wallet itself. This layered security approach makes NFID Wallet both easy to use and highly secure, catering to a broad audience of crypto enthusiasts and new adopters. Integration and Ecosystem Support The wallet is deeply integrated with the Internet Computer ecosystem, allowing seamless interaction with ICP dApps and offering a unified identity standard for cross-application use. This integration positions NFID Wallet as an essential tool for users invested in the ICP ecosystem, streamlining dApp connectivity and asset management. While its native focus is on ICP, the wallet’s Chainkey technology provides a clear pathway to multi-chain interoperability. According to the roadmap, NFID plans to integrate broader blockchain support by Spring 2026, empowering users with the ability to manage assets across multiple networks seamlessly. Accessibility and Storage NFID Wallet operates exclusively as a browser-based solution, making it accessible on any major web browser. This design choice eliminates the need for software downloads and ensures quick onboarding, with new users able to set up their wallets in seconds. The roadmap outlines plans for a browser extension and mobile app, slated for release by Spring 2025, which will further enhance accessibility and user convenience. While the wallet currently lacks cold storage options, self-sovereign mode and external backups provide advanced users with robust security controls. Token Management NFID Wallet’s structured token registry system categorizes assets into community-added, trusted, and spam registries. This governance-driven system enhances transparency, allowing users to interact with trusted tokens while filtering out potentially harmful ones. As part of its DAO model, community members can vote on token classifications, ensuring the system remains adaptive and user-focused. This feature, combined with NFID’s broader commitment to decentralization, highlights its innovative approach to token management within the ICP ecosystem. Governance and Cost One of NFID Wallet’s most innovative features is its DAO-controlled governance model. This allows the community to participate directly in decisions about software updates, fee distribution, and treasury allocation, giving users a stake in the wallet’s evolution and operations. The wallet generates revenue through a modest 0.875% convenience fee for in-app swaps, with all proceeds managed by the DAO. This transparent and user-focused approach ensures that revenue fuels community-driven initiatives rather than centralized corporations. Pros Cons Security: Open-source and audited code, passkey-based authentication, and optional self-sovereign mode make losing the wallet difficult. Limited Ecosystem: Currently focused on ICP, but Chainkey technology aims to expand multi-chain support by Spring 2026. User Experience: Simple email-based access without recovery phrases, reducing onboarding complexity, and passkey authentication for even faster access. Mobile and browser apps to be launched by Spring 2025. Cold Storage Options: Not available, though self-sovereign mode offers enhanced security for advanced users. ICP Integration: Optimized for ICP dApps and token management, offering a seamless ecosystem experience. Educational Resources: limited user education materials, though developer tools are robust. DAO Governance: Users participate in decision-making, ensuring transparency and community ownership. Verdict NFID Wallet is an excellent choice for users deeply embedded in the Internet Computer ecosystem, offering security, transparency, and ease of use. Its DAO governance model and passkey-based authentication make it a compelling alternative to centralized wallets like MetaMask, appealing to both Web3 newcomers and experienced users seeking advanced features. Looking ahead, NFID’s roadmap promises significant growth, with browser extensions and mobile apps expected by Spring 2025, and broader multi-chain interoperability planned for Spring 2026. These updates position NFID Wallet as a forward-thinking solution with immense potential for users seeking a decentralized, user-driven wallet. While current limitations include a focus on ICP and the absence of native mobile applications, NFID’s clear vision and commitment to innovation suggest it will evolve into a leading choice for Web3 users in the near future. If your focus is on ICP or you value security, simplicity, and community governance, NFID Wallet is undoubtedly worth considering .

The bill included public pension funds held by state officers, the state teachers’ retirement fund, and the public employees’ retirement fund. The proposal also requires the state’s administrative department to explore the application of blockchain technology to achieve cost efficiency and cost-effectiveness and how blockchain technology can improve consumer convenience, experience, data security, and data privacy.

John Cabello proposes legislation for a Strategic Bitcoin… pic.twitter.com/4scv5eQWoN — Kashif Raza (@simplykashif) January 30, 2025 Indiana’s State Representative Jake Teshka introduced the bill with Representatives Shane Linauer and Cory Criswell. House Bill 1322 aims to focus on blockchain adoption and Bitcoin investment strategies. “The department of administration (department) shall issue a request for information for purposes of exploring how the use of blockchain technology could be used by a state agency to: (1) achieve greater cost efficiency and cost effectiveness; and (2) improve consumer convenience, experience, data security, and data privacy,” – Jake Teshka, Indiana State Representative Teshka’s proposed bill will allow retirement funds to invest in Bitcoin ETFs, such as spot Bitcoin ETFs, which hold Bitcoin directly. The retirement funds would also invest in Bitcoin futures ETFs, which track Bitcoin price movements through derivatives. A report from Bitget Research revealed a significant shift in retirement planning trends among younger generations. The research found that 78% of the respondents expressed greater trust in alternative retirement savings options compared to traditional pension systems. The study also indicated that 20% of Generation Z and Alpha were open to receiving pensions in cryptocurrency, which reflected their increased trust in alternative financial systems and digital money. Arizona and Utah propose for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Arizona proposed the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act (SB 1025) , which would allow the state treasurer, the Arizona State Retirement System, and the Public Safety Personnel Retirement System to invest roughly 10% of public funds in cryptocurrencies. The bill will also require the state to securely store government Bitcoin holdings in segregated accounts to ensure responsible management of the digital assets. The proposal was co-sponsored by Republican Senator Wendy Rogers and Republican Representative Jeff Weninger and passed the Senate Finance Committee with a 5-2 vote on January 27. The bill is still awaiting approval from the Senate Rules Committee and potential amendments before heading to the House of Representatives. Weninger highlighted that more crypto-friendly initiatives were on the way. Both Rogers and Weninger also plan to propose additional blockchain-focused legislation to further shape the state’s role in the crypto economy. Dennis Porter said on Monday that he can confirm that Arizona had become the 1st state in the United States to pass out of committee a bill to create a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’. He also acknowledged that Arizona had set a precedent for other states to follow, with at least 12 other states exploring similar Bitcoin reserve bills. Utah also joined Arizona in considering crypto investment proposals and passed the bill in an 8-1 vote on January 28. The state approved the HB 230 bill on Tuesday, allowing it to invest its crypto holdings in a secure, segregated account within a potential crypto reserve launched by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. Porter, CEO and co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, said that Utah had become the second state in the nation to pass a ‘Strategic Bitcoin Reserve’ bill out of committee. Jordan Teuscher and Treasurer Marlo Oaks proposed the bill. The proposal is not yet legally binding since it has to pass through both chambers of the state legislature and also receives the governor’s approval. U.S. President Donald Trump also signed an executive order creating a new federal crypto working group. The group was charged with exploring the creation of a digital asset stockpile and making recommendations to make the country a leader in digital assets. The President also assigned crypto czar David Sacks to chair the new federal crypto working group.

The crypto downtrend wiped billions off the market cap as traders moved with whales dumping assets. On a positive note, crypto traders have pointed to upward metrics backing a higher price target after the short-term correction. Matt Hougan Cites Historical Patterns Despite the crypto crash, Matt Hougan explained that nothing has changed about the market, describing a short-term swing. In a recent X post , he added that the panic after market dips often translates to bullish momentum in the next phase. The crypto red wave increases sell pressure, as most traders, especially retail users, tend to offload assets. However, whales leverage the opportunity to accumulate at a lower cost, repositioning for the next upward march. This popular buy-the-dip narrative has held sway over the years, as shown by historical charts. In the last ten years, a 2% decline in SPX has resulted in a similar decrease in Bitcoin’s price, with gold often recording a 0.11% surge. “ My colleague @singularity7x did a great study on this. Over the past decade, if you look at all the days SPX has fallen 2% or more, bitcoin is down on average by 2.62%. Gold, by comparison, has risen 0.11% on average, showing it’s a better one-day hedge. But if you look out one year from these days, bitcoin is up 189% on average versus 7% for gold,” Hougan wrote. Bitcoin price has outperformed gold in recent years amid ongoing debates on both assets. Critics of the digital asset leader say price volatility can wipe out most gains for users tipping gold as a safer store of value. On the other hand, pro-crypto commentators say Bitcoin’s historical outlook shows an astronomical rise. Financial Analyst Backs Bitcoin CNBC’s Jim Cramer stated that Bitcoin is great on a portfolio backing its adoption amid present conditions. This sparked diverse reactions as holders look to an anticipated breakout over $115k above the all-time high. The popular “inverse Cramer” narrative was also visible, with users expecting a reversal like in the case of Nvidia. The AI chip manufacturer stock dipped 17% after Cramer tipped a breakout. The general crypto market is also expected to recover from positive sentiments from the United States market. A rise in altcoin inflow can also spark new optimism for decentralized finance.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|ETH,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-30 09:10:05

He predicts that Bitcoin’s traditional four-year cycle will become less intense, with shorter corrections, due to rising institutional adoption. Hougan highlighted the significance of Trump’s order and the SEC’s recent pro-crypto stance as key factors driving Bitcoin’s mainstream growth. On January 23, Trump signed an order to create a “national digital asset stockpile,” leading to a massive $1.9 billion surge in crypto investments. This decision, Hougan argues, has paved the way for major Wall Street firms and institutional investors to enter the market aggressively. Bitcoin’s latest cycle began in March 2023, when Grayscale won a critical legal battle against the SEC regarding a Bitcoin ETF. This victory set the stage for the launch of Bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, attracting billions in investments. However, Hougan believes Trump’s executive order will bring an even greater transformation. In his weekly memo, Hougan discussed how mainstream adoption is progressing beyond expectations. He envisions a scenario where banks will soon custody crypto assets alongside traditional investments, stablecoins will integrate into global payments, and major institutions will secure significant crypto holdings. These changes, he claims, could lead to the inflow of trillions of dollars into the crypto market. Bitcoin historically follows a four-year cycle driven by halving events, which reduce the mining rewards and impact price movements. The pattern typically consists of an accumulation phase, a bull run, and a subsequent downturn. Past declines occurred in 2014, 2018, and 2022, suggesting another drop in 2026 if history repeats itself. However, Hougan remains optimistic, citing the market’s maturity and a broader range of investors as reasons for a more resilient future. Looking ahead, Hougan predicts that 2025 will be a landmark year for Bitcoin, with prices potentially surpassing $200,000 . He attributes this growth to continued ETF inflows and increased adoption by corporations and governments. However, he acknowledges that this forecast might be conservative, as the crypto industry is evolving rapidly. Despite his optimism, Hougan cautions that the road ahead won’t be without challenges. He expects market excesses, leverage buildup, and potential bad actors to emerge, which could trigger temporary pullbacks. However, he believes any correction will be shorter and less severe than in previous cycles, thanks to the market’s increasing maturity and a stronger investor base. Regulatory shifts triggered by Trump’s order will take time to develop. Hougan estimates that crafting a new framework could take at least a year, while Wall Street firms may require even longer to fully integrate crypto into their operations. In the meantime, Bitcoin’s growth trajectory appears strong, supported by institutional backing and mainstream acceptance. In summary, Bitcoin’s cycle may be evolving, but its future remains promising. With institutional adoption accelerating and regulatory clarity improving, Hougan sees a path toward sustained growth, making 2025 a potentially historic year for the crypto market.",,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|BUSINESS|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-30 09:10:17
39689333,https://nulltx.com/?p=141800,1738228218,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Base Expands Access on xPortal as Layer 2 Adoption Surges,https://nulltx.com/base-expands-access-on-xportal-as-layer-2-adoption-surges/,"Another significant milestone has been achieved by Base , an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution. It is now fully available on xPortal. This allows users to buy, transfer, swap, and spend assets with an improved efficiency that promises to take on-chain applications to a whole new level. For us at Base, it is just another step—which we are very happy to have taken—toward our mission of providing a secure, low-cost, and developer-friendly Layer 2 that allows users everywhere to interact effectively with on-chain applications. The ongoing surge in Base adoption has propelled the network’s economic activity to new heights, with the GDP relating to transaction fees hitting an all-time high of 7x. This is a new way of looking at how efficient and effective the Base blockchain is. For every dollar in transaction fees, our users directed seven times as much capital toward on-chain services. Base’s Economic Growth: GDP to Transaction Fees at Record Levels One of the most prominent indicators of Base’s success is its quarterly GDP relative to transaction fees, which soared to about 7x in Q4. This metric points to Base users significantly boosting the network’s economic activity—which, in our view, is a pretty darn good sign. If you think about it, as an end user, what could be a better indicator than the network itself being significantly more economically productive than it was just a few months (or years) prior? This means that for each $1 spent on transaction fees, users were able to produce $7 worth of on-chain economic activity. This is fundamentally different from traditional blockchain systems, where high gas fees tend to keep users away. Base is able to achieve a 7:1 activity-to-spending ratio because it can maximize user capital efficiency. This makes Base a much more desirable venue for both retail users and developers. Furthermore, GDP for the overall Base quarterly was $181 million, which serves as a clear signal of the growing adoption of the Base platform. While this number comes in substantially below Ethereum’s $1.1 billion figure, the momentum behind Base suggests it could continue closing that gap as Layer 2 solutions gain even greater adoption. The Role of Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) in Base’s Growth Base’s economic expansion is being driven primarily by capital formation, which is the fundamental use case for crypto. Not surprisingly, decentralized exchanges have been the key engine for Base’s GDP. Two platforms in particular—Aerodrome Finance (@AerodromeFi) and Uniswap (@Uniswap)—have accounted for almost all the economic activity on Base over the past year. This trend spotlights the emerging dominance of DeFi on Base, with users actively trading, providing liquidity, and participating in various yield-generating activities. With each passing day, as more users and more liquidity migrate to Base, the network is positioning itself as a serious contender for the DeFi crown, right alongside Optimism, Arbitrum, and several other low-cost, high-speed Ethereum alternatives. Base’s ecosystem is increasingly home to decentralized exchanges. That’s a sign of something much larger afoot: the broader market trend of migrating from Ethereum to alternatives that offer efficiency and cost-effectiveness. And Base is a clear L2 standout in the work of doing just that. Gas fees on Ethereum aren’t dropping anytime soon. And those that pay them are gaining a staggering amount of value and a staggering number of traders. How Base Stacks Up Against Ethereum’s GDP Despite substantial progress on the part of Base in the sphere of economic activity, when it comes to overall GDP, Ethereum remains the commanding leader. For the most recent quarter, the figures show that Ethereum’s GDP reached $1.1 billion, well ahead of Base’s $181 million. But it’s worth noting that Base is just on its steep growth curve, and with the combination of its architecture and the economic incentives it provides, it could some day challenge Ethereum’s dominance among Layer 2 solutions. For additional context, at the zenith of 2021’s bull market, Ethereum was enjoying a run rate of about $10 billion in GDP. We’re using this as a historical benchmark to reference the potential scale and scope of on-chain economic activity, with the belief that Base’s increasing adoption might push it to much higher GDP figures in future market cycles. As institutional and retail interest in Layer 2 solutions ramps up, Base’s offerings make it a top contender for future DeFi expansion and wider blockchain adoption. Base is efficient, low-cost, and user-friendly—making it a perfect fit for the next wave of decentralized finance and blockchain application development. Base’s Future Outlook: What’s Next? The most recent developments concerning Base—its total integration with xPortal and its unprecedented high GDP concerning transaction fees—portend a very bright future for the network. In this heightened search for Layer 2 solutions that are both low-cost and fast, it seems that the upward trend of Base is set to continue. Key elements that could turbocharge the adoption of Base include: 1. More DeFi and NFT Projects—The unceasing expansion of decentralized exchanges, lending protocols, and NFT marketplaces on Base will fuel even more economic activity. 2. Enhanced Developer Incentives – Base is an ecosystem friendly to developers; the more of them we can attract to launch creative, new applications, the more robust and resilient our ecosystem becomes. 3. Institutional interest – If institutional investors start putting money into Base-based projects, it could see an even sharper increase in its GDP. 4. Network Congestion Ethereum – The more congested and expensive Ethereum’s mainnet becomes, the greater the demand for efficient L2 alternatives like Base. Base, with its strong grounding in DeFi, a burgeoning user base, and efficient transaction fees, may just be the most serious contender yet for the new alt-L1 throne. Its blueprint for what a blockchain can and should be offers a compelling argument for why Layer 2s don’t have to be terrible. Conclusion: Base’s Expansion Marks a Major Milestone in Layer 2 Growth xPortal now has Base available in full. Moreover, its GDP-to-transaction fee ratio was recently set at a record high, which makes it safe to say that Base influences the Layer 2 ecosystem more and more each day. The influence is not happening in a vacuum, either, as Base is still part of the Ethereum blockchain, which remains the leader in Web3 economic activity. Base, targeting user adoption, developer interest, and capital accumulation, has the potential to become one of the most used Layer 2 solutions and to redefine the future of blockchain transactions.

BTFD Coin the Next Big Thing – The Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Right Now,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-goastseus-maximus-peak-btfd-coin-the-next-big-thing-the-top-new-meme-coins-to-invest-in-right-now/,"Goatseus Maximus (GOAT) is a prime example of how early investments in meme cryptocurrencies can lead to massive profits. When GOAT was first launched, its price was incredibly low, but as the token gained traction, it skyrocketed in value, making early investors significant returns. This mirrors the success stories of other meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, where early participants capitalized on a low entry price and saw exponential growth. Now, BTFD presents a similar opportunity. Currently in its 14th presale stage, BTFD is drawing attention with projections of substantial growth, similar to what we saw with Goatseus Maximus. Just like early GOAT investors, those who enter BTFD at this stage could see impressive returns as the project matures and gains momentum in the market. For investors looking to take advantage of low entry prices before a potential explosion in value, BTFD offers a comparable chance to profit from the next big thing in the crypto world. While BTFD Coin may be taking the lead with its unique presale, Goatseus Maximus is no slouch, showing impressive growth and an expanding community. So buckle up, because we’re diving into the world of meme coins and checking out two projects that are set to take things to the next level. Here’s a closer look at why these projects are drawing so much attention, and whether they should be on your radar as we roll into 2025. BTFD Coin: A Meme Coin Revolution in the Making If you’re a meme coin enthusiast, then you’ve probably heard the buzz about BTFD Coin . With its viral presale success and dedicated community, this project is already making waves as one of the top new meme coins to invest in right now. Launched with the goal of not only bringing laughs but also making its investors some serious cash, BTFD Coin is different. For one, its presale is one of the hottest on the market right now. When the presale kicked off, BTFD was priced at a ridiculously low $0.000004 per coin. Fast forward to today, and the price has skyrocketed to $0.00016, with a total of 68 billion coins sold, and over 9,800 investors already locked in. What’s really caught the attention of investors, though, is the referral program. BTFD Coin is allowing people to multiply their gains by bringing in new investors. In short, the more people you refer, the more BTFD you can grab, and that can mean some serious profits as the presale continues to heat up. The referral program is making waves, especially considering how many meme coins fail to offer such innovative mechanisms. With this program, BTFD is setting itself apart from the herd of other meme coins out there, giving its community an actual way to earn passive income while spreading the word. Analysts are predicting that BTFD Coin will see its value soar once the presale ends and the coin hits exchanges. According to some forecasts, the price could potentially jump to as high as $0.0006 per coin by the time it’s listed. That would be a solid return on investment, especially for those who have been in the presale early. For meme coin lovers and savvy investors alike, this could be the next big thing. If you’re looking for the top new meme coins to invest in right now, the BTFD presale is hands-down one of the most exciting and promising opportunities available. Goatseus Maximus: A Meme Coin with Major Potential Many investors are now looking back at Goatseus Maximus and realising they missed a golden opportunity during its early ICO days. At launch, the coin was priced incredibly low, and those who managed to get in early are already reaping the rewards as its community and value continue to grow. While it didn’t have the explosive presale numbers of BTFD Coin, Goatseus Maximus has built solid momentum, and many believe it’s on the verge of a major breakout. What made Goatseus Maximus special during its early ICO phase was its unique blend of meme culture with real-world utility. It wasn’t just another coin riding purely on hype; it had the potential for long-term use cases that could make it more sustainable than your typical meme coin. Early investors saw the value in this and got in before the project began to gain serious traction. Now, the coin’s growing popularity and increasing recognition from niche communities make it a coin worth keeping an eye on—especially for those who missed the chance to invest when the price was at its lowest. Conclusion: The Future of Meme Coins Is Now The meme coin market has evolved significantly, and today, projects like Goatseus Maximus are showcasing the serious profit potential that meme coins can offer. Many investors are looking back and realising they missed the chance to get in early on these projects, with prices already on the rise. If you want to capitalise on this viral trend and position yourself for potential profits, now is the time to get involved in the BTFD Coin presale. As the presale progresses, prices are expected to continue increasing, and this could be your final opportunity to secure a low entry price before it goes mainstream. Don’t let this opportunity slip by—join the BTFD Coin presale today and set yourself up for potential gains, just like the early investors who got in at the ground floor of other successful meme coins.

Originally dismissed as a joke, meme coins have become a serious force in the market, generating massive returns for investors who get in early. From the wild days of Dogecoin’s rise to the multi-billion-dollar success of Shiba Inu, meme coins prove that community-driven projects can create real wealth. These tokens thrive on their strong social media presence, viral marketing, and the ability to rally millions of investors around a fun, often irreverent theme. Among the best crypto to invest in right now, one project stands out: BTFD Coin. This bullish meme coin is making headlines for its explosive presale performance, attracting thousands of investors eager to capitalize on its early-stage growth. Unlike most meme coins that rely solely on hype, BTFD Coin has managed to garner analyst predictions of exponential returns due to its well-structured ecosystem and strong investor backing. With Bonk, Peanut the Squirrel, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin also holding strong positions in the meme coin space, let’s break down why these five cryptos are worth watching in 2025. 1. BTFD Coin – The Meme Coin Presale That Has Analysts Buzzing Meme coin presales don’t always turn heads, but BTFD Coin is different. Riding the wave of its bullish branding and strong community backing, this Ethereum-based meme coin has already positioned itself as one of the most hyped crypto investments of 2025. The presale success is undeniable. With over 9,800 holders already backing the project and more than $5.78 million raised, BTFD Coin has outperformed expectations. Investors who jumped in early have secured tokens at $0.00016 each, with many analysts predicting a significant surge upon launch. Some projections suggest that if BTFD Coin reaches $0.0006, early investors could see a 3.75x return. A more optimistic scenario, where the token climbs to $0.006, would yield an astonishing 37.5x return—a massive upside for early adopters. Beyond the numbers, BTFD Coin’s success lies in its community-driven ecosystem and strong brand identity. With the “Buy The Dip” mantra fueling its growth, investors see it as a movement rather than just another meme coin. With presale momentum still building, BTFD Coin is undeniably one of the best crypto to invest in for 2025. 2. Bonk – Solana’s Meme Coin Powerhouse Bonk has taken the Solana blockchain by storm, proving that dog-themed meme coins aren’t going anywhere. As the first major meme coin built on Solana, Bonk benefits from low fees and lightning-fast transactions, making it a favorite among traders and meme coin enthusiasts alike. What makes Bonk unique is its aggressive community-driven distribution model. Unlike many projects that rely on large-scale token sales, Bonk airdropped tokens to thousands of Solana users, ensuring an engaged and diverse holder base. This strategy has paid off, as Bonk has maintained strong market interest and continues to be one of the most actively traded Solana tokens. In recent months, Bonk’s trading volume and adoption have surged, with more exchanges listing the token. As meme coins continue to dominate retail interest, Bonk remains a top contender and one of the best crypto to invest in for 2025. 3. Peanut the Squirrel – A Viral Sensation with Strong Market Growth Meme coins often thrive on internet culture and viral moments, and Peanut the Squirrel is no exception. Inspired by a real-life viral story involving a pet squirrel named Peanut, this Solana-based meme coin quickly became a favorite among traders looking for the next big trend. What sets Peanut apart is its rapid adoption and community engagement. Following its Coinbase listing in January 2025, the token experienced a 30% surge in price, reaching a trading volume of over $761 million within 24 hours. This level of demand shows that Peanut the Squirrel has successfully tapped into meme coin enthusiasm. Despite the recent correction from its all-time high of $2.44, analysts see strong potential in Peanut’s long-term growth. With its strong narrative, exchange listings, and active community, Peanut the Squirrel is proving to be one of the best crypto to invest in for 2025. 4. Shiba Inu – The Meme Coin That Won’t Be Dethroned Shiba Inu continues to dominate as one of the most recognizable and valuable meme coins in the market. Originally launched as a Dogecoin competitor, SHIB has evolved into a fully-fledged ecosystem with DeFi integration, staking rewards, and the Shibarium Layer 2 solution. A major driver of SHIB’s success is ShibaSwap, the token’s decentralized exchange, which allows investors to earn passive income through staking and liquidity pools. Additionally, the Shibarium upgrade has significantly improved network scalability and transaction efficiency, increasing developer interest in building within the SHIB ecosystem. With a market cap still sitting in the billions and continued innovation within its ecosystem, Shiba Inu remains one of the best crypto to invest in for 2025, proving that established meme coins can still provide massive returns. 5. Dogecoin – The Original Meme Coin That Still Holds Strong No meme coin list is complete without Dogecoin. As the original meme coin, Dogecoin has successfully maintained its position as a top cryptocurrency for over a decade. Dogecoin’s strength lies in its mass adoption and widespread acceptance. Unlike newer meme coins that primarily rely on speculation, DOGE is actually used for transactions, tipping, and even payments at major businesses. The token remains a favorite of Elon Musk, whose tweets and endorsements have historically driven massive price surges. Dogecoin’s liquidity and stability make it an attractive option for investors looking for a safer meme coin investment. With strong trading volume, an active user base, and institutional interest, Dogecoin remains one of the best crypto to invest in for 2025. Conclusion: Which Meme Coin Will Lead in 2025? With meme coins continuing to dominate the market, BTFD Coin, Bonk, Peanut the Squirrel, Shiba Inu, and Dogecoin are among the best crypto to invest in for 2025. Each offers unique advantages, from strong presale performance and viral potential to long-term stability and institutional adoption. BTFD Coin is setting new standards in meme coin presale success, with analysts predicting major returns upon launch. Bonk remains the top Solana meme coin, benefiting from fast transactions and an engaged community. Peanut the Squirrel capitalizes on viral internet culture, proving that real-world trends can translate into crypto success. Shiba Inu continues to grow its ecosystem and DeFi presence, while Dogecoin maintains its legacy as the most widely accepted meme coin. For investors looking to capitalize on the next wave of meme coin mania, these five cryptos are leading the charge. But if you’re looking for the highest potential return, BTFD Coin’s presale momentum and bullish predictions make it a must-watch investment. With over $5.78 million raised and 68 billion tokens sold, time is running out to secure your spot before the next price surge. Don’t miss your chance—BTFD Coin could be your best crypto investment of 2025.

The company will not hire MIT alumni as long as Gensler remains at the institution, further deepening tensions between the crypto industry and regulators. Gensler, who previously led the SEC’s crackdown on cryptocurrencies, has resumed teaching at the MIT Sloan School of Management . This decision sparked backlash from Winklevoss, who made it clear that Gemini refuses to associate with Gensler in any capacity. “As long as MIT has any connection to Gary Gensler, Gemini will not employ its graduates, not even for internships,” he stated on X. Cameron Winklevoss has not issued a separate statement but has supported calls for a wider industry boycott. Erik Voorhees, founder of Venice.ai, joined the debate, urging crypto firms to follow Gemini’s lead and refuse to hire from MIT. He argued that Gensler’s tenure at the SEC damaged the industry and that institutions supporting him should face consequences. The Winklevoss twins have long advocated for pro-crypto policies and are politically active, donating heavily to candidates who back digital assets. Their opposition to Gensler stems from what they view as excessive regulation and hostility toward crypto under his leadership. This controversy has led to discussions among MIT alumni and students. Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, questioned whether MIT alumni would push back against Gensler’s return. Matt Huang, co-founder of crypto investment firm Paradigm and an MIT graduate, has encouraged other alumni in the crypto space to connect and discuss the situation. Coinbase CLO Paul Grewal, another MIT graduate, has already responded, signaling that the debate is gaining traction. Many in the crypto community support Winklevoss, seeing Gensler as a threat to innovation. Some even suggest broader hiring bans on institutions that continue to support him. However, others argue that Gensler’s return to academia should not be politicized. Some have pointed out that his MIT lectures before joining the SEC were insightful, even if his performance as SEC chair disappointed them. While Gemini takes this bold stance, it is also dealing with its own regulatory issues. The company recently settled a case with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC ), agreeing to pay a $5 million fine without admitting wrongdoing. It also announced its withdrawal from the Canadian market due to increased regulatory pressures. As the debate over academia, regulation, and the crypto industry intensifies, the long-term impact on MIT and the sector remains uncertain.",,EN,0,0,REGULATION|COMMODITY|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-30 09:15:39

This price movement has, of course, attracted the attention and now the speculation of both retail traders and institutional investors alike. But is it really something we should be buying into and be bullish on? Or are we being set up for another in this series of “last chance” tops that we should be avoiding on our way down? Even though the number of new addresses being created every day is increasing, the overall user count isn’t. The only people left using the token tend to be trading in large amounts. These “whales” are, by and large, the only TOSHI users left. Retail traders using TOSHI in any significant way don’t exist, which means the token’s current price pump (if it even can be called that) isn’t being fueled by any significant grassroots revival, which makes us wonder how far this uptrend can go. Whale Games Behind the Price Rally? Even though the daily number of new TOSHI addresses has skyrocketed, a closer look at the seven-day averages shows that the number of new active addresses is actually under 10. So, what does this mean? Does it mean that TOSHI truly has not achieved mass retail adoption yet? Because the constant barrage of new TOSHI price all-time highs suggests otherwise. But, this could be true. TOSHI price hikes could be the result of concentrated trading, with a relatively small group of influential holders often referred to as TOSHI whales. This trend is further supported by transaction data. Even though the total daily transaction volume and frequency have risen slightly, there has not been a significant increase in activity among existing users of retail. The increase in transaction amounts is most noticeable in instances where the sum is over $100,000. This level of activity suggests that the big players in the market are the ones securing perceived profits and that there is not widespread participation in the market at this point in time. The number of small-scale transactions is further underlining this situation. On Sunday, for instance, there were just 13 recorded transactions under $1,000, which is a clear sign that the retail trader just isn’t there right now. If the average investor isn’t in this market, then the current price surge is even more suspect than it would be otherwise. After all, when prices increase without more stupid retail on the other side of the trade, is the price surge anything more than whale market-making? A Glimmer of Hope: Balanced Token Distribution Even though there’s whale-driven activity that might not be good for TOSHI holders, there’s a bright side. Unlike many other memecoins and high-volatility tokens, TOSHI’s token distribution is relatively balanced. True, the whales control the majority of the supply, but at least the concentration of ownership isn’t as extreme as it is in some other speculative cryptoassets. This indicates that if retail traders start entering the Bitcoin market in larger numbers, a more organic price discovery process could be in Bitcoin’s future. With the potential for price discovery to take place, TOSHI could go from an asset largely acted upon by whales to one in which a much more dispersed set of participants plays their part in acting upon and within the asset. What’s Next for TOSHI? With TOSHI’s price having risen 600% in just one month, all eyes are on whether the token can maintain its newfound momentum or if whale-driven market activity will lead to sharp price corrections. Whether the token’s future trajectory leans more toward continued ascent or correction will be determined by several key factors: 1. Retail Uptake – Should a larger number of small traders take part, TOSHI could experience a much more stable, much more organic growth model compared to the current variant. 2. Profit-Taking by Whales – If large holders begin to sell off their positions, a rapid price correction may ensue. 3. On-Chain Activity – An ongoing upsurge in transaction volume from a variety of wallet addresses would suggest that the market is moving toward equilibrium. At present, TOSHI is one of the most thrilling and unpredictable tokens in the marketplace, but investors should be careful. The token lacks a solid retail following, which means that any current upward price movement could just be a flash. Watch on-chain data closely to see if TOSHI can keep its recent upward momentum or if it’s on track to test support in a more bearish environment.

Illinois is pushing for a Bitcoin reserve fund, while Indiana is focusing on blockchain applications and Bitcoin investment through ETFs. Illinois State Representative John M. Cabello introduced House Bill 1844 (HB1844) , known as the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act. The bill recognizes Bitcoin as a decentralized and limited asset that could serve as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. The proposed reserve would be managed by the State Treasurer and allow Bitcoin donations from residents and government entities. Bitcoin added to the fund would be held for at least five years before being sold, transferred, or converted. The bill also includes rules for transparency, requiring regular reports on fund management. Meanwhile, Indiana’s approach differs slightly. House Bill 1322 , introduced by Representative Jake Teshka and co-authored by Representatives Shane Lindauer and Cory Criswell, focuses on both blockchain integration and Bitcoin investment. It directs the Department of Administration to explore how blockchain technology can improve government efficiency, security, and services. Additionally, the bill allows state-managed funds, including public employees' retirement funds and state teachers' retirement funds, to invest in approved Bitcoin ETFs. These ETFs include both spot Bitcoin ETFs, which hold Bitcoin directly, and Bitcoin futures ETFs , which track Bitcoin prices through derivatives. This movement aligns with initiatives in states like Utah and Arizona, which are advancing legislation to invest public funds in digital assets. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has also made the Bitcoin Reserve a priority for 2025. Other states, including South Dakota and Kentucky, may follow with similar proposals. As more states consider Bitcoin as part of their financial strategy, the impact of these policies on state economies and public investments remains to be seen.",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-30 09:18:52

The two firms completed a joint proof of concept (PoC) for the issuing of a token on the Polygon Amoy Testnet, which was listed as a trading pair with an e-money token, according to an emailed announcement on Thursday. ""The deployment of 21X's on-chain order book smart contract enabled trading between tokenized cash and the tokenized asset in one single transaction,"" the firms said. Frankfurt-based 21X, which is building a blockchain-based exchange to list and trade tokenized securities, won approval from German regulator BaFin in December. Tokenization - the representation of real-world assets such as stocks or bonds as tokens on a blockchain - has become an area of interest among traditional financial (TradFi) firms in recent years. Blockchain-native companies such as 21X securing regulatory approval in major financial centers means TradFi companies can enter partnerships with them to advance their tokenization plans with greater confidence.

Onyxcoin’s token ( XCN ) soared to an intraday high of $0.0394, pushing its market cap to over $1.16 billion as of the last check on Thursday afternoon, Asian time. Today’s rally extended the altcoin’s weekly gains to over 195%, while its monthly gains surged past 1,400%, making it one of the best-performing crypto assets over the past 30 days. XCN’s rally was accompanied by a surge in demand and trading activity. Over the past 24 hours, the altcoin’s daily trading volume jumped 60% to over $627 million, while open interest in its futures market soared 73% to an all-time high of $38.98 million per CoinGlass. Why is XCN going up? XCN surged after Onyx teased its upcoming white paper and the launch of its new blockchain, the Onyx XCN Ledger. Crypto assets typically tend to rally ahead of major announcements that support the ecosystem’s growth. Further, the token was recently listed on Kraken Pro, enabling users to trade XCN with up to 20x leverage. Additionally, Onyx’s official account shared that it had been nominated for listing on Binance Next pool, which allows users to predict which tokens will be listed next on Binance’s Futures market. You might also like: How will the FOMC decision affect Bitcoin and altcoin prices? Crypto exchange AscendEX has also announced plans to list XCN, which has further strengthened bullish momentum. Investor demand for XCN also rose after the XCN community passed OIP-52 after settling long-standing issues with HTX Global and Tron founder Justin Sun. The proposal which is yet to be deployed, will see Sun and HTX play an active role in Onyx DAO governance. “This OIP will enhance Onyx Protocol through the expertise, experience, and credibility that Justin Sun and HTX bring through their participation in the DAO,” a part of the proposal reads. XCN technical analysis XCN price, 50-day and 200-day MA — Jan. 30 |Source: crypto.news On the daily chart, the XCN price has gone parabolic and is positioned above the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, which means the buying pressure is still up. Typically, when the 50-day MA is also above the 200-day MA, assets tend to continue their rally over the upcoming days. XCN Supertrend and CMF chart — Jan. 30 |Source: crypto.news The MACD lines are pointing upwards, while the Supertrend line remains below the asset’s price, both signs that the uptrend remains strong. While the Chaikin Money Flow index remained positive suggesting a continuous inflow of capital into the XCN market. However, the token’s Relative Strength Index has been hovering in the overbought zone above 70 since Jan. 15, raising the likelihood of a potential pullback or consolidation if buying momentum starts to wane.

Known for its innovative cross-border payment solutions and lucrative staking rewards, Remittix offers a fresh opportunity in the DeFi market. As whales turn their attention from heavyweights to new assets, Remittix’s explosive growth makes it a front-runner for huge returns in the crypto industry. Cardano and Binance Coin Whales Switch to Remittix For Bigger Gains Remittix (RTX) is a DeFi project that transforms the remittance sector with quick, secure and low-cost cross-border payments. The platform overcomes the drawbacks of regular money transfer services and rapidly becomes a preferred choice for individuals and businesses. Crypto experts recognize Remittix as a competitor to established payment providers like Stripe and Wise and crypto-exclusive platforms like Coinbase. Unlike conventional platforms offering streamlined solutions, Remittix provides crypto-fiat payment services. The platform accepts over 50 cryptocurrencies and 30 fiat currencies to simplify international commerce for users. The platform passed a robust smart contract audit to ensure users and investors a transparent and safe experience. The liquidity pool and team tokens are locked for three years to ensure trust and stability, demonstrating its long-term commitment to its environment. An additional feature of Remittix is its Pay API, which allows companies to recognize crypto payments and convert them to fiat. This will enable retailers to manage digital assets and create an inclusive financial ecosystem. The platform’s core token is its native RTX, which offers governance and staking rewards. Staking earns investors up to 8% APY. A VIP tier program also provides enhanced benefits, with Tier 3 members enjoying up to 18% APY, exclusive voting rights and premium perks. This makes the platform ideal for long-term investors. The total supply of $RTX is fixed at 1.5 billion tokens, making it a highly sought-after asset. Its ICO has already raised over $9.6 million, reflecting strong investor interest. Priced at $0.0479, analysts predict the token could surge to $1 by year-end, offering an impressive 5,000% return for early adopters. Binance Coin’s (BNB) January Price Woes Continue Binance Coin (BNB) has seen lukewarm trading recently, but its price has remained at $672. The altcoin’s total trade volume is $1.7 billion, down by 20.5%. Meanwhile, BNB’s market value currently sits at $96.2 billion, reflecting a slight 1.49% increase. Open interest, which tracks unresolved transactions, has fallen to $991 million, highlighting waning enthusiasm for BNB trading. Over $300,000 worth of Binance Coin trades were recently closed as buyers exited positions due to falling prices. Despite President Trump’s directives supporting the crypto industry, Binance Coin (BNB) faces challenges. Experts attribute this to increased selling activity, making recovering the price more challenging. Market participants now await a rise in demand that could help push Binance Coins price upward. Cardano Likely to Reach $2 in February Cardano (ADA) is in a tough period and its price is dropping sharply. CoinMarketCap tracks a loss of about 9.5% during the last twenty-four hours, placing ADA at $0.90. This drop is linked to large-scale sell-offs by whales, which have unsettled investors and raised concerns about the coin’s near-term performance. Analysts at CoinCodex predict ADA could reach $2 by February 20 , 2025, reflecting a 111% market gain. Investors also anticipate Cardano hitting $2.61 in mid-April, which would mark a 169% increase in value. However, Changelly forecasts a more conservative peak value of $1.46 during April , with prices likely below $2. Despite price challenges, the Cardano ecosystem continues to grow. There are 50,000 active addresses indicating network activity. Experts forecast an uptrend might start if Cardano’s advancements continue. Remittix Emerges as The Most Sought-after DeFi Asset Remittix is emerging as a sought-after DeFi asset, offering cross-border payment solutions and staking rewards. Several BNB and Cardano whales have stormed in, as Remittix raised over $9.5 million in ICO funding in record time. Analysts view RTX as a promising opportunity in the crypto space, especially with the introduction of a pro-crypto U.S. government. For investors looking for assets with more significant growth potential, Remittix is a top choice.

Makes Bitcoin Reserve a 2025 Priority,https://coinpaprika.com/news/texas-lt-gov-makes-bitcoin-reserve-a-2025-priority,"Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has named a Bitcoin Reserve a top priority for 2025 , despite previously criticizing the state’s crypto mining industry. Other initiatives on his agenda include “Texas D.O.G.E.” and upgrades to the electrical grid, which could benefit Bitcoin miners. Texas has been at the forefront of state-level Bitcoin reserves , with around 15 states currently working on similar legislation. Although national efforts have faced setbacks, Patrick has reaffirmed Texas’ commitment by listing the Bitcoin Reserve as a key focus for the upcoming legislative session. The push for a national Bitcoin Reserve gained momentum in recent months, but President Trump’s executive order to create a “digital stockpile” was not Bitcoin-specific and did not involve the Federal Reserve. Some fear this move could weaken the drive for a national Bitcoin Reserve, but Texas is determined to move forward. Patrick announced 25 bills as top priorities, with another 15 to follow. While not all directly impact the crypto sector, the Bitcoin Reserve and Texas D.O.G.E. proposals stand out. Patrick addressed concerns that certain initiatives were missing, stating that many more bills will pass and contribute to the state’s economy. Several other high-priority bills will indirectly support the Bitcoin industry, particularly through crypto mining. Texas has become a major hub for mining, attracting several companies in the past year. Investments in energy infrastructure, such as power grid improvements, will likely benefit the sector. Crypto advocate Mario Nawfal reacted to the news, emphasizing the significance of a state holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet. ""A US state moving to hold BTC ? That’s next-level adoption,"" he said. However, Patrick’s support for Bitcoin is a recent development. He has held office for a decade without making strong pro-crypto statements and even criticized the mining industry last year. While listing the Bitcoin Reserve as a priority is a step forward, the bill still needs to pass before Texas officially starts accumulating Bitcoin.",,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MINING|DOGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-30 09:23:13

Many believed the markets may exhibit extreme volatility ahead of FOMC but the fresh rates offered a significant push to the BTC price and also the other altcoins. Meanwhile, Litecoin’s price seems to have been preparing for the breakout, as it triggered a strong rebound much before the FOMC and, amid the SEC’s review of the ETF application, surged by over 14%. LTC price surged 14% upon an acknowledgement of ETF; where will the price head once it is approved? Litecoin is considered one of the most undervalued tokens as it is the first crypto after Bitcoin, which is still working. In the times when the token appeared dead for many, the LTC price displayed a huge bullish move. The LTC price rally has been restricted below $100 through the year 2023 and 2024 and now that the price is consolidating above the range since the start of 2025, a new ATH seems to be imminent this year. The weekly chart of LTC price shows the price is preparing for the next bullish action as the levels have sustained above the 200-day MA. Moreover, the 50/200 day weekly MA is heading for a bullish crossover, known as Golden Cross, which may further push the price beyond the resistance at $205. Besides, the MACD, which was about to undergo a bearish crossover, quickly displayed a bullish divergence and revived bullish hopes. Hence, the Litecoin price is believed to break above the prevailing consolidation and rise above the pivotal range of around $150. The rise in volume suggests a rise in the trader’s participation, which may eventually increase the volatility of the token. Therefore, the price, which has been within the top 20, is soon believed to enter the top 15 as the bulls are primed to elevate the levels beyond $300.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,TRADING|LTC|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-30 09:24:52

While steady rates usually slow down investments in high-risk assets, major cryptocurrencies saw a small boost, with Bitcoin, Solana, and XRP rising about 2% after the announcement. This decision follows three rate cuts in late 2024 but suggests policymakers are not yet ready for further reductions. The Fed’s stance means capital won’t flow quickly into speculative markets, but a pause in hikes is generally positive for risk assets, including crypto. When interest rates stay high, traditional investments like bonds remain attractive, keeping investors cautious about riskier bets. However, if rates stay stable or eventually decline, crypto could benefit from increased liquidity. Market reactions were mixed. Some analysts see this as a ""hawkish pause"" , indicating the economy is stable enough to avoid aggressive tightening. This environment can support crypto markets, which rely on liquidity and investor confidence. Despite keeping rates unchanged, the Fed removed references to progress toward its 2% inflation target, suggesting further cuts aren’t coming soon. However, strong employment numbers and steady economic growth reduce fears of a recession, supporting speculative assets like Bitcoin. President Trump had urged the Fed to continue cutting rates, but policymakers decided to hold their current position. The crypto market will now closely watch for any signs of future liquidity expansion. Until then, altcoins may struggle compared to Bitcoin, which remains the safer option due to its strong institutional backing and macroeconomic resilience .",,EN,0,0,MARKET|BTC|BUSINESS|ALTCOIN|FIAT,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-30 09:26:32

The decision will slightly shift the country’s approach to crypto regulation, where accepting BTC payments will become optional for private businesses. According to a Reuters report on January 29, the legislation was ratified within minutes of being sent by President Nayib Bukele. With the majority of Congress hailing from Bukele’s New Ideas Party, the measure passed swiftly, receiving 55 votes in favor and only two against. Elisa Rosales, a lawmaker from the ruling party, said the reforms were necessary to ensure Bitcoin’s continued status as legal tender while making its use within the country’s jurisdiction more “practical.” El Salvador accepts IMF’s plea, plans to acquire more BTC still in play The legislative decision comes after El Salvador secured a $1.3 billion loan deal with the IMF in December 2024. As part of the agreement, the government agreed to scale back its embrace of Bitcoin, where the country’s private sector’s acceptance of Bitcoin will now become voluntary. Per a December 10 report from the Financial Times, the IMF agreement is expected to pave the way for $2 billion in loans from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. It is also designated to support macroeconomic adjustments and financial structural reforms in the country. El Salvador became the world’s first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, a move that initially drew sharp criticism from international financial institutions, including the IMF. The policy body urged the South American nation to repeal the law due to purported macroeconomic, legal and financial reasons. However, President Bukele and his administration stuck to their plans, persisting with their “buy one Bitcoin a day” strategy to build up a federal reserve. As of January 30, El Salvador holds 6,049 BTC, valued at approximately $634.44 million, according to data from its Bitcoin Office. The nation’s crypto portfolio has yielded a 129% profit, with an average purchase price of $46,000 per Bitcoin. The Bitcoin Office data also shows the country purchased 2 BTC for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve on January 27, taking its total additions to 14 coins in the last 10 days. President Bukele initiates crackdown on misuse of government funds In other developments, Nayib Bukele revealed in an X post on Thursday that he sent the Anti-Corrution Law proposal to the country’s Legislative Assembly, looking to “ strengthen transparency and integrity of public officials.” In his post , the El Salvador head outlined several reasons for the law’s relevance, which could see policymakers punished for partaking in corruption and misusing government funds. “Public servants and their families will be required to submit a wealth declaration along with their annual income tax return every year (this declaration will be published and accessible to any citizen),” denoted Bukele. Through the lawful mandate, he is pushing for the Court of Accounts to work directly with the Attorney General’s Office in auditing and investigating corrupt officials.

A 99.5% probability suggests that no rate changes are coming, but it’s clear that investors have largely accounted for the Fed’s hawkish posture. Nevertheless, the marché will be attentive to the digesting of remarks put forth by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who may well hold the key to the next major move—up or down—for stocks and cryptocurrencies alike. It’s FOMC Day! The Federal Reserve's rate decision is imminent, and the markets are on high alert. Crypto has been highly volatile recently, as traders anticipate today's announcement. Over the past week, major price swings have kept investors on edge, but now, all attention is… pic.twitter.com/7cekdfjpGO — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) January 29, 2025 Over the past week, the crypto market has been shaken by considerable unrest. Bitcoin (BTC), along with other major digital assets, has been swinging quite dramatically in price. Today’s announcement from the Fed could either work out nicely for crypto and traditional traders, providing a nice shot in the arm, or it could really rattle the markets. Given the uncertainty that Powell’s pronouncement could inject, most would prefer to see it injected in a non-rattle-friendly way. Bitcoin’s Future: Bullish Predictions and Institutional Adoption Short-term market upheaval, however, has had no impact on the long-term, mostly sunny, outlook for Bitcoin’s price. Indeed, many analysts, financial institutions, and investment firms seem to have doubled down in recent months on both the frequency and audacity of their price predictions. Hearing the forecasts can be a bit like listening to a group of kindergartners sing in unison but at different pitches. By 2025: A Surge to Six Figures? Analysts believe that within the next year, Bitcoin could exceed $100,000, and they point to these factors as the most likely causes of such a price explosion: institutional adoption, ETF inflows, and the cryptocurrency’s fixed supply. – Cathie Wood (ARK Invest): Sees BTC possibly hitting $500,000, driven by what she calls burgeoning institutional interest and Bitcoin’s scarcity-necessitated value appreciation. – Standard Chartered: Predicts BTC will reach $250,000, propelled by the inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and the 2024 Bitcoin halving’s influence. – Finder Panel: Projects that Bitcoin Cash could hit $150,000, propelled by post-FOMO (fear of missing out) accumulation. Additional near-term forecasts for March 2025 show a clear tendency for significant upward movement: – MarketWatch Analysis: BTC might hit $120,000 if the U.S. announces a strategic Bitcoin reserv, or if it green-lights ETFs that invest in BTC-versus only BTC and ETH. – Coinlore Forecast: Expects Bitcoin to trade between $97,636 and $112,334, with an average price of $106,323.30. Binance Forecast: Anticipates a 5% rise in the price of Bitcoin over the next month, with a possible peak at $103,253.57. – CoinCheckup Outlook: Forecasts BTC to trade at $111,516.33 within a week, signaling a possible short-term rally. Research from InvestingHaven places Bitcoin’s potential price in 2025 within a wide trading range of $85,500 to $165,000, with the average of their forecast coming in at $125,250. By 2030 and Beyond: A Multi-Million Dollar Asset? The long-term outlook for Bitcoin is even more positive. As it becomes more widely adopted and its supply continues to dwindle (thanks to the “halving” events that happen every four years), lots of analysts are projecting that Bitcoin will become a “multimillion-dollar asset.” – Cathie Wood (ARK Invest): Predicts that BTC will reach $1.5 million by 2030, attributing the increase to large-scale institutional adoption. PlanB’s Stock-to-Flow Model: Indicates that BTC might be anywhere from $1 million to $10 million, contingent essentially on global adoption. – Binance Prediction (2050): Anticipates BTC attaining a remarkable $11 million, should macroeconomic conditions continue to favor growth. – Changelly Projection (2050): Predicts BTC will be worth $3.8 million, based on steady inflation and ongoing supply scarcity. Bitcoin ETF Inflows Signal Institutional Confidence The adoption of Bitcoin by institutions keeps increasing , as seen in the current net inflows of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Net inflows into Bitcoin ETFs as of January 28, 2024, totaled $18.4379 million, with the largest Bitcoin ETF, BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, notching $30.1381 million in net inflows. The current state of play suggests Bitcoin is no longer an obscure asset and that big-name U.S. financial institutions are devoting considerable resources to it — something they wouldn’t do if they weren’t bullish on it. What’s Next for Bitcoin? While the market is poised for the FOMC decision today, Bitcoin’s upcoming move is likely to be influenced by not only the tone of Jerome Powell but also by a few broader macroeconomic factors. If the Fed signals that we should all get used to this brave new world of prolonged monetary tightening, the crypto markets could face renewed downward pressure. Conversely, if Powell comes off as neutral or even slightly dovish, the next price pump could be fueled by not just the usual suspects but also by some fresh buying from the Bitcoin shorts who got taken to school last week. As institutional involvement has surged, ETF inflows have swelled, and forecasts of Bitcoin’s long-term bullishness have become ubiquitous, the cryptocurrency’s future remains one of the most closely attended narratives in finance. Whether BTC hits $100,000 in 2025, or multiples of that sum in the decades to come, one is left to conclude that the continued inexorable march of crypto into the global financial system is a fait accompli.

The crypto exchange highlighted Solana’s “blazing transaction speeds, minimal costs, and developer-friendly tools” as key factors propelling its dominance. Pump.fun Boosts Solana’s Dominance Dune Analytics data revealed that Solana briefly captured an astounding 89.7% DEX market share during the last week of December. Over the past five weeks, the network has consistently maintained over 50% market dominance. Pump.fun has been instrumental in Solana’s rise , with volumes fluctuating week by week. Despite this variability, OKX suggested Solana’s dominance might be sustainable in the long term, given its superior performance in transaction fees, active wallet addresses, and platform usability. Trump Memecoins Propel Market Buzz A significant portion of Solana’s recent trading volume came from memecoins associated with former U.S. President Donald Trump and his wife Melania. The tokens launched just before and after Trump’s January 20 inauguration , respectively, reaching a combined market cap of over $20 billion at their peak. Jupiter, a Solana-native DEX platform, accounted for nearly 70% of Solana’s trading activity. OKX praised the platform for its ability to optimize slippage, provide accurate real-time pricing, and mitigate platform risks—further cementing Solana’s appeal as the “retail chain” of choice in DeFi markets. However, OKX pointed out that Ethereum and its layer 2 solutions still dominate in terms of weekly trading volumes per address and average trade sizes, indicating continued whale activity on the Ethereum network. While Solana shines with retail users, Ethereum remains the leader in total value locked (TVL) and liquidity pool quality. Ethereum Holds Its Ground Ethereum retains an 82% share of the tokenized real-world asset market, dwarfing Solana’s 2.5% share, according to data from 21Shares. Despite Solana’s rapid rise, OKX noted that Ethereum continues to be the “bedrock” for DeFi innovation. As Ethereum layer 2 solutions increasingly compete with Solana’s low fees and rapid transaction speeds, the future of Solana’s dominance may hinge on its ability to adapt, attract liquidity, and drive further development.

Table of Contents SOL institutional momentum defies short-term price dip Binance Coin’s deflationary strategy offsets market uncertainty DTX Exchange: The $0.16 altcoin poised for a quantum leap Key takeaways The cryptocurrency market is witnessing intriguing dynamics as established giants and emerging altcoins chart divergent paths. While Solana (SOL) and Binance Coin (BNB) exhibit bullish fundamentals despite recent price corrections, DTX Exchange (DTX) is capturing attention as a high-growth contender priced at just $0.16. With the Solana institutional adoption accelerating and Binance’s deflationary strategy strengthening Binance Coins’ scarcity, both assets remain critical pillars of the crypto ecosystem. However, DTX’s hybrid trading platform, boasting 1,000x leverage, 200,000 TPS throughput, and a $13.2 million presale surge, positions it as a potential dark horse for exponential gains in 2025. SOL institutional momentum defies short-term price dip Solana trades at $227, down 13% for the past 7 days, yet its ecosystem growth signals long-term resilience. Franklin Templeton and Société Générale recently deepened their Solana investments, citing its mobile tech innovations and cross-border payment solutions. Analysts like Armando Pantoja forecast a mid-2025 target of $1,000, driven by a 35% monthly surge and breakout from critical EMAs. The network’s developer activity remains robust, with hackathon registrations up 36% and transaction fee revenue jumping to 25% of total income. Solana’s integration of AI agents and app revenue dominance further solidify its blockchain leader position. Despite short-term volatility, its $110 billion market cap reflects strong institutional confidence, with technical indicators suggesting a rebound toward $300-$350 by year-end. Binance Coin’s deflationary strategy offsets market uncertainty BNB holds at $666, dipped 4% in the last 7 days amid broader market turbulence, but its deflationary tokenomics bolster investor sentiment. The Binance Foundation’s 30th quarterly burn removed 1.63 million Binance Coin (worth $1.16 billion) from circulation, including tokens lost during the BNB Chain Fusion upgrade. This brings the total burned Binance Coin to 42 million. While BNB’s $95 billion market cap reflects its dominance, the Auto-Burn mechanism’s price-responsive design ensures sustained value appreciation. Analysts note that reduced supply could propel Binance Coin toward new highs once market sentiment recovers, particularly with Binance’s regulatory compliance efforts gaining traction globally. You might also like: SOL sets sights on $200 as DTX gains momentum in the market DTX Exchange: The $0.16 altcoin poised for a quantum leap The presale of DTX Exchange has become the talk of crypto circles, raising $13.2 million in Stage 8 at $0.16 per token, just 20% below its $0.20 listing target. With 575,000 users onboarded, DTX’s VulcanX testnet achieves 200,000 TPS, eclipsing Solana’s 65,000 TPS. The platform’s 1,000x leverage enables $100,000 liquidity access with minimal capital, while its unified interface spans 120,000 currency pairs across crypto, stocks, and ETFs. The primary reasons behind the buzz are governance and profit sharing, as larger holders can influence product roadmaps and earn rebates, which is a powerful value proposition. Besides, tokenized ETFs bridge the regulatory issues, thus making them viable in jurisdictions where they are banned. Phoenix Wallet amplifies the ecosystem paradigm by offering secure custody solutions for many asset portfolios, ensuring users enjoy a genuine, wise experience managing their digital assets. Market analysts highlight DTX’s 600% presale ROI and predict 100x-200x gains post-listing, citing parallels to Binance’s early growth trajectory. The imminent Q1 2025 main net launch and ETF trading integration could trigger a supply shock, with exchange listings likely to amplify buying pressure. Key takeaways While Solana and Binance Coin remain cornerstone investments, DTX Exchange represents a rare convergence of innovation and accessibility. Its presale performance, outpacing 90% of 2025’s launches, combined with institutional-grade trading tools, positions it as a prime candidate for explosive growth. As the market anticipates DTX’s exchange debut and the Solana AI-driven upgrades, strategic diversification across these assets could define portfolio success in 2025’s bull cycle.

In his post, he outlined how ISO 20022 facilitates interoperability within traditional finance and how Omni Network, aims to leverage this standard to enhance the adoption of RLUSD , a stablecoin designed to bridge decentralized finance (DeFi) and traditional finance (TradFi). What did $XRP prioritize before any other crypto and processes over $434,000,000,000 each day? ISO 20022 — few people understand how important this is. Using $OMNI we are developing a mechanism to bring this to $RLUSD . Here is what's coming: pic.twitter.com/xasrRr7zCV — Austin King (@0xASK) January 29, 2025 ISO 20022: A Critical Standard for Financial Messaging ISO 20022 is a global messaging standard designed to improve communication between financial institutions by ensuring interoperability across banking networks. Major financial entities such as J.P. Morgan and Deutsche Bank already utilize this standard, reinforcing its importance in global transactions. King emphasized that XRP was among the first cryptocurrencies to prioritize ISO 20022 compliance , contributing to its ability to process over $434 billion daily. With the return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency, King believes that projects prioritizing ISO 20022 compliance will gain a strategic advantage. Given the renewed focus on financial infrastructure, regulatory clarity, and institutional adoption, he suggests that XRP’s positioning as an ISO 20022-compliant asset will be critical in the evolving financial landscape. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Omni Network and RLUSD: Expanding Interoperability Omni Network, known for its role in facilitating interoperability between blockchains, has recently announced an expansion of RLUSD into over $38 billion of new DeFi liquidity on devnet. King detailed how Omni is now working to establish RLUSD as the first ISO 20022-compliant stablecoin. By doing so, RLUSD could serve as a bridge between digital assets and the traditional banking system, opening new opportunities for institutional adoption. By integrating Omni’s interoperability solutions with XRP’s infrastructure, King envisions a seamless transfer of tokenized assets across financial networks. This integration aims to place XRP at the center of the on-chain economy by enabling banks to tokenize and distribute assets efficiently. XRP’s Expanding Role in Asset Tokenization According to King, Ripple is uniquely positioned to facilitate the tokenization of traditional financial assets, an industry expected to reach a valuation of tens of trillions of dollars. He argues that through deep integrations between Omni and XRP, these efforts can be accelerated, transforming XRP into a primary platform for financial institutions seeking to tokenize assets.

Analyst Weighs In,https://cryptopotato.com/how-high-could-bitcoin-go-in-this-bull-cycle-analyst-weighs-in/,"TL;DR Analyst Ali Martinez suggests Bitcoin (BTC) has more room for growth during this bull run before a potential cycle shift. Essential factors like reduced MVRV and negative exchange netflows support the thesis of further gains in the near future. The Possible Cycle Top The primary cryptocurrency has been on an evident uptrend in the past several months, charting substantial gains after Donald Trump’s win in the US presidential elections. Recall that Bitcoin (BTC) was trading at less than $70K prior to the voting, whereas a month later, it surpassed the psychological level of $100K for the first time in its existence . Despite the volatility, the solid performance continued, and on January 20 (hours before Trump’s inauguration), the asset tapped a new all-time high of almost $110,000. The next 10 days offered more turbulence before BTC stabilized at its current $105,000 (per CoinGecko’s data). BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko According to numerous industry participants, the valuation has yet to reach unseen peaks during this bull cycle. The popular X user Ali Martinez recently suggested that BTC could soar to as high as $184,000 before entering a bearish mode. He based his prediction on the assumption that cycle shifts typically occur once the price surpasses 2.4x the 200-day Simple Moving Average ( which is set at the depicted mark). Cycle shifts for #Bitcoin $BTC typically happen when it surpasses 2.4x the 200-day SMA. That key level currently stands at $184,600! pic.twitter.com/kbLpJ5AQd4 — Ali (@ali_charts) January 30, 2025 Many factors signal that BTC might indeed flourish in the following months. One of those includes the asset’s historical performance in February. As CryptoPotato reported , 8 of the last 12 Februaries saw BTC jumping by double digits. It is important to note that next month is a post-halving February, and all previous ones have resulted in impressive spikes. Bitcoin’s Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) and exchange netflow are also worth mentioning. The former metric has been hovering below the healthy level of 2.5 over the last several days, suggesting that the asset might have shifted toward undervalued territory. BTC’s exchange netflow has been predominantly negative in the past week, with outflows surpassing inflows. This could be interpreted as a transition from centralized platforms toward self-custody methods, which reduces the immediate selling pressure. Additional Bullish Predictions Martinez is not the only one envisioning further pumps for BTC in the near future . X user Captain Faibik observed the formation of a “broadening wedge pattern” to set a $120,000 target potentially reached in February. Michael van de Poppe and Jelle were also bullish. The former thinks a new ATH may occur in the coming weeks, while the latter believes $110K is “the final hurdle” before “a new leg of price discovery awaits.” The post How High Could Bitcoin Go in This Bull Cycle?

The world’s leading cryptocurrency has recovered since trading at $105,121. Major altcoins such as Ripple’s XRP also tumbled but have regained many of their losses. Bitcoin (BTC) Leads the Surge Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed leader of the cryptocurrency world, has maintained its position as the most trusted digital asset. As the dominant store of value, BTC remains the go-to choice for institutional investors. Bitcoin’s (BTC) recent rally, which pushed it to set a new ATH at $109,114, has investors firmly glued to the charts to see what the market has in store next. While BTC continues its bountiful journey, large-cap altcoins have also made significant gains as President Donald Trump stepped back into office. Trump’s historical victory sparked renewed optimism among market watchers as his administration plans to implement many pro-crypto policies. Join us as we explore some of the top altcoin picks. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) is one of the top-selling memecoins with a market cap exceeding $10.9 billion. The decentralized community-led token and its reputation as the “Dogecoin Killer” has yielded impressive rewards in the past year, gaining over 100%. SHIB is also a proud member of the Solana network and the best friend of Solana’s newest memecoin sensation, Husky Inu (HINU). The memecoin quickly rose to fame in the crypto industry and has since become a household name. SHIB, launched in 2020, is currently the 17th largest crypto by market cap and the second biggest memecoin after Dogecoin (DOGE). Shiba Inu and its native token, SHIB, quickly gained the attention of a dedicated community of investors thanks to its charm and support from industry giants such as Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Bitwise Submits Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF Filing Dogecoin (DOGE) maintains its title as the number one memecoin after gaining much traction after Trump’s win to become the 8th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $49 billion. The OG memecoin quickly rose to become a household name in the crypto industry, owing its success to a strong community and endless potential. DOGE began its journey in the industry as a joke but has transitioned into a legitimate investment opportunity with excellent profit potential. The memecoin witnessed impressive growth with the involvement and endorsement of Elon Musk. Musk, the world’s richest man with a net worth exceeding $430 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of Trump's most prominent and trusted supporters. The tech wizard’s endorsement of Donald Trump proved vital to the President’s success. Musk’s long-time support and promotion of DOGE could see the token run to new highs in the coming months. DOGE’s popularity and value surged after it was announced that Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would head up the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” DOGE received bullish news on January 29, as crypto asset manager Bitwise submitted a filing to launch a DOGE exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the SEC. The filing signals Bitwise’s intent to offer a product that holds DOGE directly and tracks its price movements. Ripple (XRP) Regains $3 Ripple’s XRP has gained massively over the past month and is now the third-largest crypto with a market capitalization exceeding $179 billion. Ripple (XRP) has witnessed a spectacular gain in value after news of Gary Gensler’s planned exit surfaced. Ripple Labs has been embroiled in a highly publicized legal battle with the securities agency for which Ripple paid a hefty price. In 2020, the regulator sued Ripple for its supposed breach of securities laws, resulting in many exchanges choosing to delist XRP. Ripple finally found some relief after a partial victory in 2023 ended the SEC’s 3-year-long crusade against the company. The Southern District of New York Court delivered a partial victory to Ripple in its matter with the SEC after Judge Analisa Torres ruled that Ripple’s XRP token is “not necessarily a security on its face.” Ripple received some further bullish news after Chris Giancarlo, former chair of the CFTC, predicted the SEC would drop its case against the company. The price of XRP surged further after WisdomTree filed an S-1 application for a spot XRP ETF, and Ripple officially launched its USD-backed stablecoin, RLUSD, on December 17. Ripple’s XRP gained nearly 50% over the past month and is now traded at $3.11. Husky Inu (HINU) Hits $700,000 in Presale Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the highly coveted Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by harnessing the power of this popular blockchain. The project has raised attention because of its ambition to compete with the best in the memecoin industry. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Husky Inu (HINU) continues to exceed its presale goals, raising over $700,000 since going live. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting. Husky Inu’s presale success sets the tone for immense gains and is expected to skyrocket following exchange listings. HINU presale tokens are available at a modest $0.00015000 with exceptional profit potential for early backers.

39690226,https://nulltx.com/?p=141811,1738230127,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"Sui Expands Reach with Phantom Wallet Integration, Opening Doors for 15 Million Users",https://nulltx.com/sui-expands-reach-with-phantom-wallet-integration-opening-doors-for-15-million-users/,"Unlocking a new level of accessibility for the Sui blockchain, its native cryptocurrency SUI is now available on the Phantom Wallet. This is big news for the Move-based blockchain, which is now accessible to the more than 15 million Phantom users. It makes Sui the first Move-based blockchain to be supported on that wallet platform and the third Layer-1 blockchain in general to be accessible on Phantom. Phantom is pushing into a multi-chain ecosystem to make life easier for users and to broaden the user base of decentralized tech. With this integration, Sui has advanced its position in the rapidly evolving blockchain space, solidifying its footprint in the industry. A Strategic Move Toward Multi-Chain Accessibility Both platforms share a vision of making the blockchain accessible to more people, and they see Phantom Wallet as a bridge to doing that. “We’re really excited to be a partner with Phantom,” says Christian Thompson, managing director of the Sui Foundation . “The launch of Sui as the first Move-based chain on the Phantom Wallet validates what the community has accomplished in the past year,” Phantom Wallet is now the first Move-based platform. It is one of the first decentralized apps to connect with the Sui blockchain. Therefore, saying that Phantom Wallet is first Move-based wallet is true—but it’s also not the whole story. Phantom, which is now known for more than just its support of Solana (SOL), has been busy building an even broader multi-chain ecosystem. With Sui now on board, Phantom users can access one of the most exciting and fastest-growing blockchains around today, known for its unrivaled scalability, security, and high-performance features. This sentiment received further reinforcement from Brandon Milman, CEO of Phantom. He zeroed in on how Sui’s infrastructure meshes with Phantom’s mission to make crypto accessible to the masses. “Sui’s focus on scalability and its superior user experience aligns perfectly with Phantom’s goal of making crypto accessible for everyone,” Milman stated. Phantom, which has 15 million active users, gives Sui an opportunity to increase adoption at an exponential rate. The way things are set up right now, that puts Sui in a really strong place to become one of the leading blockchain networks. Sui’s Impressive Growth: A Look at Its Market Standing As of early 2024, Sui has started to assert itself in the blockchain space and has been showing some really strong market performance. As of January 4, 2024, Sui surpassed a Total Value Locked (TVL) of $2 billion, and that is also reflecting a pretty good growth trajectory, I think, since the platform recently launched on mainnet back in March of 2023. Sui’s success stems from its distinct manner of handling blockchain scalability and transaction efficiency, setting it well apart from traditional networks. Sui runs on the Move programming language and does what legacy blockchains can’t—perform well under pressure—serving Sui at least as an attractive option for both developers and end users. SUI NETWORK ANNOUNCES INTEGRATION WITH PHANTOM WALLET – @SuiNetwork has announced its integration with @Phantom wallet, an industry-leading non-custodial multichain crypto wallet. -The latest development will allow Phantom's 15 million active users to access the SUI blockchain… https://t.co/niTU0QSJ45 pic.twitter.com/cYKeOKckBN — BSCN (@BSCNews) January 29, 2025 Market Signals: Is SUI Gearing Up for a Price Rebound? The integration of Phantom Wallet has intensified investor sentiment around SUI. And when it comes to the price action, analysts are watching closely. They may be offering a mix of bullish and bearish perspectives, if I had to guess. But according to the TD Sequential indicator, SUI is not only a buy, but it’s offering a pretty sweet technical setup at the moment that could see the price rebound soon. SUI has on-chain fundamentals that are too good to ignore. They are strong, they are getting stronger, and they are providing a growing presence in the realm of decentralized applications (dApps). The crypto world fundamentally changes how we think about everything from money to governance, and Sui has its place in that world. But what will happen next? How are things looking from a market point of view? And why is my price prediction for SUI 50% higher than what we saw at the end of March? Conclusion: A Step Toward a More Inclusive Blockchain Ecosystem Phantom Wallet’s integration with Sui represents a significant step forward for both the project and the wider multi-chain ecosystem. This milestone makes Sui the first Move-based blockchain to partner with Phantom. It further extends Sui’s reach into another facet of the blockchain universe and, along with that, it opens up another area for potential, as yet unrealized, user accessibility. Phantom Wallet’s integration with Sui represents a significant step forward for both the project and the wider multi-chain ecosystem. As of now, Sui is the first Move-based blockchain to partner with Phantom; therefore, it can be said that Sui has extended its reach into yet another facet of the blockchain universe. At present, Sui has total locked value (TVL) of over $2 billion, and it is experiencing rising adoption. Further, it has a number of positive technical indicators that could lead to it having a very good performance in 2024 and possibly beyond. So even if it takes another Sui year for Sui to reach maturity, it could still be a major player in the space long before then. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

""These Critical Data Give a Bullish Signal for Bitcoin!""",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/reassuring-statements-from-analysts-these-critical-data-give-a-bullish-signal-for-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin has been fluctuating in recent days, but experienced a sharp decline at the beginning of the week. While BTC later recovered, analysts shared the indicator that is a bullish signal for Bitcoin. Analysts stated that wallets that have been holding BTC for at least 155 days are still continuing to sell, and said that this is a bullish signal for Bitcoin. 10X Research founder Markus Thielen said that the continued selling by long-term investors is an indication that Bitcoin and the market are in an uptrend. Speaking to Coindesk, Markus Thielen noted that sharp declines in BTC held by long-term investors often coincide with strong Bitcoin rallies, saying: “According to our analysis, sharp declines in long-term holder supply (purple line) coincided with strong Bitcoin rallies (white line) as seen in Q1 and Q4 2024. Bitcoin remains at risk of a short squeeze to the upside as long as long-term investors continue to reduce their balances.” The Number of Bitcoins on Exchanges Is Decreasing! Apart from the 10X Research founder, Glassnode analysts also analyzed the change in Bitcoin dynamics. At this point, Glassnode analysts stated that the total BTC supply held by long-term Bitcoin investors has decreased to approximately 13 million BTC, and said that these BTCs were purchased by short-term investors. “During the recent rally above $100k, 1.1m BTC moved from long-term holders to short-term holders, indicating an impressive influx of demand to absorb this supply at prices above $90k.” Analysts stated that the pace of sales by long-term investors has slowed down and also pointed out that the number of BTC held in wallets connected to central exchanges has decreased significantly. “The outflow of BTC from exchanges results in reduced coin availability for flash sales and is widely seen as a bullish indicator. While many interpret the Bitcoin supply reduction as a supply shock caused by retail investors pulling out large amounts of coins, we believe that much of the decline on exchanges is due to the transfer of coins to ETF wallets managed by custodians like Coinbase.” *This is not investment advice.

While the future blockbuster crypto applications are uncertain, Sui and Aptos stand out as strong contenders for attracting the blockchain users of tomorrow. We believe that Aptos’s edge in designed flexibility and arguably more robust chain architecture may prove to be competitive advantages. We compare Sui and Aptos across blockchain performance, scalability, ecosystems, and trading advantages while projecting SUI to hit $16 and APT $22 by the end of 2025. Please note that VanEck has positions in Sui (SUI-USD) and Aptos (APT-USD) Sui and Aptos: Origins and Overview Previously, we discussed the potential of Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) and Solana ( SOL-USD ) to onboard billions of users to crypto. While both ecosystems are compelling, they represent earlier generations of blockchain technology. Since their inception, newer blockchains have emerged to address the limitations of these systems. Among these are Aptos and Sui, two related blockchains founded by the diaspora of Facebook's blockchain project, Diem. Diem aimed to create a stablecoin payment system for Facebook's social media platform but was shelved due to regulatory pressure. However, its experiments spurred significant advancements in blockchain technology. One of the most important outputs of Diem was the Move smart contract programming language. Move is based off the popular ( +4.3M developers worldwide , 3rd fastest growing language) Rust language and was optimized to solve issues with earlier smart contract languages like Ethereum's Solidity and Cardano's Haskell. Both Aptos and Sui leverage Move to create a quicker, safer, and more intuitive development environment for software engineers to build applications out of smart contracts. Move also helps the underlying engine of both Aptos and Sui, called ""the virtual machine"" (VM), process transactions faster (how quickly a user receives a confirmation) and with more throughput (how many transactions the system can process per time period). Move's potential is so high that the value of all Move-based blockchains has surged from ~$5B to ~$22B in just one year. Crypto has 1/1000th the Developer Community of JavaScript Source: Electric Capital, Slash Data as of 12/19/2024. Move is important because it offers a better entry point for incoming developers. The number of crypto developers is very small, and a popular quip is that there are more full-time developers at Meta (Facebook) than there are in all of the crypto. By offering a more approachable and efficient language, Move has the potential to attract a broader developer base, fostering experimentation and innovation. This is vital for uncovering the next groundbreaking application that could drive mass adoption. We view blockchains as a platform for innovation and experimentation, with high valuations of SCPs driven by their capacity to enable groundbreaking applications that can engage hundreds of millions of users. Because no one knows what that application may be, it is important to have as many people experimenting as possible. Both Sui and Aptos pair their Move VMs with advanced consensus mechanisms that ensure each network efficiently validates transactions and updates. This combination of cutting-edge virtual machines and consensus protocols forms the foundation of their technology, delivering superior performance compared to previous blockchain systems. Until innovations like Solana's Firedancer prove otherwise, Sui and Aptos stand as the pinnacle of blockchain technology. Aptos Achieved 326M or 13.3K Transactions Per Second (TPS) on 10/18/2024 Peak daily transactions of different blockchains. (Source: Artemis XYZ as of 12/19/2024.) Sui and Aptos offer important blockchain technology capable of serving hundreds of millions of users. Aptos and Sui bring blockchain scaling alongside simplicity and safety for builders. This contrasts Solana, which offers scaling at the cost of complexity, and Ethereum, which provides a richer ecosystem at the tradeoffs of governance through a rigid technocracy and inferior technology. Tactically, Sui and Aptos offer a better user experience for crypto's current use case - speculation and value transfer. Strategically, they lay the groundwork for future non-speculative applications like AI agents, social media, cloud services, and marketing. While the future blockbuster crypto applications are uncertain, Sui and Aptos stand out as strong contenders for attracting the blockchain users of tomorrow. But what makes these systems exceptional, and which is better ? Sui vs. Aptos: Blockchain Performance and Scalability While Sui and Aptos both utilize the Move programming language, their blockchains are architected with distinct design philosophies. Each network employs its own version of Move, optimized for different tradeoffs that influence how transactions are processed. When a transaction is sent to a blockchain, it contains information that tells the blockchain's software what parts of the blockchain's database (called state) it wants to change. Blockchain engineers call these database updates ""state changes."" Most blockchains operate in a hierarchy where one validator acts as the ""leader"" for a set period of time before a new one is selected. During a validator's leadership span, it ingests incoming transactions, determines their validity (ensuring authorization, correct signatures, and no double-spending), orders them, executes the changes, and then updates the blockchain's state. The resulting block of transactions (the block in the blockchain) is broadcast to the other validators in the network. These validators also verify, execute, and synchronize their copies of the state with other validators. Once a supermajority (66%) of validators agree that the state update is valid, the blockchain progresses to the next block of transactions. A blockchain's architecture can be segmented into two primary components: Processing transactions and building blocks of transactions Verifying transaction authenticity Ensuring sufficient account balances Executing smart contracts Updating the blockchain's ledger Communicating block across the network Broadcasting the block of transactions across the network Synchronizing the changes made to the blockchain's ledger so all validators hold the exact copy of the state Handling conflicts that arise during ledger reconciliation for all validators To improve transaction throughput, blockchains must either increase the volume of data transmitted across the network (enabling larger transaction blocks) or optimize the efficiency of data processing and communication (enhancing the message exchange process). Sui and Aptos tackle these challenges differently by leveraging their unique adaptations of Move to push the boundaries of blockchain technology to increase the efficiency and volume of data each processes. Blockchain Transaction Throughput = Block Size x Block Processing Speed Both Aptos and Sui optimize methods to increase the size of the data that can be processed and how quickly the network disseminates that data. This analysis examines their approaches to the first step, ""Processing transactions and building blocks of transactions,"" to highlight each chain's unique advantages and tradeoffs. Source: VanEck Research as of 12/19/2024. To simplify the technology behind Aptos and Sui, imagine blockchains as restaurants: The blockchain is the restaurant It provides the infrastructure and environment where the entire process takes place. The blockchain users are the customers They interact with the restaurant by placing orders, just as users interact with the blockchain through transactions. User transactions are restaurant orders These are specific requests made by customers that require processing and fulfillment. The onchain applications are the waiters Waiters act as intermediaries, taking customer orders (transactions) and delivering them to the kitchen (validator) for processing. They also return the completed orders (state changes) to the customers. The Leader Validator is the kitchen The kitchen is responsible for processing orders (validating and executing transactions) and preparing the output (state changes). The state change is the food delivered to the customer The final product, representing the processed transaction or updated blockchain state, is served to the customer. In this analogy, improvements in blockchain technology introduced by Aptos and Sui can be likened to optimizing the restaurant's operations. This includes making the kitchen faster and the waiters more efficient and ensuring orders are processed and delivered to customers quickly and accurately. Ethereum is a slow restaurant Ethereum is software that processes one state update at a time, and this happens only after transactions are accumulated in a list over a relatively lengthy period. Each block of transactions is small and can handle only a limited number of operations. Additionally, transactions are processed sequentially rather than in parallel, meaning each one must be executed one after the other. Even if transactions touch different parts of the blockchain's state, they must wait for other transactions to be processed. This combination of small block sizes, infrequent updates, and sequential execution leads to low throughput and creates significant scalability challenges. To make things more clear, imagine Ethereum as a restaurant with many waiters taking orders from tables but only one cook in the kitchen. Meals are prepared by that chef, one at a time. At the Ethereum Restaurant, customers give their food orders to their waiters, and these waiters come together to build the orders into a giant list. The list size is very limited; if a customer does not buy an expensive enough item, his order is bumped off the list (and he still owes money for his order). Once a period of time passes, roughly 12 seconds , the list of customer orders is sent to the Chef, and he arranges the batch as he sees fit. At the 'Ethereum Restaurant,' the Chef is very ""entrepreneurial,"" so he accepts ""tips"" to process orders first so that customers can receive their food sooner. Once the Chef has decided on the order sequence, he prepares the food according to the customer's preferred meal. This almost always means the Chef cooks food first for patrons who give the largest tips. Since the 'Ethereum Restaurant' has only one person making food, many tables placing orders at once will result in a long queue of orders. While many consider the food at the 'Ethereum Restaurant' to be very good, it has proven far too popular and cannot scale up to customer demand. Patrons of 'Ethereum's Restaurant' are annoyed by the long wait times and the high costs of ""tipping"" the head waiter to get a timely meal. They particularly despise the experience of paying a lot of money and not receiving food. At the 'Ethereum Restaurant,' Orders are Processed One at a Time (Even if They Don't Conflict) Source: VanEck Research as of 12/19/2024. Sui and Aptos apply parallelization to make their restaurants faster Blockchains like Sui and Aptos have made a big improvement by allowing transactions to be parallelized. This is accomplished by allowing transactions that do not conflict to occur simultaneously. In practice, this means that transactions using different applications or simple payments can be processed together. Other blockchains, like Solana and Monad, can parallel processing, but Sui and Aptos currently offer the most advanced designs. In the example of a restaurant, this capability of parallel processing would be equivalent to the restaurant adding many cooks to the kitchen. At the Sui/Aptos restaurants, the expanded staff can prepare many meals at once to fulfill customer orders much faster. However, how each blockchain achieves parallelization is very different and comes with tradeoffs. While there are now more chefs to process orders, each restaurant's kitchen is still limited by the amount of equipment it possesses. If six tables order pizza at the same time, limited space in the pizza oven means that some pizzas must be cooked before the others. On blockchain, this would be like two traders competing to get the best price on the same DEX on the same coin. These ""conflicts"" must be resolved, and Sui and Aptos have different methods of doing this. In fact, the pros and cons of each blockchain's processing scheme have important implications for application developers and each's ability to scale. At 'Casa Sui' and 'Le Maison de Aptos', Orders That Do Not Conflict with Others and Can Be Processed Simultaneously to Increase Throughput Source: VanEck Research as of 12/19/2024. Fine dining at 'Casa Sui' Sui employs a method to parallelize orders called ""static parallelism,"" which is similar to Solana's process. This means that transactions on Sui must explicitly specify the parts of the blockchain's ledger they want to read and write. Because Sui then knows what parts of the blockchain a transaction wants to touch, it can then allow other transactions that touch different parts to be processed at the same time. In the case where two transactions try to write to the same part of the blockchain simultaneously, Sui recognizes the conflict before the transactions are processed. To resolve the conflict, Sui determines which transaction comes first based on ordering criteria like fees paid, when the transaction was received, etc. Returning to the restaurant example, we can better understand what this looks like in practice. At the Sui restaurant ""Casa Sui,"" when a table orders, the waiter takes the order and mentally breaks down the order to determine which parts of the kitchen will be used during preparation. If a hamburger and french fries are ordered, the waiter tells the kitchen to use the grill and the fryer. In turn, one of Sui's many chefs ""locks"" the area of the kitchen he needs to prepare the meal. During this ""lock,"" no other orders can be processed using that same kitchen equipment. However, items that use other parts of the kitchen can be cooked at the same time. If two waiters simultaneously try to call on the same parts of the kitchen, 'Casa Sui's' ordering system recognizes the ""conflict"" before the cooking begins. In that conflict scenario, one order is selected to be cooked first and the other to come afterward. Let's assume three orders are placed simultaneously: Table A orders white pizza Table B orders black pizza (the house specialty at 'Casa Sui') Table C orders salmon In the case above, Table A's and Table B's orders conflict because they both use the pizza oven. However, Sui's waiters both determine this dependency upfront and determine the best ordering. So, 'Casa Sui' selects Table B's order to go first and Table A's to go after. Meanwhile, the salmon is processed without any hold-up because it was known in advance that the grill station would be free. At 'Casa Sui,' Waiters Call Out the Kitchen Equipment to be Used, and Ordering is Finalized After Source: VanEck Research as of 12/19/2024. Haute Cuisine by 'Le Maison De Aptos' At 'Le Maison de Aptos', the setup is very similar. There are ample waiters taking orders and many chefs cooking, but a limited supply of culinary equipment. However, Aptos does not worry about kitchen conflicts occurring. Aptos makes that tradeoff by assuming that conflicts in the kitchen are rare and can be quickly resolved. As such, Aptos uses what is called ""dynamic"" parallelism, which is similar to what Monad employs. In this model, transactions do not specify what parts of the state they touch. Instead, orders are ""optimistically"" processed, assuming they do not conflict. On Aptos, an algorithm called the ""Scheduler"" processes transactions based on maximizing the output of transactions over the shortest period of time. However, it only finds conflicting transactions when it actually goes to write the change in the blockchain's state. In the event there is a conflict, the conflicting transactions and any dependent transactions are sent back to the scheduler, who must sift through the conflicts and resolve them. Thereafter, once the issues are settled, the set of transactions is processed to completion. On Aptos, the waiters do not have to assess which parts of the kitchen must be touched. Instead, they simply pass the orders to the kitchen. Once the orders reach the kitchen, the ""Kitchen Head"" (The Scheduler) receives them and determines the most efficient cooking process. When orders come in, the Kitchen Head assumes there are no conflicts and orders the cooks to begin cooking food. If there is a conflict, it is only discovered once the cooks start cooking. In the event of a dispute, the cooks must stop cooking, throw away the partially completed meal, and ask the Kitchen Head to resolve the dispute. After scheduling the meal components, the orders are processed. While the process of ""throwing away the whole meal"" sounds like a waste and would slow down 'Le Maison de Aptos', under most circumstances, it does not impact the output very much. This is because Aptos's kitchen is very, very fast. At 'Le Maison de Aptos', the Scheduler Tries to Cook All Items Immediately. If a Conflict Occurs, the Chef Sends Back the Conflicting Requests to be Ordered Source: VanEck Research as of 12/23/2024. But what are the implications of each model? Aptos is more manageable for developers Aptos is considered by many to be a more flexible system because it does not force transactions to specify the parts of the state they touch upfront. This is important for developers because when they build applications, they must work through all the necessary dependencies and write the code to describe them. In the example of the restaurant, where the developers are waiters, processing customer orders on Aptos is much easier than it is on Sui because the waiters do not have to think about what parts of the kitchen are used for an order. From the standpoint of attracting builders to an ecosystem, some consider this development annoyance to be frustrating enough to opt for Aptos over Sui. This is because writing out extra code takes time, and dependencies may need to be changed often. As a result of Aptos design, development is more straightforward for its application creators. Additionally, many dependencies are difficult to know upfront for both users and developers. While developers want optionality in application design, users may want many different transaction pathways that they will not know in advance. Due to the preference for optionality of both developers and users, in a system like Sui, transactions may ""lock"" part of the state that they do not need, which causes other transactions to be held up. If a business relies upon lots of shared resources to operate, it will be challenging for it to reserve all resources at once using Sui's format. In some cases, a business on Sui may even lock parts of the blockchain it does not need, preventing others from using those areas. In the example of the restaurant at 'Maison de Aptos', a patron can tell the waiter he desires ""chicken"" and that he wants whichever type is made fastest (open kitchen spot) between fried, baked, or grilled. Meanwhile, at Casa Sui, the customer must tell the waiter which kind of chicken he wants upfront, and the customer cannot embed contingencies. Sui is more efficient Sui resolves conflicts between competing transactions upfront, allowing it to establish an order at the outset. This approach reduces the need for computational resources to handle conflicts during execution, freeing up the capacity to process additional transactions. This design is advantageous in scenarios with heavy decentralized exchange (DEX) activity, often called ""contentious state writes,"" such as traders competing for arbitrage opportunities. Aptos, by contrast, detects and resolves conflicts dynamically during transaction processing. Under normal conditions, the difference in performance between the two chains is minimal, as Aptos's conflict resolution takes only a few milliseconds. This is because Aptos transactions being processed into a block reside ""in memory,"" the processor's cache, enabling very fast processing. However, the Aptos transaction scheduler can become a bottleneck during extreme trading scenarios. High levels of contention require repeated detection, rollback, reordering, and re-execution of conflicting transactions, which can significantly slow down transaction processing. Kingman's Formula from operations management illustrates that as system utilization approaches its maximum capacity, small increases in load, like conflicting transactions per second, will result in exponentially longer wait times. For Aptos, heavy trading activity can overwhelm its scheduler and significantly degrade performance. While such scenarios have not yet occurred on Aptos, they remain a potential risk, particularly during events with significant trading contention. Notably, blockchain transaction throughput (TPS) benchmarks often focus on simple wallet transfers rather than real-world trading scenarios. This discrepancy means chains boasting high TPS may struggle under contentious trading conditions, where conflict resolution is critical. Restaurant Analogy: Sui is like a restaurant kitchen that pre-sorts orders to prevent clashes over limited kitchen space. Even during busy periods, kitchen space at 'Casa Sui' is more efficiently allocated. Aptos, however, resolves conflicts dynamically, which usually works well but can create chaos during peak times. Imagine a Friday night at 'Maison de Aptos,' with multiple diners competing for the popular Dover sole. The kitchen staff must re-check, re-cook, and re-serve orders amid the rush, resembling Lucy and Ethel struggling to keep up at the chocolate factory. This can lead to delays and inefficiencies under high demand, highlighting the potential drawbacks of Aptos's dynamic scheduler. A Blockchain Burdened by Too Many DEX Transactions (Colorized) Source: I Love Lucy as of 12/17/2024. Of course, Sui has its own bottlenecks and challenges due to the use of ""write-locks."" Transactions in Sui can reserve sections of the blockchain during processing, but some may fail to utilize the reserved resources effectively. This inefficiency can lead to certain parts of the blockchain being ""boxed out,"" preventing other transactions from accessing them until the write-lock is released. Such scenarios could reduce overall system efficiency, especially under heavy transaction loads or when write-lock contention is high. Sui enables ""Local Fee Markets"" Sui's approach to resolving state writes upfront introduces a unique advantage called ""local fee markets."" This feature allows Sui to manage transaction costs more efficiently by segmenting fees based on the specific parts of its blockchain being accessed. In practice, this means that the cost of interacting with a heavily used application on Sui can increase without affecting fees for other applications. For example, if there is high demand for trading in the SUI/USDC pool on the Sui-based DEX Aftermath Finance, the blockchain can raise transaction fees specifically for that pool. However, users accessing other applications or parts of the blockchain will not face increased fees. This localized pricing model contrasts with blockchains like Aptos and Ethereum, which operate global fee markets. On these platforms, a surge in demand for one application, such as during a popular NFT minting event, raises transaction fees for all users. This makes the entire blockchain more expensive and difficult to use. Restaurant Analogy: At the 'Casa Sui', cooking stations can each set prices for usage relative to demand. For instance, if there's a rush for sea urchin ravioli, the pasta station can raise its prices, but the cost of triple-stuffed steak quesadillas from the grill station remains unaffected. Conversely, all kitchen resources share a single pricing mechanism at 'Maison de Aptos'. If demand for ceviche ice cream spikes, the fees for unrelated items like red snapper pizza will also rise, even if the pizza oven is underutilized. Sui unlocks Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) Sui's design also enables service-level agreements (SLAs) on its blockchain. Validators on Sui can make binding commitments to applications regarding transaction latency and pricing on a per-day basis. This guarantees specific performance levels, ensuring businesses building on Sui do not have to worry about being crowded out by high activity elsewhere on the blockchain. For example, a business running an e-commerce platform on Sui can lock in agreements for low transaction fees and quick processing times. Sui's architecture ensures that operations remain unaffected even during high demand on unrelated applications, such as DEX trading. This capability gives businesses a level of predictability and reliability that is unavailable on most other blockchains. For developers and enterprises, this creates a compelling reason to choose Sui as a platform, as it allows them to focus on growth and operations without worrying about network congestion or fluctuating fees.

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities namedherein. For simple transactions like payments, Sui has two mechanisms that surpass other blockchains in terms of latency (user feedback time) and throughput (TPS). Sui calls these ""Fast Path"" and ""Pilot Fish."" Fast Path allows simple payment transactions to bypass consensus, resulting in transaction latencies as low as 300ms . Meanwhile, Pilot Fish demonstrates that Sui can be scaled nearly infinitely by allowing validators to add additional servers to process more transactions seamlessly. Sui's unique scaling capabilities stem from the interaction between its transaction processing model, its version of the Move smart contract language, and its consensus mechanism. A key distinction of Sui is its state architecture, which is composed of flexible, modular units called objects. This differs from the more rigid account-based structure found on blockchains like Ethereum. On Ethereum, accounts do not directly ""hold"" a balance of USDC. Instead, balances are tracked within the Ethereum-based USDC smart contract, which acts as a ledger for all USDC owners. When a user sends USDC to someone else, they must interact with the USDC smart contract. This process involves calling the contract to deduct the sender's balance and credit the recipient's balance. Every USDC transfer requires an interaction with the smart contract, which can introduce inefficiencies. Source: VanEck Research as of 12/23/2024. When Patrick sends Greg USDC on Sui, it deletes the $1,000 object to create two new $500 objects; one is sent to Greg. In contrast, Sui uses a more fluid object-based model. Balances of USDC on Sui are not centralized as ledger entries within a single contract. Instead, USDC exists as an object that individual user accounts own directly. Each USDC object is defined by: Ownership: The account controlling the object Type: The token type (ex: USDC) Metadata: Additional details such as the amount of USDC When users transfer USDC on Sui, they transfer ownership of the USDC object itself. For example, if I send USDC to another account, I create a new USDC object representing the transferred balance, and ownership of that object is assigned to the recipient's account. This eliminates the need to repeatedly call a central contract for every transaction, significantly improving efficiency. By allowing accounts to own and manage token objects directly, Sui achieves a more decentralized and scalable design. This object-based approach reduces bottlenecks caused by interactions with centralized smart contracts and provides a flexible framework for state management. This design significantly impacts blockchain parallelization. For example, suppose two entities send USDC simultaneously on Solana or Aptos. Their transactions must be ordered in that case because both will interact with the USDC smart contract and touch the same part of the Solana/Aptos state. In contrast, Sui's accounts own USDC as individual objects. When two entities send USDC, the transactions only modify the ownership of their respective token objects. As a result, these transactions can be processed in parallel, enabling higher throughput and efficiency. However, transactions involving the same object must still be serialized to maintain consistency. Sui Latencies Exclusively owned by one account Accessible and modifiable by multiple accounts Consensus Requirement No (local validators can process) Yes (all validators must agree) Execution Path Single validator validates, executes, and signs Validators execute after consensus Round Trip Times (RTT) 2xRTT @ 150ms per RTT 4xRTT @ 200ms per RTT Latency ~300ms ~800ms Conflict Potential None (exclusive ownership guarantees safety) Potential conflicts require resolution Source: VanEck Research as of 12/17/2024. Sui introduces a unique property where simple object transfers, such as payments, do not require consensus . This is possible because these object transfers can only be initiated by the owner and do not need to be globally ordered. All that is required is a signature verification and an update to the state by the validators to reflect the transfer. By contrast, in Ethereum, Solana, and Aptos, calling a smart contract (like the USDC contract) must go through consensus, as transactions must be globally ordered. Consensus is one of the most time-consuming aspects of blockchain transaction processing, often accounting for 70% or more of the total processing time in high-throughput blockchains like Solana. This is because validators worldwide must exchange messages to agree on the transaction order. The time taken is measured in ""RTTs"" (round trips of messaging), where each RTT can take 150ms-250ms , depending on the validators' geographic locations. By bypassing consensus for simple transfers, Sui eliminates this delay, shaving up to 500ms off transaction processing time. Restaurant Analogy: This would be similar to 'Casa Sui,' offering diners the option of a pre-cooked meal. This significantly reduces service time and expands the number of diners who can be served. In contrast, at other blockchain ""restaurants,"" all orders must go through the kitchen, regardless of complexity. Sui's unique pathway to ""infinite"" TPS: Pilot Fish Sui's object-based structure enables near-unlimited scaling through a mechanism called Pilot Fish. Most blockchains scale by optimizing software to run efficiently within the constraints of a single server per validator. Sui's design, however, allows validators to scale horizontally by using multiple servers. This means a validator facing resource constraints (e.g., memory, bandwidth, or computational power) can add servers to handle more transactions. While ""hot"" (high demand) areas of the blockchain still require ordered transaction processing, the ability to distribute processing across multiple servers prevents bottlenecks in other parts of the blockchain. Restaurant Analogy: If 'Casa Sui's' main kitchen becomes overwhelmed, additional kitchens with specialized equipment can be contracted to handle the load. While patrons ordering popular dishes may face wait times, others can enjoy meals prepared in less busy stations. Aptos's response: Quorum Store Aptos has developed a scaling mechanism called Quorum Store that optimizes blockchain speed by focusing on the consensus process (the second part of blockchain processing) to increase throughput and reduce latency. It allows more validators to participate in the initial transaction processing than just the leader. Traditionally, blockchains rely on a leader-validator system, where one validator at a time ingests transactions, creates blocks, and updates the blockchain's state. Leadership rotates periodically, usually based on the amount of stake held. Quorum Store disrupts this model by allowing any validator to disseminate transactions across the network, not just the leader. This frees up the leader to focus on proposing the blocks and disseminating those blocks. This speeds up the time needed to process transactions and enables other validators to do some of the leader's workload. However, Quorum Store may exacerbate Aptos's scheduler challenges under high-conflict scenarios, such as when many transactions compete for the same trade. In these cases, multiple validators proposing conflicting blocks can slow Aptos's ability to resolve dependencies and conflicts. Nevertheless, in most scenarios, Quorum Store improves transaction efficiency. Aptos is more robust than Sui In blockchain design, as in life, ""there is no such thing as a free lunch,"" and Sui's design introduces new problems alongside its unique capabilities. One key decision is to skip a process called DAG certification, which serves as an additional check on transaction authenticity. This decision reduces the number of RTTs (round trips of messaging) required during consensus, resulting in faster transaction processing. However, bypassing DAG certification comes with trade-offs. By skipping this step, Sui's network may not be as robust as Aptos's under certain conditions . For instance, packet loss, a common phenomenon in internet communication, can impact Sui more severely than other blockchains. Some researchers claim that a minor packet drop, such as a 1% loss affecting 5 of Sui's 100 validators, could significantly degrade the network's performance. While these claims should be interpreted cautiously due to a lack of transparent methodology, they highlight a potential vulnerability in Sui's design. Under specific scenarios, Sui could experience transaction latency issues that more robust designs like Aptos might avoid. Another consideration is the potential for malicious behavior by validators. Without DAG certification, Sui's network may allow validators to exploit vulnerabilities. For example, malicious validators could disrupt network operations more easily than Aptos, which has stronger safeguards through its consensus processes. While substantial attacks on proof-of-stake (PoS) systems remain rare, and these vulnerabilities are still largely theoretical, Sui's broader attack surface could pose a greater risk as the ecosystem matures. Sui has more traction, but this lead could be fleeting Both Move blockchains are less than a few years old; their usership is in its early innings. Despite immense potential, Sui and Aptos's ecosystems are relatively small. Sui is currently leading Aptos based on the most fundamental metrics of usership. Though Sui and Aptos have roughly the same number of monthly active addresses, 9.2M for Sui and 8.9M for Aptos, Sui excels in economic statistics. Note: Active Addresses may not be a reliable measure of user activity due to the simplicity of one user controlling multiples addresses. From the standpoint of fee revenues, Sui has captured 6x of the fee revenue of Aptos in the past year ($10.4M vs $1.7M). Sui has also transacted 3.5x the DEX volume of Aptos ($38.3B vs $10.8B) . When looking at DeFi TVL, Sui has $1.6B vs Aptos with $930M. However, Aptos ($750M) has more stablecoins on the chain than Sui ($476M).

Not intended as a recommendation to buy or sell any securities namedherein. Drilling down further into each ecosystem's constituents, both have most of the core components needed to facilitate speculation-focused use cases of crypto. Each ecosystem has ample applications in DEX, Borrow/Lend, and Perp Futures categories. Early as we are, Sui has stronger entities within the Borrow/Lend category in Suilend and Navi, each boasting over $450M in TVL. By comparison, the largest app on Aptos holds $300M . Sui has a deeper perpetual futures trading market, mostly centered around an application called BlueFin. Bluefin averages around $250M in trading volume and ranks 7th in all crypto. However, Aptos has a more successful decentralized stablecoin project, called Thala ($135M TVL ), than Sui's, called Bucket Protocol ($73M TVL ). Sui vs. Aptos: Ecosystems Have Grown Remarkably But Are Still Nascent The go-to market for attracting developers for Sui and Aptos has been to offer substantial incentives for builders to come to each chain. For example, on October 13, 2023 , Sui pledged 157M SUI tokens to incentivize the growth of its ecosystem. In practical terms, this has been utilized to bootstrap its DeFI by rewarding those who trade, borrow, and lend. We estimate that the collective impact of Sui's incentives resulted in rewards that have added 5.2%-10% in annualized yields since June 2024. We estimate that Sui has awarded more than 70M Sui in incentives in 2024 alone, worth ~$300M today. Following a similar pathway to attracting DeFI TVL and usership as Sui, Aptos currently adds ~6.5% in APT rewards to borrow/lend deposited USDC/USDT while adding 8%-12% to deposited BTC. It also adds ~15%-20% APT rewards to DEX pools to encourage liquidity. We estimate that Aptos spent over 10M APT worth around $100M to incentivize its DeFI ecosystem. While Sui has spent more than Aptos in dollar terms, we estimate Aptos has allocated slightly more of its token supply than Sui (0.9% vs. 0.7%). The result has been that both Sui and Aptos bootstrapped very important components of each ecosystem very quickly. However, this has also led to substantial ""mercenary capital"" (users only there to extract rewards) deploying to each chain. Similar to a federal government providing subsidies for an industry, the Sui and Aptos incentive campaigns have created a massive ecosystem. Still, it is yet to be seen if it is sustainable. Sui community is further along than Aptos's Sui and Aptos have focused on creating their respective communities by asserting each chain's technical supremacy. Though many developers herald the advantage of the Move programming language and some have fallen into the camps of Sui or Aptos, there is currently no material depth to either chain's culture compared to legacy blockchains. We assert this based upon Google search interest in each's memecoins and the total number of developers tracked in public repositories. While Sui averaged 280 weekly active developers in 1H2024, Aptos recorded 272 . These figures compare to Ethereum, which had 3,300, and Solana, which had 1,200 . Together, Sui and Aptos builders represent less than 4% of all active developers in crypto. From the standpoint of retail interest in each's community, Sui is ahead of Aptos by a factor of nearly 9x when examining Google Trends (Aptos: 2 vs. Sui: 9 ). In fact, in the last 90 days , global search interest for Sui was higher than it was for Solana on 17 days and higher than Ethereum on 16 days . The consequence of the relatively anemic development community of Aptos and Sui is that neither can boast of a truly differentiated, successful application. Though Sui has a few interesting applications like ""FanTV"" and ""Birds,"" neither application has attracted significant usage. Another current disappointment of Sui and Aptos is that neither has an application leveraging the unique technical capabilities of either chain. For example, the most important perpetual exchange on Sui, called Bluefin, has its entire trading engine deployed on Bluefin's private server and not on Sui's blockchain. Sui Outpaces Aptos in Google Searches Over the Last 90 Days Source: Google Trends as of 1/21/2025. Sui's Top Decentralized Apps (dApps) are DeFi and Infrastructure Source: Artemis XYZ as of 1/21/2025. Sui vs. Aptos: Trading Experience Sui's system is currently better for traders than Aptos Sui has created a better system for traders, which should translate into better prices for Sui DEXes. We base this upon the following components: Programmable Transaction Blocks (PTB) Predictable Gas Pricing Advantageous Fee Structure for Large Transactions Local Fee Markets DeepBook Sui has poured tremendous thought into building a system optimized for onchain trading through built-in components of Sui's code and innovations created by Sui's team. The first is the concept of programmable transaction blocks (PTB), which enable a single transaction to dynamically interact with multiple parts of the blockchain state, executing up to 1024 commands. Unlike other blockchains, such as Ethereum or Aptos, where transactions call a pre-defined function, Sui's PTBs allow transactions to dynamically decide which calls to make and which parts of the state to touch. This dynamism enables real-time decision-making based on both onchain and offchain data, providing unprecedented flexibility. This capability is particularly significant for applications requiring high performance, such as decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregators. On Sui, these aggregators can leverage offchain compute (like ASICS/GPUs) to determine optimal trading routes, incorporating both onchain liquidity and external pricing data. Due to their rigid transaction structures, this level of sophistication is challenging or impossible on Ethereum or Aptos. Furthermore, Sui's design surpasses Solana in practical applications. While Solana theoretically allows similar functionality, its stringent limits on the number of input accounts (64) and maximum transaction instructions significantly restrict its usability. For example, a complex Sui transaction that interacts with more than 100 objects would be unfeasible on Solana. This makes Sui a more robust platform for advanced trading applications. Both Sui and Aptos set their transaction prices based on the complexity of a transaction measured in network resources used (gas). Gas is the cost, in native tokens, that each network charges for some unit of resource utilization. Aptos gas prices function by having governance set a minimum gas price at an indeterminate interval and then allowing gas prices to float above this minimum based on transaction demand. Aptos does not have a priority tip separate from the gas price; instead, priority is achieved by setting the gas (cost per unit of network resource used) higher. Sui's validators set a ""reference price"" that bonds validators to process all transactions that pay this reference price. To gain a higher spot in the processing queue, a transactor on Sui can attach a priority fee to their transaction. As explained previously, Aptos has a global gas price that does not charge larger fees for higher-demand pieces of Aptos blockchain (like a DEX with lots of trading). In comparison, Sui enables more in-demand parts of the state to charge higher fees than lower-priority parts of the state. These seemingly minuscule differences are important because they affect the economics of traders in meaningful ways. Particularly important traders called ""market makers"" often place and cancel (updating) thousands (or more) of orders per second. This is done to bid/offer advantageous prices relative to newly developing information. With PTBs that change many parts of the state simultaneously, a market maker can update their book of bids/asks with fewer transactions. This alone makes operating on Sui cheaper than other chains like Aptos. Finally, Sui has an interesting component of architecture embedded in its blockchain called ""DeepBook,"" which is a global centralized limit order book ((CLOB)) on Sui for wholesale liquidity. This liquidity layer allows DEXes and DEX aggregators (entities that access all DEXes in their selection set) to tap into global liquidity across Sui. This centralized order book aggregates liquidity across Sui into one unified pool and enables deeper liquidity for traders operating on Sui. Since any app can tap into their liquidity layer, it reduces the advantages of applications with lots of liquidity, thus leveling the playing field and lowering the prices that DEXes can charge users. Sui vs. Aptos: Similar Tokenomics Sui Earned 24% More Revenue in November Than Aptos Has in the Past Year Source: Artemis XYZ as of 1/15/2025. Sui and Aptos have both designed their systems so that high usage of each respective blockchain will accrue value to each respective token. If either gets many users, its token's value will likely appreciate in price. In fact, both blockchains' chief token use cases are very similar: Payment for Gas Fees Deposit for Storage Fees Validator Staking Network Governance One key difference between SUI vs. APT tokens is that SUI has a capped supply of tokens while APT tokens have no maximum supply. Aptos inflation currently rests at 6.7% per annum and decreases each year by 1.5%. However, this endless supply of APT due to persistent inflation is offset by the fact that transaction fees on Aptos result in a token burn. Sui, by contrast, does not burn fees on its transactions. The consequence is that more activity on Sui will benefit those staking tokens over those not staking tokens. This is because those who stake validators on Sui will receive the transaction fees. On Aptos, since the token is burned, an increase in transaction fees benefits everyone equally. However, it must be noted that while Aptos can achieve a deflationary token system through substantial activity, Sui has it baked in by means of its storage system. More below. An interesting feature of Sui and Aptos is their approach to addressing the long-term challenges associated with storing crypto data onchain. Blockchains continuously grow in storage size, measured in gigabytes and terabytes, which must be maintained by validators and nodes. This poses a problem because the increasing storage demands drive up costs and place additional strain on blockchain networks. Ideally, blockchains would charge for data storage, but most do not. Instead, they primarily charge transaction fees based on the consumption of network resources like bandwidth, compute power, and RAM. However, these costs are transient as they account only for the resources consumed at the moment of the transaction. Most blockchains fail to charge fees for persistent resources, such as the ongoing cost of storing a user's account data and transaction history on the blockchain. Sui and Aptos address this issue by incorporating the cost of data creation into transaction fees. In other words, they price new data storage directly within the transaction, ensuring that users contribute to the long-term costs of maintaining the blockchain's storage. On Aptos, storage fees in APT are locked behind the data that is created. If someone modifies the data to be smaller or deletes the data entirely, a portion or all of that locked APT is remitted to whoever deleted that data. On Sui, the process of removing data from Sui's storage also allows for a refund of stored SUI. However, while most of the SUI can be returned (up to 99%), the rest remains in the fund, creating a permanent ""token sink"" of SUI. This storage fund earns rewards from the network (newly minted SUI allocated from the original 10B total supply). This fund then remits SUI rewards to the Sui network validators to help them pay the long-term costs of storing SUI's blockchain ledger. Both Sui and Aptos face significant amounts of token unlocks that will occur in the next few years. The current floating supply of Aptos is greater than that of Sui (39.9% vs. 30.9%). Over the next year, both protocols will add significant amounts to the token supply as investor unlocks occur. While Aptos will have 11.9% of its total supply ($1.2B at current prices) unlock over the next year, Sui will emit 7.6% of its total supply ($3.65B at current prices). Sui vs. Aptos: Our Valuation We base our valuation of Sui and Aptos on their projected year-end market share within the total smart contract platform (SCP) market capitalization. Our forecast for SCP market capitalization is derived from the estimated growth of the United States M2 money supply, reflecting their historical correlation. We project M2 to reach approximately $22.3 trillion by the end of 2025, continuing its annualized growth rate of 3.2% since its last trough in October 2023. Using regression analysis, we estimate the total SCP market value to reach $1.1 trillion by the end of 2025, a 43% increase from today's capitalization of $770 billion . This compares to an all-time peak valuation for SCPs of $989 billion in November 2021. Historical analysis of M2 changes versus SCP market cap changes shows a strong statistical relationship. The 12-month moving average of SCP market cap changes correlated positively with monthly M2 changes, exhibiting an R² value of 0.36 and a t-statistic of 5.7 (p . Market Capitalization of Smart Contract Platforms (SCPs) Peaked in November 2024 Source: Artemis XYZ as of 1/05/2024. Currently, Move-based blockchains hold a combined market share of approximately 2.7% of the SCP market, split between Aptos (0.7%) and Sui (2%). We forecast this share to rise to 6.5%, using an AR model demonstrating the lowest AIC among comparable forecasting models. This model also predicts the individual shares for Aptos and Sui. Sui and Aptos: Price Prediction Estimate by the End of 2025 Sui ((SUI)): 5.5% of the SCP market, corresponding to a market capitalization of $61 billion . With 3 billion tokens unlocked by January 2025, this equates to a token price of ~$16 . This represents a 326% gain from today's price of $3.75. Aptos ((APT)): 1% of the SCP market, corresponding to a market capitalization of $11 billion . With 50.5% of its token supply (507 million tokens) unlocked, this equates to a token price of ~$22 and is a 201% gain from today's price of $7.30. These projections highlight the strong growth potential for both chains. We believe Sui and Aptos are poised to capture a larger share of the expanding SCP market as other chains lose their relative status. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The information, valuation scenarios, and price targets in this blog are not intended as financial advice or any call to action, a recommendation to buy or sell, or as a projection of how Sui and Aptos will perform in the future. Actual future performance of Sui and Aptos is unknown, and may differ significantly from the hypothetical results depicted here. There may be risks or other factors not accounted for in the scenarios presented that may impede the performance. These are solely the results of a simulation based on our research, and are for illustrative purposes only. Please conduct your own research and draw your own conclusions. Sui vs. Aptos: Our Conclusion We believe the evidence supports Sui over Aptos due to its performance advantages and scaling potential. We find that it currently offers capabilities that are not replicated in Aptos. Among these are Local Fee Markets, Pilot Fish, and Fast Path. Additionally, Sui may offer a set of technical capabilities and economics that prove more attractive to market markers, resulting in a better-priced DeFi ecosystem. From a marketing standpoint, Sui has formed its technical capabilities into powerful memetic narratives that have attracted token investors and application builders. This has translated into better token performance and a more vibrant ecosystem of applications. However, we believe that Aptos's edge in designed flexibility and arguably more robust chain architecture may prove to be competitive advantages. While Sui has a substantial lead in many economic metrics, including TVL, DEX volumes, and transaction fees, this dynamic can quickly shift. The long-term winner will depend on which platform can sustain innovation while translating it into ecosystem expansion, including novel applications of crypto technology. Sui and Aptos Investment Risks Business Development - The greatest challenge facing both Aptos and Sui is achieving effective business development. While both projects have invested significant resources to incentivize ecosystem growth and emphasize their technical advantages, neither has yet developed a cohesive strategy that integrates technical development with ecosystem expansion. Both blockchains represent state-of-the-art distributed systems design driven by teams at the forefront of technological innovation. However, business success requires more than technological breakthroughs. For token prices to thrive, Aptos and Sui must attract and cultivate differentiated projects while using feedback to inform technical direction. Building the best system is admirable, but it is crucial to strike a balance between advancements that address current usability challenges and those designed to enable future use cases. While both chains have successfully onboarding projects, their ecosystems must attract applications that leverage their unique capabilities to create innovative use cases. A unified approach, where business development collaborates closely with technical development, is essential to build technology that solves problems users care about. Without this alignment and differentiation, these systems risk failing to achieve their potential. Technology - Sui and Aptos feature novel blockchain designs that have yet to be fully stress-tested in high-demand or adversarial environments. Although both have experienced surges in transaction volume, most were simple transactions rather than Solana-esque levels of DEX trading activity. This leaves uncertainty about how the systems would handle the intense trading conditions that have previously stressed many chains. Additionally, while the innovative features of these blockchains (Pilot Fish, Quorum Store, Fast Path) are engineering marvels, they might require adjustments if significant performance issues arise under extreme scenarios. These changes could potentially compromise some of their high-level capabilities, making it critical for the teams to continuously refine their systems without losing their edge. Competition - As second-generation high throughput blockchains, Aptos and Sui face competition from established ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana. While these older chains may lack the technical sophistication of Aptos and Sui, they benefit from larger developer bases and broader distribution backed by users with substantial financial resources. Emerging competitors like Monad and Berachain further intensify the landscape. Monad combines strong technology with a dedicated community, while Berachain has gained momentum by tapping into the crypto community's speculative animal spirits. Additionally, Solana's upcoming Firedancer upgrade, expected in 2025, promises to boost its performance, potentially surpassing Aptos and Sui in speed and throughput. The trend seen with Aptos and Sui, investors backing the narrative of better technology, is not new but inherently fleeting. Blockchain teams must consistently deliver and implement new innovations quickly to maintain relevance. History is filled with high-performance blockchains that lost their edge and token valuations to newer, more advanced competitors. Given the enormous economic incentives in the blockchain space, many of the world's brightest minds may pursue degrees in distributed systems engineering. These developing entrants will continue to the cadence of technological advancement, ensuring the competitive landscape remains dynamic. Macroeconomics - Like all financial instruments, blockchain tokens are subject to broader economic cycles. As alternative forms of money and financial systems, they compete with traditional monetary frameworks. While political and economic reform seems unlikely in most nations, unexpected shifts in fiscal policy or financial prudence could impact crypto markets. Crypto markets also exhibit high sensitivity to financial policy cycles. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the supply of M2 and the value of smart contract platforms, reinforcing the importance of macroeconomic trends in shaping blockchain token valuations. Regulatory - The recent rise in crypto prices reflects optimism about regulatory clarity under the new Trump administration. Although the administration's stance on crypto appears favorable, opposition to the industry remains strong and well-funded. While the executive branch's administrative ""deep state"" (SEC, FDIC, CFTC, etc) may no longer actively undermine crypto, challenges will materialize. One concern is the FIT 21 bill, which introduces criteria for determining whether a cryptocurrency qualifies as a commodity rather than a security. While this framework provides much-needed clarity, there is a risk that existing crypto incumbents and their allies may influence the bill's language to impose stringent decentralization requirements. Such requirements could disqualify chains like Solana, Sui, and Aptos, making their tokens marketable only to qualified investors and limiting broader adoption.

This, in combination with healthy on-chain metrics, seems to be setting Ethereum up for a potential long-term price appreciation. Historically, the supply of ETH on spot exchanges peaked during the 2018 bull run and again reached new highs during the DeFi boom of 2020-2021. However, since 2022, supply on exchanges has been in an almost straight-down decline, with 2023-2024 marking some of the lowest supply levels in Ethereum’s history. $ETH reserves on spot exchanges hit their peak during the 2018 bull run and surged again with DeFi’s rise in 2020-2021. But since 2022, reserves have plummeted, reaching historic lows by 2024. With supply drying up, upward price pressure is building—future gains might just be a… pic.twitter.com/auDEGchxRR — Kyledoops (@kyledoops) January 28, 2025 Supply on exchanges is drying up, and many analysts think that upward price pressure is now inevitable. “The upward price pressure is just so strong,” says crypto analyst Ali Martinez, who shares this view with many in the industry. Martinez bases his optimism on a couple of factors. One of them is simply that there’s not much Ethereum left to buy, at least not on exchanges. A second factor, he theorizes, adds even more uncertainty to the market. Martinez believes that because on-chain data has started to show that long-term holders are beginning to sell, there’s now a serious question hanging over the heads of market participants about just how confident the so-called HODLers really are. Long-term #Ethereum $ETH holders are starting to feel anxious! pic.twitter.com/2LkKRpSeum — Ali (@ali_charts) January 29, 2025 Ethereum Market Outlook: Whale Activity and Price Trajectory Although Ethereum is now back over the $3,000 level, on-chain indicators suggest that the market is at a crossroads. When you look at large transaction volume (LTV), which monitors the movements of big institutional trades, some fascinating trends come into view: – Not Even a Whale Squeeze – Unlike the bull runs of 2017 and 2021, we are not seeing a massive influx of institutional activity. This suggests that, in contrast to previous BTC bull markets, this one is primarily driven by retail traders. These are not speculative whales looking to capitalize on short-term price movements. – Is it Accumulation or Distribution? – Small spikes in whale transactions have occurred, but they aren’t at levels that suggest either parabolic movement or large-scale distribution. What this indicates is that Ethereum’s price action is still in a slow and steady uptrend, but if any large-scale buy or sell orders were to hit the market suddenly, there’s no telling how far or how fast the price would go in either direction. $3,000 Holding, but What’s Next? – ETH has held above $3,000, but to push toward $3,500 and beyond, it needs to see rising large transaction volume in confirmation. If we’re accumulating whales, Ethereum could see a breakout rally. But if we’re seeing breakdown distribution, it will be much less likely. Also: If we’re seeing whales accumulate via LTV, what might that say about price action? Is it good? Is it bad? And is it true that we’re seeing accumulation with or without breakdown distribution? Ethereum Market Update – Whale Activity & Price Outlook Ethereum’s large transaction volume (LTV) remains low compared to previous bull cycles. What does this mean for the market? Let’s break it down: No Whale Frenzy Yet – Unlike 2017 & 2021, institutional-sized… pic.twitter.com/ECkuTjSEGh — IT Tech (@IT_Tech_PL) January 29, 2025 Right now, the Ethereum market is experiencing a slight uptrend overall. The retail investor is significant at this stage. Ultimately, though, whale behavior will determine whether or not Ethereum maintains the upward motion we’ve seen so far this year or if it enters a sideways trading region. Ethereum ETF Activity and Broader Market Implications What is quite interesting is that Ethereum spot ETFs show neutral activity: they are experiencing a net outflow of $0.00 as of January 28. This certainly isn’t a good sign, but at the same time, it’s not a bad sign. No one is “fading” Ethereum with any kind of significant movement, and that absence of significant movement in either direction can sometimes be more informative than movement itself. It can indicate that we’re perhaps at a moment of stasis while the market figures things out. On January 28, the total net outflow of Ethereum spot ETF was $0.00. https://t.co/Tvs2oCSxTg — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) January 29, 2025 The involvement of institutions has historically driven Ethereum’s price action. With ETH reserves held on exchanges at all-time lows, any surge in demand from institutions—be it via ETFs, direct buying, or large-scale accumulation—could very easily result in a substantial price increase for Ethereum. Conversely, the absence of whale-driven price speculation means that Ethereum is enjoying a healthier phase of price discovery. And this, in turn, reduces the risk of a sudden market collapse like the one we’ve seen during previous speculative manias. Key Takeaways: What to Watch Moving Forward 1. Exchange Reserves at Record Lows – A contracting supply on exchanges, even more so if it is combined with enough demand, can yield a price increase. We have seen this scenario play out over the past year with Bitcoin. 2. Activity Among Whales Is Still Low—Large investors are not yet demonstrating the sort of aggressive accumulation or distribution that typically signals forthcoming major price movements. But this situation could reverse swiftly. 3. Support Holding at $3,000 – Ethereum has held strong at this level, and that typically indicates buying interest. Now, if large transactions start happening in Ether, then breaking through $3,500 will be seen. 4. ETF Inflows Stay Flat – A deficiency of substantial capital inflows from institutional investors suggests that Ethereum is still in a consolidation phase and hasn’t entered a new bull phase. For traders and investors, the way forward is clear: watch on-chain activity—especially whale transactions and ETF movements—like a hawk. If the big boys start piling into Ether, we should see a nice breakout above $2,000. And if they start throwing it into the wind, we should start looking for a heftier support range around $1,500 to $1,700. Either way, it’s all to play for on the Ether front in the second half of 2023. In the end, the long-term perspective on Ethereum is overwhelmingly positive. What we’re seeing now, though, is that the short-term market is in this fragile equilibrium, waiting for the next big market-moving event to happen. If the supply dynamics keep favoring price appreciation and something else doesn’t come along to push prices down, the market might force a retest of those highs from a few weeks ago.

Most altcoins are in a similar position, with ETH increasing past $3,200 and SOL rising to $240. BTC Above $105K The primary cryptocurrency had a quiet weekend in which its price stood mostly in a tight range between $104,000 and $105,000. The landscape changed on Monday, similar to the previous one when the bears took charge of the market and initiated a substantial leg down. Within hours during the morning Asian trading session, BTC plunged by several grand to a multi-week low of under $98,000. Nevertheless, the cryptocurrency didn’t stay there for long and went back into six-digit territory by the end of the day. The next couple of days were a lot less eventful, aside from another brief decline toward $100,000. The market anticipated the Fed’s decision on Wednesday evening, and bitcoin stood still. Once the expected decision of no interest rate cuts was announced, BTC headed south by over a grand from $103,000 to $101,500.

A comparison of the ether to bitcoin ratio across past cycles from the tokens' respective lows shows consistent underperformance. The black line in the chart above represents the current cycle that started in November 2022, when bitcoin bottomed at around $15,500 during the collapse of crypto exchange FTX . With each cycle, ether's return against bitcoin has diminished. On Wednesday, the ratio dropped below 0.0300 to touch 0.02993, a four-year low. The previous low was recorded on Jan. 19, a day before President Trump's inauguration. This month, the ratio — the exchange rate between the two largest cryptocurrencies — is down 15%. It has declined 44% over the past year. Bitcoin is currently trading around $105,000, having recovered from the slump to $98,000 caused by the release of DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) program. Ether, currently at $3,202, would need to reach roughly $3,360 to undo the DeepSeek damage. ""My general take is that the ether to bitcoin ratio underperformance is more due to a strength of bitcoin rather than a weakness of ether,"" said Andre Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise's European desk. ""Ether tends to suffer from 'middle child syndrome,' it is not as scalable as smart contract competitors like solana ( SOL ) while it is not really competing with bitcoin as the prime store-of-value.""",Markets|Ether|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-30 09:54:25

Spanish authorities and the T3 Financial Crime Unit blocked $26.4 million in crypto tied to a money laundering network operating across Europe. According to a Jan. 29 press release , T3 FCU — a team backed by TRON, Tether, and TRM Labs — worked with Spain’s Guardia Civil to track down crypto addresses linked to the criminal group. Officials say the organization laundered millions, converting cash into crypto for illicit purposes. TRON founder Justin Sun admits that the operation “exposes an uncomfortable truth,” adding that “criminals are drawn to the same features that make blockchain revolutionary… but we’re showing that TRON’s transparency actually makes it harder, not easier, to launder money.” You might also like: TRON teams up with TRM Labs to monitor USDT transactions According to a spokesperson for Spain’s Guardia Civil, the regulator used surveillance, investigative tools, and exchange KYC records to link the funds to money laundering. The spokesperson also revealed the criminal organization “moved millions across borders” but didn’t provide specifics. As crypto.news reported earlier, the T3 Financial Crime Unit was created to fight illegal activity involving USDT on the TRON blockchain. It monitors over $3 billion in USDT transactions worldwide. For T3 FCU, this is the biggest asset freeze since its launch in 2024. In total, the group has helped authorities freeze over $126 million linked to illicit activity across five continents. Tether chief executive Paolo Ardoino says the move is a “testament to the power of blockchain” in fighting crime, warning criminals that “those who attempt to misuse Tether will get caught.” Read more: Crypto heists near $1.4b in first half of 2024: TRM Labs",News|Money Laundering|Regulation|Spain|Tether|Tron,EN,0,0,USDT|BLOCKCHAIN|SPONSORED|REGULATION|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-30 10:03:03

On Jan. 30, TRIV has launched a new feature on their crypto trading application, TRIV Crypto Futures. Indonesian traders can now access the futures market in accordance with local regulations and trading standards. With the launch of TRIV Futures, TRIV platform users can now trade crypto derivatives with a variety of crypto assets such as Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), Solana ( SOL ), and others. The platform offers up to 25x leverage on its perpetual contracts, which could increase the chances of making profit. In launching this new feature, TRIV has collaborated with Indonesia’s Commodity Futures Trading Supervisory Agency or Bappebti, the Indonesian Crypto Exchange CFX and Jakarta Futures Exchange JFX. This way, futures trading on the app will be under direct supervision of regulators, ensuring a safe and secure ecosystem. TRIV becomes the latest Indonesian crypto exchange to launch its own futures contract trading feature, following PINTU, PLUANG and others which have launched theirs near the end of 2024. You might also like: More than 60% of Indonesian youths invest in crypto: report CEO of TRIV, Gabriel Rey, said in a statement that the firm decided to launch TRIV Futures as they saw a growing demand for it in the Indonesian market. He also assured that all trading activities on the TRIV platform, including Futures Trading, are carried out in compliance with high security standards set by official regulators. “So users don’t have to worry about security concerns, because this feature is official and authroized according to regulations in Indonesia,” said Rey in a press release, as quoted by Kompas. He hopes that the launch of TRIV Futures will boost crypto adoption in Indonesia. In addition, TRIV also plans to develop more new features moving forward, including improving services and adding to its list of tradable crypto assets, in order to provide users with the full experience. In Indonesia, supervision of the crypto sector is going through a transition from the Commodity Futures Trading Agency to the Financial Services Authority. The handover was set to take place on Jan. 12, however it has reportedly experienced delays due to a lack of government regulation issued to support the change.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Pepe and Cardano are showing signs of recovery, but Rollblock’s viral presale and disruptive casino platform could outshine them with explosive growth in 2025. Table of Contents Rollblock outshines meme coins and layer-1 projects Pepe could soon see a reversal Cardano Plomin Upgrade goes live Conclusion Pepe struggled to regain momentum throughout January, but the daily chart has finally started flashing signs of a potential recovery. Analysts also expect Cardano to rally before the release of the Plomin hard fork, although for now, it’s still rangebound below the critical $1 level. Meanwhile, web3 casino Rollblock is stealing the show, with its viral presale raising nearly $10 million in funds in record time. Read on to discover why Rollblock could deliver higher returns than PEPE and ADA in 2025. Rollblock outshines meme coins and layer-1 projects Crypto casino Rollblock bridges the gap between DeFi and online gambling through its GambleFi platform. By leveraging blockchain technology, Rollblock ensures a superior standard of security and transparency, raising the bar higher than ever. Rollblock’s gaming library boasts over 7,000 titles, including classics like slots and poker, and even new, AI-powered exclusives. The platform has already attracted over 45,000 daily active users, and this number is growing by the hundreds every day. In December alone, Rollblock recorded over $1.75 million in wagers alongside a 600% surge in new registrations. Analysts expect to see even bigger numbers for January 2025, priming the RBLK token for an explosive 100x breakout post-launch. Through the novel revenue-sharing mechanism, Rollblock will reinvest up to 30% of its weekly revenue into open-market buybacks of RBLK tokens. 40% of the amount will be distributed to holders as staking rewards. The remaining 60% of repurchased tokens are removed from the circulating supply through a burn mechanism, increasing scarcity and promoting long-term growth. You might also like: DOGE, ADA, BNB battle market fluctuation while Rollblock, Solana on track for new ATHs Pepe could soon see a reversal Pepe’s price dropped by 21% in the last seven days and is down by over 30% for the month. However, Pepe’s Relative Strength Index on the daily chart has rebounded sharply after reaching oversold territory. Simultaneously, Pepe is retesting the lower region of the Bollinger Bands, which potentially indicates the start of an imminent recovery. Pepe is currently trading for $0.00001227 after an intraday decrease of 2.98%. Cardano Plomin Upgrade goes live Cardano’s Plomin hard fork is scheduled to go live today, which will bring the ADA ecosystem closer to fully decentralized governance. Cardano holders will now have direct voting power on critical decisions regarding network parameters and future hard forks. Although this upgrade represents an important step forward for Cardano, its price remains volatile. At the time of writing, ADA sells for $0.91 following a 3% daily decline. Conclusion Rollblock has entered stage 10 of its presale, and RBLK tokens are selling for just $0.052. However, this discount window is expected to close very soon, as analysts anticipate an 880% surge by the end of the presale phase. To learn more about Rollblock, visit the website and its socials.

Therefore, retail investors who closely monitor smart money can gain a significant edge in the market. This article explores the five best crypto to buy now based on what smart money is talking about. 1. Pengu Unleashed: The Best Presale of the Month Pengu Unleashed ($PUNGU) has taken the crypto world by storm, raising a staggering $2.5M in just one week. But this project is about more than just profits—it’s making a real-world impact with a $1M pledge to penguin habitat conservation and climate change initiatives. $PUNGU is already gaining massive traction, with listings secured on BitMart and a soon-to-be-revealed Tier 1 CEX.

Solaxy Solaxy is building the first Solana layer 2 blockchain, helping cut costs while boosting speeds and reliability. The Solana ecosystem has been on fire ever since Donald Trump launched his meme coin there last week. However, the increased on-chain activity has underlined Solana’s long-standing congestion issue, which often occurs during times of peak activity. When the network gets congested, users are unable to execute their transactions, which can be costly. Solaxy’s layer 2 offers a solution by unloading some of Solana’s transactions to a separate blockchain. 3. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe is a new meme coin that provides its community with advanced data insight tools for trading. These include trading signals, meme coin picks, and a trading insider group. The project also offers staking and trading rewards, providing users a way to earn free $WEPE. Built on inspirations from the Pepe the Frog meme and Wolf of Wall Street, Wall Street Pepe’s approach to utility separates it from most other meme coins. 4. Ethereum Look at the Ethereum-Bitcoin price chart, and you’ll see Ethereum tanking. Look at news headlines, and you’ll see Ethereum being attacked. But in crypto, the anti-consensus bets often pay the most. After underperforming Bitcoin, Solana, and other major cryptocurrencies for some time, some smart money traders suggest that it’s finally Ethereum’s time to shine. McKenna, managing partner at Arete Capital, is one of those. ETH has had a disastrous performance this year, subdued below $4K, while Bitcoin runs well beyond its 2021 ATH. As such, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin has stepped in and plans to overhaul the Ethereum Foundation. No. This is not how this game works.The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me. One of the goals of the ongoing reform is to give the EF a ""proper board"", but until that happens it's me.If you ""keep the pressure on"", then you are creating an environment that is… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 21, 2025 Something else to consider is rumors that Ethereum staking ETFs will be approved in 2025, which could open ETH to significant liquidity inflows from Wall Street. With an underperformance against the market, a reform of the Ethereum Foundation, and a bullish institutional-focused catalyst, Ethereum seems well-positioned for gains in 2025. 5. Fartcoin Moving away from the seriousness of Ethereum, Fartcoin is an AI-created meme coin that has shown immense strength in recent months. The token launched in October and currently holds a $1.45 billion market cap. Taiki Maeda, an analyst who predicted the meteoric rally of Aave through Q3 and Q4 of 204, now says Fartcoin is one of the best cryptos to buy. His reasoning for buying Fartcoin is simple: it’s an AI meme coin, so if you believe in AI, this is one of the easiest places to allocate capital. Taiki argues that differentiating between AI agents and frameworks can be technologically challenging, while Fartcoin is a more clear-cut bet as the market-leading AI meme coin. Due to this, he suggests that Fartcoin could attract a lot of retail liquidity from those who don’t have the time or experience to identify the best AI utility coins.",More News,EN,0,0,ETH|TRADING|SOL|MARKET|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-01-30 11:32:11

Matt Hougan, Bitwise’s investment chief, believes this sweeping move could disrupt the four-year market boom-and-bust cycle that Bitcoin and other cryptos have followed over the past decade. Hougan described the executive order as a pivotal step toward “the full mainstreaming of crypto,” paving the way for banks and Wall Street to aggressively enter the space. The directive, which calls for exploring a federal digital asset stockpile and drafting comprehensive regulatory frameworks, has positioned itself as a landmark moment for the sector. Hougan noted that this initiative could unlock trillions in new investments, dwarfing the billions already flowing through crypto ETFs. The Evolving Four-Year Crypto Cycle Over Bitcoin’s 16-year lifespan, it has experienced a well-known four-year pattern: significant pullbacks in 2014, 2018, and 2022, followed by record highs in the three years between each dip. Analysts predict the next major market correction to occur in 2026 if this trend continues. However, Hougan suggested that the cycle’s influence might be waning. He highlighted the presence of more value-driven investors and a broader base of buyers as factors mitigating market volatility. “We won’t fully escape the four-year pattern,” he said, “but any pullback will likely be shorter and less severe than in previous years.” Historical downturns, including the collapse of Mt. Gox and the SEC’s crackdown on initial coin offerings, were cited by Hougan as key contributors to past market falls. More recently, the bankruptcies of FTX, Three Arrows Capital , and other major players drove the 2022 downturn. Wall Street and Regulatory Changes A significant aspect of Trump’s executive order is its potential impact on Wall Street’s involvement in crypto. With the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) canceling its Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 rule, banks can now more easily custody cryptocurrencies without treating them as liabilities on their balance sheets. Though immediate effects are unlikely, Hougan emphasized that White House crypto czar David Sacks will need time to develop the framework while financial giants navigate the learning curve. Looking ahead, Bitwise remains optimistic, maintaining its bold prediction that Bitcoin could reach $200,000 by the end of 2025, regardless of whether a national strategic Bitcoin reserve is established.

The Metro Gambir Police in Central Jakarta have arrested 20 suspects in connection with an elaborate crypto romance scam that targeted middle-class women, mostly professionals such as lawyers and doctors from the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand, according to local media . The scammers approached victims using fake profiles on dating platforms like OkCupid, Bumble, and Tinder. The bad actors then feigned romantic interest to gain their trust before moving the conversations to WhatsApp, where they eventually pitched a dubious cryptocurrency trading platform dubbed Wish. Rezeki R. Respati, Head of Metro Gambir Police in Central Jakarta, said the investment schemes promised returns of up to 25%, and victims were asked to deposit funds via the fraudulent platform.

Investigators have seized financial records and other evidence related to the fraudulent crypto transactions. Among those apprehended, three individuals were believed to be masterminds behind the scheme, while the rest played supporting roles in executing the fraud. Authorities are also searching for one suspect, AJ, believed to be a foreign national from China. A separate report from the Jakarta Post suggested that the scam was part of a larger syndicate headed by Chinese nationals. Crypto scams and ties to China Crypto scams with alleged Chinese links have surged across multiple jurisdictions in the past year. Past investigations have uncovered massive human trafficking rings, forcing victims into becoming cyber slaves executing crypto scams for Chinese criminal networks. Last year, a Chinese-run scam centre that operated crypto and romance scams was shut down by Philippine authorities. During a raid, authorities arrested 100 individuals involved. Indian authorities shut down two major scams in 2024—the HPZ token scam, which led to the country’s Enforcement Directorate filing a charge sheet against 299 entities directly controlled by Chinese nationals, and the DataMeer trading platform, which defrauded locals of inr 10 million. In November, Irish law enforcement seized $3.42 million worth of cryptocurrency, believed to be loot from pig butchering scams operated by a Chinese criminal gang. On Nov. 12, Daren Li, a dual citizen of China and St. Kitts and Nevis pleaded guilty to playing a role in laundering $73 million in proceeds from crypto scams via shell companies in the U.S. Read more: Indonesia’s crypto transactions rose over 350% in a year",News|Crypto Scam|Cryptocurrency|Indonesia,EN,0,0,ASIA|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-30 11:32:47

Netherlands ‘ third-largest bank ABN AMRO has completed a trading trial with 21X, a Frankfurt-based digital asset exchange, which tested on-chain settlement for tokenized securities using stablecoins. In a Jan. 30 announcement , 21X said the test involved listing a tokenized asset on its on-chain market. ABN AMRO issued an ERC-3643 token on the Polygon Amoy Testnet, while 21X paired it with an ERC-20-based “E-Money Token,” without naming the asset. “As part of our launch preparations we are now in the process of onboarding institutional participants,” said Max Heinzle, chief executive of 21X. He also praised blockchain’s role in cutting costs and increasing efficiency in the on-chain system.

Trump Buys SUI (TRUMPSUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys SUI launched with over $29,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Buys SUI by entering its contract address (CA) – 7chY3Yw9cArR4CGQQ2N6mciszZvWB3rW6WoBNTfwyitu – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSUI.

Fed chair Jerome Powell did not offer much other than, “We are waiting to see what policies will be implemented.” During a press briefing held at around 7 PM GMT yesterday, the Fed’s lead official gave a statement that omitted the central bank’s plan to deal with inflationary pressures and employment rates. Besides “labor market conditions remain solid” and “inflation remains somewhat elevated,” it almost seems like Powell said nothing, at all. In the last Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last year, he acknowledged the country was making “progress” toward its 2% inflation target; that word was nowhere to be heard this time. Fed pauses rates, directs focus to ‘what Trump’s administration will do’ Jerome and his team of officials are silently whispering to the US government that one reason for the Fed’s caution is uncertainty over how President Donald Trump, its number one critic, might reshape economic policy. They believe that if Trump returns the US to aggressive trade negotiations, including new tariffs on major US trading partners like Mexico, Canada, and China, inflation dynamics and global economic conditions will change, and not in a good way. The chair admitted in December that some officials have already factored such risks into their economic projections. But the 47th POTUS took office just ten days ago, and they still failed to achieve their 2% inflation rate target. It is almost common knowledge that if Trump could, he would have sent Powell packing within his first day in the Oval Office. Powell does not share the Trump administration’s win-at-all-costs style President Trump has long criticized the Federal Reserve’s handling of interest rates, saying that his successful business lifeline gives him a better perspective than “people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.” On January 23, at the World Economic Forum in Davos , he demanded the Fed to “drop interest rates immediately.” And after Powell announced the rates would remain untouched on Wednesday, Trump rage-posted on Truth Social: “ Because Jay Powell and the Fed failed to stop the problem they created with Inflation, I will do it by unleashing American Energy production, slashing Regulation, rebalancing International Trade, and reigniting American Manufacturing, but I will do much more than stopping Inflation, I will make our Country financially, and otherwise, powerful again! “ An increase in domestic manufacturing guarantees Americans more jobs, higher wages, and greater production capacity, which will obviously take both consumer spending and overall economic growth through an uptrend phase. On the other hand, the reduction in imports might push up the cost of goods, especially for industries reliant on cheaper foreign products. Domestic production often comes with higher labor and production costs, which could result in price inflation for goods and services that were previously sourced abroad at much lower costs. Now here’s the kicker: President Trump wears his American spirit on his sleeve, and he fancies the chances of the country surviving without China and the rest of the world, and so does the rest of the country. The positive response from the executive orders he has signed affirms that. Although nobody is saying that Powell doesn’t have the US’s best interest at heart, he clearly isn’t as headstrong as the country’s chief executive and doesn’t believe that Trump’s policies will work for the better. Quite ironically, the Fed chair admitted to a Fox Business reporter during a press briefing Wednesday that President Trump’s order to slow down immigration will help buff up the US employment rate. “What’s happening is the flow across the border has decreased very significantly, and we expect that to continue. The job creation has also come down too, and with those two going down together, the job market starts to stabilize,” said Powell. That’s as close as the Fed chair might come to admitting that the President’s policies are working.

A top analyst from Wall Street has sparked excitement with a daring prediction—Ethereum is set to reach $10,000 by March 2025. At the same time, DTX Exchange, an innovative hybrid trading platform, is making waves with its impressive presale performance, having raised over $13 million. Moreover, holders can benefit from a 33.5% APY, offering a passive income stream for savvy investors. Beyond its presale, DTX is poised to merge traditional markets with crypto advancements. Is this altcoin positioned to deliver the momentum needed as we await the next bullish cycle? Should Ethereum hit the $10,000 mark, DTX Exchange could become a major player in the DeFi arena. Ethereum's $10,000 Target by Mid-2025 Ethereum is experiencing a powerful surge, currently trading around $3,200 this week. This upward trend is fueled by speculation that it might become part of the U.S. national digital asset reserves. Analysts are now targeting a remarkable $10,000, driven by strong technical indicators and a wave of institutional interest. World Liberty Financial, a DeFi project associated with Donald Trump, has aggressively acquired 74,228 ETH (valued at approximately $250 million) recently. This move aligns with Trump’s executive directive to establish a national crypto reserve, initially focusing on Bitcoin but anticipated to include ETH, XRP, and Solana in the future. Market metrics highlight the optimism: ETH’s market cap has surpassed $410 billion, with daily trading volumes climbing to $34 billion, signaling that traders are making substantial bets. Technical experts note that ETH is breaking out of a downward trend and will soon aim for $4,000. Furthermore, the growing adoption of ETH ETFs and institutional interest makes the $10,000 target plausible for this crypto giant. This rally could pave the way for DTX Exchange, a promising asset with strong bullish momentum. Exploring the New Hybrid Trading Platform The expected surge in Ethereum’s value to $10,000 suggests the crypto market might soon see additional gains. Amid these developments, DTX Exchange has emerged as a project gaining traction in its early phases. It has already secured over $13 million in its current presale phase and is now trading at its final presale price of $0.16. While its presale success is drawing attention, DTX positions itself as a hybrid trading platform set to connect traditional finance with decentralized innovation. This vision has attracted both retail and institutional interest. At its core, DTX proposes to integrate forex, stocks, and cryptocurrencies into a single interface, providing traders with a unified access point to various asset classes. A key feature is its emphasis on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, which could open up traditionally illiquid markets, though its effectiveness will depend on regulatory acceptance and usage. Additionally, the platform has incorporated a non-custodial storage solution, Phoenix Wallet, which has seen hundreds of thousands of downloads during the presale. This wallet aims to reduce reliance on third-party services, a crucial factor for privacy-conscious users. Advanced Trading Tools for Strategic Traders DTX sets itself apart with features designed for seasoned traders. Its 1,000x leverage, rare among decentralized exchanges (DEXs), could attract those seeking amplified returns. DTX Exchange uses distributed liquidity pools to address volatility worries and minimize slippage for high-volume transactions. The platform also supports algorithmic and quantitative trading through APIs, enabling users to automate strategies and exploit market inefficiencies. These tools position DTX as a potential hub for sophisticated traders. Evaluating DTX Exchange's Future Although DTX’s presale achievement and feature-rich roadmap are notable, its long-term success depends on effective execution. The ambition of merging regulated assets with DeFi is significant, necessitating the seamless integration of traditional financial systems with blockchain technology. The project’s initial momentum indicates robust market confidence. Its hybrid model caters to the increasing demand for platforms that serve both traditional investors and crypto enthusiasts. If DTX can realize its vision of a comprehensive cross-market trading platform, it may establish a unique position in the evolving fintech landscape. DTX's Potential to Lead the Market As DTX moves toward its official launch, stakeholders are attentively watching to see if its potential benefits—such as the 33.5% APY staking and hybrid trading innovations—translate into practical applications. With Ethereum’s anticipated $10,000 rise boosting the crypto market’s bullish sentiment, DTX could take advantage of increased investor interest in high-yield prospects. While DTX’s promise of combining decentralized agility with Wall Street-caliber tools is enticing, its success depends on implementation. Given its strong presale outlook and innovative features, smart investors might expect positive returns by mid-2025.

Ethereum's potential rise to $10,000 could make DTX Exchange a significant disruptor in the DeFi space. $10,000 in Sight For the Ethereum Price By Mid-2025 Ethereum is surging with explosive momentum, trading at around $3,200 this week. This surge is fueled by rumors that it could join the U.S. national digital asset reserves. Analysts now eye a staggering $10,000 target, driven by bullish technical patterns and a frenzy of institutional activity. World Liberty Financial, a DeFi project linked to Donald Trump, has aggressively accumulated 74,228 ETH (worth ~$250 million) in the past few days. This aligns with Trump’s executive order to build a national crypto reserve, which is currently focused on Bitcoin but is expected to expand to ETH, XRP, and Solana. Market data underscores the optimism: ETH’s market cap eclipsed $410 billion, and daily trading volume surged to $34 billion, clearly indicating that traders are betting big. Technical analysts note that ETH is breaking free from a bearish channel and will soon target $4,000. In addition, increasing ETH ETF and institutional adoption makes the path to $10,000 plausible for this crypto titan. This rally could set the stage for DTX Exchange, an explosive gem primed with bullish momentum. A Closer Look at the Emerging Hybrid Trading Platform The anticipated rise in Ethereum's price to $10,000 reveals that the crypto market could deliver more gains soon. Amid the ongoing prospects, DTX Exchange has emerged as a project gaining traction in its early stages. So far, it has raised over $13 million in its ongoing presale phase and is currently trading at the final presale price of $0.16. While its presale success turns heads, DTX prides itself on being a hybrid trading platform poised to bridge traditional finance and decentralized innovation. This vision has attracted retail and institutional interest. DTX’s core proposition is integrating forex, stocks, and cryptocurrencies into a single interface, offering traders a unified gateway to diverse asset classes. Another standout feature is its focus on Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization. This approach could democratize access to traditionally illiquid markets, though its real-world utility will depend on regulatory compliance and adoption. In addition, the platform integrated a non-custodial storage solution, Phoenix Wallet, which has released hundreds of thousands of downloads during the presale. This wallet aims to reduce reliance on third parties, a critical selling point for privacy-focused users. Trading Tools for Advanced Strategies DTX distinguishes itself with features tailored for experienced traders. Its 1,000x leverage, uncommon in decentralized exchanges (DEXs), could appeal to those seeking amplified returns. DTX Exchange utilizes distributed liquidity pools to mitigate volatility concerns and minimize slippage for high-volume trades. Additionally, the platform supports algorithmic and quantitative trading via APIs, allowing users to automate strategies and capitalize on market inefficiencies. These tools position DTX as a potential hub for sophisticated traders. A Balanced Outlook on DTX Exchange While DTX’s presale success and feature-rich roadmap are impressive, its long-term viability hinges on execution. The promise of merging regulated assets with DeFi is ambitious, requiring seamless integration of legacy financial systems with blockchain infrastructure. The project’s early momentum suggests strong market confidence. Its hybrid model taps into the growing demand for platforms catering to traditional investors and crypto natives. If DTX can deliver on its vision of a ""one-stop shop"" for cross-market trading, it may carve a unique niche in the evolving fintech ecosystem. The Road Ahead: DTX Could Be the Next Market Leader As DTX progresses toward launch, stakeholders are speculating closely to see if its theoretical advantages—like 33.5% APY staking and hybrid trading innovations—translate into real-world utility. With Ethereum’s potential $10,000 surge fueling the crypto market’s bullish momentum, DTX could capitalize on heightened investor interest in high-yield opportunities. While DTX’s promise of blending decentralized agility with Wall Street-grade tools is compelling, its success hinges on execution. Given its bullish presale prospects and innovative features, savvy investors can expect bullish gains by mid-2025.

This would make CNB the first central bank to hold the premier crypto. Czech National Bank May Allocate 5% Of Reserves To Bitcoin Speaking with Financial Times (FT), Czech central bank chief Aleš Michl revealed that he wants to add billions of dollars worth of the country’s reserves into Bitcoin. Michl will submit a plan to allocate as much as 5% of its €140 billion (or $146 billion) of the bank’s reserves to BTC. For perspective, such a Bitcoin buy would be equivalent to around 5.3 months of newly minted BTC, as noted by André Dragosch, head of research at Bitwise. Michl acknowledged Bitcoin’s significant volatility and limited track record but noted increased investor appetite since BlackRock and other investment managers listed spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and President Donald Trump’s campaign promises on crypto deregulation, and the establishment of a national BTC stockpile. “For the diversification of our assets, Bitcoin seems good,” Michl told FT, adding that he had a different stance than other central bankers in matters of crypto. “Of course, if you compare my position with other bankers, then I’m the one entering the jungle or the pioneer. I used to run an investment fund, so I’m a typical investment banker I would say, I like profitability.” Trump’s Crypto-Friendly Regime To Spark Bitcoin Rally President Trump’s return to the White House has bolstered optimism in the crypto industry due to heightened expectations of a more lenient regulatory environment for digital assets. Michl believes Trump’s crypto-friendly stance will potentially light a fire under the bulls, setting up the crypto for a break to new sky-high levels. “Those [Trump] guys can now kind of create some bubble for Bitcoin, but I think the trend would be an increase without those guys as well because it’s an alternative [investment] for more people.” The CNB governor further suggested that more central banks around the world could follow his example in the coming five years, but he also cautioned that the investment could end up being worthless. “It’s possible to have a big range of outcomes, that Bitcoin will have a value of zero or an absolutely fantastic value.” The world’s largest crypto briefly hit a record $108,786 just before President Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20 but has since retraced to $105,251 as of publication time.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|Czech,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|REGULATION|BUSINESS|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-01-30 11:42:56

Why Are Investors Banking on Lightchain AI for Major Portfolio Gains,https://bitzo.com/2025/01/can-pepe-compete-why-are-investors-banking-on-lightchain-ai-for-major-portfolio-gains,"Pepe Coin (PEPE) made waves in the cryptocurrency scene as a meme coin that captured the attention of traders, reminiscent of the rapid ascents of Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. Those who got in early enjoyed significant profits during its rise. However, as the crypto landscape changes, investors are now turning their attention to projects with solid fundamentals and long-term growth potential. Enter Lightchain AI. Having successfully raised $13.8 million during its presale at a token price of $0.005625, Lightchain AI is positioning itself as a promising option for portfolio growth approaching 2025. The Hurdles Facing Meme Coins Like Pepe Meme coins such as Pepe are encountering major obstacles in the crypto market. Their high volatility, primarily fueled by social media buzz and speculative trading, leads to erratic price movements, presenting significant risks for investors. This instability is further aggravated by the absence of intrinsic value or utility, as their valuation often hinges solely on market sentiment. Moreover, the market's increasing saturation with new meme coins makes it challenging for any single coin to sustain its visibility. Regulatory oversight is also on the rise, with increasing concerns about the speculative nature of these assets. This could result in stricter regulations that might affect their trading and usability. Collectively, these elements render the future of meme coins like Pepe highly unpredictable. The Reasons Behind Investors' Focus on Lightchain AI Lightchain AI is a cutting-edge platform that merges artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to offer innovative solutions across various sectors. Its tokenomics model is crafted for sustainability and equity, with a total supply of 10 billion tokens divided among presale, staking rewards, liquidity, marketing, team, and treasury allocations. Lightchain AI (LCAI) employs a deflationary tokenomics scheme to fortify its ecosystem. A portion of transaction fees and payments for AI-driven tasks are burned, permanently reducing the token supply. Over time, this controlled scarcity can enhance the value of the remaining tokens in circulation. By seamlessly blending advanced AI technology with blockchain, Lightchain AI is making a significant impact in the digital tech industry. Why Lightchain AI Is Attracting Investors for Smarter, Safer Growth While meme coins like Pepe thrive on speculative hype, Lightchain AI distinguishes itself by concentrating on practical utility. It's not about the buzz—it's about establishing a stable, long-term growth platform. Investors eager to diversify their portfolios view Lightchain AI as a wiser choice for enduring, sustainable returns. What sets it apart? By addressing real-world issues and offering scalable solutions, Lightchain AI is appealing to both individual traders and institutional investors. It's more than just a project; it's an investment geared for the future. Here's the process: Lightchain AI integrates off-chain systems like IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave to securely store datasets and AI models. The blockchain enhances security by handling metadata, cryptographic proofs, and access controls—ensuring traceability and integrity throughout. Ready to invest in innovation?

Early adopters reaped quick rewards during its surge. Yet, as the cryptocurrency market evolves, investors are shifting focus towards projects with robust fundamentals and sustainable growth potential. Enter Lightchain AI. With its presale raising an impressive $13.8 million at a price of $0.005625 per token, Lightchain AI is emerging as a strong contender for portfolio expansion heading into 2025. Challenges for Meme Coins Like Pepe Meme coins like Pepe are facing significant challenges in the crypto market. Their extreme volatility, driven largely by social media hype and speculative behavior, results in unpredictable price swings, posing substantial risks for investors. The lack of inherent value or utility exacerbates this instability, as their worth often depends solely on market sentiment. Additionally, the growing saturation of the market with new meme coins has made it increasingly difficult for any single coin to maintain prominence. Regulatory scrutiny is also intensifying, with concerns rising over the speculative nature of these assets. This could lead to stricter regulations that may impact their trading and utility. Together, these factors make the future of meme coins like Pepe highly uncertain. Why Investors Are Focusing on Lightchain AI Lightchain AI is an innovative platform that combines the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology to deliver cutting-edge solutions across multiple industries. Its tokenomics model is designed for sustainability and fairness, with a capped supply of 10 billion tokens distributed across presale, staking rewards, liquidity, marketing, team, and treasury allocations. Lightchain AI (LCAI) utilizes a deflationary tokenomics system to strengthen its ecosystem.

While Trump Coin capitalizes on political branding and meme culture, Skyren DAO focuses on revolutionizing decentralized finance (DeFi). Let’s explore why experts suggest including both in your portfolio and why Skyren DAO might be the smarter choice for long-term growth. Trump Coin: Political Meme Hype or Solid Investment Opportunity? Trump Coin (TRUMP) is a meme-based cryptocurrency associated with US President Donald Trump. Launched on the Solana blockchain , it leverages the cultural power of Trump’s brand, attracting both political supporters and crypto enthusiasts. What Makes Trump Coin Stand Out? Meme Power: Trump Coin thrives on internet trends and cultural relevance, similar to Dogecoin or Shiba Inu. Speculation-Driven: Its price is fueled by hype and market sentiment rather than utility. High Volatility: Investors have seen sharp gains, but the token’s lack of underlying value makes it risky. Despite reaching over $14 billion in market capitalization shortly after its launch, Trump Coin has been criticized for its speculative nature and centralized control. A significant portion of the tokens is held by entities affiliated with Donald Trump, raising concerns about manipulation. Skyren DAO: A Forward-Thinking DeFi Solution In contrast, Skyren DAO (SKYRN) focuses on building an innovative and transparent ecosystem in the world of decentralized finance. Operating on the Polygon network , Skyren DAO is designed to address the gaps in traditional financial systems by offering utility, sustainability, and highest level of security . What Sets Skyren DAO Apart? Decentralized Governance: Token holders actively influence decisions, ensuring the community drives the platform’s evolution. Airdrop Collection Tokens: Skyren DAO introduces a unique token model, allowing users to participate in crypto airdrops and DeFi strategies. Proven Security: Skyren DAO has undergone thorough auditing and KYC verification, ensuring transparency and trustworthiness. The focus on long-term growth, paired with innovatove features, positions Skyren DAO as a stable and innovative option. Expert Opinions on Skyren DAO Skyren DAO’s innovative approach to decentralized finance has drawn praise from both users and industry analysts alike. One X user criticized speculative tokens like Trump Coin , stating, “The problem with the $TRUMP coin is the same as with all other shitcoins — centralization and unlimited supply. It is in no way a competitor to Bitcoin (decentralized people’s sound money), no matter how much money people put into it. It’s a Ponzi scheme and it will collapse.” Meanwhile, Skyren DAO has been recognized for its focus on utility and sustainability. A recent report highlighted, “Skyren DAO simplifies participation in DeFi through its automated airdrop collection system, making it accessible to more users while driving value for token holders.” Leveraging Polygon’s scalable infrastructure , Skyren DAO ensures fast transactions with minimal fees, addressing challenges Ethereum’s base layer often faces. Experts argue that this practical focus gives Skyren DAO an edge over speculative tokens, solidifying its reputation as a platform designed for long-term growth and stability. How Skyren DAO and Trump Coin Compare Aspect Skyren DAO (SKYRN) Trump Coin (TRUMP) Purpose Decentralized finance, DeFi participation, and sustainable growth. Meme-based token tied to political branding and speculation. Governance Community-driven through token holder voting. Centralized, with significant control held by Trump affiliates. Utility Supports DeFi strategies and provides real-world use cases. Primarily speculative with little inherent value. Scalability Powered by Polygon, offering high speed and low transaction fees. Built on Solana, which has experienced frequent outages. Security and Audits Regularly audited for security; KYC-compliant. No clear transparency around security or governance. Skyren DAO provides utility and security, while Trump Coin relies on hype and branding. Both have their place, but Skyren DAO appeals more to those seeking stability and real-world application. The Skyren DAO Presale: A Unique Opportunity Skyren DAO is currently in its presale phase , offering early investors a chance to secure SKYRN tokens before they hit the market. Joining the presale comes with several benefits: Access tokens at a discounted rate, maximizing long-term returns. Be part of a growing ecosystem with strong community-driven governance.

Secure your tokens and take advantage of this opportunity by visiting Skyren.io. Trump Coin brings the excitement of meme-based investments, while Skyren DAO stands out for its focus on innovation and decentralized finance. Including both in your portfolio can strike a balance between the speculative opportunities of Trump Coin and the long-term growth potential of Skyren DAO. The future of crypto belongs to those who diversify wisely. Don’t miss your chance to secure SKYRN tokens and join a forward-thinking community shaping the future of DeFi.

Speculations around the XRP price and the future prospects of its ledger are constant. Newer altcoins that offer practical applications and less speculative behavior are making 2025 a crucial year for crypto investors. They must decide between established tokens and new entrants, both offering significant profit potential. Having raised over $13M by the final stage of its presale, DTX Exchange is set to bring extensive utility to the DeFi space in just a few days. DTX Exchange's unique use case is poised to transform trading by integrating DeFi with centralized finance, allowing users to effortlessly exchange fiat assets with crypto derivatives on a unified platform. XRP Price Could Surge to $5 A positive resolution in Ripple’s ongoing legal battle with the SEC could enhance investor confidence and lead to increased institutional adoption, pushing the XRP price upward. The case's outcome, which centers around whether XRP qualifies as a security, is expected to be favorable. Once resolved, XRP is likely to regain its momentum and reach new peaks. The growing use of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity platform is crucial for driving the XRP price higher. As more financial institutions and payment providers start utilizing the XRP token, its demand is expected to rise, further boosting its price. Altcoins are also predicted to mirror Bitcoin's upward trend. With a bullish market forecast for 2025, both Bitcoin and XRP prices are expected to thrive. As cryptocurrencies gain wider acceptance globally and attract more institutional investment, the maturing crypto market paired with economic stability offers a conducive environment for Ripple’s further growth. DTX Exchange Poised for Significant Returns DTX Exchange is making a significant impact in the digital asset sector by revolutionizing asset trading. By achieving what was once thought impossible, it has developed a platform that supports both fiat assets and crypto derivatives. This will deliver unparalleled security, rapid transaction speeds, and a robust blockchain-based infrastructure to support its hybrid trading platform. While centralized exchanges often lack transparency and trust, decentralized exchanges can be expensive and slow. DTX combines the strengths of both, overcoming their shortcomings to create a single platform where fiat and crypto can be traded together. Through DTX Exchange, users can obtain governance rights regardless of their investment size. They will benefit from the 1000x leverage feature and access liquidity a thousand times their investment. Additionally, the DTX platform’s AI trading tools will aid traders in making well-informed decisions.

The XRP price and the future potential of the ledger have been a hot topic for speculation. The advent of newer altcoins with less speculative natures and more real-world utility means 2025 is a pivotal year for crypto investors as they choose between legacy and new ones, with both promising massive gains. DTX Exchange has amassed more than $13M by the last stage of its presale, and in a matter of a few days, it will offer deep utility in the DeFi space. DTX Exchange’s use case is second to none and will reshape the trading landscape by merging DeFI with centralized finance. It will let users smoothly trade fiat assets with crypto derivatives on one smooth platform. XRP Price Rallies to $5 If there is a positive outcome to Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC, it will boost investor confidence and spur institutional adoption. The XRP price will follow suit. A favorable resolution is anticipated for the SEC case, which hinges on whether XRP is a security. Once the case settles, the XRP price will regain momentum and rise to new highs. There is increasing adoption of Ripple’s On-Demand Liquidity platform. It will play a key role in driving the XRP price upwards. As more financial stakeholders and payment providers adopt the XRP token, the demand for the XRP token will increase, thereby boosting the XRP price further. Altcoins are also likely to follow Bitcoin's trajectory. A bullish trend is expected in 2025 for Bitcoin and, therefore, for the XRP price. Globally, cryptocurrencies are gaining more acceptance, and there has been an influx of institutional investment. The crypto market is maturing, and with global economic stability, there is a favorable environment for Ripple to grow further. DTX Exchange to Deliver Big Returns DTX Exchange is making waves in the digital asset industry by changing how traders trade assets. It has achieved the unthinkable and created a platform supporting fiat assets and crypto derivatives. It will offer unmatched security, lightning-speed transaction times, and a robust blockchain-based infrastructure to support its hybrid trading platform.

With DTX Exchange, users can get governance rights regardless of their investment size. They will also be able to use the 1000x leverage feature and access liquidity a thousand times worth their investments.

Key Takeaways The DTX token is still affordable in the last phase of its presale at $0.16. Experts predict more than 100x returns this year, and it should be the best coins to invest in today.

Jerome Powell-led FOMC maintained the policy rate steady at 4.25-4.50 per cent in the first decision of Trump's presidency after reducing the rates for three straight meetings in 2024. “We do not need to be in a hurry to adjust our policy stance,"" Powell said in a post-policy press conference. The rate pause comes because officials seek further progress on inflation. Interest rate hikes can make traditional investments more appealing, potentially reducing demand for bitcoin. Conversely, lower rates tend to boost bitcoin by making other investments less attractive. Higher rates might strengthen the dollar, impacting bitcoin's price negatively, while lower rates could do the opposite. BTC added nearly 3% in the past 24 hours after the FOMC meeting, reversing all losses from a Monday bloodbath that saw prices drop as much as 8% — a liquidatations-led flushout that was ripe for dip buying opportunities, as CoinDesk noted. Cardano’s ADA, dogecoin (DOGE), xrp (XRP) and ether (ETH) mirrored BTC’s gains, rising as much as 3%. Solana’s SOL outperformed with a 4% rise. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 (CD20) added 2.8%. Outside of majors, litecoin (LTC) surged 14% as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) officially acknowledged the 19b-4 filing from Canary Capital for a spot Litecoin ETF, marking it as the first of its kind beyond BTC and ETH. “First alt coin 19b-4 to be acknowledged, rest were told to withdraw by Genz SEC,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas said on X . “In the comments from SEC on the S-1 and this filing is by far the furthest along checking all the boxes.” A public comment period has now been initiated with a 240-day decision deadline for the SEC in about 240 days.",Markets|Litecoin|Bitcoin|Markets,EN,0,0,BTC|LTC|ADA|DOGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-30 11:56:04

With innovative features and a strategic vision, the platform is already being touted as a project with the potential for 20x returns. AI-Driven Solutions for Practical Utility In contrast to Dogecoin, which relies heavily on community enthusiasm and hype, Lightchain AI is centered around providing tangible, real-world applications. The platform focuses on AI-powered decentralized applications (dApps) that empower businesses and developers to handle complex computational challenges on the blockchain. These challenges include sophisticated data modeling, AI-driven analytics, and automation in real-time. By integrating artificial intelligence seamlessly with blockchain technology, Lightchain AI presents practical use cases across a variety of sectors, ensuring its value transcends mere speculation. This emphasis on functionality makes Lightchain AI an appealing investment for those aiming for substantial long-term returns. Tokenomics for Sustained Growth Lightchain AI’s strategic tokenomics offer a compelling alternative to Dogecoin. With a capped supply of 10 billion tokens , the platform has thoughtfully allocated resources to bolster its ecosystem. For example, 5% of tokens are reserved for marketing and partnerships to boost global recognition and adoption, and 6.5% is set aside for a treasury fund to ensure operational stability. This careful distribution allows Lightchain AI to grow effectively while maintaining economic balance, sharply contrasting with Dogecoin’s inflationary supply model. The platform’s focus on sustainability further enhances its appeal to investors seeking dependable growth. Fostering Early Adoption and Developer Participation One of Lightchain AI’s primary growth strategies is its dedication to promoting early adoption by engaging developers. The platform provides a robust set of tools, such as a sandbox environment, allowing developers to test and deploy dApps without risk. By offering accessible resources and incentives, Lightchain AI actively fosters innovation within its network. This forward-thinking strategy is already drawing a wide array of developers and businesses, reinforcing its role as a platform engineered for real-world adoption .

The CoinDesk 20 Index, which debuted a year ago, measures the performance of leading digital assets, catering to institutional demand for diverse tradable products beyond bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH). The availability of options means traders can speculate on volatility and time in addition to price direction, bringing professional liquidity to the index. Options are derivative contracts that give the holder the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price on or before a specific date. The ongoing crypto bull run, led by the institutionalization of bitcoin, has seen investors embrace options tied to BTC and crypto-linked products, including alternative investment vehicles like spot ETFs. ""As the digital assets market continues to mature, qualified institutional market participants are demanding a foundational reference index to trade, invest and measure performance,” said Perry Parker, head of options trading at BlockFills. Institutions are already participating in BlockFills's CD20 options, with digital asset manager and multi-strategy crypto fund Hyperion Decimus executing the first transaction this month. ""The BlockFills CoinDesk 20 index options market is a unique solution for professionals managing a portfolio within this asset class, and we are thrilled to kick off trading of the product,"" said Chris Sullivan, Principal at Hyperion Decimus.

The move suggests a possible sale by investors, taking advantage of the recent price rallies. The total altcoin market cap, except BTC and ETH, hit a high of $1.03 trillion, hitting a resistance wall. A large amount of altcoins are moving to centralized exchanges, a potentially bearish sign for crypto market participants. Blockchain analysis platform Santiment highlighted the developments for leading altcoins, including Mantra (OM), Worldcoin (WLD), Movement (MOVE), stETH, Reserve Rights (RSR), and Maker (MKR). Large inflows of altcoins to exchanges typically indicate that holders may be looking to sell. This can lead to increased selling pressure and potential price declines. There could be multiple reasons for this transfer, including profit-taking, fear of further declines, or macroeconomic events affecting the broader crypto market. According to a post on X (formerly Twitter) by Santiment, a substantial 0.21% of WLD supply moved to Bybit along with 0.20% supply of stETH and OM being moved to Bybit and Binance, respectively.

Among cryptocurrencies with $5 billion-plus market valuations, the standout performer is litecoin (LTC), the silver to bitcoin's gold, which has jumped more than 11% since the early Asian hours compared with gains of 1% to 3% for the rest. It is the third-best performing of the top 100 coins in the past 24 hours, thanks to the SEC acknowledging Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF proposal. That has opened for public feedback, a move that hints at potential approval in the coming months. ""This is the first altcoin ETF filing to get acknowledged,"" Bloomberg Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas said on X, noting that the proposal is the one to make the most progress in regulatory requirements. A potential listing could be as positive for LTC as it has been for BTC and ETH. Note that despite the price surge to $130, LTC is still well short of the $410 record high hit in 2021. Its price chart shows a constructive outlook (check out the Technical Analysis section below). In other key developments, on-chain activity tracked by Glassnode shows a lower level of retail participation in BTC right than in November. That's encouraging for bulls looking for cues on whether the latest move above $100,000 is sustainable. Meanwhile, Lombard Finance is becoming more dominant in the bitcoin staking space, capturing a giant share of the total BTC staked this week. The number of Ethereum's active addresses recently topped a March 2024 high, signaling a renewed uptick in the on-chain activity, according to IntoTheBlock data. Ether's price has crossed above $3,200 but is yet to clear the bearish trendline connecting the Dec. 16 and Jan. 6 highs. In traditional markets, the yield on the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note has dropped to 4.50%, revisiting Monday's low in a bullish move for risk assets. Those bullish on BTC may be hoping for U.S. core PCE inflation to come in softer-than-expected later today, driving the bond yield even lower. That said, we will also get fourth-quarter GDP alongside the weekly jobless claims report. Meanwhile, European gas prices have surged to a 15-month high and could inject some volatility into risk assets. Stay alert!

33767162,[object Object],1738238428,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Crypto Banking Gets Green Light From Fed Chair Jerome Powell,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-banking-green-light-fed-chair-powell/,"Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered remarks yesterday suggesting that US banks can freely engage with crypto clients—provided they understand and manage the inherent risks. Powell’s comments came during the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) press conference, where he addressed queries about the Fed’s stance on crypto banking. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they understand and can manage the risks,” Powell said . “We’re not against innovation, and we certainly don’t want to take actions that would cause banks to terminate customers who are perfectly legal just because excess risk aversion may be related to regulation and supervision.” Positive Reactions From Crypto Industry Within hours, key figures in the community offered widespread praise for Powell’s statement, interpreting it as a green light for banks that have been hesitant to embrace crypto services. Nic Carter, a partner at Castle Island Ventures and co-founder of blockchain data aggregator Coinmetrics.io, commented via X, “Immense tonal shift. OCP2.0 over. this is particularly notable because my understanding is the Fed specifically was the nexus of OCP2.0.” This sentiment was echoed by Hunter Horsley, CEO of Bitwise Asset Management, who tweeted , “Banks will be a major catalyst for crypto in 2025. Mainstream era beginning.” Meanwhile, David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, remarked , “Massive wave incoming over next 6-18 months. Most aren’t aware of the scale of it.” Joe Consorti, head of growth at They, underscored the potential breadth of bank offerings: “Banks can custody bitcoin on behalf of clients, create structured bitcoin financial products, and allow customers to buy bitcoin. Even Powell isn’t badmouthing it anymore. Vibe shift.” Bitcoin analyst Dylan LeClair also signaled the convergence of regulatory and market forces, stating, “FASB + repeal of SAB 121 + In-Kind redemptions for ETFs. Banks are here.” Powell’s comments arrive at a moment when several regulatory and accounting changes are poised to reshape how banks handle digital assets. In August 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) introduced a standardized framework for accounting cryptocurrencies on company balance sheets. This was a landmark step, as it establishes clarity on reporting practices—a crucial component for banks considering offering crypto services. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had previously imposed Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 121 in March 2022, requiring financial firms to record customer-held cryptocurrencies as liabilities on their balance sheets. On January 23, 2025, the SEC repealed this rule through SAB 122. This move simplifies the custody process for digital assets, removing a substantial reporting burden and paving the way for more financial institutions to engage in crypto. Moreover, in-kind redemptions for exchange-traded funds (ETFs), especially Bitcoin ETFs, are set to become a reality under the Trump administration. Instead of using cash, this mechanism allows ETF shares to be exchanged for the underlying assets—aligning smoothly with Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and offering potential tax benefits. BlackRock recently applied for a rule change at the SEC for its spot Bitcoin ETF. Taken together, these regulatory evolutions—coupled with Powell’s supportive tone—signal a turning point for banks considering entry into crypto markets. Industry observers suggest that, with obstacles like SAB 121 removed and transparent FASB rules in place, US banks could become leading participants in the next wave of crypto adoption.

While investors are abuzz with excitement for the XRP price surge and Ripple ETF approval, DTX Exchange steals the show with a staggering $13.2 million presale gain. The hybrid exchange could flip Cardano’s market position by replacing it. Though ADA price is also on an ascending path, DTX Exchange’s market frenzy helps it take a lead over Cardano. XRP Price Analysis: Implications for Spot Ripple ETFs On Saturday, XRP price gained 0.25%, partially reversing Friday’s 0.61% drop to close at $3.1078. XRP price moved within a tight range of $3.0772 and $3.1420 as investors awaited SEC appeal-related news. Meanwhile, the broader crypto market advanced by 0.12%, taking the total market cap to $3.53 trillion. The SEC’s appeal strategy in the Ripple case remained the focal point on Saturday, January 25. On Thursday, January 23, the SEC held a closed meeting, likely discussing enforcement actions, including the Ripple case and the much-awaited Ripple ETF approval. XRP price’s near-term trends hinge on the SEC’s appeal strategy and progress toward a Ripple ETF market. A withdrawal could drive the XRP price above its all-time high of $3.5505. Ripple could break above $4 if the SEC approves pending spot Ripple ETF applications. On the downside, pursuing the appeal and rejecting the spot Ripple ETF applications could drag the XRP price below $2. ADA Price Analysis: Elliot Wave Predicts Cardano’s Surge To $2 A potential catalyst for the ADA price is that the Cardano network is seeing more developers. Santiment data shows that Cardano had the third-most development activity in the 30 days after Internet Computer and Hedera Hashgraph. This trend is also evident on DeFi Llama, where developers have made almost 2,000 commits this month, a big increase from the 709 they made in December. This month’s commits are the highest since August last year. Core developers have also jumped to 40, the highest point in almost 3 months. Cardano has some of the best technicals on the weekly chart. First, the ADA price formed a triple-bottom chart pattern around the $0.215 level. It failed to drop below that level in the last three years. Its neckline was at $0.810, its highest swing in March 2024. Cardano moved above that level in November last year and then retested it, a popular continuation sign. Second, ADA price has also embarked on an impulse wave of the Elliot Wave Pattern. The first phase ended at $1.327, which coincided with the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. It is now in the second wave, which will be followed by the third one, which is usually the longest. The third phase could push it to $2, which coincides with the 61.8% retracement point. Despite this, Cardano’s market performance seems nothing when compared to DTX’s ascent. DTX Exchange (DTX) Sees A 700% Price Surge In Ongoing Presale DTX Exchange (DTX) is a presale star that could change online trading forever. Those who bought into this crypto ICO event early on are now enjoying a 700% return. Since this presale is now in phase eight, more price pumps will come. Interest in DTX Exchange is sky-high at the moment as it recently launched its hybrid trading platform. On it, traders can buy over 120,000 asset classes that include CFDs, FX, and crypto coins. Plus, transaction speeds as fast as 0.04 seconds and no-sign-up KYC checks have made over 300K users sign up for this platform so far. The DTX native token will fuel this platform and its ecosystem which includes the Phoenix Wallet – a new secure custody solution for cryptos, stocks, etc. By holding this altcoin, users will get a part of the platform’s trading fee revenue and more. Currently, DTX costs just $0.16, but this price will rise to $0.20 after a Tier-1 crypto exchange like Uniswap lists it soon. This could make DTX one of the best crypto coins for fast returns this quarter. Key Takeaways DTX Exchange replaces Cardano as the best investment in this bull run, with the ADA price facing turbulence. The XRP price is expected to soar after the Ripple ETF is approved. Thus, XRP price gains and DTX's rapid ascent are the talk of the town in this session.

Amid the buzz over XRP’s potential price hike and the Ripple ETF approval, DTX Exchange is making headlines with a remarkable $13.2 million presale success. This hybrid exchange might overtake Cardano in market standing. Although ADA is also on an upward trajectory, DTX Exchange's market excitement gives it an edge over Cardano. XRP Price Insights: Impact on Spot Ripple ETFs On Saturday, XRP's price increased by 0.25%, partially offsetting Friday's 0.61% loss, closing at $3.1078. During the day, XRP traded within a narrow margin between $3.0772 and $3.1420 as investors anticipated updates regarding the SEC appeal. Meanwhile, the wider crypto market saw a 0.12% uptick, pushing the total market cap to $3.53 trillion. The SEC's approach to the Ripple case was the main talking point on Saturday, January 25. On Thursday, January 23, the SEC conducted a closed meeting, likely addressing enforcement actions including the Ripple case and the eagerly awaited Ripple ETF approval. The short-term trends for XRP's price are closely tied to the SEC's appeal tactics and the progress towards establishing a Ripple ETF market. If the appeal is dropped, XRP's price could surpass its all-time high of $3.5505. Should the SEC approve the pending spot Ripple ETF applications, Ripple might even break the $4 threshold. Conversely, if the appeal proceeds and the ETF applications are rejected, XRP's price could fall below $2. ADA Price Forecast: Elliot Wave Indicates Cardano’s Rise to $2 The ADA price could be driven by an increase in developers on the Cardano network. According to Santiment data, Cardano ranked third in development activity over the past 30 days, following Internet Computer and Hedera Hashgraph. This trend is also visible on DeFi Llama, where developers have made nearly 2,000 commits this month, a substantial rise from the 709 in December. This month's commits are the highest since August of the previous year. The number of core developers has also surged to 40, marking the highest point in almost three months. Cardano boasts strong technical indicators on the weekly chart. Firstly, the ADA price established a triple-bottom chart pattern near the $0.215 level, a point it hasn't dipped below in the past three years. Its neckline was at $0.810, the highest swing in March 2024. Cardano surpassed this level last November and retested it, a common continuation signal. Secondly, ADA's price has initiated an impulse wave as part of the Elliot Wave Pattern. The first phase peaked at $1.327, aligning with the 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement level. It is currently in the second wave, with the third wave, typically the longest, on the horizon. The third phase might propel it to $2, which aligns with the 61.8% retracement level. However, Cardano's market progress pales in comparison to DTX's rapid rise. DTX Exchange (DTX) Experiences a 700% Price Increase During Presale DTX Exchange (DTX) has emerged as a standout in its presale phase, potentially revolutionizing online trading. Early adopters of this crypto ICO are reaping a 700% profit. With the presale now in its eighth stage, further price increases are anticipated. Interest in DTX Exchange is at an all-time high following the recent launch of its hybrid trading platform. This platform allows traders to access over 120,000 asset classes, including CFDs, FX, and cryptocurrencies. The platform's transaction speeds, as fast as 0.04 seconds, and the absence of KYC checks upon sign-up, have attracted over 300,000 users so far. The native DTX token will power this platform and its ecosystem, which features the Phoenix Wallet—a new secure custody solution for cryptocurrencies, stocks, and more. By holding this altcoin, users can earn a share of the platform's trading fee revenue and additional benefits. Currently priced at $0.16, the DTX price is expected to rise to $0.20 upon its imminent listing on a Tier-1 crypto exchange like Uniswap, potentially making DTX one of the top-performing crypto coins this quarter. Key Highlights DTX Exchange is poised to overtake Cardano as the top investment during this bull market, while ADA's price faces challenges. The XRP price is anticipated to climb significantly post-Ripple ETF approval. Consequently, XRP's price increase and DTX's swift rise are the main topics of discussion in this session.

Dogecoin continues to ride its wave of community-driven momentum, while Cronos gains traction through strategic partnerships and ecosystem expansion. Amid this action, a new contender is emerging - Lightchain AI . With over $11 million raised during its Stage 12 presale at a price of $0.00525, Lightchain AI is poised to join the rally with its innovative blockchain platform. Could Lightchain AI become the next big name in crypto this cycle? Dogecoin Original Meme Coin Still Leading the Pack Dogecoin (DOGE) started as a joke in December 2013, but it’s no laughing matter today. Created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer as a parody of the cryptocurrency craze, Dogecoin features the iconic Shiba Inu from the famous ""Doge"" meme as its playful logo. What began as a lighthearted experiment has grown into a major player in the crypto world, thanks to its loyal community and high-profile endorsements from figures like Elon Musk. This meme-driven cryptocurrency has defied expectations, becoming a symbol of how fun and finance can collide. Fast forward to January 14, 2025, and Dogecoin is still making waves, holding strong at approximately $0.34. Love it or doubt it, DOGE continues to prove it’s here to stay in the ever-evolving world of digital currency. Cronos Building an Ecosystem Beyond Payments Cronos, an open-source and energy-efficient public blockchain, is broadening its ecosystem to include decentralized finance (DeFi), GameFi, and the metaverse alongside its existing payment-focused solutions. By incorporating the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and the Cosmos SDK, Cronos enables seamless interoperability between both ecosystems, allowing for the efficient migration of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. This robust architecture supports a wide array of applications, such as yield farming, liquidity provision, and other DeFi services. Furthermore, Cronos is actively advancing metaverse development by integrating blockchain technology into virtual environments to enhance user experiences and virtual economies. Through these strategic initiatives, Cronos is establishing a comprehensive ecosystem that transcends traditional payment functionalities. Lightchain AI New Contender for the Spotlight Lightchain AI is stepping into the spotlight as a blockchain platform built for scalability, efficiency, and real-world utility. Unlike Dogecoin’s community-driven appeal or Cronos’ ecosystem-centric growth, Lightchain AI combines innovative technology with practical applications. Its layered architecture ensures seamless scalability, making it ideal for high-performance decentralized applications (dApps). A key feature is its integration with off-chain systems like IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave, enabling secure storage of datasets and AI models. The blockchain itself stores metadata, cryptographic proofs, and access controls, ensuring traceability and integrity throughout the process. The ongoing presale, which has raised over $11 million, reflects investor confidence in its potential to disrupt the blockchain landscape. By addressing inefficiencies in existing platforms and offering solutions for both developers and enterprises, Lightchain AI stands out as a project with long-term promise. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf https://x.com/LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",More News,EN,0,0,DOGE|CRO|BLOCKCHAIN|TRADING|MARKET,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-01-30 12:10:31

As an AI-powered platform operating across four continents, its goal is to establish an unregulated decentralized market powered by its token, known as NEBA Token (prices start at $0.04 with public offering expected around $0.20). NEBA Token's primary function is fuelling blockchain-based online stores which lower costs while improving trust between merchants and consumers; its primary function being creating decentralized markets powered by its token NEBA Token's primary mission being fuelling blockchain-powered stores which reduce costs while improving trust between merchants and consumers - an ambitious task indeed! Reimagining E-commerce in the Web3 Era Traditionally, e-commerce has revolved around Web2-style structures which centralize power in the hands of only a few major players. While convenient at first, this often leads to lower margins for merchants and limited options for consumers. With decentralization redefining this landscape NEXT BASKET creates an advantageous competitive environment where control is redistributed evenly among all participants involved. Blockchain technology enables the NEXT BASKET model to do away with costly third-party validations and intermediaries, while smart contracts automate transactions, disperse loyalty rewards, update inventory records without human error or manipulation - this is where AI and blockchain meet: artificial intelligence increases operational efficiency while decentralization ensures governance remains transparent and data remains safe. NEBA Token's Role within Next BASKET By 2024, the company had achieved significant milestones, such as 35,000 registered clients and an annual turnover approaching 3 Million euros. Central to its decentralized approach lies NEBA Token, designed as more than simply another cryptocurrency. It serves three key purposes: 1. Loyalty Bonuses: Customers making purchases through NEXT BASKET-powered stores earn loyalty bonuses in the form of NEBA Tokens in their crypto wallets, incentivizing repeat business and encouraging repeat purchases. 2. Merchant Obligations: Store owners must purchase enough tokens in order to fund these bonuses as the platform expands, leading to rising demand as more stores join up and take part. 3. Platform Access: By holding NEBA Tokens, merchants gain free access to NEXT BASKET suite of tools - AI analytics, inventory management and marketing automation among them - at no cost. This model creates a closed-loop economy where merchants and consumers reap mutually beneficial outcomes. More merchants leads to increased token demand and thus an increased market value of tokens; both early adopters and the ecosystem at large stand to benefit. How Decentralization Enhances E-Commerce? * Maximization: Without middlemen, sellers keep more of their revenue. * Strengther Security: Blockchain records all purchases made on its platform, minimizing fraudster opportunities and data breaches. * Lower Fees: Automated processes powered by smart contracts reduce transaction and administrative costs, and fast deliveries through improved logistics and direct connections between stakeholders can speed up fulfillment processes. Economic Outlook and Tokenomics With 1 billion NEBA Tokens available, NEXT BASKET plans to raise $30 million through token sales and subsequent platform development. Most of this money will go toward marketing and platform enhancement efforts while half will go towards maintaining liquidity on crypto exchanges to ensure token stability and trading ease. Because merchants must purchase tokens regularly in order to compensate their customers, demand could cause its price to increase--projections estimate it could hit $3.50 within its first year of availability. Stepping Up For investors and entrepreneurs alike, the private sale of NEBA Token at $0.04 offers investors and entrepreneurs a rare chance to access NEXT BASKET forward-thinking e-commerce model at a discounted rate. Not only could you make potentially substantial financial gains but you will be contributing actively towards changing how online commerce is perceived and performed globally - using AI for operational excellence and blockchain for structural fairness to create an ecosystem in which all parties benefit from increased transparency, reduced costs and stronger loyalty dynamics.",More News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TOKEN SALE|TRADING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Crypto Daily', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptodaily,2025-01-30 12:17:12

Having raised millions in its presale of which $1.2M came from Solana whales it is dubbed as one of the most promising opportunities on the current market. Read on to find out why this is the case and why you should get on board today. Can Ripple’s XRP Price Hit $4? With the recent start of Trump’s term in office and his new SEC team, the broader crypto market will likely start benefitting. While a new chairman could help clarify the regulatory environment, ultimately, the future of XRP’s price is in the hands of its legal battle. Any further delay with the SEC lawsuit might dampen investor enthusiasm around Ripple’s outlook. XRP’s price is currently sitting at $3.08, with a market cap of $177 billion. Ripple has seen quite an impressive performance, rising from just several cents to its ATH of $3.84 in January 2018, but it struggled to maintain good momentum until November. In recent times, more precisely in the last two weeks, fueled by rumors and the imminent inauguration ceremony, XRP’s price jumped from $2.3 to almost $3.5. This is reflected in XRP’s price increase of almost 48% on the monthly charts. Despite a recent correction, Ripple’s XRP remains in the top 10 with the highest growth. With more than $4.4B invested in crypto by the largest investment companies in the world, such as BlackRock and Fidelity, if the pro-crypto chairman Paul Atkins commits to the resolution of Ripple’s legal case, we could easily XRP price breaching its ATH in 2025. However, Ripple holders also know that while the XRP price $5 mark is quite an astonishing performance, it is still only a 66% increase. They have recognized that its large market cap and market saturation are preventing the XRP price from pumping as high as this altcoin. That is why they have flocked in big numbers and started investing heavily in it. Solana’s Up 19%, What Is Next? Solana is a high-performance blockchain platform designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto projects with fast transaction speeds and low fees. This flexibility has made it regarded as the home to dApps, DeFi, and NFTs. Solana is currently sitting at $231, up 19% on the monthly charts, retaining its form despite the unstable market periods. SOL climbed from just $30 to more than $250 in November 2021, providing huge gains for those early backers. Furthermore, just recently, during the pre-inauguration day hype, Solana once again soared and managed to breach its ATH at $294. Furthermore, SOL’s market cap has increased by and is currently sitting at a whopping $112B. However, its large market cap and it being a well-established coin will keep the growth more modest. According to some analysts, Solana could rise to $350 by the end of the year, paling in comparison to this AI altcoin’s projected growth. Furthermore, the declining interest in SOL-based meme coins could put pressure on the token. This is why these whales have decided to back the AI altcoin with over $1.2M. IntelMarkets (INTL): The AI Altcoin Breaking Records IntelMarkets is making waves with its groundbreaking AI-powered trading platform. Launched in 2024, IntelMarkets aims to revolutionize the crypto trading market by integrating artificial intelligence into every aspect of trading.

In its ninth ICO stage, INTL’s tokens are priced at just $0.082, making them highly appealing to early backers. With some analysts predicting a 50x increase it’s easy to see why INTL comes out as a must-watch altcoin in 2025. Conclusion While XRP and Solana remain solid investments, their potential for exponential growth is limited. IntelMarkets (INTL) , with its AI-powered trading ecosystem and early-stage advantage, presents a far greater opportunity.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/trumps-crypto-policy-director-david-sacks-made-statements-about-bitcoin-reserve-here-are-the-details/,"Despite Trump’s crypto policy chief David Sacks confirming that the administration is examining creating a US strategic Bitcoin (BTC) reserve, betting markets remain unconvinced. Polymarket Skeptical of US Bitcoin Reserve Despite Trump Advisor's Reassurance Prediction platform Polymarket currently pegs the probability of Donald Trump ordering the establishment of a national BTC reserve within the first 100 days of his administration at just 16%, reflecting skepticism about the plan’s viability and political momentum. In a recent interview, Sacks confirmed that President Trump had asked his team to assess the potential for a BTC reserve, but refrained from making a definitive commitment. “President Trump has asked us to look into this issue, so we are not ready to comment on it yet. But it is one of the issues that our working groups will look at,” he said. Separately, Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), a staunch Bitcoin advocate, has introduced legislation to create a BTC reserve through a “Bitcoin Purchase Program.” The offering aims to purchase up to 200,000 BTC per year for five years, funded in part by the revaluation of the Federal Reserve’s gold holdings. However, this legislative initiative remains distinct from any previous White House-led effort and is currently under review by the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor, one of the strongest advocates of a US Bitcoin reserve, argues that such a move would preserve the dominance of the US dollar. Meanwhile, Texas is also taking its own steps toward a Bitcoin reserve. Unlike the federal effort, it seems more likely to move forward in the Texas state legislature, with Polymarket bettors placing a 53% chance that a bill approving a Texas BTC reserve will pass in 2025. *This is not investment advice.

Proof verification on Arbitrum ( ARB ) is about to become more efficient and cost-effective as zkVerify has integrated with the layer-2 solution, reducing verification costs by 91%, crypto.news can exclusively report. Zero-knowledge proofs let users verify information without exposing sensitive details, but they can be expensive and slow to process. By offloading this task to zkVerify, Arbitrum developers and users gain faster verification and lower costs. For instance, the integration allows decentralized finance users to prove creditworthiness with reduced fees, while DAOs can verify votes “in hours rather than days,” the press release reads. Nina Rong, head of partnerships at Arbitrum Foundation, says zkVerify’s integration with Arbitrum demonstrates how the technology can support advanced privacy solutions. “This advancement showcases the ability of Arbitrum’s infrastructure to enable sophisticated zero-knowledge applications while maintaining exceptional cost-effectiveness and performance.” Nina Rong You might also like: Arbitrum One as the first layer-2 to reached $20 bilion in TVL For testnet use only, for now Rob Viglione, co-founder and CEO of Horizen Labs, the team behind zkVerify, called the partnership a “significant step forward for both platforms,” saying it enables Arbitrum developers to create “more sophisticated applications while maintaining the speed and cost advantages that make Arbitrum attractive.” As of press time, the solution is live on Arbitrum’s testnet only, with a mainnet launch planned for Q2, the press release reads. The partnership comes as Arbitrum’s ecosystem grows, potentially positioning the token for a bullish breakout. As crypto.news reported earlier, the number of active addresses on the Arbitrum network has recently surged by 77% to 2.43 million, per data from Nansen. The boost has pushed transactions up by 35%, with fees increasing by 182% to over $1 million. With this surge in activity, Arbitrum has formed a falling wedge pattern, where two converging trendlines are nearing their confluence. This could signal a potential rebound, pushing the price to $1.2470, the upper side of the cup-and-handle pattern, a 76% increase from current levels. Measuring the depth of the cup suggests the price could rise to $2.13. However, a drop below the support level at $0.4626 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

As newer, more utility-driven meme coins hit the market, Pepe currency (PEPE), which was formerly seen to be a leader in the meme currency field, is now facing uncertainty. Many investors are turning their attention to newer tokens that offer more concrete use cases and potential long-term value, even though PEPE news is still being shared through updates and community-driven campaigns. The Rise of Pepe Coin and Its Popularity Due to its association with the online meme culture and the robust community that supported it, Pepe Coin became extremely famous. Since its debut, merchants, meme aficionados, and even celebrities have taken notice and joined the coin’s fervor. Nevertheless, despite its early success, its lack of a distinct use has started to hurt its standing in the market, particularly when other meme currencies with useful uses enter the market. The price of the Pepe Coin is $0.00001242 as of January 29, 2025, which represents a little decline from its peak values. Even though the coin still has a fervent fan base, some investors are beginning to doubt its long-term sustainability due to its lack of practical applications. Due to its speculative character, which is largely fueled by memes and social media buzz, the coin is prone to volatility, which raises questions about its future. New Meme Coins With More Utility Enter the Market Even while Pepe Coin is still a major force in the meme coin market, new tokens with more practical uses and a longer-term outlook are starting to appear. These new meme coins are providing novel use cases and ecosystems that can offer their users real benefits, in contrast to Pepe Coin, which mostly depends on internet culture and viral memes to drive its value. With features like governance mechanisms, partnerships with larger blockchain ecosystems, and decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities, meme coins like Panshibi are harnessing the potential of community-driven growth. These coins have the potential to provide users with genuine advantages beyond mere enjoyment; they are intended to be integrated into real-world applications. PEPE News Reflects Growing Concerns Over Its Future The PEPE news environment has changed as the market keeps changing. Many investors are now worried about PEPE’s speculative nature and are searching more and more for coins with long-term potential. Investor mood is changing in the market as a result of the emergence of utility-focused meme coins. Pepe Coin’s community may still contribute to its appeal, but it is The Shift Towards Utility and Long-Term Value Now that the Bitcoin market has developed, investors are putting utility ahead of excitement. Memes with obvious use cases are growing in popularity as the market favors initiatives that offer answers and deal with actual issues. Traditional meme currencies that provide little more than short-term speculation are starting to give way to coins like Panshibi, which are made with DeFi capabilities. More investors are looking for assets with longevity as they see past the euphoria generated by memes. More promising investments are thought to be made by meme currencies with useful features, like those that incorporate DeFi or provide staking rewards. These changes point to a change in the meme coin market, where coins like Pepe Coin can lose their dominance if they don’t adjust to the evolving needs of investors. Conclusion Even if Pepe Coin has enjoyed some success, its future is in question due to the emergence of more recent meme coins that have real-world applications. Pepe Coin is finding it challenging to hold onto its hegemony as investors are now looking for coins with long-term promise and practical uses. Memes like Panshibi are demonstrating that utility-driven tokens can do better than those that only use memes and viral marketing as the market develops. It remains to be seen if Pepe Coin can adjust to this shifting environment or if it will eventually become obscure.

With a growing community and an expanding ecosystem, analysts are suggesting that YETIO has the potential to surpass Ripple’s XRP and outperform the coin. The project has rolled out a limited-time 20% bonus from January 29th to 31st marking the Chinese New Year, igniting a surge of investor interest in the YETIO presale. XRP’s Legal Battles And Price Movement Ripple’s XRP has long been in the Crypto space, with ups and downs along the way. However, XRP has faced continuous scrutiny from the regulatory body, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Recent developments indicate that the SEC has removed Ripple and related civil actions from its website, as reported by crypto analyst JackTheRippler on X . While this is significant positive news for the XRP community, XRP price remains largely stagnant, currently sitting at $3.10 on Coinmarketcap after a minor 0.36% decline in the last 24 hours. With a market capitalization of $178.96 billion, it’s still a long way for new projects to take down the assets. Yeti Ouro’s Unmatched Potential Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is one of the most promising new altcoins in the crypto space. Currently priced at just $0.017, YETIO is in the second stage of its presale and has already sold over 151 million tokens. Thanks to its creative approach Yeti Ouro presale is performing beyond expectations. Yeti Ouro is built on the Ethereum blockchain which guarantees security and as part of its Chinese New Year celebration, Yeti Ouro is giving a 20% bonus to any investors who join the presale. The offer is running for a limited time from January 29th to 31st, further driving adoption and excitement. Analysts are predicting Yetio Ouro could see massive gains in the coming month based on the nature of the projects. Unlike most projects, YETIO is designed as a next-generation utility memecoin with real-world applications. It forms the backbone of Yeti Go, an upcoming Play-to-Earn (P2E) racing game. Yeti Go integrates Yeti Ouro (YETIO) tokens as in-game currency, allowing players to earn rewards, purchase exclusive in-game assets, and participate in competitions. This innovative approach is what analysts see as placing YETIO in a unique position within the crypto gaming sector, an industry that is rapidly expanding and attracting billions in investment. Yeti Ouro has captivated the curiosity of investors in the crypto market as well as the gaming industry. YETIO is rising as a leading candidate for 2025, investors looking for the perfect opportunity, this is the one to watch out for. YETIO Vs XRP While XRP price currently stands at $3.10, YETIO price is not as high making it quite affordable to investors. Aside from prices, XRP circulation is 100 times more than Yeti Ouro and automatically makes Yeti Ouro 100 times more scarce, boosting its potential to rally more. Right now Yeti Ouro is in its early stages with great potential, unlike XRP where early investors already benefited. At just $0.017, analysts believe that YETIO presents a 100x opportunity for early investors, with significant room for growth. As whales enter Yeti Ouro presale, it continues to gather steam, YETIO provides the ideal mix of substance and possibility for those looking for more than just buzz.

The ongoing sideways action suggests that the next phase could be a bullish breakout, contingent on the market maintaining current support levels. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart ADA has been consolidating inside a triangle pattern, with the recent price rejection at the upper boundary halting the previous bullish momentum. This rejection led to a decline toward the $0.85 level, which aligns with the 100-day moving average. This price range holds significance as it serves as a major support zone. Despite this setback, the expectation is for the asset to maintain its bullish consolidation toward the triangle’s upper boundary at $1.2. A successful breakout above this level could signal a continuation of the upward trend, pushing ADA to reclaim the $1.2 mark. Conversely, if the market fails to maintain support at $0.85, a bearish breakdown could occur, potentially delaying a recovery. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, Cardano successfully broke above a descending wedge pattern, only to face rejection at the $1.2 resistance level. This failure led to a consolidation phase within an expanding wedge pattern, with price fluctuations occurring above the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci levels. Currently, ADA is hovering near the lower boundary of this wedge, with a slight bullish rebound emerging. If the buying activity continues to grow, the price could surge back toward the critical $1.2 resistance. Nevertheless, an ultimate breakout from the $0.85-$1.2 range will determine the next major move for Cardano. Given the strong support zone, a bullish breakout is expected, with the potential for the price to continue its upward trend.

39696256,https://nulltx.com/?p=141906,1738243991,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Why Are TRON & Monero Holders Buying Panshibi & What Is The Panda Meme Likely To Do,https://nulltx.com/why-are-tron-what-is-the-panda-meme-likely-to-do/,"In a market flooded with new projects, the TRON news cycle is full of updates about decentralized entertainment and frictionless transactions, while Monero enthusiasts keep touting unmatched privacy features. Yet, despite the appeal of their respective technologies, a growing number of TRON and Monero holders are exploring a fresh meme coin called Panshibi. This move might seem surprising initially, but its reasons highlight a shifting tide in the crypto world, where meme coins can offer a unique blend of entertainment, profit potential, and community-driven spirit. Below, we examine why TRON and Monero backers are checking out Panshibi and how this panda-themed token could shake up the 2025 crypto scene. TRON’s Vision and What Holds It Back TRON (TRX), currently around $0.2379, set out to change the entertainment world by cutting out middlemen like YouTube or Apple. Its network supports smart contracts and dApps through delegated proof-of-stake, aiming for high transaction speeds. TRX holders who freeze their tokens get Tron Power, letting them vote for “super representatives” who confirm transactions and earn rewards. Despite these goals, TRON hasn’t seen huge gains lately. According to the newest TRON news, the project keeps growing but faces strong rivals like Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain. Many TRX investors feel let down by the slower progress, as 2025 hasn’t brought the big price boost they hoped for. Although the tech looks solid, this steady pace sometimes pushes people to look for other projects that might offer faster returns. Monero: Championing Privacy On the other side of the spectrum, Monero (XMR), currently hovering around $220.56, attracts users drawn to absolute privacy and fungibility. Built to obscure transaction details, Monero allows for near-total anonymity. This advanced cryptography not only hides sender and receiver addresses but also splits the transaction amount into randomized chunks, making it exceptionally difficult to track. The emphasis on privacy resonates with those wary of invasive oversight from governments or hackers. Despite its unique value proposition, Monero struggles with mainstream adoption partly because of regulatory scrutiny. Authorities often view privacy coins as a convenient tool for illicit activities, which complicates listings on major exchanges. For investors, this also means the XMR price can experience periods of stagnation as global crackdowns or delistings dampen interest. While true believers in privacy hold on for the long run, some also want a slice of the hype-laced returns often associated with the meme coin space. Panshibi’s Prospects in 2025 The meme coin space is unpredictable. However, past successes such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu demonstrate the massive gains possible when a vibrant community forms around a simple but catchy concept. If Panshibi successfully delivers on its roadmap, it could evolve from a mere novelty into a staple of 2025’s crypto discussion. As TRON holders notice stagnating returns and Monero backers wrestle with regulatory hurdles, Panshibi offers an alternative that merges the thrill of meme coins with a measure of built-in security. Conclusion Despite the ongoing TRON news spotlighting the network’s strides in decentralized entertainment, many TRX investors remain underwhelmed by the returns. Monero, though prized for its ironclad privacy, also faces hurdles that limit its growth trajectory. In this environment, Panshibi ($SHIBI) emerges as a fresh alternative that blends meme culture with robust tokenomics and fosters a community-driven ethos. For those seeking excitement beyond TRON’s methodical expansion and Monero’s guarded niche, Panshibi could be the meme coin to watch in 2025. Whether it truly becomes a breakout star or fades amid fierce competition remains to be seen, but the hype swirling around its presale indicates that both TRON and Monero holders are more than willing to explore its panda-powered promise.

While these tokens saw a surge in popularity due to their political branding, their speculative nature has led to high volatility and rapid sell-offs. As the hype fades, Lightchain AI (LCAI) has emerged as a promising alternative, offering real-world utility and long-term growth potential. With a presale raising $13.8 million and tokens priced at $0.005625, Lightchain AI is quickly becoming a preferred choice for investors seeking stability and high returns. Why Trump Coins Are Losing Steam Donald Trump's recently launched meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA, have experienced significant volatility, with $TRUMP's value surging from $6 to over $70 per coin shortly after its launch, only to plummet by more than half in subsequent days. This instability has raised concerns within the cryptocurrency community about the speculative nature of such tokens and their potential to undermine the industry's credibility. Critics argue that these coins, lacking inherent value, could be vehicles for conflicts of interest, especially given Trump's influential position. The high concentration of tokens held by Trump's affiliates has also led to fears of market manipulation and significant financial losses for regular investors. As of January 29, 2025, the market remains cautious, with many viewing these developments as detrimental to efforts aimed at legitimizing digital assets.

Moving Beyond Hype to Sustainable Growth The fall of Trump-themed meme coins proves one thing: hype can only take you so far. Enter Lightchain AI —a project built for real-world impact and long-term growth. Lightchain AI ($LCAI) isn’t just another token; it’s a game-changer. With its deflationary tokenomics model, a portion of every transaction fee and payment for AI tasks is burned, reducing the token supply permanently. This built-in scarcity could significantly boost the value of remaining tokens over time. If you’re tired of the rollercoaster ride of meme coins and looking for something with substance, Lightchain AI offers a promising path forward. With a focus on real adoption and practical utility, this AI-powered blockchain project could become one of the smartest investments of 2025. Ready to invest in the future?

The Waning Appeal of Trump Coins The recently launched Trump meme coins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA, have shown considerable volatility, with $TRUMP's price skyrocketing from $6 to above $70 per coin shortly after release, only to fall by more than 50% in the days that followed. This erratic behavior has sparked concerns in the crypto community about the speculative nature of such tokens and their potential impact on the industry's credibility. Critics suggest that these coins, lacking intrinsic value, could serve as a platform for conflicts of interest, particularly given Trump's influential role.

The XRP/RLUSD AMM pool will allow holders to participate in liquidity providing services. The RLUSD holders were unable to participate in the LP services because of a clawback feature. The XRP Ledger (XRPL) is set to vote on a new amendment that would allow users to create an Automated Market Maker (AMM) pool for the newly-released stablecoin, RLUSD. This move gives an additional use case to the real-world asset-backed stablecoin which American fintech firm Ripple debuted last year in December. According to official documents, the amendment will allow the creation of the AMM pool. This would enhance liquidity and trading efficiency within the XRP ecosystem, which includes the XRPL DEX. The benefits arise from AMMs’ ability to automate the trading process by using liquidity pools instead of traditional order books, allowing for seamless token swaps with lower slippage. The inclusion of RLUSD, a real-world asset-backed stablecoin, further strengthens XRPL’s DeFi capabilities, potentially attracting more users and institutional players.

Investors are closely watching for signs of a breakout, but the XRP price remains uncertain. Meanwhile, Cardano is facing challenges, with ADA struggling to keep up. Recent Cardano news suggests slow growth, raising concerns about its long-term position in the market. At the same time, a new contender is making headlines. DTX Exchange has raised $13 million in its presale, drawing attention from big investors. Some experts now believe this rising altcoin could overtake the ADA price in 2025. XRP Price Explodes as Ripple ETF Hype Fuels a Major Rally The XRP price remains stagnant despite Ripple’s latest regulatory advancements in the U.S. The company has secured Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) in New York and Texas, expanding its reach in key financial markets. Meanwhile, speculation around a Ripple ETF continues to grow, with investors hoping for clearer regulatory direction. Ripple’s legal standoff with the SEC remains unresolved, though partial victories have fueled optimism, and this is also a reason for fluctuations in the XRP price. At the same time, the company’s decentralized exchange (DEX) has processed over $1 billion in swaps showing growing adoption of the XRP Ledger, which could also have a chance to boost XRP price. However, uncertainty around the XRP price persists as the market reacts to shifting regulatory dynamics. A potential Ripple ETF approval could inject momentum, but for now, investors remain cautious. As XRP price struggles, investors await clarity on a Ripple ETF, which could impact market sentiment. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange is in the game with its 600% presale surge. This rising demand could position it as a strong alternative to ADA price especially as Cardano News highlights slow adoption and increasing competition in the market. ADA Price Struggles: Can It Keep Up with the Competition? The ADA price remains weak as Cardano news shows growing competition in the blockchain space. Recent Cardano news highlights PayPal’s USD stablecoin (PYUSD) joining the network through Wanchain’s bridge, aiming to improve liquidity and usability in Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem. While Cardano news headlines boost cross-chain interoperability, the ADA price has yet to see any strong reaction, raising concerns about the network’s real-world adoption. Despite ongoing development, Cardano struggles to keep pace with faster-growing projects. PYUSD integration brings new opportunities, but adoption remains slow, and ADA price continues to lag. Meanwhile, platforms like DTX Exchange are gaining traction with a good price as compared to ADA price and offering broader asset access compared to Cardano’s DeFi sector. DTX Exchange $13 Million Presale Success Is Set to Overtake ADA in 2025 DTX Exchange is building the next big thing in trading. It has already raised over $13 million in presale, proving strong demand from investors. This platform lets users trade crypto, stocks, forex, ETFs and over 120,000 currency pairs all in one place. This platform gives full control to traders with a non-custodial system that keeps assets safe and private. With 500,000+ holders, it is already one of the fastest growing projects and also a better alternative for those who are confused about negative Cardano news and hinged Ripple ETF approval. Source: DTX Exchange At its core, DTX runs on VulcanX, a high-speed Layer-1 blockchain designed for serious traders. It processes up to 200,000 transactions per second, making it faster than most competitors. Traders can also use 1000x leverage, allowing small investments to control big trades. The platform is built for quick, low-cost trading, helping users execute orders with better speed and efficiency. With DTX’s final token price set at $0.16, the launch is getting closer. As the presale moves into final stages, analysts say that the DTX Exchange could surge more compared to the XRP price and ADA price and could set to change how people trade. Final Thoughts DTX Exchange is bringing crypto and traditional markets together on one platform. As XRP price reacts to Ripple ETF speculation and ADA price struggles despite ongoing Cardano news, traders are looking for faster, more efficient exchanges. If adoption continues at this pace, DTX could become one of the most widely used trading platforms in the next market cycle.

ZachXBT discovered that the stolen funds were funneled through Gate, Binance, Kraken, OKX, HTX, HitBTC, and MEXC. In total, 8 addresses were identified as being involved in the alleged theft.

Ripple ( XRP ) rose by over 50%, while Bitcoin ( BTC ) jumped by 12%, and Ethereum ( ETH ) fell by 6%. It also did better than other large-cap coins like Polkadot, Solana, and Binance Coin. Several catalysts drove XRP’s surge in January. The Ripple USD ( RLUSD ) stablecoin flipped top stablecoins like PayPal USD and Ethena USDe in terms of volume. Its daily volume on January 30 was $62 million, higher than PYUSD’s $29 million, and USDD had $3.9 million. The XRP price also surged after Gary Gensler resigned, which ushered a new regulatory environment. The SEC, under Mark Uyeda and Paul Atkins, will be more friendly to the crypto industry. As crypto.news reported , the agency plans to pause some legal proceedings among crypto companies. Ripple would benefit since its legal issues with the agency may end this year.

As a result, JPMorgan analysts expect that such a fund would have over $8 billion in inflows this year. In contrast, Ethereum ETFs have had less than $3 billion in inflows since their launch. The XRP price rose after Ripple Labs received a money transmitter license in New York. This means that the company can now work with other large firms in the state and also offer more services. The XRP Ledger is also growing, with some ecosystem tokens like Sologenic, Crypto Trading Fund, XRP Army, and PHNIX gaining market share. Sologenic has a market cap of $174 million, while the XRPL total value locked hit a $80 million total value locked. XRP price technical analysis XRP chart | Source: crypto.news Technicals suggest that the XRP price will have a strong bullish breakout in February. The daily chart shows that the coin formed a bullish pennant pattern with a long vertical line and a symmetrical triangle pattern. It made a bullish breakout above its upper side at $2.90 on January 15. Ripple has formed another smaller bullish pennant pattern, whose two lines of the triangle are nearing their confluence. Therefore, it will likely have a strong breakout in February, with the next possible target being the psychological level at $5, which is about 65% above the current level.

Accessed via the Apollo Diversified Credit Securitize Fund (ACRED) feeder fund, the token is the first public on-chain offering for accredited investors of Apollo and also the first integration for Securitize with the Solana blockchain, as well as with Ink, a layer-2 network built by the Kraken crypto exchange . Ethereum, Aptos, Avalanche and Polygon are also initial launchpads for the tokenized fund. Apollo Diversified Credit Fund, which has more than $1.2 billion in managed assets, invests in corporate direct lending, asset-backed finance as well as performing, dislocated and structured credit, the firm said. The fund delivered an 11.7% return in 2024 compared with around 4.5% on U.S. Treasuries. Christine Moy, a partner leading digital assets, data and AI strategy at Apollo, said the fund was chosen because it has a daily subscription and daily net asset value (NAV) structure that’s well suited for seamless and efficient blockchain-based markets. “For those that are trying to build a diversified portfolio on-chain, it serves as a higher yielding complement to stablecoins, tokenized treasuries and money market funds,” Moy said in an interview. “But it’s also a diversifier to the more volatile crypto native yield products that are out there. So it can help complete the picture of the different assets you would need in an on-chain diversified portfolio.” There’s been something of a rush among traditional finance firms to tokenize so-called real world assets (RWAs), with blockchain-based versions of U.S. Treasuries being the largest and most liquid market to emerge. As of 2023, global private credit assets under management reached approximately $2.1 trillion, a fourfold increase from a decade earlier, according to Securitize. Private credit tokens are less common, but they open up a new space for on-chain assets, said Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo. “Private credit is an area that’s been exploding of late, and we have been among the pioneers in this area of tokenization having already launched a top-tier private credit fund token with Hamilton Lane,” Domingo said in an interview. “Private credit with a higher yield is a good complement to treasuries especially in a scenario with interest rates coming down.” Securitize is the tokenization partner of BlackRock and the digital transfer agent for the asset manager’s BUIDL money market fund token. For Apollo, Securitize is using its partnership with Wormhole, a developer platform that allows different blockchain networks to communicate with each other, to offer a multichain approach out of the gate. Apollo has participated in some tests of tokenized assets such as a proof of concept last year involving JPMorgan, carried out under the auspices of Project Guardian, a collaborative effort led by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). Moy, a longtime Web3 strategist who previously worked on JPMorgan’s blockchain and led projects like Intraday Repo, looked ahead to working in areas like decentralized finance (DeFi). “Tokenizing Apollo’s products is just the beginning,” Moy said. “We're excited to collaborate with leading teams in the digital assets ecosystem to design modern treasury management, automatically rebalancing investment portfolios at scale, smart contract-driven collateral management, and in the future, potentially the enablement of secondary liquidity for alternative assets.”",Finance|Exclusive|apollo global management|Tokenization|Securitize,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|APT,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-30 13:37:26

Meet the Bold Contender, Delivering 700% Gains To Early Adopters In recent months, Ethereum (ETH) has seen significant growth in terms of adoption, drawing attention from investors and analysts. Despite its recent price drop, the large-cap altcoin recorded an unprecedented jump in the number of new addresses on the network. Notably, the number of new ETH addresses has surpassed 200,000 in a single day, doubling the daily average of 2024. On the other hand, Solana ETF news has dominated headlines, with the most recent news of Cboe BZX Exchange resubmitting filing on behalf of four asset managers looking to list a spot Solana exchange-traded fund (ETF). Meanwhile, DTX Exchange (DTX) continues to gain traction in the crypto market, thanks to its hybrid protocol and a $13.20 million presale. The DTX token has increased by 700% since its launch, showing investors’ confidence. Ethereum and Volatility: An Opportunity or Risk Despite the rise in adoption, the price of Ethereum has seen volatility, but it has not discouraged interest in the network. Market participants believe the recent decline represents an opportunity to accumulate Ethereum tokens, given a potential future rally. While ETH’s price has been fluctuating, its fundamentals have remained solid. The ETH ecosystem’s constant development and usage rise across various sectors indicate a promising future. The growth in new addresses suggests that not only speculative traders are participating, but holders and users also see long-term value in the Ethereum network. The token sustained over $48.25 million in futures liquidations, with $14.55 million and $33.70 million accounting for long and short liquidations, respectively. The token has attempted to reclaim the $3,200 support level after a broader market crash that saw Ethereum touch the $3,000 level. If ETH crypto reclaims this level, it will face another hurdle at the descending trendline of the right-angled pattern. The token has to overcome this resistance to sustain an uptrend. However, if it gets rejected at the $3,200 support level, it could fall and breach the $3,000 level and find support near the $2,817 critical support level, where the bulls had held for four months―from April to July 2024. Ethereum’s RSI, Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD), and Stochastic Oscillator (Stoch) highlight neutral levels, suggesting a dominant bearish momentum. A daily candlestick close above $4,100 could invalidate the thesis. Where Next for Solana (SOL) —$150 or $400? Solana has had a downtrend since its new all-time high of $295.83 on January 19. However, the recent downturn has not deterred optimism on the altcoin. More so now that the market anticipates a spot Solana ETF approval. Notably, Cboe BZX Exchange has resubmitted filings on behalf of four asset managers exploring the listing of spot Solana ETF in the US this year. The bullish news could trigger renewed interest in the Solana token, propelling it to new highs. Meanwhile, the SOL price could set its sights on local support at $233.06. If the current selling pressures persist, it could steer the price of Solana towards the $230 level. Interestingly, its technical indicators reveal a more bearish scenario than a bullish one. If the candlestick closes with a long wick, the accumulated momentum could be enough for a support breakout, which could follow a further correction towards the $210-$220 range. Solana’s trading volume has also plunged significantly, indicating an absence of buyers’ and sellers’ energy. The token could enter a sideways trading zone around the $220 and $260 levels. A dip to $150 is another possibility. This could be the case if market conditions remain unfavorable and SOL’s adoption drops. However, it is pretty unlikely with projects coming to Solana. Market participants still see Solana crypto as a reliable option for those seeking steady gains. Why DTX Exchange Stands Out in the Crypto Market At the intersection of DeFi and TradFi, DTX Exchange is bridging gaps, combining the speed and efficiency of centralized exchanges (CEXs) with the security and decentralization of decentralized exchanges (DEXs). It offers a one-stop platform that will meet the constantly evolving traders’ needs by creating a secure, user-friendly, and flexible trading environment. Powered by the Layer-1 blockchain VulcanX, DTX Exchange will interact with traditional assets like stocks, forex, ETFs, and currency. Its standout Phoenix wallet will be available on the platform. The non-custodial asset storage will reduce restrictions that limit users from particular regions from engaging in international trade. This is particularly true for tokenized ETF trading. Additionally, its 1000x leverage will enable users to get maximum gains and trade one asset against the other with unmatched transparency. With 200,000 TPS on its testnet, DTX could challenge leading blockchains like Solana. DTX Exchange has also prioritized community engagement. Its VIP Rebate program will enable DTX users to earn steady passive gains from crypto holdings. Qualified participants in this program could earn a portion of the exchange. It also offers among the highest APYs on the market. So far, DTX is selling for only $0.16, marking a 700% leap from its initial offering of $0.02. Meanwhile, it has raised over $13.20 million as investors continue to be bullish about it. DTX Exchange Could Challenge Ethereum and Solana Blockchains As Ethereum and Solana’s blockchains continue to witness greater adoption, they face competition from DTX Exchange, which serves as a one-stop shop for all trading needs, including everyday financial instruments with cutting-edge Web3 products. Its 200,000 TPS on its testnet is quicker than the leading blockchains, gearing up for massive adoption and explosive growth.

The vote, initiated by the “votedannyryancom” campaign, comes at a time when EF is facing criticism for its leadership and governance strategies. According to the website counting the votes, as of January 30, a total of 341 wallets collectively holding 51,209 ETH participated in the vote. Their holdings were valued at approximately $164.4 million. Ethereum Foundation voting. Source – ETH website Of the cumulative votes, 99.98%, representing 331 wallets, believe Ryan should take up the Ethereum Foundation leadership role. Only 10 voters, holding ETH worth $28,500 disputed the former EF researcher’s proposed appointment.. Ethereum community push for Danny Ryan to lead Ethereum Foundation In a January 21 post on X, Quadrata co-founder and developer Fabrice Cheng told his followers he had built a site to provide the Ether family with a platform to voice their opinions about Ryan and the EF’s leadership. Many in the Ethereum community believe Danny Ryan is the leader we need. I built a site where you can vote (no gas) with ETH across major chains to support Danny as the next EF Executive Director. 📢 Please RT to spread the word! 🔗 Link & Demo below. pic.twitter.com/MkLoVNu8qR — fabda.eth (@fabdarice) January 21, 2025 Cheng pointed out that many in the community believe Ryan is the leader the foundation “needs.” Over the last nine days, votes have come in favor of the proposal, but since it is unofficial, it is highly unlikely the organization will act on it. Merely hours after the voting website went live, Ryan himself took to X, pleading with the community to “fight its battles with respect and reason.” “With or without me, the EF is evolving and for the better. You’ve been heard, but vitriol is ultimately harmful to this process,” he surmised. Miyaguchi bashed for lack of credibility Since the start of the year, naysayers have called for the removal of Aya Miyaguchi, the current executive director of the Ethereum Foundation, who has held the position since 2018. The pressure to replace Miyaguchi with Ryan has grown louder, with some supporters even resorting to online threats against her. One Ether investor and influencer on X supported the calls for Ryan to become EF’s executive director because he “led Ethereum through the most difficult transition in history,” reffering to the Ethereum Merge, where the network moved to a Proof-of-Stake consensus, in 2022. “He is respected by both developers AND community members, and he lives and breathes Ethereum,” the influencer wrote. “Aya is frankly respected by neither. I’m sure she’s a nice person, but she doesn’t have the vision or credibility to shepherd the EF through the times to come.” The public outrage from the community prompted Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin to speak up, expressing his disapproval of the attacks. “This is not how this game works,” Buterin wrote in a January 21 post , reiterating that he holds the authority to make decisions regarding EF leadership. “The person deciding the new EF leadership team is me.” Prominent industry leaders like Joseph Lubin, an Ethereum co-founder and founder of the development powerhouse ConsenSys, have also publicly issued their support for the former EF member. “We are now in a very different kind of environment in our industry. And it requires a very different kind of Ethereum Foundation,” Lubin asserted. His support for Ryan is rooted in the belief that the organization needs to evolve in order to beat other networks like Solana and Bitcoin, whose coins skyrocketed during the end-2024 market bull run, while Ether holders saw little gains.

As interest in Ethereum continues to soar, the innovative PlutoChain ($PLUTO) project could also attract whale attention thanks to bringing innovative technologies. It introduces smart contracts and decentralized applications directly onto the Bitcoin network, thanks to its new hybrid Layer-2 blockchain. This new solution could also address Bitcoin’s scalability problems, offering faster transactions and reduced fees. Let’s explore this topic in more detail below! Will ETH Break Records and Reach 16,000 in 2025? Many are forecasting a significant surge in Ethereum’s price, with some predicting it could reach $16,000 by 2025. This optimism stems from Ethereum’s historical patterns and growing institutional interest. Analysts at Cointelegraph anticipate an “impulsive breakout,” potentially driving ETH to approximately $15,937 by May 2025. This projection is based on Ethereum’s consolidation within a three-year ascending triangle pattern, suggesting a forthcoming significant price movement. Some analysts, like VirtualBacon , forecast ETH to reach $14,000 by year-end, citing factors such as increased staking and supply reduction. Others, including Standard Chartered , predict ETH could climb to $10,000 by the end of 2025 and $22,500 by 2030. However, not all forecasts are as bullish. For instance, CryptoNewsZ forecasts Ethereum could exceed its previous all-time high of $4,800, but they predict more modest figures for 2025 – like a high of $3,700 and an average of $3,300. PlutoChain ($PLUTO) Introduces Smart Contracts To Bitcoin’s Underdeveloped Network Through a New L2 Solution PlutoChain ($PLUTO) brings the first hybrid Layer-2 solution that could bring smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) directly to the Bitcoin network. This new solution offers a significantly faster block time of just 2 seconds, compared to Bitcoin’s 10-minute interval, potentially solving scalability issues while offering low transaction costs. It also features Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility which could allow developers to seamlessly migrate Ethereum-based applications to Bitcoin. This integration might merge Ethereum’s flexibility with Bitcoin’s security, potentially opening doors for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and AI-driven projects on the Bitcoin blockchain. The platform has successfully passed multiple independent audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi , ensuring a reliable environment for both developers and users. Furthermore, PlutoChain’s scalability isn’t theoretical anymore – its testnet has achieved an impressive 43,200 daily transactions, demonstrating its real-world readiness. Thanks to it having a community-driven governance model all community members have a say in all project-related decisions, creating a decentralized and user-centric ecosystem. All these features could potentially enhance Bitcoin’s functionality without compromising its core principles. It could transform it into a hub for blockchain innovation, competing with dominant networks like Solana and Ethereum. PlutoChain’s innovative approach could not only scale Bitcoin, but also potentially expand its utility beyond a mere store of value, expanding its reach into previously untapped sectors. Final Words Ethereum’s price could reach between $3,700 and $14,000 by 2025, with some forecasts suggesting a potential high of $16,000. Factors such as increased staking and supply reduction contribute to this optimism. However, new projects like PlutoChain ($PLUTO) could be worth taking a closer look at due to its transformative capabilities for Bitcoin’s network. Its hybrid Layer-2 solution offers an improved average block time of just 2 seconds and also enables smart contracts. These features could be the foundation for Bitcoin’s ecosystem and case-use expansion. ——– This article is purely informational and should not be interpreted as financial advice.

This upgrade has successfully reduced usage fees by approximately 75%, making it more affordable for users. Transactions Surge 38% Post-Upgrade Data from Flipside and Bitquery r eveals that since the upgrade, the number of transactions on Avalanche has increased by 38%, reaching an average of 354,691 transactions per day. This surge in activity indicates the impact of lower fees in encouraging more usage of the blockchain. Key Changes for a More Cost-Effective Blockchain The upgrade, which was a part of a broader set of improvements, introduced several key changes to the Avalanche network. Among them was ACP 125, a proposal that lowered the base fee for running smart contracts. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Grayscale Launches Bitcoin Miners ETF: New Investment Opportunity in Crypto Mining , This upgrade is a major step forward for Avalanche in its mission to create a scalable and efficient blockchain platform, potentially strengthening its position as a leading player in the smart contract space.

Analysts predict the price could soar to as high as $300, but its RSI nearing overbought levels signals a potential pullback. How High Can LTC Go? The cryptocurrency sector has witnessed a revival in the past 24 hours, with its global market capitalization soaring above $3.7 trillion. The resurgence occurred shortly after the latest FOMC meeting, following which the US Federal Reserve kept the interest rates unchanged at 4.25% – 4.50%. It is worth noting that, at first, the Fed’s decision triggered a market decline. In a subsequent conference, Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank was “not against innovation” with regard to cryptocurrencies. He also stated that local banking institutions are “perfectly able to serve crypto customers, as long as they understand and can manage the risks.” Some of the cryptocurrencies whose prices headed north after the press conference include Bitcoin (BTC), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), Chainlink (LINK), and many others. Meanwhile, Litcoin (LTC) has outperformed all top 20 digital assets, witnessing a 14% rise on a 24-hour scale. Currently, it trades at approximately $130, which is the highest level observed since mid-January. Perhaps the most obvious factor contributing to the double-digit rally is the US SEC’s acknowledgment of Canary Fund’s intention to launch a spot LTC exchange-traded fund (ETF). Once the agency acknowledges such a filing, it initiates a regulatory review process that can take up to 240 days. The potential approval of an LTC ETF would allow more options for investors to gain exposure to the asset and could positively affect the price in the long term. Several analysts noted LTC’s latest pump, envisioning further gains during this bull cycle. According to the X user Nebrascangooner, the asset looks “mega bullish” and might soar to around $160 sometime next month. Prior to that, they assumed that Litecoin’s potential bull run could be followed by a Bitcoin (BTC) pump. George chipped in, too. The X user assumed that LTC might mimic the impressive performance of Ripple’s XRP and skyrocket to $300. “ Bought a spot bag again and longed on margin,” the analyst added . Something for the Bears Despite the overall bullish environment and the optimistic forecasts from market observers, LTC’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) signals an incoming correction. The technical analysis tool measures the speed and change of price movements to help traders identify possible trend reversals. The RSI varies from 0 to 100, with readings above 70 suggesting that the asset is overbought and could be due for a pullback. The ratio has been gradually increasing in the past few days, currently standing just shy of the bearish mark.

Users are watching closely as PEPE rebounds from recent dips, which fuels hopes for a new all-time high. Meanwhile, PlutoChain , a Bitcoin Layer-2 solution, is introducing EVM-based smart contracts and high-speed transactions, which could redefine blockchain scalability. Pepe Coin Price Prediction – Can PEPE Reach New Highs? Pepe Coin (PEPE) has been drawing attention again, with recent whale accumulation sparking renewed interest. When whales buy in, it often suggests upcoming price movement, as their holdings influence supply and demand dynamics. If the broader meme market gains traction, PEPE could benefit from the renewed retail demand. Looking at the technical side, PEPE’s price recently bounced off key support levels, which shows signs of recovery. TradingView indicators highlight crucial resistance at $0.00001250, with momentum building toward a potential breakout. Binance analysts remain split on PEPE’s long-term trajectory, but projections suggest bullish momentum if whale activity sustains. How PlutoChain Could Expand Bitcoin’s Scalability and Cross-Chain Functionality Bitcoin has long been the gold standard, but its slow transaction speeds and lack of smart contract capabilities have limited its broader adoption beyond a store of value. PlutoChain , a cutting-edge Layer-2 solution, may aim to change that by bringing scalability, interoperability, and AI-driven applications to Bitcoin’s ecosystem. One of PlutoChain’s standout features is its ability to offer block time of just 2 seconds, a huge leap from Bitcoin’s 10-minute block time. The network handles up to 43,200 transactions per day, which makes it a viable solution for high-speed payments and DeFi applications that require real-time transactions. PlutoChain is fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine ( EVM ), which means Ethereum-based dApps, DeFi protocols, and NFT platforms can seamlessly migrate to Bitcoin’s network. This might bridge the gap between Ethereum and Bitcoin, which could allow developers to leverage Bitcoin’s security while maintaining Ethereum’s smart contract flexibility. Unlike traditional Layer-2 networks, PlutoChain might introduce AI-driven applications that could redefine how decentralized finance and automation function on Bitcoin. AI-powered tools could enable predictive analytics, automated trading strategies, and intelligent contract execution, which might expand Bitcoin’s use cases beyond simple transactions. Security is a major concern for any blockchain network, and PlutoChain has prioritized this by undergoing rigorous audits from SolidProof , QuillAudits , and Assure DeFi . These audits ensure that PlutoChain’s protocol remains secure, transparent, and resistant to exploits, which could give developers and users confidence in its infrastructure. Beyond scalability, PlutoChain provides a robust infrastructure for developers looking to build next-gen decentralized applications, interoperable DeFi solutions, and Bitcoin-native smart contracts. PlutoChain might create a more dynamic and efficient blockchain environment by combining Bitcoin’s security with Ethereum’s flexibility and AI-powered automation. With these innovations, PlutoChain could become a key component in Bitcoin’s evolution, which might open up new opportunities for developers, and users looking for a high-performance, multi-functional blockchain solution. Final Words Pepe Coin (PEPE) is gaining traction with increased whale accumulation and retail demand, which could fuel speculation about new price highs. Meanwhile, PlutoChain could reshape Bitcoin’s scalability and interoperability with its Layer-2 technology, EVM compatibility, and AI-driven applications. PlutoChain might position itself as a pivotal innovation in blockchain development by improving Bitcoin’s transaction speed and expanding its functionality. ———— Disclaimer: It’s important to note that participating in presales carries risks, including market volatility and potential project delays.

The legislation, sent by President Nayib Bukele, was ratified on January 29, just minutes after reaching the Legislative Assembly, with 55 lawmakers voting in favor and only two opposing. This reform marks a significant shift as it lifts the previous legal obligation for private businesses to accept Bitcoin as payment. Instead, Bitcoin usage by merchants will now be optional and voluntary. Elisa Rosales, a ruling party lawmaker, emphasized that the adjustment ensures Bitcoin’s continued legal tender status while promoting a practical implementation framework. Bitcoin Remains a Strategic Asset in El Salvador Despite IMF pressures to reduce exposure to cryptocurrency, El Salvador continues to strengthen its Bitcoin position . The nation recently acquired an additional 12 BTC, adding to its strategic reserves. According to official data from the country’s Bitcoin Office, El Salvador currently holds 6,049 BTC, valued at approximately $633 million. A spokesperson for the Bitcoin Office reaffirmed the government’s commitment to ongoing Bitcoin purchases, noting that the country aims to “intensify” its accumulation strategy by 2025. “We have achieved not only the greatest rebrand in history but are now a case study for a winning country strategy,” the representative stated confidently. El Salvador first made headlines in 2021 as the pioneer nation to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. While the IMF deal signals a regulatory pivot, the Bukele administration appears determined to balance international financial obligations with its pro-crypto stance. Political Intrigue and Legal Fallout Amid the economic developments in El Salvador, former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, a vocal critic of the country’s Bitcoin adoption, was sentenced to 11 years in prison on January 29. Menendez faced charges of accepting bribes in cash and gold, with FBI agents reportedly discovering $480,000 in cash and gold bars valued at around $150,000 during a search of his home. The timing of Menendez’s sentencing adds a twist to the narrative, as critics like him once argued that El Salvador’s Bitcoin policy would attract financial chaos and corruption. Yet, with the recent legislative amendments and strong profits from Bitcoin holdings, the country continues to challenge global skepticism about its bold crypto experiment.

What Panshibi Is Going Viral Among Investors Worldwide,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/why-panshibi-will-be-the-next-big-meme-coin-overtaking-pepe-in-2025-what-panshibi-is-going-viral-among-investors-worldwide/,"When meme coins were initially introduced to the crypto market, they were nothing more than a laughing stock as most traders struggled to see any real usage or applications for these tokens. But the reality is different today because you’ll find that the meme coin market capitalization has grown by about 500%. Meme coins are now highly sought-after because of their massive profit potential, and 31% of those who bought crypto tokens in 2024 invested in meme coins. Let’s say you’re interested in this aspect of the crypto market and seeking viable options to add to your wallet. Keep reading to find out exactly how Panshibi and Pepe are the best meme coins to hold over the next bull season. Here’s How Panshibi Will Be The Next Big Meme Coin to Overtake Pepe in 2025 As mentioned earlier, the meme coin industry is currently a fast-growing aspect of the crypto market, and this category of tokens is redefining what cryptocurrency means. While it differs from most trending altcoins, Panshibi is on the front lines to introduce crypto traders to a new type of utility, and there’s already plenty of traction surrounding the future of this project. According to the information on this meme coin’s whitepaper, Panshibi excels as a cryptocurrency project that combines the benefits of SocialFi and AI elements to give those who participate in this project exciting rewards. Like many other top-rated meme coins that have thrived in the coin market before now, Panshibi’s blockchain runs on a crypto token – $SHIBI – which acts as a governance tool to allow token holders to vote on key decisions, supports stake-to-earn transactions, and first-hand access to on-blockchain rewards. One of the most exciting features that separates Panshibi from other crypto tokens is the transparency of its development team. This coin’s developers have revealed clear information on what this project is about, including details about tokenomics, presale, launch, etc. It’s clear that Panshibi has a commitment to rewarding token holders. That’s why it has organized a 60-day presale to allow anyone who wants to be part of the community to purchase $SHIBI tokens at a much cheaper price. The best thing about this presale is that Panshibi has clearly stated everything that token holders should expect. For instance, this presale will only last for 60 days without the typical endless extensions which many meme coins are guilty of. The listing price has also been explicitly stated as $0.026, which will represent a 1,200% price increase from the first stage of the presale. Pepe ’s Rise to the Top May Finally Be Slowing Down 2024 may have been a torrid year for the cryptocurrency market, but Pepe was one of the few trending altcoins that managed to give an account of itself by gaining widespread attention and massive market capitalization. As of September 2024, Pepe boasted a market cap worth $3.45 billion, which was a 12.67% boost over the value it used to have. While it was impressive to watch the Pepe coin price and this token gain worldwide renown, its rapid rise to the world can be attributed to several factors. First, Pepe was listed on several popular cryptocurrency trading platforms, including Robinhood, which ensured that many traders and enthusiasts could easily access the token to fill their wallets. Pepe’s listing on several trading platforms also made it more appealing to investors. Elon Musk’s affiliation with meme coins like Pepe also made it easier for many people to trust the token and invest their money in it. Yes, Musk is not directly linked to this coin or any other meme token, but he has adopted related imagery and used similar terminology on his social media platform, resulting in surges in Pepe coin price and global interest Will Panshibi Replace Pepe As the Top Meme Coin of 2025? Pepe was the hottest meme coin of 2024, and while it has gradually lost steam, investors are turning their attention to the next big thing – Panshibi. When you consider all the features this project has, it’s clear that it’s very likely to reach or even surpass the heights set by Pepe. Join the Panshibi family and enjoy exclusive rewards today!

The price is currently strong following a solid bounce back from a two-week low. Started this week very rough, LTC lost some chunk of dollars following a little meltdown that hit the crypto space some days ago. Though this loss was traced to some key fundamentals surrounding the market lately. Interestingly, it later found support above $106 and closed yesterday strong after a short recovery. This brought the bulls back into action and as we can see, they are trying to regain control on a daily scale. A strong close above the monthly high should signal a further recovery. Meanwhile, the bears are currently in disbelief as they aim to revisit the important $100 level. Currently, they are looking for a key resistance to initiate more drops. The $131 level has posed a threat in the past hours. If the bears act upon it, we may see another drag down to the mentioned important level before picking up again. But considering the recent reduction, which came as a retest of the mid-month surge, there’s a conviction for a buy rather than a sell. And if such a setup comes into play, LTC should resume bullish at full speed. LTC’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview The latest strong bounce suggests a fresh increase in the daily timeframe. A push above the $131.5 resistance should validate a shift. The next resistance level would be $147, followed by a break to $160. A pull-back level to watch is $120. Below the holding $106 support lies the important $100 level. An extension under this level could dip the price to $92.6 and $87.

POL (ex-MATIC) Eyes Key Levels Amid Market Anticipation POL (ex-MATIC) is trading between $0.41 and $0.47. In the past week, it has declined by over 11%, and over the past month, it has decreased by more than 13%. The Relative Strength Index is at 50.73, indicating a neutral market. The Stochastic oscillator stands at 82.16, suggesting the asset may be overbought. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0022, pointing to mild bearish momentum. The price is near the 100-day simple moving average of $0.42, showing that bulls and bears are closely matched. With an anticipated altcoin season and a global crypto bull run, POL could see upward movement. The nearest resistance level is $0.51; surpassing this could lead the price to the second resistance at $0.57. This would represent increases of approximately 21% and 36% from the current price. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.39, and a drop to the second support at $0.33 would mean a decrease of about 20%. Traders are monitoring these levels as POL may be preparing for significant movement in line with broader market trends. Solana (SOL) Eyes Next Resistance After 23% Monthly Gain Solana (SOL) has been trading within a price range of $222.20 to $265.71 recently. Over the past month, SOL has seen a substantial increase of 23.51%, indicating a bullish sentiment among investors. However, the past week shows a slight decline of 6.41%, suggesting some short-term profit-taking or consolidation. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54.62, which is neutral, and the Stochastic indicator is at 81.09, pointing towards an overbought condition. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.6128, hinting at possible bearish momentum in the short term. Despite these mixed signals, Solana has potential for further growth. If the bulls regain control, the price could test the nearest resistance level at $290.97. Breaking through this level might open the path towards the second resistance at $334.48, representing a significant gain from the current price range. On the downside, if the bears take over, the price might find support at $203.95 or even at $160.44. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are close, indicating that the price is near its average, and a significant move could be on the horizon.

It is showing signs of increase following a 5% surge since yesterday. This month brought a little setback in the market as Link went through a short retracement phase after reaching a new milestone last month. Though the bulls attempted to resume pressure in the mid-month but they failed to sustain it after testing $27. Multiple rejections from that price level triggered a drop last week and the asset continued to retrace until it tested the $22 level on Monday. It reiterated actions the following day but the bulls intercepted and the bleeding stopped, marking an end in the retracement phase. Yesterday, trading volume increased and the price bounced, closing strong for the first time in a week. Today, the bulls further show commitment and are now aiming to claim more highs as volume slowly rises. A surge above last week’s high could activate another leg up, which could skyrocket the price to a new high. Meanwhile, it is important to note that there’s still room for drops should the bears step back in action. If that happens, Link must dip below the current weekly low before considering an extension. But as it appears now, the bulls are likely to gain control as volume enhances. LINK’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview Now that the landscape is gradually changing again, Link may retake the previous $27 high along with the $31 level, where it initiated drops last month. Breaking out of this level could rally us to $33 and maybe $40. The latest increase is supported by the weekly $22 low. If the price drops off this low, the market may extend bearishness to $20.7 and even $17.9.

The fund , which tracks the Indxx Bitcoin Miners Index, is designed for investors looking to gain exposure to the Bitcoin mining industry without directly investing in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin miners play a key role in the Bitcoin ( BTC ) network, using powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems that secure transactions and maintain network operations. In return, miners are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoin. The MNRS ETF invests in companies that generate most of their revenue from mining operations or related activities, such as producing mining hardware and software. As of writing, the ETF’s top ten holdings include major mining companies such as Marathon Holdings, Riot Platforms, CleanSpark, Hut 8, and Core Scientific. David LaValle, Grayscale’s Global Head of ETFs, said the fund offers “targeted exposure” to the Bitcoin mining industry and is structured to evolve with the sector. Introducing the Grayscale Bitcoin Miners ETF (ticker: $MNRS ) ⛏ $MNRS offers investors targeted, pure-play exposure to #Bitcoin Miners and the Bitcoin Mining Industry, available directly in your investment account. Learn more about $MNRS : https://t.co/kCpi8yOYF1 pic.twitter.com/6z5Kctq2Xy — Grayscale (@Grayscale) January 30, 2025 The ETF does not invest in Bitcoin itself but holds shares of companies whose performance is often linked to Bitcoin’s price. When Bitcoin’s value rises, mining companies typically see increased revenue and profits, which may benefit investors in the fund. Crypto investment alternative The launch of MNRS provides an alternative for investors seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency ecosystem without directly holding digital assets. Unlike direct Bitcoin investments, ETFs are traded on traditional stock exchanges, making them accessible through brokerage accounts. Grayscale has been expanding its crypto-related investment products, with MNRS joining its lineup of funds that offer exposure to blockchain-related industries. The firm’s approach allows investors to participate in the growing cryptocurrency market while adhering to regulatory standards for publicly traded investment funds.

Join the Feline Frenzy! $CATZILLA Is on the Rise—Claim Your Share Today! Shiba Inu Set to Roar: Potential Price Surge Looms Shiba Inu (SHIB) is showing promising signs of growth. Currently trading between $0.00001801 and $0.00002116, it’s approaching a resistance level at $0.00002324. If it breaks past this, the next challenge is $0.00002639, which could see a robust upward push. Despite a recent dip, with prices dropping over 12% in a week, long-term movement shows a 16.41% rise over 6 months. The Relative Strength Index hovering around 50.72 suggests a stable market. Stochastic at 67.12 indicates a potential bullish trend. If momentum picks up, SHIB might gain substantial ground, making it a coin to watch in the upcoming altcoin season. JasmyCoin Eyes Rebound Amid Market Volatility JasmyCoin’s price is currently sitting between $0.0246 and $0.0296. It has seen a decline recently but might be headed for a rebound. The nearest resistance level is at $0.0324. If JasmyCoin breaks this level, it could potentially climb to the next resistance at $0.0374, marking a potential rise. The nearest support level is at $0.0225, which could act as a safety net. The RSI is near 50, indicating neutral momentum, and the MACD level suggests the current downward trend might be losing steam. If the global crypto market goes bullish, JasmyCoin could see significant growth, potentially recovering its losses from the past month. Pepe (PEPE) Set for Potential Rally Amid Fluctuating Prices Pepe (PEPE) shows a mix of challenges and opportunities. The price swings between $0.00001278 and $0.00001638. A crucial resistance lies at $0.00001877, and strong support is just below the $0.00001155 mark. Despite a month-long downtrend of nearly 30%, there’s room for optimism with a medium-term growth of almost 20%. The coin’s Relative Strength Index stands at 53.42, indicating a balanced scenario. Stochastic points to a potential upswing, currently at 78.80. Recent movements suggest a bullish climb might be on the horizon. If PEPE can push past the nearest resistance levels, it could potentially break into the $0.00002237 zone for further gains. Onyxcoin Surges: Is a Skyrocketing Altcoin Season on the Horizon? Onyxcoin is on a roll. Its price jumped over 182% this week and shows impressive gains of more than 2270% in the last six months. Currently, it’s trading between $0.0137 and $0.0531. It’s not slowing down anytime soon. With the nearest resistance at $0.0706, if it breaks through, expect a further rise. The indicators support the bullish trend; RSI stands at 61.26, and the MACD is positive. These signals suggest more upward movement. Hold tight, Onyxcoin could hit the second resistance at $0.1100. That’s a potential increase of over twice its recent high. Could this altcoin lead the next big rally? Stay tuned. Conclusion While coins like FLR, JASMY, PEPE, and XCN show some promise, their short-term potential appears limited. Catzilla emerges as the leading meme coin hero, aiming to bring financial freedom to all. With a remarkable 700% ROI potential during its presale, triple utility features, and a mission to unite enthusiasts against crypto villains, Catzilla stands ready to reclaim the meme coin realm.

Elastos, a decentralized infrastructure provider, aims to scale its Bitcoin DeFi protocol BeL2 as a utility layer for the world's original blockchain. The firm has raised $20 million from private investment company Rollman Management, with which it plans to expand its merge-mined ELA token as a Bitcoin reserve asset, Elastos told CoinDesk in an email on Thursday. Merge mining is the process of mining two or more cryptocurrencies simultaneously. BeL2 is built to allow bitcoin holders to collateralize BTC in their wallets and access Ethereum smart contract services, such as minting stablecoins and peer-to-peer borrowing. Elastos is one of a large number of projects looking to capitalize on the roughly $2 trillion stored in bitcoin by building DeFi services that BTC's deep wells can fund. DeFi requires liquidity and security, both of which Bitcoin can provide with a stronger track record than any other blockchain. However, historically, the network has lacked the utility for DeFi projects to be able to harness it, which is what Elastos and others are aiming to address .

After experiencing a surge in December, altcoins entered a correction, leaving their next move uncertain. However, Captain Faibik suggests that the recent pullback was merely a “trailer” for the main event, with February potentially marking the start of the next rally. Bull Pennant Signals Altcoin Season Boom In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Captain Faibik suggested that the altcoin season may be well on its way, as market indicators like a recently formed Bull Pennant show positive signals that support this prediction. The analyst revealed that in early December 2024, the crypto market had experienced a significant uptrend before entering a deep correction phase. Related Reading: Altcoin Season Enters 140-Day Golden Window, What Does Bitcoin Dominance Have To Do With It? Captain Faibik said this decline was necessary as it allowed the market to cool off after significant gains. Usually, when a cryptocurrency experiences strong growth and a subsequent price drop, it tends to flush out weak hands in the market and reset overheated indicators. In the case of the crypto market, the pullback is seen as a healthy market reset that could set the stage for an even stronger uptrend. Moving on, the crypto analyst noted that the market’s correction is almost over, paving the way for the next bullish wave. He shared a chart representing the total crypto market capitalization excluding Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) on a 1-day time frame. Currently, the crypto market’s price action is forming a Bull Pennant characterized by converging trendlines. A breakout from this bull pattern is anticipated, potentially leading to a $1.4 trillion market capitalization target for the broader crypto market. The analyst has indicated that February could be a bullish month for altcoins if the Bull Pennant pattern breaks upwards. He warns investors to buy and hold their bags while waiting for this supposedly explosive altcoin season. Historically, the altcoin season has seen cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin surge dramatically as investors’ interest and demand from BTC to other alternative coins. Ethereum typically leads this trend, as its growth often sparks rallies across the altcoin market. However, with ETH underperforming against all expectations, the possibility of a full-fledged altcoin season remains uncertain. February To KickStart AltSeason Sharing a similar sentiment with the timeline of Captain Faibik’s prediction for the altcoin season, many analysts have speculated that this bullish trend is set to occur in February. Specifically, Crypto Rover, a prominent crypto analyst on X, announced that the altcoin season will begin in the next two days. Related Reading: Is Altcoin Season Here Already? VanEck Answers As Bitcoin Price Struggles Below $100,000 The analyst shared a chart highlighting Ethereum’s historical monthly returns from 2016 to 2024. The column for February shows that ETH has performed massively during this time almost every year, with 2017 recording its most significant return of 48.09%. Based on this analysis, Crypto Rover suggests that February could signal a bullish period for altcoins, triggering the start of the highly anticipated altcoin season.

With the growing demand for its innovative AI features, these whales anticipate an astonishing 30,000% ROI by March. This article will explore why you should consider joining these whales and investing in this emerging token. Why Dogecoin Whales Are Eyeing RCO Finance’s AI Revolution As Dogecoin whales recognize the potential for high returns with RCO Finance, excitement continues to mount. This trend reflects a broader wave of innovation within the crypto space, with platforms like RCO Finance spearheading a new era of investment opportunities. Fueling this significant interest is the growing adoption of its intelligent robo-advisor, a groundbreaking tool that provides users with real-time market insights and tailored investment advice. This sophisticated technology simplifies trading for newcomers and enables seasoned investors to make more informed decisions, improving their trading efficiency and profitability. Imagine getting an alert to exit a token like LUNA before its notorious crash—saving your portfolio from significant losses! This foresight could have been a lifesaver for many traders caught off guard. In a market known for its wild swings, the robo-advisor is set to become an invaluable ally, helping investors navigate volatility, secure profits, and sidestep any potential downturns. Another feature that mainly attracts whales is RCO Finance’s approach to tokenizing tangible assets, such as real estate and commodities, which makes traditionally illiquid markets more accessible. This strategic move broadens investment horizons and enhances liquidity and flexibility within the ecosystem. Furthermore, RCO Finance prioritizes user privacy by eliminating the need for KYC verification—a significant concern for many in the crypto space. The DeFi trading platform’s smart contracts have been rigorously audited by the reputable SolidProof team, guaranteeing secure and trustworthy operations. Ready to join these Dogecoin whales? RCO Finance has just launched its beta platform, featuring cutting-edge AI trading tools and automated analytical systems designed to elevate your trading experience. And the best part? More enhancements are on the horizon! Dogecoin Faces Potential Lower Support Levels Dogecoin is experiencing a sharp decline, dropping over 10.7% over the past week following an initial price spike. The technical analysis shows that Dogecoin faced strong resistance around $0.34, failing to maintain momentum and triggering a sell-off. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) likely signaled overbought conditions, leading traders to take profits. Additionally, Dogecoin’s volume indicates that selling pressure outweighs buying interest, reinforcing the downward trend. Another key factor in Dogecoin’s decline is market sentiment. News of Ramaswamy’s departure created uncertainty, prompting investors to move away from riskier assets like Dogecoin. With a bearish trend forming, Dogecoin could test lower support levels if sentiment doesn’t improve. Traders should watch for stabilization before considering new positions. RCO Finance: The 30,000% Crypto Jackpot You Can’t Afford to Miss! Excitement among Dogecoin whales is reaching new heights as RCO Finance nears the final stages of its token presale. Many Dogecoin investors are getting involved daily, leading experts to believe that the presale may conclude much sooner than anticipated. Currently, the RCOF price is $0.10 , and investors can receive a 40% bonus using the code RCOF50. Experts anticipate that once RCO Finance starts trading on exchanges, the token price could surge to $0.60, potentially offering up to 300% returns. Analysts predict that the official launch of RCOF will trigger a significant price increase, driven by rising demand for AI technologies and the unique advantages of RCO Finance. Early investors could see their returns skyrocket by 30,000% sooner than expected. Don’t miss out on this opportunity—secure your presale tokens today!

Table of Contents Cardano readies itself for a possible breakout Wedge descending reversal Yeti Ouro: Where meme coin and AAA Grade P2E collide Yeti Go: A new player in the mobile gaming industry Tokenomics and presale growth Conclusion Cardano (ADA) continues to be of focus as the network transitions into decentralized governance. Simultaneously, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) is also making strides by attracting gamers and investors alike with its 20% bonus on tokens bought until January 31 to mark the onset of the Chinese New Year. This marketing strategy could attract investors who are seeking projects with a balanced mix of meme coins and real use cases, especially in the greatly emerging gaming sector. Cardano readies itself for a possible breakout When Cardano price action crosses a certain threshold, it evokes a sequential buy signal on the daily chart. This indicates that selling pressure has likely reached its limit. Analysts suggest that if ADA is able to break above the 0.94 CTL resistance band, ADA price could target $1.00 on Coinmarketcap. ADA could face a slight hurdle at 0.05 CTL. Wedge descending reversal On the other side of the coin, ADA has been traversing through a descending wedge which is more often than not, viewed as a bullish reversal pattern. These do provide some other certainty when viewed with over 160% trading volume spiking in some clusters. If the macroeconomic sentiment remains positive, these indicators strengthen the chances of a parabolic move. Interest rates do matter in ADA’s case, but if Bitcoin recovers from its current standing or at least remains stable, it could motivate ADA upside momentum more aggressively. Cardano’s anticipated new Plomin hard fork, alongside pre-established Lace wallet features, provides confidence to investors. There are a plethora of new reasons why ADA will receive stronger inflows. Additional speculation suggests that institutions that are interested in a sturdy Layer-1 alternative will be appeased by Cardano’s methodology of Research and Development.

YETIO implements a 5% burn policy and sets its supply limit at one billion tokens, targeting long-term value instead of hype a couple of months prior to the launch. What sets it apart is the ability to base these tokenomics around a high-end P2E game called Yeti Go. The presale has also gone through a thorough audit by SolidProof, a reputable company, further strengthening investors’ confidence. This makes Yeti Ouro more credible providing investors a peace of mind. Yeti Go: A new player in the mobile gaming industry Yeti Go uses a player vs player racing format with the integrated audio systems of Spatial Audio and Dolby Atmos, and is built on the Unreal Engine 5. It’s expected that casual and hardcore gamers alike would find it easy to immerse themselves in the game. This goes hand in hand with the relevant market research, as Mordor Intelligence predicts that mobile gaming will reach $110.9 billion in 2025 and $181.9 billion by 2030. Some analysts, however, suggest that the sector might already be experiencing peak growth. Yeti Ouro’s “meme” coin culture, combined with mobile gaming development, is an opportunistic strategy that enables them to capture significant market shares before the competition becomes more intense. Here is a glimpse into the level 1 map of the game: Please note that this video is from Yeti Ouro, currently in development. It does not represent the final product. Tokenomics and presale growth In the presale of YETIO tokens, over 151,000,000 tokens have already been purchased by users and in stage 2 at the price of $0.017. Seeing such development so fast indicates strong investor confidence and growing demand. Yeti Ouro will likely become a significant participant in the crypto market as it grows its community and gains leadership in the play-to-earn market. Investors are also getting an additional 20% bonus YETIO tokens on the occasion of Chinese New Year, until January 31, 2025. This initiative honors its investors for participation, creating a buzz in the crypto market. Conclusion Yeti Ouro vividly stands out as it seeks to go beyond the traditional theory of life cycles of meme coins by providing a new experience through the mobile play-to-earn gaming market. Analysts predict Yeti Ouro can provide one of the highest ROIs in the crypto market, with its fast popularity among investors in the crypto world, as well as its utility in the GameFi market.

The Rich Dad Poor Dad author tells 3.5 million subscribers of his YouTube channel that since 1964, he has been investing in silver but is now trading in silver and gold for Bitcoin. According to Kiyosaki, Bitcoin has more upside potential relative to the two precious metals. “I’m switching as fast as I can out of gold and silver into Bitcoin. Because I think Bitcoin, in 2025, it will probably go to $250,000 a coin.” Bitcoin is trading at $102,011 at time of writing. The Rich Dad Poor Dad author says that the massive debt the US holds, currently approximately $36.2 trillion, is a bullish catalyst for Bitcoin. “The reason Bitcoin is doing so well is because of my generation or the generation before. America is now the biggest debtor nation in history. They’re printing $1 trillion every 90 days. And as much as I like President Trump, who is a friend of mine, they don’t talk about it. They don’t talk about how they’re going to handle that debt… …so that’s why for years I have saved silver and gold. But now I’m taking all my silver and gold and converting to Bitcoin.” Kiyosaki further says, “This is the biggest change in world history – the shift from fake money to crypto, the digital money.

After experiencing a sharp 25% decline from its all-time high (ATH) in less than two weeks, SOL tested a crucial demand level and is now making an attempt to recover lost ground. Related Reading: Dogecoin Is Setting For A Massive Leg Higher – Analyst Sees Bullish Consolidation Above Key Level Investors remain divided on whether Solana has bottomed or if another pullback is on the horizon. However, early signs suggest buyers are stepping in, defending key technical levels. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, noting that Solana has successfully retested the 25-day EMA and RSI midlevel, both of which have historically acted as strong support during bullish trends. Following this retest, SOL bounced straight into key resistance, signaling a potential reversal if bulls maintain momentum. For Solana to confirm its recovery, it must break above resistance and sustain its move higher. If successful, SOL could resume its bullish trend, potentially reclaiming recent highs. However, failure to break key levels could lead to further consolidation or even another leg down. The coming days will be crucial in determining Solana’s next major move. Solana Surges 8% As Market Reacts To Fed Meeting Solana has bounced back strongly, surging 8% from local lows on Wednesday as the entire market reacted positively to the Federal Reserve meeting. Investors and analysts are now shifting their focus to a bullish outlook, anticipating a strong performance for crypto throughout the year. With sentiment improving, SOL is once again positioning itself as a market leader, aiming to reclaim key price levels and push toward new highs. Top analyst Jelle shared a technical analysis on X, highlighting Solana’s recent retest of the 25-day EMA and RSI midlevel, both of which have historically acted as crucial support zones. After confirming these levels, SOL bounced straight into key resistance, signaling a potential breakout if momentum continues. Jelle emphasized that for Solana to “look great again,” it must reclaim the $240 level. However, he also cautioned that “resistance is resistance” until a clear breakout occurs. Related Reading: Dogecoin Whales Accumulate 450 Million DOGE During Recent Price Dip – Time For A Breakout? As the broader market tries to push higher, Solana is leading the way with strong technical formations and renewed bullish momentum. If bulls successfully push past resistance, SOL could retest its all-time highs and enter price discovery once again. The coming days will be pivotal in determining whether Solana confirms its next major uptrend. Solana Price Holds Strong at $240 Solana (SOL) is currently trading at $240 after successfully testing the $220 level as support. The price appears ready to bounce, but key resistance levels must be reclaimed to confirm a short-term trend reversal. For bulls to maintain momentum, SOL must break above $240 and $260, two critical resistance zones that have capped upward movement in recent days. If Solana clears these levels with strength, a surge above all-time highs (ATH) will be imminent, setting the stage for price discovery. On the bearish side, losing the $220 mark would signal weakness, potentially leading to further downside and deeper consolidation. The broader market remains volatile, and SOL must hold above key support levels to sustain its bullish trajectory. Related Reading: Bitcoin Finally Turns $100K Into Support – Ready To Rally Higher? For now, Solana remains well-positioned to push higher, but investors will be watching closely to see if it can reclaim resistance and confirm a breakout.

Within this sphere, memecoins have carved out a unique niche due to their knack for grabbing attention and sparking viral trends. DOGWIFHAT, a well-loved memecoin, is on the verge of reaching the $5 milestone. Simultaneously, PEPETO , a fresh competitor in the memecoin arena, has surpassed $4 million in its presale phase. Although both are pushing boundaries, they embark on distinct paths with different methodologies. PEPETO: The Emerging Memecoin Star As DOGWIFHAT continues to hold its market position, PEPETO is stealing the spotlight as a promising newcomer in the memecoin realm. This frog-themed token is capturing significant interest because of its groundbreaking approach and impressive presale achievements, having crossed the $4 million threshold. Such progress underscores its potential as a top crypto investment, buoyed by strong investor trust and a bright outlook.

Every target has been met, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 The rise of PEPETO can be attributed to several key elements. Firstly, it has successfully cultivated a vibrant and participatory community through social media initiatives, viral campaigns, and exclusive content tailored for token owners. This strong community foundation has been instrumental in the token's rapid expansion. Secondly, the frog motif, a popular meme culture element, strikes a chord with crypto fans, solidifying PEPETO's identity amid the sea of memecoins. Ultimately, #PEPETO blends humor with practical value, unlike many memecoins that solely rely on hype. Its future plans include launching a decentralized exchange and offering staking rewards, adding substantial value. DOGWIFHAT's Rise Toward $5 DOGWIFHAT made its debut during the memecoin boom, riding the wave of community enthusiasm and the widespread appeal of decentralized currencies. Like other memecoins that gained fame through witty branding and active communities, DOGWIFHAT has faced challenges in sustaining its momentum. Nevertheless, it is regaining traction and is poised for a strong resurgence as it closes in on the $5 target. Several factors could propel DOGWIFHAT to the $5 threshold, such as a shift in market sentiment. As major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum rebound, retail investors' renewed interest positively affects memecoins like DOGWIFHAT. Furthermore, with a devoted community backing it, reaching the $5 mark seems within reach. Two Distinct Routes While DOGWIFHAT strives to regain its past success by reaching the $5 milestone, # PEPETO is carving out a reputation as the premier meme coin to invest in. Looking ahead, PEPETO is seen as the next #PEPE, but with greater promise, offering the potential for significant returns, early investor benefits, and strong utility. #PEPETO stands out as one of the top crypto investments for 2025, yet it remains vital to invest only what you're willing to lose.

Its roadmap includes plans for a decentralized exchange and staking rewards, giving it more value. DOGWIFHAT's Journey to $5 DOGWIFHAT emerged during the memecoin era and blew up, leveraging community enthusiasm and the broader popularity of decentralized tokens.

However, DOGWIFHAT is gaining momentum again and is set on making a strong comeback as it nears the $5 milestone.

Musk Buys Solana (MUSKSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Buys Solana by entering its contract address (CA) – HZgXdFhQK1KTn8wM6hfRPtyGuKskETTzWM31qAdXJVRV – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSOL.

This pattern is typical in bull markets, where assets go through a rapid period of growth, followed by accumulation phases before their next move upward, and 2025 bull run is not expected to be any different. Investors continue to search for top crypto presales and launches that can offer the highest returns, as they allow for early entry into promising projects before they hit the market. In this article, we’ll explore Bitcoin’s current trend, the impact of Trump’s return on the crypto space, why investors are focusing on next cryptocurrency launches and one of the most talked-about presales currently. Table of Contents Bitcoin’s Sideways Movement: A Healthy Accumulation Phase Trump’s Potential Return and Its Crypto Impact Why Investors Seek Promising Cryptos Understanding Presales: The Earliest Entry into a Project The Rise of Memes: Top Crypto Presale Summary Bitcoin’s Sideways Movement: A Healthy Accumulation Phase After a remarkable 50% growth in November, Bitcoin has been trading within a tight range of $92K to $107K over the past month. This sideways movement is not a sign of weakness but rather a natural phase in a bull market cycle. Historically, Bitcoin price does not go up in a straight line. Instead, the market moves through three key phases: Pump Phase – A strong rally where Bitcoin experiences rapid price appreciation. Accumulation Phase – A period of sideways movement where investors consolidate positions and the market prepares for the next move. Early sellers are shaken out. Continuation Phase – A breakout to new highs, fueled by fresh capital entering the market. Right now, Bitcoin is in accumulation mode, setting the stage for its next leg higher. This phase provides a crucial window for investors to position themselves in promising altcoins and top crypto presale projects. Trump’s Return and Its Crypto Impact The 2025 U.S. Presidential election is a major focal point for the crypto industry. Many investors anticipated Donald Trump’s return to the White House, calling him the Crypto President, given his pro-crypto stance . Unlike the previous administration, which has been lukewarm or outright hostile toward digital assets, Trump has signaled a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. A pro-crypto stance from a U.S. President could: Open doors for institutional adoption Foster clearer regulatory frameworks Drive greater mainstream acceptance of digital assets With this political shift on the horizon, the search for the best cheap cryptos to buy now has never been higher, including upcoming projects with high growth potential. Why Investors Seek Promising Cryptos During a bull market, smart investors look for early-stage projects that have the potential to skyrocket. While established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum offer stability, new cryptocurrency launches provide the biggest opportunities for exponential gains. Investors look for: Low market cap projects – These offer higher upside potential compared to already-established assets. Unique use cases – Cryptos with strong narratives often gain rapid traction. Early entry points – Getting in at the presale stage maximizes profit potential. This is where crypto presales come into play. Understanding Presales: The Earliest Entry into a Project A crypto presale allows early investors to buy tokens at a discount before they are listed on public exchanges. These presales often come in stages, with the price increasing as more tokens are sold. Why Do Investors Favor Presales? Discounted Entry – Prices in presales are significantly lower than post-launch prices. High Growth Potential – Many projects that perform well post-launch see 10x, 50x, or even 100x gains. Strategic Positioning – Early investors benefit from demand surges when a token gets listed on major exchanges. Finding the top crypto presale opportunities requires research, but one standout project currently attracting attention is The Rise of Memes($RISE). The Rise of Memes: Top Crypto Presale In 2025 Among the new wave of meme coins, The Rise of Memes ($RISE) is one of the most promising crypto projects currently in presale. Unlike traditional meme coins, RISE integrates a P2E game, unique in-game economy, faction-based competition, and strong community engagement, making it more than just another speculative asset. What Makes The Rise of Memes Stand Out? Online Gameplay – Players align with different factions and battle against other players in real-time, adding a competitive and engaging element to the ecosystem. Balanced Tokenomics – The project ensures sustainable growth with structured presale stages and liquidity allocation. Meme Culture & Marketability – Meme coins have a history of explosive growth, and RISE is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend bringing utility to memes. Currently, The Rise of Memes presale is attracting investors looking to secure early-stage exposure before the next major leg up in the market. Summary Bitcoin’s sideways movement between $92K and $107K is a healthy accumulation phase before its next breakout. Meanwhile, investors are looking for the next cryptocurrency launches that could deliver massive returns during the upcoming bull run. Crypto presales offer one of the most lucrative opportunities, allowing investors to get in at the earliest possible stage. The Rise of Memes is currently one of the most talked-about crypto presale projects, combining the power of meme culture with strong in-game mechanics and strategic tokenomics.

This pattern is common in bullish markets, where rapid growth is often succeeded by accumulation phases before the next surge, and the 2025 bull run is anticipated to follow a similar trajectory. Investors are on the lookout for top crypto presales and new launches that promise substantial returns, as these provide an opportunity to invest early in promising projects before they become publicly available. In this article, we will delve into Bitcoin's current movement, the potential impact of Trump's return on the crypto landscape, reasons why investors are focusing on upcoming cryptocurrency launches, and one of the most buzzworthy presales at the moment.

This stagnant movement is not an indication of weakness but rather a typical phase in a bullish market cycle. Historically, Bitcoin's price does not increase in a linear fashion. Instead, the market progresses through three distinct phases: Pump Phase – A significant rally where Bitcoin quickly gains value. Accumulation Phase – A period of lateral movement where investors consolidate their assets, preparing the market for the next move. Early sellers are weeded out. Continuation Phase – A breakout to new peaks, driven by the influx of new capital into the market. Currently, Bitcoin is in the accumulation phase, setting the stage for its next upward movement.

The miner is part of a new drive to use simple equipment to bring back retail BTC block production. A Bitcoin block at height 881423 was solved by a solo miner, who took the entire 3.125 BTC reward. Despite the near-record hashrate and competition, mining remains a game of luck, and the block was discovered with a small fraction of the total hashrate. The discovery of a solo block usually happens a few times a year and is highly improbable but not impossible. BTC is mined at more than 775 TH/s, while the miner did not exceed 992 ph/s and mined at a much lower rate. The block, valued at $326,301, was discovered with specially created, consumer-facing equipment mining at a low baseline rate. The block was also discovered at peak difficulty conditions after a year of constantly increasing the complexity of the Bitcoin puzzle. Lucky block is the second one coming from FutureBit equipment Solo mining can be done with any equipment, including a series of rigs. This time, the miner used FutureBit’s mining setup, which aims to bring back mining to retail users, relying on a bit of luck to discover a block. The recently discovered block is actually the second for a FutureBit user. In October 2024, a FutureBit user solved block 867760 , again with a 3.125 BTC reward. Solving two blocks through FutureBit usage is an achievement that may raise exposure for the project. The second block, which was solved this January, was also discovered accidentally during a FutureBit publicity event. FutureBit used the event to showcase its equipment and hashrate, pointing hashing power with a self-hosted Apollo node. We have reached maximum dynamic hashpower… 1 EH/s being directed to a single Apollo Full Node! Wild🤯 pic.twitter.com/dv3oclaPJa — FutureBit (@FutureBit) January 29, 2025 The block was thus discovered during the fundraiser event of the 256 Foundation , a Bitcoin education and mining initiative. The event also meant that the block actually required multiple FutureBit devices to achieve the maximum hashing power. At the same time, discovering a block with such a low hashrate was an astronomically rare event. Essentially, owners of FutureBit equipment ran their own Apollo node, then worked as a mini-pool to point peak hashrate. With a bit of luck, the wallet connected to the node grabbed the reward. FutureBit did not give more details on who will end up with the prize. Estimates of the mining event during the fundraiser show that there were 296 participants with coordinated mining equipment, though only a single node took the reward. FutureBit wants to move away from large pools The ‘Made in USA’ mining most often refers to the top US-based pools, especially Foundry. Pool competition is global, but large-scale miners are usually regional. US-based mining leaders include MARA Holdings, Canaan Minind, and other publicly traded companies. FutureBit aims to bring a form of solo mining that offers a mix of equipment and node operation tools and a return to solo mining. FutureBit does not limit its hashrate but aims to solve the BTC block solo without adding that hashrate to a larger pool. Solo mining operations can also happen with a hashrate from large mining centers. The disadvantage of solo mining is the rarity of discovering a block. The main advantage is that the block reward is not shared with all pool participants. FutureBit offers node equipment that can connect to extremely high hashrate and is compatible with big data centers or even pools. Apollo nodes can also handle minimal, retail-sized hashrate from one or multiple machines. FutureBit’s equipment is a multi-chip ASIC, capable of producing around 3 TH/s. This amount of hashing power is insufficient to solve a node with any realistic probability, but has the advantage of running a full archival Bitcoin node. The equipment moves away from the dominance of large mining centers, and may be used to sign and verify personal transactions faster. Running a node is also one of the key components of a more widely decentralized Bitcoin network, which relies on more diversified hardware. Apollo retails for under $700, allowing retail miners to run a node or run the chance of solving a block with a relatively smaller investment.

Among these, Litecoin stands out in the altcoin sector, recording significant double-digit gains in just a few hours. This surge has impacted several on-chain metrics, suggesting that Litecoin’s price is currently overvalued. This could lead to strong selling pressure if LTC price struggles in breaking through resistance levels. Litecoin’s MVRV Declines Despite Price Surge Litecoin faced increased buying demand following rumors of a Litecoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF). On Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market, crypto bettors have placed an 87% chance that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve a Litecoin-based exchange-traded fund (ETF) this year. The hopes among investors increased after the SEC began a public comment period for the proposed Canary Litecoin ETF. The public has 21 days from the announcement to submit feedback, which will help the SEC decide whether to approve the ETF. Also read: Why Litecoin Price is Up Today: Key Factors Driving Its 14% Surge After the comment period, the SEC has 45 days to make a decision, which can be extended to 90 days if needed, to approve, deny, or further review the ETF. Due to this news, there’s an increased buying pressure in the LTC price chart. Data from IntoTheBlock indicates that the MVRV ratio for Litecoin is falling, even though the price of LTC is rising. Currently, the ratio is at 1.23, suggesting that the last realized value is nearing LTC’s market value. A declining MVRV ratio amidst a price surge might suggest that although prices are increasing, the value being realized by holders does not support this price increase, indicating potential overvaluation. Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, highlighted that this is the first altcoin ETF to get this far, showing significant progress in the approval process. However, it’s still unclear if the SEC will speed up its decision or use the entire 240-day review period. What’s Next for LTC Price? Litecoin price has been facing increasing buying demand as buyers pushed the price from the low of $110 to a recent high of $134. Currently, buyers are holding the price above 23.6% Fib level to stabilize the momentum within a buying zone. As of writing, LTC price trades at $131.6, surging over 17.1% in the last 24 hours. The rising 20-day EMA at $119 and an RSI over 69 suggest that buyers currently have the advantage. If LTC breaks and closes above the downtrend line, it could set off a rally towards $150, and possibly extend to $165. On the other hand, if the price sharply reverses from the downtrend line, it means that sellers are still influential at higher prices. This could lead them to try pushing the LTC/USDT pair back down towards the 50-day SMA at $120.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,LTC|TRADING|MARKET|REGULATION|ALTCOIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-30 15:39:44

The ongoing 1Fuel presale has raised over $1.6 million in just days, and analysts are tipping it to surge by 500% before its public launch. This has attracted top Elon’s DOGE holders who are moving away from Dogecoin and flocking to 1Fuel. Elon’s DOGE struggles despite the Trump effect myth Dogecoin ( DOGE) is among the crypto assets currently performing below expectations. Key market stakeholders believed Dogecoin (DOGE) would pump due to Trump's pro-crypto stance and Elon's association with the government. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) has continued to battle downward pressure even after the Trump administration kick-started. Elon's influence on Dogecoin seems to be waning, and community support is no longer enough to spur a positive DOGE price movement. The meme coin's developers now have todig deeper for innovation in the Dogecoin ecosystem to sway the sentiment around DOGE in the bullish direction. In other news, Dogecoin (DOGE) has dropped by 15% in the last seven days and trades slightly above its $0.30 critical support level. However, Dogecoin (DOGE) needs stronger buy action to surge beyond the resistance around $0.35 and attempt the $0.40 price zone. Analysts say this could happen in the coming month, as the Bitwise Dogecoin ETF application could improve DOGE interest amongst investors again. 1Fuel's innovative features attract top market players The budding 1Fuel is billed for high adoption from crypto traders and investors alike. Analysts highlight that 1Fuel will not only provide a better trading experience to users, but it will also yield good returns for token holders. The crypto solution aims to address major concerns in DeFi, increasing its adoption potential. 1Fuel’s one-click technology that will facilitate seamless cross-chain asset swaps. This feature will eliminate the need for multiple wallets to transact across different blockchains. The platform will also have a cold storage feature for better asset management and monitoring. Furthermore, it will feature military-grade mixer technology to provide users with complete anonymity. 1Fuel has a real-world application. Users can make everyday purchases in crypto, leveraging the virtual and physical 1Fuel debit and credit cards. Beyond this, 1Fuel ecosystem participants can explore numerous passive income opportunities through liquidity provision or staking to earn up to 30% APR. The incredible features and utilities 1Fuel boasts make it a potential top token. This is why analysts see it as one of the best buys in 2025. 1Fuel is currently valued at $0.017 in presale, a low entry price that will yield high-margin profit in the long run. Early investors have copped 70% gains with more to come as prices soar. The constantly increasing presale price is a signal to act fast to enjoy maximum profit from 1Fuel . 1Fuel has raised over $1.6 million in ICO funding and sold over 164 million OFT tokens. With projections that OFT will surge by a further 500% before the presale concludes, now is the best time to join before prices explode. Join the presale now and be a part of the revolutionary project billed to transform DeFi.

In a new blog post , Cronje detailed a years-long struggle with the regulator that ultimately forced him to step away from public engagement with decentralized finance . Cronje, best known for launching Yearn Finance in 2020, said he deliberately avoided raising funds or selling tokens to steer clear of regulatory scrutiny. However, in 2021, he received his first inquiry from the Securities and Exchange Commission requesting details about Yearn Finance’s investors and profit distribution. Despite not being a United States citizen and never conducting business in the country, he complied with the request, gathering extensive information over several weeks. The SEC continued its investigation, sending additional letters that Cronje described as increasingly aggressive. Over time, the focus shifted from an alleged securities violation to questioning whether Yearn Finance’s vaults qualified as investment vehicles. These inquiries, he said, consumed his time and resources, forcing him to halt development work. “After two years of needing to deal with this every month, and endless sleepless nights and stress,” Cronje wrote that he chose to step away. He emphasized that his departure was not due to dissatisfaction with DeFi but rather the toll of constant regulatory scrutiny.

He now says he is close to launching new DeFi initiatives. He also noted that recent shifts in the SEC’s leadership made him feel comfortable sharing his experience, as previous investigators warned him against speaking out. “Given the new direction of the SEC, I finally figured I can actually write about this, as previously I was strongly advised by those same investigators to not mention the investigation or it could escalate things,” Cronje wrote.

She emphasized that reserves must be liquid and free from concerns related to illicit activities. “There is a view around the table of the Governing Council and most likely the General Council as well that reserves have to be liquid, that reserves have to be secure, that they have to be safe, that they should not be plagued by the suspicion of money laundering or other criminal activities.

Analysts Weigh In,https://cryptopotato.com/is-ripple-xrp-poised-for-a-massive-breakout-rally-analysts-weigh-in/,"TL:DR; The third-largest cryptocurrency has been trading within this high range for the first time in its history, which some analysts believe is an indicator of a future price rally. As usual, many industry commentators continue to be bullish on the asset, outlining predictions of up to $14. XRP to Break Out Soon? XRP went on a roll after the US elections as its price skyrocketed from under $0.6 in early November to just shy of its 2018 all-time high (according to CoinGecko) of $3.4 in mid-January. It surpassed numerous alternative coins in the process, becoming the third-largest digital asset with a market cap of $180 billion at press time as its price has retraced slightly to $3.13. What’s particularly compelling about its price movements is the fact that it has remained predominantly above $2 ever since it broke above that level on December 1. Popular XRP commentator JackTheRippler outlined this milestone, indicating that the asset has “never been so long in the $2-$3 range in its entire history.” As such, they predicted an upcoming major breakout should this consolidation end soon.

XRP is currently preparing for a major breakout. pic.twitter.com/e5NAOPJl25 — JackTheRippler ©️ (@RippleXrpie) January 30, 2025 Fellow analyst Altcoin Sherpa also weighed in on the recent price actions, saying that “dino coin price action” such as XRP and LTC is a “sight to behold.” On the other hand, Alexander Lorenzo told his 30K X followers that he is “about to go all in on XRP.” $4.5 or $14? The XRP Army has long been known for highly bullish comments and beliefs even when the asset’s price seemed stuck for years below $1 after the 2017/2018 bull market, especially following the SEC’s lawsuit against the company behind the cross-border token. STEPH IS CRYPTO, a digital asset commentator with over 40,000 followers, provided two such optimistic price predictions for XRP. His short-term target would require the asset to break its 2018 ATH of $3.4 and jump to $4.5. The mid-term goal is even more spectacular – $14 per XRP. Should such a massive target be reached, XRP’s market cap will skyrocket to $810 billion, which would be twice as big as ETH’s now.

Here's Why",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-is-having-its-worst-bull-cycle-compared-to-bitcoin-according-to-analysts-heres-why/,"Ethereum’s native token Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing its worst bull cycle performance compared to Bitcoin (BTC) since the blockchain’s inception in 2015, according to analyst Van Straten, highlighting a pattern of diminishing returns. Ethereum’s Poor Performance Against Bitcoin Signals Declining Returns, Analysts Say A historical comparison of the ETH/BTC ratio over past cycles reveals that ETH has been a consistent underperformer. The last cycle, which started when Bitcoin bottomed at $15,500 after the FTX collapse in November 2022, continues this trend. The rate fell below 0.0300 on Wednesday to 0.02993, marking a four-year low. ETH/BTC was last at these levels in January 2019. So far this month, the rate has fallen 15%, adding to a 44% drop last year. Meanwhile, Bitcoin briefly fell to $98,000 before topping $105,000 following the launch of China’s artificial intelligence program DeepSeek. Ethereum, currently priced at $3,202, needs to climb to $3,360 to reverse the impact of the AI-induced decline. Despite ETH's underperformance, some analysts believe that this trend reflects Bitcoin's strength rather than Ethereum's weakness. “My general view is that the underperformance of the Ether-Bitcoin ratio is due to Bitcoin strength rather than Ethereum weakness,” said Andre Dragosch, head of research on Bitwise’s European desk. Dragosch also noted Ethereum’s competitive struggle, stating that smart contract platforms like Solana (SOL) offer greater scalability, while Ethereum does not directly compete with Bitcoin as a store of value asset. With Ethereum’s yields declining against Bitcoin, investors are watching closely to see if ETH can regain momentum or if this trend signals a longer-term shift in market dynamics. *This is not investment advice.

Multiple fund managers have recently submitted applications for altcoin ETFs to the securities regulator. However, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas, Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF is the only one that has advanced past the initial stage. Litecoin ETF Approval Incoming? In his latest update , Balchunas noted that Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF is the first altcoin 19b-4 filing to be acknowledged by the agency. He pointed out that all other similar applications were effectively shut down, as firms were instructed to withdraw them by Gary Gensler’s SEC. With the Commission’s comments on the S-1 and the acceptance of this filing, the Litecoin ETF is now the most advanced among altcoin proposals, having met all necessary regulatory requirements. As such, the key question remains whether the SEC will take the full 240-day review period to reach a decision or opt for a faster approval process – something that, at this stage, remains uncertain. According to the SEC’s January 29 filing , the public has a 21-day window from the document’s publication in the Federal Register to submit opinions on the proposed fund. This feedback will help shape the regulator’s decision-making process. After the comment period ends, the SEC has up to 45 days to reach a conclusion, though it retains the right to extend the review period to 90 days if needed. The final outcome will involve approval, rejection, or a more detailed examination of the ETF application. Polymarket Odds Favor Litecoin ETF Approval During Gensler’s tenure as SEC Chair, the agency frequently postponed decisions on crypto ETFs. It was also notorious for often delaying approvals until the final deadline. However, since his departure, the regulatory landscape is expected to shift. Acting Chair Mark Uyeda has shown a more receptive attitude toward crypto-related financial products, which has led to a surge in ETF applications beyond just Bitcoin. This shift has fueled optimism among crypto investors. In fact, traders on Polymarket, a decentralized prediction platform, have placed an 86% probability that the SEC will approve a Litecoin ETF this year. The recent development surrounding Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF proposal has had a significant positive impact on Litecoin’s price. Over the past day, LTC surged nearly 20%, trading above $132. The latest price movement has also strengthened the crypto asset’s monthly gains, bringing it closer to approximately 28%. Additionally, on-chain data hints at growing whale accumulation, which could be indicative of large investors positioning themselves in anticipation of a possible ETF approval.

A new staking product is now available for U.S. clients in 37 states and 2 territories, allowing them to securely support networks. The company plans to expand to more states as allowed. Starting today, clients residing in eligible states will be able to securely stake eligible tokens via Kraken Pro. These clients will be able to participate in bonded staking, which locks up/bonds cryptoassets to the network for a specific period of time. Clients in select U.S. states and territories will now be able to use Kraken’s onchain staking product to stake 17 assets, including ETH, SOL, DOT and ADA. Kraken’s restaking integration will also be made available in eligible states. An End To Stricter Crypto Rules With Donald Trump back in office, tough crypto rules from the previous administration, especially from the SEC, are being relaxed. In February 2023, Kraken ended its staking service for U.S. customers and paid $30 million to settle SEC charges about unregistered securities. “Launching this new staking product in the U.S. is an overwhelmingly positive development, not just for Kraken but also for the entire U.S. crypto space,” emphasized Mark Greenberg, Kraken Global Head of Consumer. Notably, Kraken was the first major centralized exchange to launch onchain staking in 2019, empowering clients to play a role in securing proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains. Last year, Kraken became one of the first crypto platforms to enable clients to restake ETH, so EigenLayer projects could benefit from the underlying security of Ethereum.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|ETH|REGULATION|ADA|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-30 15:54:52

Near Protocol continues its climb challenging Uniswap’s position with its scalable blockchain solutions. 1Fuel is in its presale phase, amassing $1.6M in funding and delivering 70% returns to early investors, it has become a must-watch. As the battle heats up, analysts predict explosive growth for 1Fuel (OFT) with the potential for 100x gains by 2025. Let’s find out why! Near Protocol gains ground as Uniswap fights to recover Near Protocol (NEAR) is stabilizing after a 5% drop last week now trading around $4.5 with a market cap of over $5 billion. It briefly peaked at $5.8 during market excitement but has since consolidated with 24-hour trading volume up nearly 45%. Investors watch closely as the token struggles to regain momentum in a volatile market. Despite its advanced sharding technology and a strong reputation for scalability, NEAR’s recent performance has left holders searching for tokens with faster growth potential. The protocol’s appeal to developers and institutions remains strong, but some investors are moving toward projects with higher short-term returns. In contrast, 1Fuel (OFT) has drawn attention to its innovative cross-chain wallet solutions and successful presale, which has raised over $1.6 million. With its utility-driven approach, 1Fuel offers a compelling alternative to NEAR, focusing on usability and consistent growth opportunities. 1Fuel (OFT) wallet disrupts DeFi with cross-chain revolution As Uniswap recovers and Near Protocol stabilizes, 1Fuel (OFT) is stealing the spotlight with its breakthrough cross-chain wallet technology. Its one-click transaction feature allows users to swap tokens across networks without switching wallets or paying extra fees. 1Fuel also prioritizes security and privacy. It includes a built-in mixer for private transactions and cold storage options to protect assets from hacks. These features give users peace of mind, especially as security concerns grow in the crypto world. Unlike most wallets, 1Fuel combines ease of use with top-notch protection, which is rare in the market. Beyond its wallet technology, 1Fuel offers rewards like trading bonuses and staking opportunities with up to 30% APR, making it attractive to long-term investors. Upcoming features like virtual and physical cards for real-world spending further show 1Fuel’s focus on practical use, giving it a clear edge over competitors. Compared to Near Protocol’s developer-centric model, 1Fuel’s focus on cross-chain functionality and everyday usability makes it stand out. It’s a clear choice for investors looking for practical and innovative solutions in the DeFi space. Presale skyrockets: Investors eye 1Fuel’s massive returns While Near Protocol works to regain its momentum, 1Fuel (OFT) is thriving in its presale. The token, now priced around $0.017, has already risen by 70% from its starting price. Investors are flocking to the presale, drawn by the 20% bonus on all purchases and the project’s rapid growth. Over $1.6 million has already been raised, showing strong market interest. Analysts predict that 1Fuel could deliver returns of over 100x after its official launch. As traditional tokens face slow growth, 1Fuel’s practical features and strong presale performance make it one of the most exciting investment opportunities in the current market. Key takeaways 1Fuel (OFT) is leading the way in DeFi with its cross-chain wallet, top-notch security, and real-world usability. Its presale is gaining momentum, with over $1.6 million raised and early investors already seeing big gains of over 70% It is reshaping how we manage crypto that is simple, secure, and ready for the future. Don’t miss this chance to invest at the lowest price and secure a 20% bonus. Join the presale now and take the first step toward massive growth!

Then, Crews Enochs from Index Coop answers questions on the topic in Ask and Expert. – Sarah Morton You’re reading Crypto for Advisors , CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter that unpacks digital assets for financial advisors. Subscribe here to get it every Thursday. The Lines Between Spot Crypto ETFs and Direct Ownership Will Blur in 2025 The year 2024 marked a pivotal moment for the cryptocurrency market with the launch of bitcoin and ether spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs), rapidly becoming some of the fastest-growing ETFs in history. According to various reports, global crypto ETPs amassed over $134 billion in assets under management (AUM) by November 2024. This success was notable even under the initial constraint of cash-only redemptions and contributions in the United States, a condition imposed by the SEC during the 2024 approvals. However, the landscape is set to evolve further in 2025 with anticipated changes in redemption mechanisms. The Shift to In-Kind Redemptions The SEC's decision in 2024 to not allow in-kind redemptions and contributions meant that only cash could be used for buying or selling ETF shares, which somewhat limited the potential of these financial products. This restriction is poised to change in 2025, with expectations that regulatory bodies will permit in-kind transactions for spot crypto ETFs. BlackRock has already filed for a rule change to enable in-kind redemptions for its Bitcoin ETF. This change will allow authorized participants to issue and redeem shares directly with Bitcoin or ether rather than cash, which will create a new liquidity flywheel between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. Impact on Investors The cash-only approach previously left billions in cryptocurrency assets on the sidelines. Crypto-native investors, particularly those with low-basis assets, hesitated to convert their holdings into ETFs due to the substantial tax liabilities. With in-kind redemptions, these investors could move portions of their crypto wealth into ETFs without the immediate tax burden, thus accessing a broader range of traditional financial services like uncollateralized lending, mortgages, and private banking. For traditional investors who have gained exposure to cryptocurrencies through ETFs, the shift to in-kind redemptions provides an opportunity to dive deeper into the crypto ecosystem. These investors, having seen significant appreciation in their ETF holdings (bitcoin, for instance, was valued at around $46,800 at the time of ETF launch in January 2024, and ether at approximately $3,422 by mid-July 2024), can now convert their ETF shares into direct crypto holdings to explore DeFi products without needing new capital or facing tax implications. Catalysts for Change The recent withdrawal of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 21 (SAB-21) is another significant development. This will relieve financial institutions from recording digital assets as liabilities on their balance sheets, encouraging more banks and brokerages to engage with crypto custody and develop crypto-native financial products. An example of this trend is Coinbase's recent launch of a bitcoin-backed lending product in partnership with Morpho Labs, leveraging DeFi to back loans with Bitcoin. This year, we should expect to see a wave of traditional financial institutions following this path. Concurrently, a segment of investors gravitate towards self-custody, preferring to manage their assets independently to access crypto-native products without intermediaries. This trend underscores the importance of user-friendly and secure self-custody solutions in the evolving crypto landscape. The Convergence of TradFi and DeFi 2025 is shaping up to be when the boundaries between traditional and decentralized finance become increasingly blurred. With mechanisms like in-kind transactions and favorable regulatory changes, investors will likely interact with crypto-native platforms more seamlessly, often inadvertently. This convergence is expected to enhance inflows into both sectors, boosting volume and creating a more interconnected and liquid market. In conclusion, the evolution from ETF to direct ownership in the crypto space is not just about investment choice but about how these financial instruments are reshaping investor behavior and market dynamics. With in-kind redemptions on the horizon and regulatory changes like the withdrawal of SAB-21, 2025 will mark a significant chapter in integrating cryptocurrencies into mainstream finance, further blurring the lines between traditional and on-chain financial rails. - Miguel Kudry, CEO, L1 Advisors Ask an Expert Q. What sets on-chain crypto ownership apart from traditional ETFs? 24/7 market access is just the starting point. On-chain ownership unlocks true composability—allowing investors to use assets as collateral, earn yield, and participate in decentralized ecosystems. While ETFs provide exposure, on-chain assets provide unmatched flexibility and utility. Q. How does direct custody of crypto assets enhance investor flexibility compared to ETFs? Have you ever tried transferring holdings from one brokerage to another? How long did it take? Was it a nightmare of friction? Probably. With on-chain crypto ownership, you have complete control. You can self-custody your assets, deposit them with custodians, and move them in and out in minutes. What if an opportunity arises, and you need to act fast? You can get liquidity immediately by selling or borrowing against your assets—no waiting, no hassle, just action when needed. Q. Will the AI agents of the future prefer ETFs or tokenized assets on-chain? Imagine an AI agent managing investments. To buy an ETF, it would need to navigate KYC processes, work through a brokerage’s limited hours, and depend on human intermediaries. Tokenized assets on-chain eliminate these barriers, offering 24/7 access, seamless automation, and the composability to maximize efficiency. For AI-driven financial systems, the choice will be clear: DeFi. - Crews Enochs, ecosystem growth lead, Index Coop Keep Reading President Donald Trump signed a crypto order to set a federal agenda meant to move U.S. digital assets businesses into friendly oversight.

Stablecoins are everywhere. Wealthy businesses and VCs see them as a silver bullet for companies struggling with outdated payment systems. In countries with high inflation, like Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, ordinary users are increasingly turning to stablecoins to save money or send funds to family members abroad. One thing is clear: stablecoins are here to stay. And the numbers speak for themselves. According to data from blockchain forensic firm Chainalysis, stablecoins now account for approximately 70% of the share of indirect flows from Brazil’s local exchanges to global exchanges. “Brazil’s high levels of stablecoin activity, as well as general interest in digital products and services, are drawing significant interest from major crypto players, notably Circle, which announced its official launch in Brazil in May 2024.” Chainalysis Nubank, the largest Brazilian digital bank in Latin America, is also chasing the trend. With over 85 million customers in Brazil and 6 million in Mexico and Colombia, the bank now offers a fixed 4% annual return to users who hold USD Coin ( USDC ), a stablecoin issued by Circle . Nubank says it started offering yields on stablecoins because “more than 50% of new Nubank Crypto users chose USDC as their first digital asset.” Big venture capital firms are also betting on stablecoins, expecting them to change how small businesses handle payments. Dragonfly Capital’s managing partner, Haseeb Qureshi, says stablecoins will go beyond trading and make things like 24/7 instant settlements possible — unlike banks that close on holidays. My 2025 Crypto Predictions I'm either going to look like a prophet or an idiot over these predictions, but one thing is for sure: I'm going to piss off a lot of people with bags. Breaking this up into six sections: my predictions for L1s/L2s, token launches, stablecoins,… — Haseeb ＞|＜ (@hosseeb) January 1, 2025 Citi Wealth strategists also see big potential in stablecoins, saying they “could end up reinforcing the U.S. dollar’s dominance” as market activity hit record highs with $5.5 trillion in transactions in Q1 2024. You might also like: European Central Bank eyes digital Euro to counter Trump’s stablecoin push Marc Boiron, CEO of Polygon Labs, sees huge potential in stablecoins, although he emphasizes that their growth is not just about market size. “What’s compelling is how the fundamentals are aligning,” Boiron told crypto.news in a commentary. He pointed out that regulatory frameworks like Markets in Crypto-Assets in Europe are also providing clarity, helping traditional financial institutions enter the stablecoin space. “Regulatory clarity is acting as a catalyst rather than a barrier. With frameworks like MiCA providing clear guidelines, traditional financial institutions and fintech companies can now approach stablecoins with greater confidence.” Marc Boiron Not everyone shares Boiron’s optimism about stablecoins. For Paolo Ardoino, CEO of Tether — the largest stablecoin issuer by market cap — MiCA regulations seem far-fetched , to say the least. He argues that requiring stablecoin issuers to keep at least 60% of their reserves in cash deposits could create serious risks for banks. Ardoino compared the regulations to the incident with Circle’s USDC in 2023 when billions of dollars of USDC reserves were stuck in the collapsed Silicon Valley Bank, which failed after a bank run. “I don’t want to endanger those 300 million people holding USDT because I have to keep the 60% in uninsured cash deposits in a European bank.” Paolo Ardoino Analysts at French blockchain firm Kaiko point out that European regulations don’t affect all stablecoin issuers equally. MiCA-compliant stablecoins | Source: Kaiko So far, they say only one company has benefited from the stricter rules — Circle, whose Euro-pegged stablecoin EURC and USDC have seen the biggest jump in daily trading volumes since MiCA took effect. It might still be too early to draw conclusions. But one thing is clear — big money is eager to find a way to make the “one trillion dollar opportunity” happen. Californian venture capital firm Pantera Capital also notes that these assets now account for over 50% of blockchain transactions, up from just 3% in 2020. What’s unclear is how or where that breakthrough will come, especially with regulations already putting pressure on even the biggest stablecoin firms.

In addition, the USDC stablecoin was added to the roadmap for listing on the Aptos network. Recently, Coinbase has started to expand its futures platform considerably. In fact, some altcoins that are not yet listed on the exchange's spot platform can be listed in futures. The loose regulation caused by futures being closed to US users may also be effective in this. On the other hand, when we examine the latest listings announced by Coinbase, we see that Tezos and MultiversX are layer 1 blockchain platforms, while Axie Infinity is one of the most popular gaming altcoins of a period.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board updated guidelines allowing companies to adjust the value of their digital assets at market prices for each quarter. Before the update, companies had to report their digital asset holdings at their lowest valuation at the time of ownership. Even if their value rose, the assets could not be revalued until they were sold, making the company’s digital asset holdings appear weaker than their market value. As a result of the updated rules, Tesla’s digital asset holdings surged to $1.07 billion by the end of Q4, a substantial jump from $184 million in previous quarters. Tesla’s numbers coincided with a remarkable surge in the price of BTC , which jumped over 50% in Q4. The surge was driven by several factors, like the re-election of Donald Trump, increased institutional interest in BTC , and spot bitcoin ETFs. BTC is currently trading at around $105,000. Tesla did not disclose its BTC holdings in its Q4 report. However, data from Arkham Intelligence puts Tesla’s holdings at 11,509 BTC , valued at $1.21 billion. This makes Tesla the fourth-largest publicly-traded BTC holder behind MicroStrategy, Marathon Digital, and Galaxy Digital. CME To Introduce Bitcoin Options For Retail Traders The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) Group has announced plans to introduce options related to its bite-sized Bitcoin Friday futures to cater to growing interest from retail investors in crypto derivatives. The cash-settled options will begin trading on February 24, subject to regulatory approval. The options will complement CME’s current offerings and include physically settled options on BTC and ETH futures. According to CME’s global head of crypto products, Giovanni Vicioso, the new options will offer traders greater precision in managing short-term Bitcoin price risks, adding that the smaller contract size and daily expiries will provide an efficient way for traders to manage their BTC exposure. CME launched Bitcoin Friday futures on September 29. They are smaller than other retail-focused Bitcoin futures products, with each contract representing 1/50th of a Bitcoin. They are even smaller than Coinbase’s nano Bitcoin futures, sold in increments of one-100th of a Bitcoin. Bitcoin Friday futures have registered considerable trading activity since their introduction, with over 775,000 contracts traded at an average daily volume of 9,700 contracts. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is hovering around $105,000 despite the Federal Reserve’s decision to pause interest rate cuts. Investors are now waiting for the upcoming US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Q4 2024, set to release on Thursday. Analysts expect considerable volatility in the BTC price following the release of these numbers. Gracy Chen, CEO of Bitget, stated, “Immediate growth, as we’ve seen in previous bull cycles, may not follow as much of the optimism surrounding Trump’s stance on crypto has already been priced in following recent bullish trends.” Markets expected the Fed to keep interest rates unchanged, adopting a hawkish stance after acknowledging that inflation had not eased on expected lines. The Fed’s monetary policy statement highlighted a resilient labor market and stated that risks to its dual mandate goals are “roughly in balance.” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said that while inflation has eased, it remains at 2.9%, making further adjustments uncertain. US Treasury yields rose 4.5 basis points to 4.581% following the announcement, while the US Dollar Index climbed to a session high of 108.10. However, the Fed’s decision to pause interest rate cuts could indicate a bearish outlook for the crypto market. BTC registered a substantial decline at the beginning of the week after facing volatility the week prior. Volatility set in on Thursday after the flagship cryptocurrency registered a substantial drop a day prior. BTC rose to an intraday high of $106,903 and fell to an intraday low of $101,296 before settling at $104,004. Buyers retained control on Friday as BTC rose to an intraday high of $107,038 before settling at $14,874. However, sentiment began changing over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal drop on Saturday before falling over 2% on Sunday to settle at $102,655. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Monday as BTC dropped to an intraday low of $97,766. However, the price recovered from this level to reclaim $100,000, ultimately settling at $102,064. Buyers retained control on Tuesday, and BTC fell 0.69% to $101,362. BTC made a strong recovery on Wednesday, rising 2.27% to $103,666. BTC has crossed $105,000 during the ongoing session, up nearly 2% and trading around $105,51. Sentiment around BTC has picked up since Wednesday. The RSI currently sits at 61, well above the neutral zone. The MACD has also flipped to bullish, indicating an uptick in positive sentiment. If BTC remains above $105,000, buyers will look to push to $110,000. On the other hand, if sellers retake control and drive the price below $100,000, BTC could decline to $90,000.

The CNB noted in a statement that the central bank has been increasingly diversifying its investments over the last two years as part of its reserve management strategy. “At the proposal of Governor Aleš Michl, the CNB is to assess whether it would be appropriate in terms of diversification and return to include other asset classes in the reserves as well,” it noted. The board said it will decide on next steps after analyzing the situation, with no changes until then. Any new reserve investments will be revealed in quarterly and annual reports. Remarkably, if Bitcoin is added, the CNB would be the first central bank to hold it. CNB Governor Aleš Michl recently announced plans to introduce a BTC reserve, calling it a game-changer. The national bank aims to invest at least 5% of its €140bn reserves in Bitcoin. However the Finance Minister had voiced concerns about Bitcoin’s instability and volatility. He argued that Bitcoin is unsuitable as a national reserve due to its highly volatile nature and emphasized that the government cannot override the CNB’s decisions. Nevertheless, the Czech National Bank’s move to explore Bitcoin as part of its reserve strategy marks a bold step toward diversification. The decision will be carefully analyzed, and if approved, it could set a precedent for other central banks, with the CNB potentially becoming the first to hold Bitcoin in its reserves.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-30 16:12:58
