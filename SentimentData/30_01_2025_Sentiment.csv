Dogecoin, the meme coin that continues to defy expectations, is aiming for a $1 valuation, fueled by its recent price surge and growing adoption. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is making waves with its innovative approach to decentralized e-commerce, attracting significant interest with its presale, which has now surpassed $970,000 in just four stages. This article explores the contrasting narratives of these two crypto contenders, highlighting their unique strengths and potential for growth in 2025. Dogecoin Price Dynamics: Is a Surge Around the Corner? Dogecoin has been a fascinating phenomenon in the crypto space, defying skeptics and delivering impressive returns for its supporters. Originally created as a joke, Dogecoin has gained mainstream recognition, thanks to its vibrant community. Currently trading at around $0.35, Dogecoin has experienced a recent surge in price, fueled by positive market sentiment and increased adoption. Analysts are optimistic about Dogecoin’s potential to reach $1 by the end of 2025, especially if its utility as a payment method continues to grow. Despite its meme-based origins, Dogecoin is increasingly being recognized for its practical applications. Its use for tipping, microtransactions, and even merchandise purchases at Tesla highlights its growing acceptance as a legitimate form of currency. However, it’s important to remember that Dogecoin’s price is heavily influenced by market sentiment and social media trends. This volatility can lead to significant price fluctuations, making it a higher-risk investment compared to more established cryptocurrencies. Web3Bay: A Marketplace Built for Buyers & Sellers, Not Middlemen While Dogecoin captures headlines with its meme-fueled price movements, Web3Bay is quietly building a revolution in the e-commerce space. This blockchain-powered platform is designed to address the limitations of traditional online marketplaces, offering a more secure, transparent, and user-centric experience. Web3Bay’s presale has generated significant interest, raising over $970,000 in just four stages. This strong performance reflects the growing confidence in Web3Bay’s vision and its potential to disrupt the e-commerce industry. At the heart of this ecosystem is the 3BAY token, currently priced at $0.004562625 in stage 4 of the presale. With a projected launch price of $0.1959, early investors could see returns exceeding 6,430%. This, combined with the platform’s innovative features and community-driven governance model, makes Web3Bay a compelling investment opportunity. Web3Bay’s roadmap includes exciting developments such as the integration of NFT marketplaces, staking opportunities, and Layer-2 scaling solutions for faster and cheaper transactions. The platform also plans to transition into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), giving users a direct say in its future development. Dogecoin vs. Web3Bay: A Tale of Two Cryptos Dogecoin and Web3Bay represent two distinct approaches to cryptocurrency. Dogecoin thrives on community enthusiasm and market sentiment, while Web3Bay focuses on solving real-world problems and delivering tangible value to its users. Dogecoin’s price is heavily influenced by external factors, such as social media trends and endorsements from influential figures. This makes it a volatile asset, with the potential for both significant gains and losses. Web3Bay, on the other hand, offers a more predictable investment thesis. Its presale success and robust roadmap suggest that it’s well-positioned for sustained growth. As blockchain adoption increases, Web3Bay’s utility-driven model could become a standard for decentralized marketplaces, making it a compelling choice for risk-averse investors. Diversifying Your Crypto Portfolio For those seeking to navigate the crypto market effectively, diversification is key. Including both Dogecoin and Web3Bay in your portfolio can provide a balanced approach, allowing you to capitalize on Dogecoin’s potential for rapid growth while also benefiting from Web3Bay’s long-term potential and stability. By diversifying your holdings, you can mitigate risk and position yourself to benefit from the diverse opportunities that the crypto market offers. Whether you’re seeking short-term gains or long-term growth, a balanced portfolio can help you achieve your investment goals. The Crypto Landscape in 2025 The crypto market is constantly evolving, and projects like Dogecoin and Web3Bay are at the forefront of this exciting landscape. Dogecoin’s ability to capture the imagination of the masses and Web3Bay’s potential to revolutionize e-commerce demonstrate the diverse applications of blockchain technology. As we look ahead to the rest of 2025, both Dogecoin and Web3Bay offer compelling reasons for investors to take notice. Whether you’re drawn to the meme-fueled excitement of Dogecoin or the practical utility of Web3Bay, these two projects represent the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the crypto world.

Analyst Weighs In,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-prolonged-consolidation-what-is-really-going-on-analyst-weighs-in/,"Ethereum performance has lagged behind the broader cryptocurrency market in recent months, with the asset failing to capitalize on the bullish momentum recently seen in the market. While Bitcoin has repeatedly reached new all-time highs, Ethereum has struggled to break past $4,000 and remains well below its 2021 peak of $4,800. Amid this slow recovery, a crypto analyst known as ProjectW has shared insights on the potential for Ethereum’s resurgence, urging investors to consider the long-term picture. In a detailed post on X, ProjectW outlined several factors that could drive Ethereum’s next breakout. The analyst highlighted Ethereum’s years of accumulation within a broad trading range, suggesting that such prolonged consolidation often precedes significant price expansions. Despite the negative sentiment around Ethereum and narratives favoring other networks like Solana, ProjectW emphasized that Ethereum’s long-term upward trend remains intact. A possible retest of the sub-$ 3,000 range could serve as a catalyst, providing the liquidity needed to push Ethereum past $4,000 and set the stage for a broader recovery. Related Reading: Ethereum Foundation Sells Another 100 ETH, But There’s Still ‘Hopium’ For Holders ETH/BTC Performance And Outlook A key point in ProjectW’s analysis is Ethereum’s ongoing underperformance against Bitcoin. So far, Ethereum has struggled to match Bitcoin’s gains during market rallies and has often faced steeper declines during market corrections. This trend is reflected in the ETH/BTC trading pair, which remains in a bearish structure on higher timeframes. However, the analyst identified a potential reversal zone around $2,700 for Ethereum, which could coincide with a structural shift if ETH/BTC stabilizes at these levels. THE BIG COMEBACK OF ETHEREUM: An Unbiased Evaluation “Ethereum is dead. Solana stole the show.” You’ve probably heard this take a hundred times. The sentiment around ETH has never been worse. And yet – if we strip away emotions and narratives – Ethereum’s long-term… pic.twitter.com/ipkXvuXbnj — ProjectW (@fitforcrypto_) January 29, 2025 The analyst also touched on the role of market makers and institutional players in shaping Ethereum’s price trajectory. According to ProjectW, recent negative coverage of Ethereum—ranging from concerns about the Ethereum Foundation to repeated comparisons with Bitcoin—may not be coincidental. Instead, it could represent a deliberate effort by major market participants to accumulate Ethereum at lower prices, a pattern observed in past market cycles. The involvement of institutional players, such as Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial reportedly acquiring significant amounts of Ethereum, adds another layer of complexity to the current market dynamics. The analyst wrote: We know how this game works. MMs move price where they want – especially to areas with high liquidity. And how do they do it? Media narratives. Recently, we’ve seen an aggressive push of ETH FUD in major publications. – The Ethereum Foundation being questioned – ETH’s underperformance against BTC being highlighted everywhere Is this really a coincidence? Or is it the same old SM playbook? Flood the market with FUD → Retail panic sells at the bottom → Institutions accumulate. Ethereum’s Core Strengths and Future Outlook Despite recent underperformance, the analyst argued that Ethereum’s core fundamentals remain strong. ProjectW wrote: Despite all the noise, Ethereum remains the most important smart contract network. – The deepest liquidity in DeFi – The highest security & decentralization – It has the strongest developer ecosystem While sentiment is at rock bottom, the actual fundamentals suggest ETH is still the backbone of the space. So where does this leave us? Related Reading: Ethereum Price Forms Flag And Pole Pattern For Possible Breakout, New Targets Emerge While no rally is guaranteed, ProjectW suggested that Ethereum’s long-term conditions are aligning for potential growth. The analyst concluded with a call to closely monitor Ethereum’s progress in the coming weeks, as market participants await signs of a sustained upward trend.

The proposal, which will be presented on January 30, could see the central bank allocate up to 5% of its €140 billion ($146 billion) reserves into Bitcoin, amounting to a potential investment of approximately €7 billion. If approved, the Czech National Bank would become the first European central bank to hold Bitcoin as part of its reserve assets. Michl stated that Bitcoin has zero correlation to bonds and is an interesting asset for a large portfolio. However, he noted that while Bitcoin is under consideration, there is no imminent decision.

Here’s Why Crypto Whales Are Betting On WLTQ For 60,000% Gains Over XRP",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/is-wallitiq-wltq-the-next-dogecoin-heres-why-crypto-whales-are-betting-on-wltq-for-60000-gains-over-xrp/,"While Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a crowd favorite and Ripple (XRP) continues to garner attention for its resilience in legal battles, a new kid on the blockchain has captured the imagination of crypto whales: WallitIQ (WLTQ) . With predictions of a staggering 60,000% price spike, the WLTQ presale is being hailed by crypto whales as the opportunity of a lifetime. WallitIQ (WLTQ): Takes Heavy Bets To Lead Bull Market The WallitIQ (WLTQ) platform enters the crypto space with a comprehensive solution for the future of decentralized finance (DeFi). The platform maximizes cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology to address some of the most pressing issues in crypto asset management. A standout feature is the Escrow Connect system , which combines biometric and facial recognition authentication to safeguard transactions and protect assets. For crypto whales and everyday investors alike, this security-first approach is a game-changer. At the heart of WallitIQ’s ecosystem is its WLTQ token, a utility-packed altcoin designed to generate incredible returns. One of its most attractive features is its staking rewards program, which offers up to 180% APY, making it one of the most profitable opportunities in DeFi. With crypto whales forecasting a 60,000% price surge, the token’s potential is undeniable. WallitIQ (WLTQ) also introduces AI-driven predictive analytics and real-time market notifications through Push Protocol technology, helping users deal with the volatile crypto market with confidence. Its MVP crypto wallet app is another standout feature, offering live market data, real-time sentiment analysis, and advanced security measures like biometric authentication. For frequent travelers, users in restrictive financial environments, or anyone seeking secure, borderless asset management , WallitIQ (WLTQ) with its CoinMarketCap listing and a SolidProof smart contract audit , stands out as the better option over tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) The WLTQ presale is a golden ticket for investors aiming to secure life-changing returns. Priced at just $0.0420 , early adopters have the chance to lock in massive gains before the token skyrockets. Imagine investing $1,000 today—at a 60,000% increase, that would yield $600,000. A $10,000 investment would turn into $6 million, while $100,000 could grow to a staggering $60 million. This is the kind of wealth-generating potential that crypto whales are racing to capitalize on, and you can too. Now is the time to act. WallitIQ‘s (WLTQ) AI-driven trading strategy and unique utility are primed to catalyze a price explosion once the presale ends, setting the stage for altcoin season. Don’t miss this once-in-a-lifetime chance to transform your financial future. Dogecoin (DOGE): A Favorite with Limited Upside Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin with a loyal community, has a special place in the crypto market, However, Dogecoin’s (DOGE) lack of tangible utility limits its long-term growth potential. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) value largely depends on market sentiment and social media buzz. Although Dogecoin (DOGE) has been a key player in past bull markets, analysts believe Dogecoin (DOGE) may struggle to maintain its momentum as more innovative altcoins like WallitIQ (WLTQ) enter the scene. XRP: A Resilient Contender with Lingering Uncertainty Ripple (XRP) has proven its resilience despite ongoing legal challenges with the SEC. Ripple’s (XRP) technology allows fast and cost-effective cross-border transactions, making it a popular choice among financial institutions. However, the uncertainty surrounding Ripple’s (XRP) legal status has kept many investors on edge. While Ripple (XRP) remains a viable altcoin, crypto whales agree that Ripple’s (XRP) potential upside pales in comparison to the explosive 60,000% growth projected for WLTQ. Conclusion: WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is the Clear Choice for 60,000% Gains In a market crowded with Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP), WallitIQ (WLTQ) stands out for crypto whales as a revolutionary project poised to lead the next bull market. Its AI-powered security features , unparalleled staking rewards, and innovative ecosystem make it a must-have for any investor. The presale, priced at an accessible $0.0420, is your gateway to life-changing returns. With crypto whales predicting a 60,000% price surge, now is the time to join in the act. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by; invest in WallitIQ (WLTQ) today and position yourself for massive gains by 2025.

In a new press release , TMTG – the firm behind social media platform Truth Social and the video streaming service Truth+ – says it’s collaborating with Charles Schwab to launch Truth.Fi, a fintech firm with crypto services. As a means of diversifying the firm’s reserves, TMTG’s board has approved an investment of $250 million to be custodied by Charles Schwab, which could go toward investment vehicles, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), separately managed accounts (SMAs), as well as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other digital assets, according to the press release. As stated by TMGT chief executive and chairman David Nunez, “Truth.Fi is a natural expansion of the Truth Social movement. We began by creating a free-speech social media platform, added an ultra-fast TV streaming service, and now we’re moving into investment products and decentralized finance. Developing American First investment vehicles is another step toward our goal of creating a robust ecosystem through which American patriots can protect themselves from the ever-present threat of cancellation, censorship, debanking, and privacy violations committed by big tech…” Last year, Trump announced the launch of his own DeFi network – World Liberty Financial (WLFI) – as a means of helping those who have been disenfranchised by banks. Last week, it was found that WLFI has become a top 0.1% holder of staked Ethereum ( stETH ) as the firm is staking $33 million worth of the leading altcoin.

According to AP, this is the first-of-its-kind international report, released on Wednesday ahead of the AI summit in Paris in February, cataloging the dangers posed by the fast-growing technology. Countries back the International Scientific Report The report details some of the dangers that could arise as a result of advanced AI and these include enabling terrorism and widespread job losses. This has already been experienced especially within the tech where thousands of jobs have been cut off as the companies automate, thanks to AI. According to AP , the report has the support of 30 countries including the US and China, a rare instance that the two biggest economies in the world are in cooperation. The two have been at each other’s throat as they fight for supremacy in AI. This week, Chinese startup DeepSeek stunned the world with its budget chatbot, although the US imposed stringent export controls on China. Prominent AI scientist Yoshua Bengio led the study, which is a fusion of already existing studies meant to guide authorities on drawing up guardrails for the fast-growing tech. “The stakes are high,” says the report, noting that a few years ago AI systems could barely produce a coherent paragraph. However, with recent development the AI can now generate realistic images, computer programming as well as hold extended conversations with users. According to the researchers, the dangers of advanced AI are already slowly being witnessed such as misinformation and disinformation, deepfakes, scams, and biases. “We need to better understand the systems we’re building and the risks that come with them so that we can take these better decisions in the future.” Bengio. This comes “as general-purpose AI becomes more capable, evidence of additional risks is gradually emerging,” according to the report. This also comes during the same week that the Vatican has warned against the technology together with group behind Doomsday Clock . The report focuses on general purpose AI, which is typified by models such as ChatGPT by OpenAI. The report categorized the advanced AI risks The International Scientific Report groups the risks into three, that is malicious use, malfunctions, and widespread “systemic” risks. The researchers looked at how easy it is for AI to learn to use chemical or biological weapons posing huge risks to humans. Additionally, the report notes that general purpose AI can also transform the job market, displacing some employees, although other researchers agree that AI could create more employment than it takes it away. The report also expressed fears over AI systems running out of control for two possible reasons, the first being either because they undermine human oversight or humans pay less attention. Bengio revealed that the 100 experts who came together for the report did not always agree on what to expect from AI in the future. One of the disagreement was on when AI would surpass human capabilities on different tasks. “They disagree also about the scenarios,” said Bengio. “Of course, nobody has a crystal ball. Some scenarios are very beneficial. Some are terrifying. I think it’s really important for policymakers and the public to take stock of that uncertainty.” Bengio. The report, which several countries have backed, also has the support of the European Union. It comes as world leaders, tech leaders and experts as well as civil society are expected to gather again at the Paris AI Action Summit. The countries will sign a “common declaration” on AI development.

Qubetics is revolutionizing blockchain interoperability, VeChain is solidifying its position as a leader in supply chain solutions, and Hedera faces uncertainty as bearish predictions loom. These developments put them in the spotlight as some of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025, offering investors varying levels of risk and reward. Qubetics: Driving Blockchain Interoperability with a Game-Changing Vision In today’s fragmented blockchain ecosystem, most networks operate in isolation, limiting seamless data exchange and cross-chain transactions. This lack of interoperability restricts decentralized applications from reaching their full potential, creating roadblocks for blockchain adoption. Qubetics aims to resolve this issue by becoming a Web3-aggregated chain , bridging multiple networks into a unified framework. By enabling seamless asset transfers, data sharing, and cross-chain functionality, Qubetics is set to revolutionize how developers, enterprises, and users interact with blockchain technology. Investor enthusiasm for Qubetics remains at an all-time high, with the project reaching its 19th presale phase. The $TICS token is currently priced at $0.0606, pushing total presale funds to an impressive $11.3 million. Over 17,100 holders have collectively acquired 450 million tokens, further reinforcing confidence in Qubetics’ long-term potential. Looking ahead, $TICS is projected to hit $0.25 by the end of the presale, offering a remarkable 312.18% ROI for early investors. Crypto analysts anticipate a major price surge post-mainnet, with forecasts ranging between $10 and $15 per token. With this trajectory, Qubetics is undoubtedly one of the best cryptos to buy for January 2025, offering both strong fundamentals and explosive growth potential. VeChain: Poised for a Breakout as Supply Chain Adoption Grows VeChain has emerged as one of the most promising blockchain projects in supply chain management, offering businesses an efficient and transparent way to track goods and streamline operations. As companies seek reliable solutions to enhance logistics, VeChain’s blockchain technology is becoming an essential part of real-world applications. Currently priced at $0.048, VeChain has seen an 80% increase in the past six months, showcasing strong momentum. It is approaching a key resistance level of $0.0717, signaling a potential breakout. Experts predict that if this trend continues, VeChain could surpass $0.095 by the end of the year, making it a strong contender for further gains. What sets VeChain apart is its real-world utility, which goes beyond speculation. Major corporations have already integrated VeChain’s blockchain into their supply chains, further strengthening its market position. With growing adoption and a bullish price outlook, VeChain is among the best cryptos to buy for January 2025, particularly for investors seeking projects with tangible use cases. Hedera: Facing Bearish Sentiment Amid Market Uncertainty Hedera (HBAR), known for its high-speed, low-cost, and scalable blockchain alternative, has been a strong competitor in crypto. However, the latest February 2025 forecast suggests a potential 20% decline in Hedera’s value as market conditions become increasingly challenging. The bearish outlook is driven by increased competition from newer blockchain projects and concerns over Hedera’s ability to attract developers and investors. With the crypto market becoming more selective, projects with strong use cases and scalability are gaining favor, while others may struggle to maintain relevance. Although Hedera still boasts impressive technology, investors are closely watching whether the project can overcome this downturn and regain its bullish momentum. HBAR could present an opportunity at lower entry prices for risk-tolerant investors, but caution is warranted given the current predictions. Conclusion: Which Crypto Should You Buy in January 2025? As the crypto market continues to evolve, Qubetics, VeChain, and Hedera present diverse opportunities for investors. Qubetics is breaking new ground in blockchain interoperability, making it a top contender for massive gains. VeChain’s strong supply chain use cases and bullish price trends position it as a solid investment with real-world adoption. Meanwhile, Hedera’s uncertain price outlook raises questions about its future performance, requiring a cautious approach. For investors looking for the best cryptos to buy for January 2025 , Qubetics and VeChain stand out as strong candidates with clear growth potential. Hedera remains a watchlist asset for those willing to navigate market uncertainty.

However, the company appears to be safe from a Habeas Corpus lawsuit. The case raised “ethical” concerns at the nation’s supreme court. Is Worldcoin ‘Flouting’ Brazil Ban? G1 , the digital arm of the O Globo newspaper, has reported that Tools for Humanity appears not to be heeding a ruling from Brazil’s National Data Protection Authority (ANPD). https://t.co/l8Qj5lR5h2 — Alexandre Pimenta (@alexandrepim) January 28, 2025 The ANPD ruling forbids Tools for Humanity from offering people crypto or financial incentives in exchange for their biometric data on Brazilian territory.

BITCOIN, XRP, and OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM Are in the Spotlight!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/turn-1000-into-a-fortune-bitcoin-xrp-and-officialmagacoin-com-are-in-the-spotlight/,"THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN: The Standout Crypto of 2025 Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) have long been regarded as market leaders, but THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven itself to be a dominant force in the crypto landscape. With its record-breaking presale raising $1 million in minutes, it has captured the attention of both experienced and new investors. Analysts agree: THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has firmly established itself as a standout token, outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) in their early days. How THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Outshines Its Rivals Ethereum (ETH): As a leader in DeFi, ETH remains strong but lacks the explosive appeal of this newly dominant token. Polygon (MATIC): While MATIC focuses on scaling Ethereum, it hasn’t achieved the same market enthusiasm or record-breaking performance. TRON (TRX): Known for its content-sharing applications, TRX’s growth has been steady but cannot compare to THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s transformative impact. Arbitrum (ARB): Though a promising Layer-2 solution, ARB doesn’t command the same attention or investor trust. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is Ahead of the Pack 1. Unmatched Presale Success Few cryptocurrencies can claim the level of demand seen by THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . The presale’s $1 million milestone within minutes is a testament to its strong market position and widespread investor confidence. 2. Scarcity Drives Demand With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN ensures sustained demand through its deflationary model. Unlike ETH or MATIC, which face high token circulation, this scarcity gives investors a tangible advantage. 3. Exclusive Market Access Available only at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM , this token’s exclusivity gives early adopters an edge that other widely available cryptos like TRX and ARB can’t replicate. This controlled distribution solidifies its reputation as the go-to investment for those seeking proven opportunities. Are You In? THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven itself as the standout crypto of 2025, setting a new benchmark in the market with its record-breaking presale. Its limited supply, exclusivity, and overwhelming demand position it as the go-to choice for investors.

The firm led a $16 million funding round for Sign, a blockchain startup focused on improving token distribution and on-chain credential verification. The company now represents the family office of Zhao and Binance co-founder Yi He. This shift marks a major change, with Zhao now taking a more active role in crypto investments. The branded firm is moving away from its previous focus on the exchange’s capital ventures, setting its sights on foundational blockchain infrastructure. YZi Lab’s $16 Million Investment into Sign YZi Labs made its debut investment with a $16 million funding round into Sign. This startup aims to simplify the token distribution process while verifying credentials on-chain. Its goal is to provide a more trustworthy infrastructure as more people shift their activities to blockchain. In a recent statement, Zhao emphasized the importance of proper distribution and verification to build trust. As blockchain adoption grows, such infrastructure becomes increasingly vital for the industry’s success. Remarkably, Sign has seen rapid growth, with revenue surging from $1.7 million in 2023 to $15 million in 2024. This achievement came after its integration with the TON blockchain. The platform aims to use its new funding to expand globally and assist governments in embracing blockchain technology. A Fresh Start for YZi Labs Zhao was released in September after serving four months for violating the Bank Secrecy Act. As part of his guilty plea, he resigned as Binance CEO and paid a whopping $50 million fine. However, this has not slowed his ambitions. With the rebranding from Binance Labs to YZi Labs, the focus has shifted to investments led by Zhao and Yi He, with the firm now serving as their family office. This move aligns with Zhao’s vision of taking a hands-on approach to shaping the future of blockchain and cryptocurrency. He is focusing more directly on ventures that interest him and his co-founder. This new direction signals that YZi Labs will likely be more selective in its investment choices. The firm plans to shape the blockchain space beyond Binance. CZ’s Legal Woes Continues Even though Zhao has regained his freedom, his legal troubles, including Binanceare, are not over. In a fresh lawsuit, investors have accused the exchange of selling unregistered tokens that later lost value. The exchange initially filed to appeal these allegations. However, the U.S. Supreme Court regulators refused to hear the exchange and its founder’s plea. Because the appeal was rejected, the case will continue in lower courts. The lawsuit argues that U.S. laws apply to Binance since American investors used its platform. Even though Binance claims it operates outside the U.S., courts ruled that its activities fall under U.S. jurisdiction.

With Dogecoin on the verge of an ETF and Popcat securing a major foothold in the Solana ecosystem, it’s clear that meme coins are transforming into serious assets. Even ANDY, an Ethereum-based meme token, is making headlines with its growing market cap and community traction. Among these rising stars, Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is crafting an entirely new genre of meme coins. Instead of following traditional presale stages, it takes investors on an extraordinary journey across mythical and hidden locations, creating a sense of adventure and urgency. The blend of mystery, storytelling, and financial opportunity makes Arctic Pablo one of the most exciting meme coins to watch. Let’s dive deep into the top meme coins to join for long term, analyzing their unique selling points, potential returns, and the frenzy they’re stirring up in the crypto world. Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC): The Adventurer’s Treasure with Insane ROI Arctic Pablo is on a quest unlike any other in the frozen landscapes of the unknown. He’s not just collecting relics; he’s uncovering the secrets of hidden wealth and mystical lands. His journey has now reached Glacier Grove, the 7th location, where early investors are reaping the benefits of their trust in his expedition. So far, over $600,000 has been raised, and the presale price stands at $0.000043. But here’s the kicker: by the time Arctic Pablo reaches his destination, the launch price is set at $0.008, meaning an astonishing 18,546% ROI potential for early backers. For those wondering what that means in real numbers, investing just $100 at the current presale price would yield 2,325,567 APC tokens. At launch, this investment balloons to $18,604.54. That’s not just an investment; that’s a ticket to life-changing gains. But Arctic Pablo Coin isn’t just about price speculation. The project introduces an ecosystem built on Binance Smart Chain (BSC), ensuring low transaction fees and secure, scalable operations. A weekly token burn mechanism further increases scarcity, permanently eliminating unsold tokens. All burn transactions are fully recorded on BSC for transparency. Staking enthusiasts aren’t left out either. With a massive 66% APY staking program, holders can lock in their tokens for two months post-launch and watch their investment grow. This staking model ensures long-term sustainability while rewarding the most loyal adventurers in Pablo’s journey. If there’s one meme coin making waves in both storytelling and financial growth, it’s Arctic Pablo Coin. With no ordinary presale stages, each location discovery adds a layer of exclusivity and urgency. Don’t miss out on the adventure—Arctic Pablo is rewriting meme coin history. It is one of the top meme coins to join for long term . Popcat ($POPCAT): The Solana Powerhouse Taking Over the Internet The internet thrives on viral trends, and Popcat has become one of the most iconic internet sensations. Built on the Solana blockchain, Popcat ($POPCAT) is more than just a meme; it’s an ever-growing ecosystem fueled by community engagement and massive trading volumes. Currently trading at $0.378482, Popcat has witnessed incredible traction, boasting a market cap of $370,902,653. Despite a slight 0.96% drop in the last 24 hours, the project continues to dominate meme coin discussions. What makes it special? It rides the wave of Solana’s blazing-fast transactions, ensuring smooth and cheap trades compared to Ethereum-based rivals. Beyond its hilarious origins, Popcat has embraced NFT integration, staking rewards, and decentralized governance, setting it apart from the average meme coin. The meme-based utility ensures organic virality, drawing in new investors daily. ANDY ($ANDY): The Ethereum Meme Coin with Explosive Market Growth Ethereum-based meme coins have always been strong contenders in the crypto space, and ANDY ($ANDY) is rapidly climbing the ranks. Currently priced at $0.000103, ANDY has witnessed a 15.42% drop, but that hasn’t stopped it from amassing a market cap of $103,296,738. Ethereum meme coins historically bounce back stronger, making this dip a potential buying opportunity for those looking for long-term gains. ANDY’s growth can be attributed to its solid tokenomics and rising demand among Ethereum users. With the Ethereum network thriving due to NFT and DeFi adoption, meme coins like ANDY are reaping the benefits of increased blockchain activity. Community involvement has also played a major role in ANDY’s success. From social media hype to community-driven marketing efforts, the token continues to attract new investors looking for the next big meme coin explosion. If Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have proven anything, Ethereum meme coins hold their ground against even the biggest market swings. With its growing adoption and Ethereum’s scalability upgrades, ANDY is well-positioned for long-term price appreciation. Experts suggest that a rally toward $0.0003 or beyond is possible, especially as more investors look for Ethereum-based meme coins with real growth potential. Final Thoughts: The Best Meme Coins to Hold for Long-Term Gains Based on our research and market trends, Arctic Pablo Coin, Popcat, and ANDY are among the top meme coins to join for long term. Each brings a unique blend of viral appeal, community engagement, and real investment opportunities.

But as CZ looks ahead, regulators in France are looking back. Table of Contents From Binance to YZi Labs Binance’s never-ending troubles YZi Labs’ expanding investment portfolio What’s CZ up to? From Binance to YZi Labs Changpeng Zhao , more commonly known as “CZ,” once the most influential figure in crypto, is back — but this time, in a different role. After stepping down as Binance ’s CEO in 2023 and serving a four-month prison sentence in the U.S. for compliance failures, CZ has returned with YZi Labs — a rebranded version of Binance Labs that is expanding its focus beyond the crypto world. Unlike its predecessor, which primarily nurtured blockchain startups, YZi Labs is broadening its scope , venturing into artificial intelligence and biotechnology. The initiative will be led by Ella Zhang, a familiar face from Binance Labs’ early days, and will reintroduce a 12-week, in-person residency program for startup founders. CZ will also be involved, offering mentorship to the next generation of entrepreneurs. YZi Labs has already made its first major investment, leading a $16 million funding round for Sign, a platform aiming to improve on-chain credential verification and token distribution. The sign has developed TokenTable, a tool designed to address common issues with airdrops, such as token supply mismanagement and fraudulent claims from fake accounts. CZ has signalled that blockchain infrastructure and trust mechanisms remain core to his vision, stating in a Fortune report , “Proper distribution builds trust, and verification is an essential part of it.” But while CZ is looking ahead, Binance is still tied up in regulatory battles. French authorities have launched a new probe into alleged fraud and money laundering, adding to the exchange’s history of legal troubles. CZ may have stepped away from Binance, but will regulators and the industry let him move on that easily? And as Binance fights for its future, how far will its past pull CZ back in? Let’s try to decode. Binance’s never-ending troubles On Jan. 28, French authorities escalated their investigation into Binance, launching a judicial probe into alleged money laundering, tax fraud, and the provision of unauthorized digital asset services, Reuters reported . The Paris Public Prosecutor’s Office confirmed that the investigation covers Binance’s activities between 2019 and 2024, with a particular focus on money laundering linked to drug trafficking. This marks a key development in a case that began as a preliminary investigation in June 2023, prompted by complaints from users who claimed to have lost money due to misleading information provided by the platform. The allegations now also extend to Binance’s operations in France and across the European Union, where the company is accused of operating without proper regulatory approvals. In response, Binance has denied the allegations, describing them as “several years old.” The company has stated, “Binance fully denies the allegations and will vigorously fight any charges made against it.” Binance further clarified that it has since strengthened its compliance measures, aligning with anti-money laundering and know-your-customer standards, and enhanced employee training programs. This investigation is the latest in a series of legal and regulatory challenges for Binance amid growing scrutiny of cryptocurrency exchanges following the collapse of FTX in 2022. In 2023, U.S. authorities, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice, took legal action against major platforms like Binance and Coinbase, alleging violations of securities laws and other regulatory failures. While Coinbase pushed back against the SEC’s claims, Binance settled with the DOJ in November 2023, agreeing to pay a historic $4.3 billion — marking the largest corporate compliance penalty ever imposed. U.S. prosecutors accused Binance of operating with a “Wild West” approach, allegedly facilitating illicit activities and failing to report over 100,000 suspicious transactions tied to terrorist organizations and other criminal groups. As part of the settlement, CZ stepped down as CEO, with Richard Teng appointed as his replacement. However, the legal troubles did not end there. Binance also faced regulatory action in other regions, including in December 2024, when Australia’s financial regulator sued the company’s local derivatives business, alleging misclassification of retail clients as wholesale investors — thereby denying them essential consumer protections. YZi Labs’ expanding investment portfolio As Binance grapples with mounting legal challenges, CZ is pushing forward with YZi Labs, backing projects that signal a clear break from his past role as an exchange operator. In 2024, YZi Labs (previously Binance Labs) actively expanded its investment portfolio, focusing on emerging technologies. Throughout the year, the firm invested in 46 projects across various sectors, including decentralized finance, AI, gaming, and DeSci. In August 2024, YZi Labs announced investments in two AI-focused companies to support the development of AI-powered decentralized applications. One of these was Sahara AI, a startup that integrates blockchain and AI technologies. Sahara AI enables users to maintain intellectual property rights through on-chain attribution and earn rewards for contributing to the decentralized AI’s infrastructure, knowledge base, and maintenance. The company secured $43 million in a Series A funding round led by Pantera Capital, YZi Labs, and Polychain Capital, with participation from Samsung NEXT and others. Another notable investment was in MyShell, an AI startup that allows users to build and share AI-powered applications, empowering developers to create customizable AI solutions. In November 2024, YZi Labs also ventured into the decentralized science sector by investing in BIO Protocol, an accelerator program focused on capital formation for biotechnologies. BIO Protocol supports a collection of decentralized autonomous organizations committed to developing pharmaceutical drugs and life-saving treatments. But while YZi Labs is expanding in new directions, CZ’s past is never far behind. His financial backing and continued presence in blockchain-related ventures keep him connected to an industry still dealing with the fallout of Binance’s legal troubles. What’s CZ up to? CZ began shaping his next steps even before serving his four-month U.S. prison sentence in March 2024. Just days before reporting in, he tweeted, “Launching a new project. No, no new tokens. Education project. More details soon…” Launching a new project. No, no new tokens. Education project. More details soon… — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) March 18, 2024 The following day, he unveiled Giggle Academy, describing it as a free, gamified, and adaptive learning platform for students in grades 1–12. “No revenue. Gamified. Adaptive,” he wrote, sharing a link to the project’s concept paper and announcing he was hiring a small team to work directly with him. My next project. @GiggleAcademy (No logo yet) Free basic (grade 1-12 ish) education, for all. No revenue. Gamified. Adaptive. Read the Concept Paper at https://t.co/knqmZF0sQ8 We are HIRING. Small team, work directly with CZ. — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) March 19, 2024 In September 2024, after completing his sentence, Zhao returned to social media with a personal update. “gm, the food tastes so good… And what a luxury to be able to have more than one piece of fruit per day!” he shared, offering a throbbing glimpse into his time in prison. gm, the food taste so good… And what a luxury to be able to have more than one piece of fruit per day! I know some of you may have a lot of questions. I won't have all the answers. Let me chill for a bit. Then figure out the next steps. There are always more opportunities in… https://t.co/9hvgp8Bo97 — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) September 29, 2024 In the same post, he outlined his next priorities: “Giggle Academy is going well and will be a big part of my life for the next few years. I will continue to invest in blockchain/decentralized technologies, AI, and biotech. I am a long-term investor who cares about impact, not returns.” The following month, in October 2024, Zhao made his first public appearance at Binance Blockchain Week, where he was greeted with a packed room and a standing ovation. Moderator Austin Arnold opened with, “First question, how was your summer?” Zhao responded candidly, “It’s not good. It’s less fun than now. I think the whole experience is just very limiting in a lot of ways, right? Your freedom is taken away and you have nothing to do, so it gives you a lot of time to reflect.” While he avoided directly criticizing his case, he noted that he was “the first person to go to prison over a Bank Secrecy Act violation,” contrasting his situation with that of large financial institutions where executives faced settlements but not jail time. More importantly, CZ confirmed that he has no plans to run another crypto exchange. In December 2024, CZ announced the launch of the Giggle Academy iOS app, inviting parents with young children aged 2–6 to test it out, further expanding the project’s reach. The @GiggleAcademy iOS app is live now. Test it out if you have young kids in the 2-6 age range. https://t.co/kZRb0DDTP0 https://t.co/ho7NXcavuG — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 18, 2024 Meanwhile, talking about the rise of meme coins, including Donald Trump’s recent launch of his own meme coin Official Trump ( TRUMP ), CZ jokingly tweeted, “No, I currently have no plan to make a meme coin. But I am guessing a few other country leaders might be thinking about it.” No, I currently have no plan to make a meme coin.

Trump Buys SUI (TRUMPSUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys SUI launched with over $29,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Buys SUI by entering its contract address (CA) – 7chY3Yw9cArR4CGQQ2N6mciszZvWB3rW6WoBNTfwyitu – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|SUI|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-29 23:49:00

Each project is based on distinct concepts—Dogecoin continues as the ever-resilient meme coin, while Web3Bay serves as a practical innovator in decentralized e-commerce. These projects exemplify the range of possibilities within the crypto universe. This article delves into the 2025 Dogecoin price prediction and examines how Web3Bay might redefine the use of utility tokens by investors. Dogecoin Price Prediction: Harnessing Meme Popularity Dogecoin continues to impress in the cryptocurrency sphere, surpassing expectations since its start as a humorous venture. Endorsed by celebrities like Elon Musk, Dogecoin has gained significant traction. As of January 2025, its trading price is around $0.35. With the recent inauguration of Donald Trump and his new department initiative, sentiment around Dogecoin has grown positive. Experts are optimistic about Dogecoin’s short-term growth, backed by technical strengths and significant acquisitions by large holders, who have recently bought over 100 million Dogecoin tokens. This reflects a strong belief in its market stability, with some foreseeing a surge to $0.50 soon. In the long term, it might even surpass the $1 mark by year-end, especially if it continues to expand as a payment method. Though Dogecoin started as a meme, its real-world payment utility is increasingly acknowledged. For instance, Tesla now accepts Dogecoin for merchandise purchases, and its use in online donations is growing. However, potential investors should be wary of its price volatility and market mood swings. Web3Bay: Pioneering Decentralized E-Commerce While Dogecoin makes news with its community-driven value surges, Web3Bay introduces a different opportunity—focusing on practicality and foresight. Web3Bay is a blockchain-based e-commerce platform that eliminates traditional market inefficiencies. Unlike Dogecoin, which thrives on community excitement, Web3Bay addresses real issues like high fees, data security, and regional barriers. Currently, in its fourth presale stage, Web3Bay’s token, $3BAY, is priced at $0.004562625, with over $960,000 raised, selling more than 255 million tokens. Early investors could see a return of 6,430% when the token price will be $0.1959, indicating strong market confidence in Web3Bay’s approach. Web3Bay aims to transform e-commerce through NFT markets, staking opportunities, and Layer-2 solutions for efficient transactions. Its future as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) will allow token holders to direct its growth, positioning Web3Bay as a significant player in the digital transaction realm. Web3Bay vs. Dogecoin: Which Crypto Offers Better Long-Term Value? Comparing Dogecoin with Web3Bay is akin to contrasting two entirely different fruits; both have distinct strengths that appeal to varying investor preferences. Dogecoin suits those who thrive on high-risk, high-reward opportunities fueled by community support and market buzz. Conversely, Web3Bay attracts those prioritizing functionality and enduring growth. The 2025 Dogecoin price outlook is optimistic, with experts predicting that its unique charm and robust community backing will propel it to greater heights. Nonetheless, its dependency on factors like celebrity shout-outs and general market moods adds an element of unpredictability. For instance, a single tweet from Elon Musk might boost Dogecoin’s value, whereas a slowdown in regular updates could hinder its progress. Web3Bay presents a more stable investment rationale. Its successful presale and comprehensive strategy indicate that $3BAY is poised for long-term success. The anticipated 6,430% ROI reflects the genuine potential for capturing a significant portion of the e-commerce sector . As more people embrace blockchain, Web3Bay’s pragmatic approach could set a new standard for decentralized marketplaces, appealing especially to those cautious of risk. Dogecoin Price Prediction & How Web3Bay Helps Diversify Portfolios A crucial lesson for investors in 2025 is the significance of diversification. While prospects for Dogecoin look promising, solely depending on a meme coin carries risks. Integrating utility tokens like Web3Bay into an investment portfolio mitigates these risks and introduces exposure to ventures with real-world applications. Imagine a scenario where Dogecoin climbs to $1, offering swift financial benefits. Simultaneously, Web3Bay might rise as a key figure in decentralized e-commerce, providing both capital appreciation and staking benefits for the long haul. This two-pronged strategy allows investors to leverage Dogecoin’s market fluctuations while benefiting from Web3Bay’s consistent expansion. Wrapping Up! Looking towards 2025, both Dogecoin and Web3Bay offer enticing prospects for cryptocurrency enthusiasts. Dogecoin’s potential for significant rallies, driven by community engagement and sentiment, presents an exciting choice for those who can handle swings in the market. Meanwhile, Web3Bay, with its focus on practicality and innovation, stands as a reliable investment promising considerable growth potential. Dogecoin’s forecast for the year is bullish, potentially surpassing the $1 mark. However, its reliance on external influences means it might also experience sharp declines. On the other hand, Web3Bay, backed by a solid plan and presale achievements, promises a different kind of future—one dedicated to addressing real challenges and generating value for its stakeholders. In conclusion, Dogecoin and Web3Bay exemplify the two facets of the cryptocurrency spectrum—hype versus utility, fleeting gains versus sustainable development. For astute investors, the optimal approach might involve incorporating both into their portfolios, balancing risks against possible rewards. Whether you’re an experienced trader or just starting, keeping an eye on these two projects in the coming year is advisable.

XRP news highlights its recent regulatory milestones, with Ripple securing key licenses that could expand adoption, while Ethereum (ETH) price action shows promise, rebounding from challenges with a 3.89% gain this week. These updates have put both projects in the spotlight, attracting interest from traders and crypto enthusiasts alike. However, a less conventional yet exciting development is unfolding with BlockDAG . Partnering with the iconic football club Inter Milan, BlockDAG represents a bold step into merging blockchain technology with legacy sports. This collaboration not only signals blockchain’s growing mainstream acceptance but also showcases how innovative startups and established institutions can create new standards for fan engagement and digital transformation. BlockDAG and Inter Milan: Bridging Tradition and Innovation BlockDAG’s partnership with Inter Milan is a significant step in connecting blockchain technology with legacy sports. Inter Milan, one of the most storied clubs in football history, brings global recognition and a passionate fanbase, while BlockDAG offers cutting-edge solutions for secure and scalable digital transactions. This collaboration highlights blockchain’s growing relevance beyond tech-savvy circles, signaling its potential for widespread adoption. Legacy brands like Inter Milan adopting blockchain reinforce the idea that traditional industries are ready to embrace innovation. By integrating blockchain into their fan engagement strategies, the club is setting an example for others in the sports world. Initiatives like fan tokens, digital collectibles, and NFT-based memberships offer fans tangible value while maintaining transparency and security. BlockDAG is also gaining traction through its highly successful presale. Having raised $185 million so far and selling over 18 billion BDAG coins, the presale reflects significant interest in the project. Currently priced at $0.0248 per BDAG, this represents a 2,380% ROI from its starting price, positioning BlockDAG as one of the top trending crypto projects in 2025. This partnership and presale success have the potential to set a precedent for other sports organizations. Clubs worldwide could adopt similar blockchain-driven models for fan interaction and revenue generation. With BlockDAG’s advanced architecture and Inter Milan’s influence, this partnership could become the blueprint for the intersection of sports and technology. XRP News: Ripple’s Latest Wins and Market Movement XRP news recently spotlighted Ripple’s success in securing Money Transmitter Licenses in New York and Texas. These licenses could significantly boost adoption, as Ripple can now legally offer its services in two of the most stringent regulatory markets in the United States. This development positions XRP for wider usage in cross-border payments and digital asset solutions. On the market front, XRP is trading at $3.15, with a recent intraday low of $2.91. The modest upward movement reflects market confidence following regulatory clarity. Additionally, analysts suggest this could be the start of broader acceptance for XRP as Ripple continues to strengthen its foothold in the U.S. financial landscape. The news surrounding these licenses has also reinforced XRP’s status as one of the top trending cryptos to watch in 2025. Ethereum (ETH) Price Action: Market Trends and Recent Updates Ethereum (ETH) price action has caught attention with a 3.89% increase, bringing its value to $3,191.58. The rise comes as Ethereum stabilizes after recent market fluctuations. Analysts suggest this rebound could be linked to renewed interest in Ethereum’s roadmap for improving scalability and security, with Vitalik Buterin hinting at structural changes to the Ethereum Foundation to address growing competition. Another factor influencing Ethereum (ETH) price action is the pressure from alternative platforms like Solana. With Solana gaining developer traction due to lower transaction costs, Ethereum faces challenges maintaining dominance. However, Ethereum’s versatility in supporting DeFi, NFTs, and Layer 2 solutions continues to provide strong fundamentals. As these updates unfold, Ethereum remains one of the top trending cryptos to watch, reflecting its resilience and potential for sustained growth. Summing Up XRP news highlights key regulatory advancements, with Ripple’s licenses in New York and Texas paving the way for broader adoption. Similarly, Ethereum (ETH) price action shows resilience, with recent gains signaling potential recovery despite mounting competition from other blockchains. Both projects maintain their status as top trending crypto assets to watch this year. Amid these updates, BlockDAG takes a unique path with its collaboration with Inter Milan. This partnership merges a legacy sports brand with cutting-edge blockchain technology, demonstrating how blockchain can enhance fan engagement and digital interactions. BlockDAG’s approach sets a precedent for industries exploring blockchain’s transformative potential.

Investors saw their hopes crash as three of the biggest tech giants struggled on multiple fronts—electric vehicles, digital advertising, and cloud computing. Shares of all three companies saw immediate hits in extended trading. Let’s break down the chaos, who got hurt, and why it’s making headlines everywhere. Tesla warns of higher production costs Tesla missed expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings, reporting 73 cents per share compared to Wall Street’s expected 75 cents, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG. Revenue came in at $25.71 billion, much lower than the anticipated $27.27 billion. The stock took a 3.4% dive in after-hours trading at 4:14 p.m. in New York, proving investor frustration with the electric vehicle giant’s performance. Tesla told investors its goal to build more affordable cars remains on track, with production for new models starting in the first half of 2025. The Cybercab, Tesla’s latest project, is also expected to roll out by 2026. But here’s the thing, Tesla admitted it won’t be cutting production costs as much as previously planned. Instead, the company will rely on a combination of its current production methods and a next-gen platform to ramp up volumes during what it called “uncertain times.” Analysts didn’t love that message. The mix of slower cost reductions and missed revenue left Wall Street skittish. Still, Tesla’s loyal fan base came through, pushing the stock up 2% in later after-hours trading. Meta struggles to meet growth expectations Meta Platforms, the company behind Facebook and Instagram, projected a weaker-than-expected sales outlook for the first quarter of 2025, ranging between $39.5 billion and $41.8 billion. The midpoint of that forecast, $40.65 billion, came in below the $41.7 billion analysts had predicted, according to Bloomberg. Shares rose 5% in after-hours trading, but that optimism wasn’t about the future, it was about Meta narrowly beating its fourth-quarter numbers. For the last quarter of 2024, Meta posted $48.39 billion in revenue and $8.02 in earnings per share, outperforming Wall Street’s expected $47.04 billion in revenue and $6.77 per share in earnings. Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse ambitions and AI investments continue to weigh heavily on Meta’s balance sheet, and the company isn’t generating ad revenue fast enough to offset those costs. And the company got hit with more drama. According to a Wall Street Journal report, President Donald Trump signed settlement papers that require the company to cough up $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit. Microsoft investors lose patience with AI rollout Microsoft Corp. disappointed investors when it reported slower growth in its Azure cloud computing business. The division posted a 31% revenue gain during the quarter, a drop from the 34% growth it recorded the previous quarter. Analysts had projected a 32% gain, and Microsoft’s miss triggered a 4% drop in its stock during after-hours trading. Total revenue for the company hit $69.6 billion, with profit coming in at $3.23 per share. Both figures surpassed Wall Street’s estimates of $68.9 billion and $3.12 per share, but the Azure slowdown was enough to overshadow the overall positive results. Microsoft has been pouring billions into AI, banking on its close relationship with OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT. Over the last year, the company has launched many AI-powered products under the Copilot brand. But the returns have been slow, and investors aren’t thrilled. Meanwhile, AI king Nvidia saw a slight recovery, gaining 1% after a brutal 17% drop earlier in the week. The stock had been rattled after Chinese AI startup DeepSeek sparked concerns about US dominance in AI tech.

While Ethereum (ETH) continues to dominate the DeFi space and Ripple (XRP) solidifies its position in cross-border payments, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has proven to be the standout investment. With $1 million raised in minutes during its presale, it has cemented its position as the ultimate opportunity of 2025. Why THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN Is the Next Big Opportunity 1. Exceptional Market Demand In its presale, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN raised over $1 million almost instantly. This level of investor enthusiasm reflects the token’s high growth potential and positions it as the next major crypto to watch. 2. Deflationary Tokenomics With a capped supply of 100 billion tokens, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN creates scarcity that directly drives value. Its deflationary model offers early investors significant advantages, surpassing the gradual inflationary nature of tokens like APT and INJ. 3. Exclusive Availability Unlike BTC and ETH, which are traded on virtually every platform, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is exclusively available at OFFICIALMAGACOIN . This exclusivity creates a controlled market environment, driving demand and making it an excellent choice for early adopters. How It Compares to Other Top Cryptos Bitcoin (BTC): Bitcoin may have hit $100K, but its market is mature, making THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN a stronger choice for exponential returns. Ethereum (ETH): A leader in smart contracts, ETH offers stability, but it lacks the exclusivity and early-stage growth of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Aptos (APT): Aptos focuses on scalability but hasn’t captured the same market excitement as this token. Injective Protocol (INJ): INJ excels in DeFi but cannot compete with the overwhelming momentum of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN . Seize the Opportunity Now Bitcoin’s success paved the way for standout cryptos like THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN to dominate the market. With limited supply, overwhelming demand, and exclusive availability, it’s the ultimate choice for investors seeking the next big win.

Whether it’s a bullish breakout, a legendary presale, or a dip-buying opportunity that has investors lining up to snatch the next big thing, there’s never a dull moment in the meme coin space. And speaking of opportunities, BTFD Coin is turning heads with its scorching-hot presale, while Popcat and Brett are making waves on their respective chains. BTFD Coin’s presale just hit an eye-watering $5.78 million, and the Bulls Squad is charging full speed ahead. But what makes this stage of the presale exciting? The team has burned unsold tokens from Stage 13 and skipped straight to Stage 14, making way for a massive opportunity. And here’s where it gets even wilder: the LAUNCH100 promo code is here, giving investors a 100% token bonus. That’s right—every dollar you spend gets you double the $BTFD. But what’s even more bullish? BTFD Coin’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game could change the way meme coins operate forever. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Powering Up P2E Gaming BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme token—it’s a movement. The Bulls Squad (Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull) is leading a revolution, and with the staking system, token burns, and a high-energy P2E game, the potential is massive. The game integrates BTFD tokens directly, meaning players can grind, level up, and earn real crypto rewards. The more you play, the more you earn. Now, suppose you invest $1,000 in BTFD Coin today at its Stage 14 price of $0.00016 per token. That gets you 6,250,000 $BTFD tokens. But with the LAUNCH100 bonus code, that amount doubles to 12,500,000 tokens—absolutely insane. If $BTFD hits $0.0006, your investment would be worth $7,500. But if it climbs to $0.006, your initial $1,000 would skyrocket to $75,000. With staking rewards offering a juicy 90% APY , that’s an extra layer of gains on top. Aside from gaming, BTFD Coin’s roadmap is packed. With a locked liquidity pool, low presale allocation, and aggressive marketing, the Bulls are playing for keeps. Now’s the moment to BTFD or get left behind. How to Claim the LAUNCH100 Bonus Code Right Now Want to double your BTFD Coins? Follow these steps: Go to the presale page first. Click “Connect Wallet” and select MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or your preferred wallet. In the bonus code field, type LAUNCH100 (in all caps) and click “Apply.” Confirm the message in your wallet. Input how much $BTFD you want to buy. Click “Buy Now” and confirm the transaction. Act fast—this 100% bonus is a limited-time deal! Popcat: A Meme Coin with a Legendary Comeback Play Popcat isn’t just an internet meme—it’s a cultural icon. And as a Solana-based token, it’s benefiting from low fees and lightning-fast transactions. Despite dropping 5.06% in the last 24 hours, the current price of $0.3735 could be an elite dip-buying opportunity for those looking to stack up on a trending meme coin. With a market cap of $366 million and a circulating supply of nearly 980 million tokens, Popcat has a strong community and a real shot at reclaiming its bullish momentum. As Solana continues to explode in popularity, expect Popcat to ride that wave. If meme coin season keeps heating up, Popcat could be one of the top new meme coins to buy today. Brett: Base Chain’s Meme King Brett is the mascot of Base Chain, which is rapidly expanding with new projects, developers, and growing liquidity. With a market cap of $793 million and over 9.9 billion coins in circulation, Brett is solidifying itself as one of the leading meme coins in 2025. At a current price of $0.0801, Brett presents an opportunity for those who believe in the long-term success of Base Chain’s ecosystem. As Base Chain grows, so does Brett’s influence. It’s easy to see why this token is grabbing attention and making its way onto the list of top new meme coins to buy today. Conclusion: BTFD or Regret Later BTFD Coin is in Stage 14, the presale tally has soared past $5.78 million, and the token supply is shrinking thanks to a massive burn event. With the LAUNCH100 bonus, there’s no better time to get in. Popcat and Brett also have strong cases, with major ecosystems backing them, but BTFD’s gaming ecosystem and insane token bonus offer unmatched upside. The Bulls are charging—are you in?

However, breaking through the persistent $4,000 resistance level remains a key hurdle for the cryptocurrency, before it goes on to create new highs. Ethereum On The Brink Of A Massive Rally? While frustration may be getting the better of ETH holders due to the digital asset’s below par price performance over the past two years, there could still be a chance to witness a complete turnaround in ETH’s price trajectory. Related Reading: Ethereum Foundation Sells Another 100 ETH, But There’s Still ‘Hopium’ For Holders In a post on X, Titan of Crypto shared the following ETH weekly chart, illustrating how the digital asset has been consistently forming higher lows since 2022. If ETH maintains this trend, it could soon break through the crucial $4,000 level and potentially set new all-time highs (ATH) later this year. The analyst also applied Fibonacci extensions to estimate potential price targets, with the most optimistic projections reaching as high as $13,000 in 2026. Crypto trader Ted shared a similar outlook on ETH’s price action. According to Ted, once ETH reclaims the $4,000 mark, it could soon surpass its previous ATH. He further predicted that ETH could surge to $9,000 within 3 to 4 months. Additionally, he noted that US President Donald Trump’s recent ETH purchases could provide further upside momentum for the digital asset. Indeed, Trump’s decentralized finance (DeFi) project dubbed World Liberty Financial (WLF) has been on an ETH buying spree. In December 2024, WLF bought 722 ETH, worth $2.5 million at the prevailing market price. Technical analysis trader Alex Clay also sees ETH’s current downtrend as a potential buying opportunity. Clay highlighted that ETH has not only completed its falling wedge pattern but also successfully defended the $3,000 support level. He added: Time to reverse the short-term trend! Send $ETH to $4,000, $4,500, $5,000. ETH: An Overcrowded Trade? While the above analyses may offer hope to ETH traders, seasoned crypto analyst Ali Martinez cautions that the bullish head-and-shoulder pattern on ETH’s daily chart could be turning into an overcrowded trade. He added: If the pattern holds, any dip to $2,900 could be a buying opportunity, but keep your stop-loss tight between $2,700 and $2,500. Related Reading: Ethereum Struggles As Bitcoin Dominance Pushes ETH/BTC Pair To 4-Year Low That said, crypto analyst Mister Crypto recently remarked that Ethereum has “likely bottomed out” and could be on the verge of a breakout to the upside.

As of January 27, 2025, Cronos (CRO), a dynamic layer one blockchain backed by Crypto.com, has experienced a significant dip, dropping over 35% since early December to trade around $0.128. Despite this downturn, technical indicators suggest potential bullish trends on the horizon, making it a focal point for investors eyeing the top crypto coins to buy now. Similarly, Stellar (XLM) has showcased impressive growth. Since January 2024, its price has surged by over 300%, with a notable 16% increase in the past week alone. Trading at $0.473 as of January 15, 2025, Stellar continues to be a strong contender among the top crypto coins to buy now, especially for those interested in facilitating global transactions. Enter Qubetics ($TICS ), a groundbreaking player in the crypto space. Positioning itself as the world’s first Layer-1, EVM-compatible, aggregated multichain blockchain, Qubetics aims to tackle real-world challenges that its predecessors have struggled with. By enhancing scalability, security, and interoperability, Qubetics is not just keeping up but is poised to lead the future of blockchain and digital finance. Qubetics: Revolutionizing Digital Finance Qubetics isn’t just another name in the crypto world; it’s a game-changer. As the first Layer-1, EVM-compatible, aggregated multichain blockchain, Qubetics is setting new standards in the industry. But what does that mean for you? Imagine a platform where multiple blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana work together seamlessly. That’s Qubetics for you. This integration isn’t just a tech marvel; it’s a practical solution for businesses, professionals, and individuals. For instance, a freelancer working with clients across different platforms can manage payments effortlessly without juggling multiple wallets. Or consider a business aiming to streamline transactions across various blockchain networks; Qubetics makes it possible with ease. Now, let’s talk about the Qubetics presale. Currently in its 19th stage, it has already sold over 450 million tokens to more than 17,100 holders, raising upwards of $11.3 million. At this stage, anyone can purchase $TICS tokens at $0.0606. Analysts are buzzing with excitement, predicting that $TICS could reach $0.25 by the presale’s end, offering a 312% return on investment. And that’s just the beginning. Post-presale projections suggest $TICS could soar to $1, marking a staggering 1,548% ROI. Looking further ahead, some forecasts even see $TICS hitting $10 to $15 after the mainnet launch, translating to an eye-popping 16,387% to 24,630% ROI. It’s no wonder that Qubetics is topping the list of top crypto coins to buy now. Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multichain Wallet: A Game Changer One of Qubetics’ standout features is its non-custodial multichain wallet . But what makes it so special? In simple terms, a non-custodial wallet means you’re in full control. Unlike custodial wallets, where a third party holds your private keys, non-custodial wallets ensure that only you have access to your funds. This setup offers enhanced security and peace of mind. Now, add multichain capabilities to the mix. This means the Qubetics wallet supports multiple blockchains, allowing you to manage various cryptocurrencies all in one place. No more hopping between different wallets or platforms. Whether you’re dealing with Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other major cryptocurrency, Qubetics has got you covered. Consider this scenario: You’re a business owner who accepts payments in multiple cryptocurrencies. With traditional wallets, you’d need to manage each currency separately, which can be a logistical nightmare. But with Qubetics’ multichain wallet, all your assets are accessible under one roof, simplifying transactions and accounting. Or think about an individual investor looking to diversify their crypto portfolio. Instead of juggling multiple wallets and remembering countless passwords, you can use the Qubetics wallet to manage all your investments seamlessly. It’s convenience and security rolled into one. Qubetics Partners with 1inch: Enhancing the Trading Experience In a move to further elevate the user experience, Qubetics has integrated with the 1inch Network, a leading DeFi aggregator. This partnership is a big deal. The 1inch Network connects users to hundreds of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), ensuring optimized trades, unmatched liquidity, and the best possible rates. For Qubetics wallet users, this means access to trades across numerous DEXs, optimized pricing through 1inch’s advanced aggregation technology, and a seamless, efficient trading experience suitable for both newbies and seasoned traders. With this integration, the Qubetics wallet isn’t just a place to store your crypto; it’s a gateway to the decentralized future. It combines intuitive usability with exceptional performance, redefining the trading experience for DeFi enthusiasts worldwide. Cronos: Powering the Next Wave of DeFi Cronos (CRO), backed by Crypto.com, has been a powerhouse in the DeFi space. Although its price took a hit recently—dropping over 35% since early December—its underlying fundamentals remain strong. As of January 27, 2025, CRO is trading at $0.128, a potential buying opportunity for those looking at the top crypto coins to buy now. Cronos has been forming a rising channel since late 2023, and in the daily timeframe, it’s developing a falling wedge pattern, which often signals a bullish reversal. For those who know their technical analysis, this could mean CRO is gearing up for a major breakout. But let’s talk about what makes Cronos unique. Unlike many blockchains that struggle with high fees and slow transactions, Cronos offers lightning-fast processing speeds and low costs, making it an ideal choice for developers and users alike. The blockchain is deeply integrated with the Crypto.com exchange, further solidifying its position in the crypto space. Beyond its technical aspects, Cronos is making waves in the regulatory landscape. Crypto.com executives have been working closely with Donald Trump’s crypto team to shape digital asset regulations. This could have long-term positive implications, as clearer regulations often lead to wider adoption and increased investor confidence. Moreover, Cronos’ DeFi ecosystem is thriving, with over $479 million locked in smart contracts and a stablecoin market cap exceeding $18 million. Whether you’re into staking, lending, or yield farming, CRO provides an array of opportunities to generate passive income. For those seeking undervalued projects with solid fundamentals, Cronos remains a top contender among the top crypto coins to buy now. Its current dip might just be the perfect entry point before the next rally. Stellar: The Future of Global Transactions Stellar (XLM) has been on an absolute tear, surging over 300% since January 2024. As of January 15, 2025, it’s trading at $0.473, nearly half of its all-time high of $0.938. With its mission to make financial services accessible to everyone, Stellar remains a top crypto coin to buy now, especially for those interested in cross-border payments. Stellar is more than just a blockchain—it’s a lifeline for the unbanked. Founded by Jed McCaleb and the Stellar Development Foundation, the network is designed to facilitate instant, low-cost global transactions. Whether you’re sending money to family overseas or handling international business payments, Stellar makes it seamless and affordable. Unlike traditional banking systems, which can take days to process transactions and charge hefty fees, Stellar’s network completes transactions in seconds. It’s already being used by major financial institutions and governments looking to modernize their payment infrastructure. But what’s got investors excited is Stellar’s long-term potential. With the increasing demand for fast, cost-efficient cross-border payments, Stellar is positioned to be a major player in the global financial system. Many investors are accumulating XLM now, betting on its continued adoption. As one of the most promising digital assets, Stellar remains a top crypto coin to buy now for those looking at long-term gains. XLM’s price is expected to increase by 62%, potentially reaching $0.7366 by February 13, 2025. However, short-term projections for next week indicate the price could hover between $0.4718 and $0.42. If the price meets the lower estimate, a 10.87% drop is expected, bringing it to $0.42 by January 26, 2025. As of January 15, 2025, the overall sentiment for Stellar remains bullish, with 27 technical analysis indicators signaling bullish trends and only 2 showing bearish signals. This strong momentum further supports the case for XLM as a top cryptocurrency investment in 2025. Why Non-Custodial Multichain Wallets Are the Future If you’ve been in crypto long enough, you know the risks of centralized wallets. Exchange hacks, government crackdowns, and frozen accounts—it’s happened too many times to count. That’s why non-custodial multichain wallets, like the one Qubetics offers, are becoming the gold standard. With a non-custodial wallet, you hold your private keys, meaning you’re the sole owner of your assets. There’s no middleman, no third-party risk, just pure control over your crypto. Multichain functionality takes things a step further. Instead of juggling multiple wallets for different blockchains, you get a single interface to manage everything. Whether you’re dealing with Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, or Solana, a multichain wallet allows seamless interaction across ecosystems. For traders, this means faster transactions, lower fees, and more liquidity. For everyday users, it simplifies crypto management, making it easier to spend, save, and invest. And for businesses, it’s a game-changer—streamlining operations and reducing transaction costs. With the increasing adoption of DeFi and cross-chain interoperability, non-custodial multichain wallets aren’t just a trend; they’re the future of blockchain technology. Final Thoughts: The Best Time to Invest Is Now With Qubetics pioneering multichain interoperability, Cronos strengthening its DeFi foothold, and Stellar revolutionizing global payments, it’s clear that these three projects are among the top crypto coins to buy now. Each brings something unique to the table, whether it’s scalability, security, or real-world utility. And if you’re looking for an opportunity that could deliver massive returns, the Qubetics presale is where you want to be. With $TICS currently priced at $0.0606 and analysts predicting a surge to $10-$15 post-mainnet launch, the potential ROI is staggering. But as with any investment, timing is everything. The crypto market moves fast, and opportunities like these don’t last forever. If you’re serious about securing your spot in the next wave of blockchain innovation, now’s the time to take action. Don’t just watch from the sidelines—get in on the action and make your move today!

Cronje claims on the social media platform X that Sonic, formerly known as Fantom, is the “only actual decentralized stage 3 L2.” “No fee extraction, all submits 100% to ETH, no ‘centralized value extraction’. Decentralized sequencing. Decentralized bridges. While the rest of the L2s continue to fake pretend to ‘decentralize’ (why would they when they get millions of fees per year?), we already did it. Scaled transactions per second to 16,000+ on the L1. Decreased storage by 98% even on archival nodes. Scaled L1 and jumped to the ‘golden standard’ of L2. Not even mentioning FeeM, FeeSub, and Dynamic Fees.” A South Korean computer scientist launched Fantom (FTM) in 2018. The project aimed to serve as a tool to aggregate smart contracts into decentralized applications (dApps). Last year, the development team behind the blockchain announced a rebrand to Sonic as a way to improve transaction efficiency. Investors can trade in their FTM tokens at a 1:1 rate for S tokens, which will have multiple functions within the Sonic ecosystem. S is trading at $0.453 at time of writing. The 85th-ranked crypto asset by market cap is down nearly 8.5% in the past 24 hours.

The Ethereum price has shown price instability and low returns, leaving investors questioning its potential. Meanwhile, WallitIQ (WLTQ) is breaking through with unstoppable momentum as investors and whales rush to purchase its presale tokens, eager to cash in on massive profits. Experts forecast a 1000x value surge , with million-dollar stakes betting it could flip their portfolios into generational fortunes. WallitIQ (WLTQ) Is Gaining Traction With 1000x Gains And Whale Interest in Its Presale WallitIQ (WLTQ) is quickly gaining traction as one of the most popular new wallets in the cryptocurrency market. Investors and whales are flocking to its presale as analysts predict a 1000x increase in value within weeks. With nearly $6.5 million already raised, the presale could hit $7 million before the month ends. The WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale token is off to a promising start in 2025, with ambitious goals to outshine the Ethereum price gains this Q1. Its rising presale demand has drawn whales’ attention, moving it closer to selling out completely. Analysts believe it could rank among the top-performing presale this quarter, leaving popular coins like Ethereum (ETH) behind. Missing out on its wallet means making your trading less efficient and more vulnerable to market challenges like low security and increased risks. Advanced security features like biometric and facial authentication offer a smooth physical-to-digital wallet experience, automated transactions , optimal liquidity, 180% APY, governance rights, and referral bonuses . The WallitIQ (WLTQ) wallet empowers new and experienced investors to make smarter investment decisions while gaining expert-level insights into crypto market activities. It recently unveiled its crypto wallet mobile app, offering customizable alerts, instant payments via a QR code scanner , and an AI-powered interface for smooth portfolio tracking and management. While the WallitIQ (WLTQ) presale price is currently $0.042 , experts predict its value could surge to $3 by Q2 2025. Already listed on CoinMarketCap , the presale token’s 1000x potential has drawn significant whale interest, with its price expected to skyrocket further upon listing on major centralized exchanges. Ethereum Price Struggles Lead Whales To Shift Focus Towards WallitIQ (WLTQ) The market report on Ethereum price shows a 5.85% gain in the daily chart but a 3% decline over the past week. This fluctuation has left whales reconsidering their strategies to start 2025 with stable investments. With the Ethereum price instability, many whales have turned to its rival, whose presale is positioned to deliver steady 1,000% gains. The decline in Ethereum price has continued on its monthly chart, sliding 4% from its $3,500 high to a current value of $3,398. Its rival, WallitIQ (WLTQ), has emerged as a standout choice, reporting impressive stability and unparalleled adoption rates in its presale. Whales Are Moving To WallitIQ (WLTQ) Presale For 1000x ROI With the Ethereum price movement showing volatility, many investors seek more stable opportunities to maximize returns this Q1 2025. As the Ethereum price trends discourage further investment, attention is shifting to WallitIQ (WLTQ), which performs impressively in presale and promises 1000x stable gains. WallitIQ (WLTQ) users have praised its impressive wallet features, including liquidity options, referral bonuses, and high-yield rewards from utility token staking. The wallet makes payments quicker with modern methods like its Scan & QR system. It also incorporates artificial intelligence and machine learning, with its smart contract audited by SolidProof. Whales have recognized the potential of WallitIQ (WLTQ), moving away from Ethereum (ETH) to stake in it, showing that they value future growth over current popularity. You can join the ranks of future millionaires by investing in its stable presale with massive potential. To capitalize on a potential 1000x gain, buy its affordable presale tokens at $0.042 before the price rises to $0.062 in the next stage.

While Cardano and XRP have long been major players, experts argue that RCOF presents a safer and more lucrative investment opportunity, potentially delivering a staggering 50,000% ROI. But what makes RCO Finance stand out from giants like XRP and Cardano? Let’s dive in. XRP vs. Cardano vs. RCO Finance: The Emerging Power Shift XRP and Cardano have solidified their presence in the market, each offering unique blockchain capabilities. However, recent developments have highlighted their challenges. XRP continues to grapple with regulatory hurdles, while Cardano has faced network upgrades and adoption delays. In contrast, RCO Finance is gaining momentum due to its innovative AI-driven approach to decentralized finance (DeFi). The project has already raised over $12 million in its presale, attracting investors looking for a safer, high-growth opportunity in the evolving crypto landscape. With the price currently at $0.10 in its fifth presale stage, investors are eager to lock in their positions before it rises to $0.13 in the next round. Experience RCO Finance’s Beta Platform Firsthand The beta version of RCO Finance is now live, offering early access to its advanced AI-driven tools before the full launch. Users can experience firsthand how the powerful AI-powered Robo Advisor and asset tokenization features function in real market conditions. The beta platform continuously evolves, with enhancements to refine performance and integrate new features. As one of the few projects providing a beta version during its presale, RCOF sets itself apart by allowing investors to test and familiarize themselves with its cutting-edge DeFi solutions early on. RCO Finance’s AI-Powered Edge Over XRP and Cardano in the Market Unlike traditional investment platforms that provide one-size-fits-all solutions, RCO Finance’s Robo Advisor delivers fully customized strategies tailored to each investor’s goals and risk tolerance. The AI engine continuously processes market data, optimizing portfolios based on shifting trends to benefit seasoned and novice investors. Imagine receiving early alerts on promising tokens before they explode, like $MELANIA , which quickly surpassed $10.1 billion in market capitalization after its launch, outpacing its predecessor, $TRUMP. Without sophisticated AI-driven tools, many traders miss out on these monumental gains, losing the opportunity to maximize their portfolios. With RCO Finance’s Robo Advisor, investors receive real-time insights and early alerts, allowing them to position themselves ahead of the market and capture such rapid surges early on. The Robo Advisor also prevents traders from incurring losses in the market. For example, Nvidia lost over 16% of its market value in the past 24 hours, wiping out $560 billion of investors’ funds, the highest in United States history. With the Robo Advisor, you will be notified before such a ‘bloodbath’ to exit your position on the asset. RCOF is advancing the future of AI-powered trading with cutting-edge monitoring features for its Robo Advisor. These features are currently in the alpha phase and undergoing internal testing to help the team consistently improve the Robo Advisor’s performance, ensuring it delivers optimal service to users at all times. Cardano and XRP have made strides in blockchain applications, but RCOF takes innovation further by integrating real-world asset tokenization. RCO Finance allows investors to enter traditionally illiquid markets by converting tangible assets like real estate and commodities into blockchain-based tokens. The tokenization approach enables fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy portions of high-value assets without requiring huge capital commitment. RCO Finance offers a KYC-free ecosystem, ensuring privacy and anonymity for its users. This frictionless onboarding process makes DeFi more accessible to global investors who value financial privacy. Users can seamlessly enter the crypto market without cumbersome and intrusive identity verification, RCOF allows access to 120,000+ assets across 12,500 categories, including cryptocurrencies, tokenized stocks, and ETFs. Investors can build diversified portfolios that balance risk across multiple asset classes. This extensive selection ensures that traders never run out of lucrative opportunities. RCO Finance offers up to 1000x leverage for traders looking to amplify their gains. Investors can engage in leveraged trading across multiple asset classes, maximizing their capital efficiency. The ability to trade with 10x, 50x, or even 100x leverage positions RCOF as one of the most powerful tools in the financial market. Additionally, RCOF token holders enjoy discounted trading fees, incentivizing long-term engagement and ensuring users extract the most value from the platform. The platform’s tier-based reward system further enhances profitability for committed investors. With over 10,000 users already engaging with the platform, the rapidly growing community reflects the trust and confidence in RCOF’s AI-driven approach to DeFi trading. This momentum is a key reason why analysts, including Dogecoin (DOGE) experts, have predicted RCOF to experience a significant surge. Explore the beta platform and be part of the future of AI-powered investing. 50,000% Presale: Your Golden Ticket to Massive Gains With RCO Finance’s presale price at $0.10, investors are rushing to secure tokens before the price increases to $0.13 in the next stage. The project has already raised over $12 million, and analysts predict a surge past $10 per token post-launch, giving early investors a realistic chance at 50,000% returns. Adding to the excitement, RCOF runs an exclusive 30% bonus for early adopters using the code RCOF30, further amplifying potential gains. Moreover, a $100,000 giveaway is on the horizon and will likely launch once the platform hits its $250,000 milestone, making it even more rewarding for early investors. For traders looking to expand their portfolios, RCOF tokens also offer leverage up to 1000x, allowing for exponential portfolio growth beyond what XRP or Cardano currently provides. RCOF is backed by the $450 billion DeFi market and has also undergone a comprehensive audit by SolidProof to ensure its security as an investment. With security, innovation, and AI-driven market insights, RCO Finance is becoming the next big thing in crypto. Join the presale now to capitalize on this potentially life-changing opportunity.

Traders snapped back to riskier assets after five straight days of losses. The surge puts Bitcoin just $4,000 shy of its all-time high, which it hit last week on ‘crypto president’ Donald Trump’s first day in office. The sudden price hike came as markets tried to shake off the chaos caused by a Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, which had sent stocks and crypto spiraling. Bitcoin has been moving more in step with stock markets in recent weeks. The correlation tightened after inflation worries pushed both Wall Street and crypto into a risk-off mood earlier this month. Stephane Ouellette, CEO of FRNT Financial Inc., said Bitcoin’s bounce wasn’t just about the Fed’s announcement. “Rather than a direct response to today’s Fed announcement, we view the move as more related to recovering from the nonsensical sell-off earlier in the week and putting the Fed announcement behind us,” he explained. For traders, the Fed’s pause gave markets the breather they needed. Powell’s crypto remarks turn heads At the press conference that happened after the Federal Open Market Committee meeting today, Powell made a pro-crypto comment, or at least the closest thing to it. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they can understand and service the risks,” Powell said , which is a huge change in attitude from the Biden era’s hardline approach. Under Biden, crypto businesses struggled to maintain relationships with banks, often being dropped for reasons shrouded in secrecy. Now, Powell is telling banks that they don’t need to shut out crypto, as long as their operations are “safe and sound.” The comment is also a huge departure from the debanking drama of recent years, where major institutions cut off access to financial services for crypto companies. Powell addressed the issue head-on, saying: “We certainly don’t want to take actions that would cause banks to terminate customers who are perfectly legal just because of excess risk aversion.” Senate hearing to investigate debanking On February 5, the U.S. Senate Banking Committee will hold a hearing to investigate debanking practices targeting the crypto industry. Republicans on the committee have confirmed three witnesses: Nathan McCauley, CEO of Anchorage Digital; Evan Hafer, founder of Black Rifle Coffee; and Stephen Gannon, a partner at DWT Law. Their testimonies are expected to pull back the curtain on specifically how and why banks were severing ties with crypto businesses. Hafer, known for running a conservative-owned business, has also faced account closures. The committee’s investigation seeks to determine if banks are selectively cutting off clients for political or regulatory reasons. And the banks have gone into full-on damage control mode. Bank of America told Fox Business, “We never close accounts for political reasons. We are required to follow strict government rules and regulations, which sometimes lead to decisions to exit certain relationships.” JPMorgan took a similar line, saying, “We follow the law. Full stop. Political bias has no place in our policies.” Still, those reassurances aren’t sitting well with crypto insiders. Many have long accused Wall Street of playing favorites, cutting off access to crypto businesses to protect their dominance. Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan’s CEO, weighed in on the issue during his company’s podcast, The Unshakeables . He admitted that banks are often forced to shut accounts but can’t legally disclose the reasons to their clients, saying: “We should be allowed to tell clients why. There should be far clearer rules about what we have to do and what we don’t have to do.” Last week, Donald Trump blasted Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan in a speech at the World Economic Forum. The president accused Bank of America and JPMorgan of locking out conservative businesses. “They don’t take conservative business,” Trump said. “I don’t know if the regulators forced that because of Biden or what, but you and Jamie and everybody—I hope you open your banks to conservatives because what you’re doing is wrong.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Are You Making These Web3 Resume Mistakes? - Find Out Here",News,EN,0,0,BTC|REGULATION|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-30 01:07:37

Musk Buys Solana (MUSKSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Buys Solana by entering its contract address (CA) – HZgXdFhQK1KTn8wM6hfRPtyGuKskETTzWM31qAdXJVRV – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|DOGE|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-30 01:20:00

The rule permits companies to value digital assets at market prices each quarter. According to Arkham Intelligence data , the electric vehicle maker holds 11,509 BTC, estimated at $1.19 billion based on current market prices. Tesla reports a $600 million Bitcoin gain under new accounting rules. The automotive company did not disclose its Bitcoin holdings in its Q4 2024 report . Instead, it disclosed a $600 million mark-to-market gain on “digital assets.” Still, according to Bitcoin Treasuries, Tesla holds 9,720 BTC, making it the sixth-largest publicly traded company with Bitcoin on its balance sheet. This gain stems from an accounting adjustment under new reporting rules, which increased Tesla’s reported digital asset value to $1.076 billion, up from the previously impaired value of $184 million recorded under older accounting methods. In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board introduced a new rule update, requiring companies to report digital assets at their fair market value and not at the lowest price for which they have been recorded since they were purchased. Tesla adopted the rule early before the 2025 deadline, which is a requirement for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Previously, Tesla could only report losses if Bitcoin’s price declined but was not allowed to record gains unless the asset was sold. Under the new standard, companies must recalculate the value of their crypto holdings from the market every quarter, as they do with other financial assets like stocks. Tesla reports a 23% drop in operating profit despite rising sales and Bitcoin revaluation gains. Tesla’s profit during the last three months of 2024 was $2.3 billion. This was a decline compared with $7.9 billion a year earlier, but 2023’s profit included a one-time tax benefit of $5.9 billion. Tesla’s operating profit, excluding that special gain, fell 23% in the year’s final three months. Conversely, sales rose 2% to $25.7 billion in the fourth quarter from $25.2 billion in the same period in 2023. The company missed Wall Street’s estimate of $0.78 for adjusted earnings per share; It reported $0.73. However, investors are happy with the Bitcoin revaluation, and Tesla shares are up 4.3% in after-hours trading at $406.25. According to Google Finance data , this followed a 2.25% decline in regular trading, bringing Tesla’s stock price to $389.10. With 11,509 BTC, Tesla continues to be one of the largest publicly traded Bitcoin holders. Some investors seem to be hopeful that Musk’s close ties with President Trump will benefit Tesla, such as by helping to remove regulatory obstacles for self-driving vehicles. However, Trump and the Republicans in Congress have vowed to eliminate tax credits and other incentives for electric vehicles, including Tesla. Tesla’s CEO has stated that the removal of these incentives would impact rivals more than Tesla. Other firms with crypto exposure, including MicroStrategy and Coinbase, may also see their reported asset values increase under the new accounting rule this year.

The token swam against the current as most of the top memecoins recorded red numbers, leading analysts to suggest a possible breakout for the token. Related Reading: Bitcoin Preparing For A February Rally? Analyst Says New High Is Two Weeks Away Las Vegas Sphere About To Be WIF Hat Dogwifhat has recovered from yesterday’s drop below the $1 mark following its team’s tease of the long-awaited Las Vegas Sphere project. On Tuesday night, the official Dogwifhat X account shared a picture of its mascot in Las Vegas. The image included the cute dog with the Las Vegas Sphere as its hat and an old Nokia phone with “01.2025” on its screen. Additionally, the account stated that the “hat stays on,” explaining that dates will be shared “as soon as we are allowed.” The bullish tease propelled the token back to its recently lost support of $1.30 and reignited the broader community’s interest in the memecoin. WIF became the memecoin sensation of 2024, reaching an all-time high of $4.88 last March. The token also led the memecoin narrative during Q2 and recovered some of its early glory during the December pump. However, WIF’s spotlight was eclipsed by the oversaturated memecoin sector and the rise of many other market sensations like PNUT and CHILL, dropping 40% in the last six months and 75% from its ATH. During its 2,000% growth phase, many crypto investors put their hats on, which prompted a massive fundraising campaign to display the memecoin in the Las Vegas Sphere, the world’s largest LED screen, for a week. The community raised $700,000 to achieve this dream but was left in the dark over the last several months. In July 2024, many investors expressed concern and frustration about the project after Crypto.com displayed Bitcoin’s logo on the Sphere. Some community members questioned the project, calling the initiative an alleged scam. However, the organizer repeatedly assured the WIF community that they were working to make “wif on Sphere” happen soon. Is the Dogwifhat Bottom In? Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa shared his outlook on WIF’s recent performance. He suggested that the pump doesn’t seem “actually real/sustainable” based on the “overall chart/market conditions.” However, he considers that if Dogwifhat shows some consolidation above the $1.23 mark, it could see another leg up. Meanwhile, crypto trader Bluntz stated that its current levels could potentially be WIF’s bottom. According to the post, “the major A wave has now been swept” and there are some “nice signs of life forming” in the lower timeframes despite the retrace lasting longer than he anticipated. The trader previously forecasted an “inevitable” fall to the $1 range, arguing that WIF was headed for a large retrace before the next parabolic run, which could lead to a new ATH. Related Reading: ‘No Need To Panic’: Cardano (ADA) Holding Key Level Despite 14% Drop After the recent performance, Bluntz warned that it is a “very early day, and we haven’t seen a 5-wave rise from the lows ‘yet’, but I think there’s a decent chance one has begun to form.” Another market watcher also pointed out a one-month falling wedge pattern on WIF’s chart, which targets $1.90 at a “minimum and quickly” if the memecoin breaks out of the upper downtrend line at around $1.40. As of this writing, dogwifhat trades at $1.21, a 14.4% surge in the daily timeframe.

SOL Whale Activity Surges & BNB Token Burn Strengthens Market,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-is-now-the-best-crypto-to-mine-with-500k-x1-users-sol-whale-activity-surges-bnb-token-burn-strengthens-market/,"The cryptocurrency landscape is abuzz with significant developments that continue to shape the industry’s trajectory. Despite a recent market pullback, Solana (SOL) is witnessing persistent whale activity, a strong indication that large investors remain confident in the blockchain’s long-term potential. Meanwhile, Binance Coin (BNB) has once again reinforced its deflationary model with a staggering $1.16 billion token burn, permanently removing over 1.6 million BNB from circulation. However, one of the most remarkable milestones in the crypto space today is the meteoric rise of BlockDAG (BDAG) mining, with the X1 mobile mining app surpassing 500,000 active users. This unprecedented growth underscores the massive demand for accessible crypto mining, positioning BDAG as the best crypto to mine on mobile. As BlockDAG’s presale continues to break records, the industry is witnessing a paradigm shift in how digital assets are mined, stored, and utilized. Solana Whale Activity Remains Strong Despite Market Pullback Solana has been at the center of attention following a 22.93% decline in its price, dropping from its all-time high of $294.33 to $227. While this significant price correction might typically signal bearish sentiment, the actions of large investors tell a different story. Solana whale activity remains robust, with wallets holding 10,000+ SOL reaching a peak of 5,137 before slightly retreating to 5,128. This continued interest from whales suggests that institutional and high-net-worth investors are still optimistic about the blockchain’s long-term potential, despite the temporary price downturn. Market analysts have noted that technical indicators paint a mixed picture of Solana’s trajectory. The Average Directional Index (ADX), a key metric used to assess trend strength, has fallen from 66.2 to 27.2, signaling a weakening upward trend. However, the persistence of whale accumulation suggests that large investors might be positioning themselves for future gains. Some experts believe that if whale activity continues at this rate, Solana’s price could stabilize and even stage a strong recovery in the coming months. BNB Token Burn: Strengthening Binance’s Deflationary Model BNB has once again demonstrated its commitment to a scarcity-driven value model with its latest token burn. The 30th quarterly burn event saw the permanent removal of 1,634,200.95 BNB, reducing the total circulating supply and reinforcing Binance’s long-term deflationary strategy. This massive $1.16 billion reduction includes 110,000 BNB lost during the recent BNB Chain Fusion, further solidifying the asset’s limited supply mechanism. The impact of these burns cannot be understated. Binance’s Auto-Burn system, which calculates the number of tokens to be removed based on market performance and network activity, ensures a transparent and systematic approach to reducing supply. As demand for BNB grows, this mechanism could lead to a significant price appreciation over time. Investor sentiment surrounding BNB remains overwhelmingly positive, especially given Binance’s long-term goal of burning a total of 42 million BNB tokens. BlockDAG Mining Soars: Is it the Best Crypto to Mine on Mobile? While Solana and BNB continue to command attention, the most exciting development in the industry is the rapid rise of BlockDAG (BDAG) mining. The X1 mobile mining app has now surpassed 500,000 active users, reflecting an unparalleled surge in demand for decentralized and user-friendly mining solutions. Unlike traditional crypto mining, which often requires expensive hardware, high electricity costs, and complex technical setups, BlockDAG’s X1 app enables seamless mobile mining, allowing users to earn up to 20 BDAG coins per day. The simplicity of the system has made it incredibly popular among crypto enthusiasts looking for a low-barrier entry into digital asset mining. The potential profitability of BDAG mining is another driving factor behind its adoption. If BDAG reaches its projected value of $1 per coin, miners could earn $20 per day, $600 per month, and an impressive $7,200 per year. This substantial earning potential, combined with bonus incentives through referrals, makes BDAG mining one of the most attractive opportunities in the crypto space. BlockDAG’s success is also evident in its ongoing presale, which has raised over $186 million and sold a staggering 18.2 billion BDAG coins. Early investors have already seen a 2,380% return on investment (ROI), as BDAG’s price has surged from $0.001 to $0.0248. This explosive growth has fueled increased demand for BDAG mining, leading to a dramatic rise in X1 app users. Crypto’s Most Exciting Era Yet: Key Takeaways Solana’s ongoing whale activity signals continued institutional confidence, suggesting that long-term investors remain bullish on its prospects. BNB’s deflationary model has been further strengthened by its latest $1.16 billion token burn, reinforcing its position as a valuable and scarce asset. However, the most significant shift is happening in the mining sector, where BlockDAG’s X1 app is reshaping the landscape of decentralized mining. By surpassing 500,000 active users, BlockDAG has proven that there is immense demand for accessible, profitable, and mobile-friendly mining solutions. As BDAG’s presale continues to gain momentum, early adopters are positioning themselves to capitalize on one of the most promising mining ecosystems in the industry. Now is the perfect time for traders, miners, and crypto enthusiasts to explore the BlockDAG ecosystem and take advantage of its mining rewards.

Experts Recommend Considering Web3Bay,https://thecoinrise.com/tron-kaspa-are-not-worth-it-in-2025-which-is-the-best-crypto-to-buy-experts-recommend-considering-web3bay/,"Donald Trump’s return to office has sparked a surge in the crypto market, prompting investors to search for the most promising assets. Among key players like TRON, Kaspa, and Web3Bay, it is Web3Bay that emerges as the best crypto to buy in 2025. It offers a unique take on decentralized e-commerce which could revolutionize how we shop online. With growing enthusiasm and increased institutional focus on blockchain, Web3Bay’s successful presale underscores its capacity to transform global commerce. Having raised $970,000 and sold over 255 million tokens, Web3Bay is quickly becoming the preferred choice for investors aiming for substantial returns in the digital economy. TRON: Expanding Applications Yet Struggling with Centralization Issues TRON is known for its rapid blockchain solutions, handling vast transactions at low costs. It has become a central hub for decentralized apps, gaming, and content sharing, highlighted by its TRUMP memecoin launch, which captured widespread interest. However, the centralization of TRON, with few super representatives, sparks debates over its decentralization and durability. In contrast, Web3Bay champions full decentralization with a community-based governance structure, giving all token holders a say in its operations. Unlike TRON, which mainly focuses on blockchain capabilities, Web3Bay tackles the inefficiencies in traditional e-commerce by removing middlemen, lowering fees, and offering a transparent platform for global transactions. Kaspa: Cutting-Edge Technology with a Limited Application Range Kaspa has been acknowledged for its blockDAG technology, enhancing fast transaction confirmations and scalability. It attracts blockchain enthusiasts who prioritize speed and decentralization. Kaspa has experienced notable price increases over the last year, securing its status as a noteworthy market contender. Yet, Kaspa’s appeal is predominantly technical with restricted practical applications, which may hinder broader market penetration. Web3Bay proposes a more dynamic solution aimed at the expansive $5 trillion e-commerce sector. It supports small businesses and consumers worldwide by eliminating high transaction fees, offering diverse payment methods, and preventing data centralization. With features like NFT integration, staking rewards, and a hybrid payment system, Web3Bay is positioned for widespread use and enduring success, presenting a more comprehensive investment opportunity compared to Kaspa. Web3Bay Positioned as the Best Crypto To Buy Now Web3Bay isn’t just a digital currency, but a response to the deep-rooted issues of e-commerce. Platforms such as Amazon and eBay often impose high fees, limit payment methods, and control user data. Web3Bay changes this, offering a clear, affordable market where buyers and sellers meet directly. The 3BAY token is vital to this ecosystem, providing tangible benefits and rewards for its holders. Those who own tokens receive a 5% discount on purchases, staking rewards, and governance rights via the platform’s DAO. Web3Bay’s mixed payment system accepts both crypto and traditional methods like PayPal, making it accessible worldwide. Web3Bay’s presale has excelled, amassing $970,000 in its fourth stage at a token price of $0.004562625. Early investors have witnessed price rises in each presale phase. With a forecasted launch price of $0.1959, early backers could see a 6,430% ROI. Consider this: A $1,000 investment in 3BAY tokens now could surge to $42,939 by its launch. This potential for high returns, coupled with the real-world use of Web3Bay, highlights it as a top pick for investors aiming for wise investments in 2025. Web3Bay Dominates TRON and Kaspa While TRON and Kaspa are notable in the crypto world, Web3Bay surpasses them with its adaptability and potential for growth. TRON’s centralization may deter blockchain enthusiasts, and Kaspa’s emphasis on transaction speed misses out on wider applications that attract a general audience. Web3Bay, however, meets a global demand: fair and reachable commerce. Its roadmap is packed with promising features like an NFT marketplace, compatibility across different chains, and expandable Layer-2 solutions, preparing it to expand with its users. This positions Web3Bay not just as a cryptocurrency but as a fundamental part of the evolving digital economy. For small companies, Web3Bay eliminates traditional banking dependencies, allowing them to access worldwide markets without hefty fees or limiting conditions. For shoppers, it ensures a safe, unlimited buying experience with genuine savings. Which One is the Best Crypto To Buy Today? The cryptocurrency market is embracing a new era of expansion, driven by positive market trends and wider acceptance. TRON and Kaspa hold their ground in specific areas, but Web3Bay shines with its usability, scalability, and visionary outlook. With $970,000 collected in its crypto presale , an anticipated ROI of 6,430%, and a system set to transform worldwide commerce, Web3Bay stands as the most exciting investment for 2025. Its decentralized commerce model introduces a just, open, and collective marketplace benefiting all participants—buyers, sellers, and investors.

With Bitcoin flirting with new all-time highs and institutional investors diving headfirst into the blockchain space, the race to find the top cryptos to buy for 2025 is hotter than ever. But let’s be real—not every project makes it to the top. Aptos was one of the hyped ones, and those who got in early made a killing. But what about the ones who missed out? That “what if” feeling is the worst, right? Well, here’s the good news—there’s another rising star, and this time, there’s still a chance to get in before the fireworks start. Enter Qubetics ($TICS) —the world’s first Web3 aggregator that’s solving problems the big-name cryptos haven’t figured out yet. The future isn’t just about faster transactions or lower fees; it’s about making different blockchains actually talk to each other. That’s where Qubetics comes in. Whether it’s businesses struggling with multi-chain compatibility, freelancers juggling payments across different networks, or regular users tired of swapping tokens every time they want to use a new dApp—Qubetics is making it all seamless. And with its presale heating up, investors are eyeing $TICS as a golden ticket to massive gains. Qubetics: The Future of Interoperability For those who missed out on Aptos, Qubetics presale presents an enticing opportunity. Currently in its 19th presale stage, Qubetics has already raised over $11.3 million, with more than 450 million $TICS tokens sold to over 17,100 holders. The token is priced at $0.0606, offering an accessible entry point for potential investors. Qubetics distinguishes itself through its focus on interoperability—the seamless interaction between different blockchain networks. This capability is crucial in a landscape where numerous blockchains operate in isolation. By enabling cross-chain transactions, asset transfers, and data sharing, Qubetics is set to revolutionize how various blockchain platforms communicate and collaborate. Imagine a tech startup in Silicon Valley that utilizes Ethereum for smart contracts and Solana for swift transactions. Traditionally, integrating these platforms would be complex and resource-intensive. However, with Qubetics’ interoperability solutions, the startup can effortlessly manage operations across both blockchains, streamlining processes and reducing costs. Similarly, a freelance graphic designer in New York could use Qubetics to manage payments received in different cryptocurrencies. Instead of juggling multiple wallets and conversion processes, the designer can consolidate transactions through Qubetics’ platform, simplifying financial management. Analysts are bullish on $TICS, predicting significant price appreciation. By the end of the presale, $TICS is expected to reach $0.25, translating into a 312.18% return on investment for early participants. Post-presale projections are even more optimistic, with forecasts of $1 per token, equating to a 1,548.71% increase. Following the mainnet launch, some experts anticipate the token reaching $15, which would mean a staggering 24,630.58% return. Aptos: A Rising Star in the Crypto Space Aptos has been making waves with its innovative approach to blockchain technology. As of January 29, 2025, Aptos is trading at approximately $7.42, experiencing a slight dip of 2.89% from the previous day. Despite this minor setback, analysts remain optimistic about its future. Projections suggest that Aptos could reach $9.44 by February 2, 2025, indicating a potential increase of around 27%. Aptos aims to enhance scalability and security within the blockchain ecosystem. Its unique consensus mechanism and focus on user-friendly applications have attracted a growing community of developers and investors. The platform’s commitment to continuous improvement and adaptability positions it as a strong contender among the top cryptos to buy for 2025. Conclusion: Seizing the Opportunity The cryptocurrency market is dynamic and ever-evolving, presenting both challenges and opportunities. While Aptos continues to develop its platform and expand its user base, Qubetics offers a compelling alternative, especially for those who may have missed earlier investment opportunities. With its groundbreaking focus on interoperability and impressive presale performance, Qubetics stands out as one of the top cryptos to buy for 2025. The potential for substantial returns, coupled with real-world applications across various industries, makes $TICS a token worth considering. Don’t let this chance slip by. Participate in the Qubetics presale today and position yourself at the forefront of the next wave in blockchain innovation.

Trump Fuks DeepSeek (TRUMSEEK), a Solana memecoin launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMSEEK is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and cause its price to rally, which will benefit investors who buy before these new exchange listings. Currently, Trump Fuks DeepSeek can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Fuks DeepSeek could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Fuks DeepSeek launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Fuks DeepSeek on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump Fuks DeepSeek by entering its contract address (CA) – 3QtYU6QPQPGbzHX9evKdxVHsoTnXyjUwY8xkaVnZ9QPc – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. Early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMSEEK. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-30 02:45:00

Dogecoin’s earliest days are a prime example. What started as a joke quickly became a financial revolution, turning those who took it seriously into millionaires. But here’s the thing—history has a way of repeating itself. Right now, Arctic Pablo Coin (APC)is making waves in the meme coin space, and those who seize the moment could be the ones telling their own success stories in the coming years. Dogecoin: The Missed ICO That Could Have Made You a Fortune Dogecoin was never supposed to be taken seriously. When software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer launched it in December 2013, it was a fun, satirical response to the increasingly serious crypto scene. No one expected that this Shiba Inu-inspired meme coin would one day skyrocket to global fame. Back then, Dogecoin traded at a fraction of a cent—literally worth almost nothing. In early 2014, its price hovered around $0.0002 to $0.0003, with barely any attention from major investors. Fast forward to today, and Dogecoin has hit highs of over $0.70, making early believers jaw-droppingly rich. A mere $100 investment in Dogecoin in its early days would have turned into six-figure wealth at its peak. That’s the kind of moonshot opportunity that makes or breaks crypto millionaires. Yet, most people didn’t take it seriously. They laughed. They dismissed it. And then, they regretted it. The biggest question now is: Will you make the same mistake again? Because right now, another meme coin is gaining traction, and the window of opportunity is still wide open. Enter Arctic Pablo, one of the top new meme coins to invest in now that is rewriting the rules of presales. Arctic Pablo: The Meme Coin Presale That’s Turning Heads Unlike Dogecoin, which had no structured presale, Arctic Pablo is offering an exclusive chance for early adopters to jump in before the market does. And this isn’t just any typical ICO—this is a revolution in meme coin presales. Rather than traditional stages, Arctic Pablo’s presale is mapped out as a journey. Right now, the presale is at Glacier Grove, with the price sitting at just $0.000043. This is still insanely early, but here’s the kicker—the final presale price is set at $0.0008, and the launch price is projected at $0.008. Do the math, and early investors at this stage could be looking at a staggering 18,546% ROI by the time it officially hits the market. Think about that. Imagine turning a modest investment into a life-changing windfall, just like the earliest Dogecoin investors did. People always say they wish they had a time machine to go back and buy Dogecoin in 2013. But Arctic Pablo is right here, right now, and this could be your moment to grab hold of the next viral meme coin phenomenon. The Perks That Set Arctic Pablo Apart Beyond just price potential, Arctic Pablo is built for longevity. It’s not just another hype-driven meme coin—it’s creating an ecosystem that rewards its community in multiple ways. Investors can stake their tokens at an APY of 66% during the presale, meaning they’re already making gains before the coin even launches. The project also offers referral incentives so those who spread the word about Arctic Pablo can earn even more. And let’s not forget the community competitions, where participants can score additional rewards in APC tokens or even USD. This is the kind of active, engaging, and rewarding ecosystem that meme coin lovers crave—and it’s happening now, not months or years down the road. Why Arctic Pablo Is One of the Top New Meme Coins to Invest in Now The meme coin market is constantly evolving, but one thing remains true: the best time to invest in a meme coin is before the mainstream catches on. Arctic Pablo is generating massive buzz, with over $600,000 already raised in the presale, and momentum is only growing. This isn’t a situation where you’ll be looking back years from now, wondering why you didn’t take action. This is a live opportunity, and it’s still in its early days. With a launch price of $0.008, the potential for massive early gains is undeniable. And let’s be real—who doesn’t want to be part of the next big crypto success story? The Final Chance to Be an Early Investor Every crypto cycle has its defining moments—the projects that started small but exploded into global sensations. Dogecoin had its moment, and those who caught it early made fortunes. But the next big story? It’s unfolding right now with Arctic Pablo . The presale won’t last forever. Each new location brings a price increase as Arctic Pablo continues its journey. The top new meme coins to invest in now aren’t the ones that have already peaked—they’re still in their infancy, flying under the radar, and giving early believers a once-in-a-lifetime chance. So, will you let another meme coin moon while you sit on the sidelines? Or will you secure your spot in Arctic Pablo before it skyrockets? The choice is yours—but the window is closing fast.

As the digital asset space braces for new opportunities, three tokens are emerging as potential leaders – Lightchain AI , a platform revolutionizing blockchain and AI integration; Bitcoin (BTC), the original and most trusted cryptocurrency; and Ethereum (ETH), the backbone of decentralized applications. Among these, Lightchain AI’s presale success, raising $12.3 million at $0.005625 per token, signals its rise as a groundbreaking contender in this golden era for crypto. Bitcoin and Ethereum – Leaders of the Crypto Market As of January 24, 2025, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to dominate the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin is trading at approximately $102,378, reflecting a slight decrease of 1.42% from the previous close, with intraday highs and lows of $104,430 and $102,378, respectively. Ethereum is priced at around $3,218.67, down 0.85%, with intraday highs and lows of $3,262.94 and $3,216.28. The market is influenced by President Donald Trump’s pro-crypto policies, including proposals for a U.S. strategic bitcoin reserve and the appointment of crypto advocate Paul Atkins as SEC chair. Analysts predict Bitcoin could surpass $150,000 in 2025, driven by increased institutional adoption and favorable regulations. Ethereum’s growth is supported by network upgrades and the expansion of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, with price forecasts suggesting it could reach $6,563 by 2025. Both cryptocurrencies are poised for significant growth amid evolving market dynamics and supportive regulatory environments. Lightchain AI Next Big Thing in Blockchain Innovation Lightchain AI is making waves with its innovative approach to blockchain and artificial intelligence integration. Unlike Bitcoin and Ethereum, which focus on financial transactions and general-purpose computation, Lightchain AI introduces features tailored for AI-powered decentralized applications. The platform also incorporates a regenerative economic model, where transaction fees are reinvested into ecosystem development and rewards for contributors. This approach fosters a self-sustaining ecosystem that supports long-term growth and innovation. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s developer-centric environment provides tools and incentives to accelerate the creation of decentralized applications. These features, combined with its successful presale, position Lightchain AI as a frontrunner in the blockchain space. Why Lightchain AI Stands Out While Bitcoin and Ethereum are well-established giants, Lightchain AI’s focus on innovation and real-world applications sets it apart. Its $12.8 million presale is a clear indicator of investor confidence in its vision.

This Top Meme Coin Presale to Buy Today Could Be Your Big Shot at 100x Gains!,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-bomes-explosive-surge-this-top-meme-coin-presale-to-buy-today-could-be-your-big-shot-at-100x-gains/,"Imagine waking up one day to realize that a $300 investment in a meme coin a year ago is now worth over a thousand dollars. Sounds ridiculous? Well, that’s exactly what happened with early Book of Meme (BOME) investors when this Solana-based memecoin skyrocketed to a $1 billion market cap within 48 hours of its launch. But if you missed that train, don’t worry—history is handing you a second chance with BTFD Coin (BTFD) , the latest and most exciting top meme coin presale to buy today. Meme coins aren’t just internet jokes anymore—they’re turning everyday traders into overnight success stories. The hype around these digital assets has only intensified, and BTFD Coin is leading the next wave. The presale has already raised a staggering $5.78 million, selling over 68 billion tokens to enthusiastic investors. With over 9,800 holders already securing their bags, BTFD Coin is moving fast, currently in its 14th presale stage at just $0.00016 per token. But here’s the kicker: once the presale wraps up, BTFD is set to list at $0.0006, offering a 275% return on investment before it even hits the open market. Think about it: if you put in $30,000 today, your BTFD stash could be worth $112,500 by the time it goes live. And if this coin follows the meteoric path of past meme legends like BOME, we’re talking life-changing money. BTFD Coin: The Next Big Meme Coin Taking Over 2025 BTFD Coin isn’t just another meme coin—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem packed with rewards, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and an industry-leading referral program designed to reward its most loyal supporters. On January 1, 2025, BTFD launched its P2E game, allowing users to earn real rewards simply by playing. Whether you’re a casual gamer or a hardcore competitor, this adds an extra layer of value to holding BTFD. Meanwhile, staking rewards are through the roof, with an eye-watering 90% APY for those who lock in their tokens early. With such high returns, staking BTFD could become a passive income machine for smart investors. But the real showstopper? BTFD’s viral referral program. BTFD’s Referral Program: Your Ticket to Massive Crypto Rewards If you’ve ever regretted not being an early influencer in a meme coin’s rise, this is your redemption arc. BTFD’s Referral Rewards Program is one of the most lucrative in the industry, and here’s how it works: Get Your Code – Connect your wallet on the BTFD buy page to generate your unique referral link. Share and Earn – Send your code to friends, family, and crypto communities. Double Bonuses – Anyone who buys $50+ in BTFD using your code gets an extra 10% in tokens. Leaderboard Perks – If you land in the top 20 referrers by the end of the month, you’ll score 10% of the total raised amount in BTFD tokens . Track Your Gains – Monitor your referral rewards in real time through your connected wallet. With this system, top referrers could potentially rake in thousands of dollars in free BTFD tokens every month. If you’ve got a network, this is an easy way to stack up your holdings before BTFD even lists. Book of Meme (BOME): The $1 Billion Rocket You Missed If you were around in early 2024 and didn’t buy Book of Meme (BOME), you probably still regret it. This memecoin exploded from obscurity to a $1 billion valuation in just two days, making its early investors filthy rich. Launched in March 2024 by digital artist Darkfarms, BOME set out to preserve meme culture on the blockchain. It caught fire immediately, with Binance, KuCoin, and Gate.io rushing to list it. Within 48 hours, its price skyrocketed, minting a new generation of meme coin millionaires. By October 2024, BOME surged another 88%, reaching $0.021 before retracing to its current price of $0.0033. But let’s be real—most people weren’t early enough to catch those massive gains. If you missed BOME’s launch, you likely watched in horror as others cashed out life-changing profits. That’s exactly why BTFD Coin’s presale is the chance you don’t want to miss. While BOME required timing perfection, BTFD is handing investors a golden ticket on a silver platter. With the presale still open, you can buy at the ground floor price before the masses flood in. Final Call: Will You Ride the BTFD Wave or Miss Out Again? Let’s be honest—regret stings. If you’ve ever wished you jumped into Dogecoin in 2013, Shiba Inu in 2020, or BOME in 2024, this is your moment of redemption. BTFD Coin is the top meme coin presale to buy today , and with its P2E game, staking rewards, and game-changing referral program, it’s got everything needed for a parabolic run. With a $5.78 million presale tally, 68 billion tokens already sold, and an ROI of 275% locked in before launch, the question isn’t whether BTFD will explode—it’s whether you’ll be holding when it does. Don’t be the one reading stories of BTFD millionaires a year from now, kicking yourself for missing out. Sign up now, grab your BTFD tokens, and get ready for the ride of your life!

In recent weeks, the company has started to replicate MicroStrategy's business model of selling overvalued shares into the open market and using the proceeds to accumulate Bitcoins. While MicroStrategy is currently valued at approximately 2x its Bitcoin holdings, KULR Technology's multiple is closer to 9x. Even when assigning a very generous valuation to the company's tiny core business, downside could be north of 40%. Given KULR Technology's massive overvaluation and considering the risks associated with the company's Bitcoin accumulation strategy, I am reiterating my ""Sell"" rating on the shares. Note: I have covered KULR Technology Group, Inc. ( KULR ) or “KULR Technology” previously, so investors should view this as an update to my earlier article on the company. Last month, I initiated coverage of KULR Technology with a "" Sell "" rating due to the tiny, money-losing company trading at an eye-watering valuation of 30x estimated 2025 revenues. In recent months, management's persistent efforts to position KULR Technology as an investment into several of the biggest hype themes in today's market (Space, AI, Defense, Energy Storage, Nuclear, Bitcoin) have attracted hosts of speculative investors and momentum traders. While the company has continued to celebrate its alleged progress in a series of press releases , the recent decision to effectively replicate MicroStrategy's ( MSTR ) business model of financing large-scale Bitcoin purchases by raising additional equity might soon result in the stock price becoming more closely correlated to movements in the world's leading cryptocurrency. KULR Technology also adopted ""BTC Yield"" as a key performance indicator: KULR has introduced “BTC Yield” as a key performance indicator (""KPI"") for its Bitcoin Treasury strategy. This metric evaluates the Company’s ability to increase its bitcoin holdings per share, offering investors a transparent measure of the per share accretive impact of its bitcoin acquisitions. BTC Yield is calculated as the percentage change period-to-period in the ratio of the Company’s bitcoin holdings to its Assumed Fully Diluted Shares Outstanding. This KPI helps assess the effectiveness of KULR’s bitcoin acquisition strategy in driving shareholder value. As of last week, the company had utilized $50 million in cash to acquire 510 bitcoins with a current market value of $52.6 million. KULR last updated on its share count in a SEC-filing on January 17. At that time, total outstanding common shares had increased to 273.6 million, up by almost 30% over the past six weeks alone. On January 24, the company increased its existing At the Market Offering Agreement (""ATM Agreement""), with Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC by another $50 million and with 500 million authorized shares, further increases to the ATM Agreement seem to be likely. So far, KULR Technology has increased the original $20 million ATM Agreement three times: Regulatory Filings Until last week, the company had raised $96 million in gross proceeds under the ATM Agreement, of which $50 million had been invested in Bitcoin. Adjusted for commissions and assumed cash burn from operations, I would expect the company's current cash position to be at least $35 million. Using the last disclosed share count, KULR Technology's enterprise value calculates to approximately $468 million, or 26x the company's estimated 2025 revenue. Regulatory Filings / Author's Estimates Perhaps more important, KULR Technology is trading at 9x the market value of its Bitcoin holdings and 5.3x the combined value of its cash and Bitcoin holdings. In comparison, MicroStrategy is currently changing hands at slightly below 2.0x the market value of its Bitcoin holdings, which apparently isn't exactly cheap either. However, the world's largest corporate Bitcoin holder looks like a real bargain when compared to tiny KULR Technology. Quite frankly, rather than buying shares of overvalued Bitcoin players like MicroStrategy and particularly KULR Technology, investors with a bullish view of the cryptocurrency should rather consider an investment in ETFs from the likes of IBIT , FBTC , ARKB or HODL which trade close to their net asset value. In addition, with KULR Technology trading at a massive premium to net asset value, there's a huge incentive for the company to facilitate further Bitcoin purchases by selling large amounts of newly-issued shares into the open market. Even assigning a valuation of 10x estimated 2025 revenues for the company's tiny core business and using MicroStrategy's valuation of 2x its Bitcoin holdings would only result in a price target of $1.17: Author's Calculations / Regulatory Filings Given KULR Technology's massive overvaluation and considering the risks associated with the company's Bitcoin accumulation strategy, I am reiterating my "" Sell "" rating on the company's shares. Even under generous valuation assumptions, current downside potential is exceeding 40%. Bottom Line Given KULR Technology's eye-watering valuation, I can't blame management for its efforts to replicate MicroStrategy's business model of selling expensive common shares into the open market and invest the proceeds into additional Bitcoins. However, investors looking for exposure to the world's leading cryptocurrency should rather consider investing in Bitcoin ETFs which tend to trade around net asset value rather than buying overvalued shares of companies like MicroStrategy and particularly KULR Technology. Even when using very generous valuation assumptions, there's still plenty of downside in KULR Technology's common shares. Consequently, I am reiterating my "" Sell "" rating on the company's shares.",MSTR|KULR,EN,0,0,BTC|TECHNOLOGY|BUSINESS|MARKET|ZRX,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-01-30 03:27:31

ETH is now consolidating losses and might face resistance near the $3,220 zone. Ethereum started a fresh decline below the $3,120 zone. The price is trading below $3,180 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,220 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start another decline if it stays below the $3,200 level. Ethereum Price Faces Resistance Ethereum price started a fresh decline below the $3,220 and $3,180 levels, like Bitcoin . ETH even declined below the $3,050 level before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $3,021 and the price recently corrected some losses . There was a move above the $3,120 and $3,150 levels. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,425 wing high to the $3,020 swing low. However, the bears were active below the $3,200 resistance. Ethereum price is now trading below $3,200 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,220 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $3,180 level. The first major resistance is near the $3,200 level and the trend line. The main resistance is now forming near $3,220 and the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,425 wing high to the $3,020 swing low. A clear move above the $3,220 resistance might send the price toward the $3,320 resistance. An upside break above the $3,320 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $3,450 resistance zone or even $3,500 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,200 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,0750 level. The first major support sits near the $3,050. A clear move below the $3,050 support might push the price toward the $3,020 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,000 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $2,950. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI – The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 zone.

BTC now sits just above $101,000 and is up ~7% year to date. Ether's closing price dropped over 7% this week to its lowest level in over two months. ETH is currently down ~8% year to date. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and has continued that momentum into 2025. XRP is currently up ~32% year to date. By Jennifer Nash This weekly update tracks some of the largest cryptocurrencies by market share: bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) and ether ( ETH-USD ). While both are considered to be high risk when it comes to investing, the two have foundational differences that investors should know . We've also included XRP ( XRP-USD ), as it was one of the largest cryptocurrencies when this series began. According to Wikipedia , a cryptocurrency is ""a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units, and to verify the transfer of assets."" Bitcoin Bitcoin was the world's first cryptocurrency and decentralized digital currency. The first bitcoin transaction occurred in early 2009 and has since grown worldwide to a mainstream financial asset. It is often considered volatile, as seen in our first chart, but one can argue that it is also resilient . Bitcoin's closing price hit an all-time high last week but has since fallen nearly 5%. BTC now sits just above $101,000 and is up ~7% year to date. Ether Ether is a cryptocurrency run on the Ethereum blockchain platform and was launched in July 2015. It has the second largest market share, despite being the newest of the three discussed in this article. Ether's closing price dropped over 7% this week to its lowest level in over two months. ETH is currently down ~8% year to date. XRP XRP, which is owned by Ripple, was launched in 2012 and was one of the larger cryptocurrencies for some time until new coins joined the market. XRP surged during the last few months of 2024 and has continued that momentum into 2025. XRP is currently up ~32% year to date. Bitcoin vs. Ether vs. XRP An index has been created in order to chart these three cryptocurrencies together, considering their significantly different pricing histories. The chart tells us which cryptocurrency's price has changed the most since November 9, 2017. At one point or another, all three have been at the top. At the time of writing, bitcoin is in the lead, just edging out XRP. On January 10th, 2024, the SEC approved spot bitcoin ETFs from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ETF ( GBTC ), iShares Bitcoin Trust ( IBIT ), Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ), ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF ( ARKB ), Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Coinshares Valkyrie Bitcoin Fund ( BRRR ). Here are some of the quick takeaways from the spot bitcoin ETF launch. On July 23rd, 2024, a handful of spot ether ETFs launched from a range of issuers such as Grayscale Ethereum Trust ( ETHE ), Franklin Ethereum ETF ( EZET ), Bitwise Ethereum ETF ( ETHW ), iShares Ethereum Trust ( ETHA ), Fidelity Ethereum ETF ( FETH ).

Powell was asked whether speculation in this unregulated asset class could harm individuals’ financial well-being, especially in contrast to the broader concerns about the financial system. Powell said that the Federal Reserve’s primary role is to oversee how banks interact with cryptocurrencies. He noted that banks can serve cryptocurrency customers as long as they understand and manage the associated risks, ensuring their operations remain safe and sound. Many banks under the Federal Reserve’s supervision are already engaging with crypto in a secure manner. However, Powell pointed out that banks face higher thresholds when it comes to crypto activities due to the relatively new nature of digital assets. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers as long as they understand and can manage the risks. And it’s safe and sound, as a good number of our banks that we regulate and supervise do that. The threshold has been a little higher for banks engaging in crypto activities. And that’s because they’re so new,” he explained. He explained that if a bank decides to offer crypto services, it must ensure the activity is fully safe, as it operates under the federal safety net, including deposit insurance. The Fed’s cautious approach aims to prevent risks to the broader financial system while supporting innovation. Powell reiterated that the Fed is not opposed to cryptocurrency innovation, but it seeks to prevent overly cautious regulations from unduly disrupting legitimate business activities.",News|Crypto news|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,FIAT|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-30 03:46:01

While Solana’s strong rally and potential for a 200% surge captivate investors, PropiChain , a rising AI-driven low-cap altcoin, is gaining attention with its projected 50,000% market growth. PropiChain’s innovative AI and blockchain features position it as a standout competitor, challenging Solana’s dominance. Investors are closely watching PropiChain’s rapid ascent, which is overshadowing Solana’s 200%. Here is a closer look at what is driving PropiChain’s numbers. What is Driving Solana’s 200% Rally? Solana’s recent price surge has captured market attention, with several factors contributing to its upward trajectory. The U.S. political shift under Donald Trump’s administration has created anticipation for crypto-friendly regulations. Analysts speculate that Solana ETFs could gain approval, further boosting investor sentiment. Solana’s Firedancer project, designed to achieve one million transactions per second, enhances scalability and efficiency. This technological innovation strengthens Solana’s position as a blockchain leader. Additionally, Bitcoin’s surge past $100,000 has sparked broader market optimism, propelling Solana and other altcoins into the spotlight. PropiChain’s 50,000% Gains Overshadows Solana PropiChain is emerging as a compelling alternative to Solana, capturing investor interest with its AI platform. While Solana faces market fluctuations, PropiChain integrates AI and blockchain to transform the $300 trillion real estate market with practical applications. PropiChain integrates NFTs and Real-World Assets (RWA) to revolutionize real estate investments. By tokenizing physical properties into NFTs, PropiChain enables fractional ownership, making high-value assets accessible to a broader audience starting as low as $100. Each NFT represents a share in a property, allowing investors to diversify portfolios with minimal capital. This innovative approach enhances liquidity in the $300 trillion real estate market by addressing inefficiencies in traditional systems. PropiChain’s focus on RWAs positions it as a practical low-cap altcoin for investors seeking tangible, asset-backed opportunities with growth potential. This innovation democratizes access to high-value properties, increasing liquidity and lowering entry barriers. Investors seeking utility beyond speculative trends are turning to PropiChain for solutions. PropiChain’s AI optimizes transactions through automation and predictive analytics. Investors can rely on virtual assistants and chatbots for real-time support, helping them easily make informed decisions. These tools streamline complex processes, ensuring efficiency and precision, which cements PropiChain’s position as a leader in AI-powered blockchain technology. Its metaverse integration goes further by offering virtual property tours and 3D visualizations. Investors can explore properties in detail without needing physical visits, removing geographical barriers. Beyond visualization, the metaverse platform facilitates direct interactions between buyers, sellers, and agents, creating a seamless and immersive transaction experience. PropiChain’s AI analytics provide investors with insights into market trends, property values, and risk factors, enabling data-driven investment strategies. Combined with its metaverse tools, PropiChain is a comprehensive platform for global real estate transactions. By blending AI and the metaverse, PropiChain stands out as an innovative low cap altcoin reshaping property investment. With a security audit by BlockAudit , a security blockchain firm, PropiChain delivers reliability and innovation. Its CoinMarketCap listing further boosts investor confidence in its security and reliability. As Solana’s volatility persists, this low-cap altcoin stands out for its utility and potential market stability. Invest in PropiChain Presale for Massive Gains PropiChain’s presale is gaining significant traction. Phase 1 raised over $1.3 million, and Phase 2 has already brought in over $1 million from eager investors. With limited token supply and strategic positioning, demand for PropiChain tokens continues to grow.

Web3Bay is becoming more than just a token; it’s a gateway to the future of decentralized trading platforms. Ready to join? What’s Driving Web3Bay’s Presale to $1M? Web3Bay’s presale is shining brightly in the crypto market. As projects like TRON and Chainlink remain in the spotlight, Web3Bay is attracting its own audience by merging practicality, easy access, and promising financial returns. Having collected over $970,000 already, the presale provides an appealing opportunity for those looking to engage with a revolutionary decentralized e-commerce network. At the heart of this excitement is the Web3Bay token, 3BAY, currently priced at $0.004562625 in its fourth phase. With an expected launch price of $0.1959, early participants could achieve a remarkable 6,430% ROI. But it’s not all about the numbers. Web3Bay’s blueprint for a blockchain-driven e-commerce system, incorporating NFTs and decentralized governance, is driving community participation. This is a crypto presale with genuine, practical uses, not mere speculation. Web3Bay stands out for its accessibility and focus on user needs.

If you’re looking to invest in an innovative presale with a clear vision, Web3Bay is a project to consider before it’s too late. Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis: Signs of Consistent Growth Chainlink is increasingly becoming a key player in the decentralized oracle space. The latest Chainlink (LINK) Price Analysis shows steady growth, with LINK now trading at $24.64. This increase in value corresponds to broader adoption driven by the launch of CCIP 1.5 on the mainnet. This update improves secure communication across chains for decentralized apps, solidifying Chainlink’s crucial role in blockchain networks. Apart from technological advancements, Chainlink’s strategic partnerships are also gaining attention. Its collaborations with Ripple for RLUSD stablecoin pricing and BTguru to promote tokenized securities in Turkey illustrate its practical impact.

For those considering presale opportunities like Web3Bay or looking into established networks, Chainlink remains a fundamental element of blockchain innovation. TRON Whale Accumulation Signifies Rising Interest TRON (TRX) is capturing the attention of significant investors, with Tron Whale Accumulation now over $7.5 million.

These advancements are in line with the network’s impressive daily transfer volume of $3.6 trillion, indicating increased activity and wider adoption. From a technical standpoint, analysts predict a possible 50% surge in TRX value if it overcomes the $0.26 resistance level, aiming for $0.37. This potential increase makes TRON an appealing choice for those looking to diversify with established assets like Chainlink and promising crypto presale projects such as Web3Bay. As TRON continues to enhance its ecosystem, its growing allure among whales and casual investors suggests a strong belief in its long-term worth. Key Insights Chainlink (LINK) continues to excel with ongoing utility enhancements and partnerships, while Tron Whale Accumulation indicates increased faith in its network’s progress.

Trump Buys SUI (TRUMPSUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys SUI launched with over $29,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Buys SUI by entering its contract address (CA) – 7chY3Yw9cArR4CGQQ2N6mciszZvWB3rW6WoBNTfwyitu – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|SUI|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-30 04:07:00

SEC Closed-Door Meeting Stirs Ripple Case Rumors appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News A closed-door meeting of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 30 has sparked new speculation about the future of the ongoing Ripple case. This marks the fifth such meeting of the year, and it has grabbed the attention of the XRP community, which is hopeful for potential developments regarding the lawsuit. The meeting, scheduled in advance and disclosed via a Sunshine Act notice on the SEC’s website, will feature SEC acting Chair Mark Uyeda and Commissioner Hester Peirce. Uyeda’s leadership is drawing particular attention, as he is known for his critical stance on using enforcement actions to regulate cryptocurrency. The subject matter of the closed meeting will consist of the following topics: Institution and settlement of injunctive actions; Institution and settlement of administrative proceedings; Resolution of litigation claims; and Other matters relating to examinations and enforcement proceedings. As he continues serving as interim chair, awaiting confirmation from the U.S. Senate for a permanent successor, many believe his leadership may favor clarity and fairness for the crypto industry. Ripple’s Potential Breakthrough Adding to the anticipation is the recent development that the SEC has reportedly removed all references to Ripple from its litigation releases section on its website. This has led to speculation that the lawsuit involving Ripple may be nearing its end. Although this change is not conclusive proof that the case is over, it has certainly fueled excitement within the XRP community. The situation remains fluid, and while there is no official confirmation, the XRP community is hopeful that this is a sign of progress. Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple, recently spoke about the dangers of crypto maximalism, advocating for a more inclusive approach to the industry.

As altcoin season draws closer, the next couple of weeks could mark the final chance to accumulate high-potential safety net assets like XRP at discounted prices before momentum inevitably shifts upward and newer investors start becoming exit liquidity later this year. For those aiming to muster greater gains beyond 10x, focusing on projects with strong utility and explosive hype potential is essential. The gaming sector, poised for a major surge in 2025, presents a lucrative avenue for investors, with standout projects like Rollblock leading the charge. With its cutting-edge approach to GameFi, Rollblock is positioned to deliver 25-100x returns as soon as Q2, making it one of the most compelling opportunities today. Here’s The Rundown On RBLK’s Bullish Potential Rollblock is redefining GameFi with a forward-thinking approach to blockchain-powered gaming. With a diverse catalog of over 7,000 games, spanning classic favorites like blackjack and poker to blockchain-exclusive experiences, the platform delivers entertainment at an unprecedented scale. The recent launch of sports betting has added another layer of engagement, while a packed 2025 roadmap is set to introduce even more exciting titles, solidifying Rollblock’s leadership in the space. At the core of Rollblock’s ecosystem is the RBLK token, designed for sustainable growth and community rewards. Up to 30% of the platform’s weekly profits are allocated for token buybacks, with 60% permanently burned to reduce supply.

Audited by SolidProof and backed by an Anjouan Gaming license, the platform adheres to strict regulatory requirements. With advanced encryption and AI-powered security features in place, Rollblock ensures a safe and reliable environment for both users and investors, setting a new standard in the GambleFi sector. Bullish Factors Weigh In Favour Of Ripples’s XRP Despite Some Expedited Controversy Ripple (XRP) is maintaining relative stability during a wider market downturn, declining by 3% on the daily and weekly charts as institutional accumulation intensifies in the background. Over a billion XRP tokens have been purchased in just ten days, signaling renewed confidence in Ripple’s ecosystem and strong enthusiasm for XRP amongst retail investors and the “XRP army”. Speculation about an XRP spot ETF continues to build, with former Ripple executive Sean McBride hinting at major upcoming announcements that could reshape XRP’s market outlook. Meanwhile, regulatory clarity appears to be on the horizon as the SEC undergoes a leadership shift under the pro-crypto Trump administration, with Paul Atkins replacing Gary Gensler as Chair. Additionally, the launch of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin further cements XRP’s growing role in cross-border finance, positioning it as a potential leader in the next wave of blockchain adoption. Despite its positive trajectory, XRP remains a point of contention in the crypto space, often criticized by Bitcoin maximalists for its perceived centralization. The debate has escalated as Ripple pushes for inclusion in a potential US digital asset stockpile, challenging Bitcoin’s dominance as the preferred institutional crypto asset. Regardless, for investors seeking minimal 5-10x returns from here, XRP may present an ideal opportunity today. Don’t Miss This Chance To Get Into Rollblock Early!

Bitcoin (BTC) has long been the benchmark for cryptocurrency investments, delivering consistent value and stability over the years. However, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is quickly stealing the spotlight, with analysts projecting a potential 50,000% breakout. This groundbreaking token has already proven its worth, raising $1 million in just minutes during its presale. With momentum building and investor interest surging, OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM is positioning itself as the most promising crypto of 2025. What’s Driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN’s Momentum? Record-Breaking Presale Success The demand for THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has been unprecedented, with $1 million raised in minutes. This strong presale performance demonstrates overwhelming investor confidence, rivaling early excitement around XRP and SOL. Exclusive Availability Unlike XRP and SOLANA, which are widely available on major exchanges, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN is sold exclusively at OFFICIALMAGACOIN.COM . This exclusivity drives demand and ensures that early adopters stand to gain the most from its projected breakout. Growing Investor Confidence With predictions of a 50,000% return, THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN has become a magnet for investors seeking exponential growth. Its strong performance and limited supply are fueling speculation that it could redefine the crypto market. How It Compares to Market Leaders Ripple (XRP): Known for its dominance in cross-border payments, XRP offers steady growth but doesn’t match the early-stage explosive potential of THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN .

This regulatory sanction enables Coinbase to conduct business legally in Argentina, which is a critical component of its ongoing global expansion strategy. Regulatory Milestone Coinbase has pursued to get permission from regulators in Argentina to strengthen its place in the country as more people start using cryptocurrencies, driven by economic troubles and rising prices. The VASP registration ensures Coinbase’s legal standing, making it one of the few major crypto platforms to operate under clear local regulations. We’re approved to launch in Argentina. This is an important step in our international strategy and another key chapter in our mission to increase economic freedom around the world. pic.twitter.com/bfudgiDuVD — Coinbase (@coinbase) January 28, 2025 In addition to granting Coinbase’s services in Argentina legitimacy, this step puts the exchange in a stronger position to compete with unregulated rivals. The exchange seeks to provide consumers with a dependable, secure platform for trading and investing in digital assets by abiding by local regulations. Matías Alberti is now in charge of Coinbase’s activities in Argentina. Alberti has prior experience working with fintech businesses like Clara and Buenbit. He will be in charge of overseeing Coinbase’s growth in the Argentine market. Demand For Cryptocurrency In Argentina On The Rise Due to the country’s high rate of inflation and economic difficulties, there is a significant demand for Bitcoin and stablecoins, making the Argentine market a crucial arena for the adoption of cryptocurrencies. Coinbase’s regulatory sanction has put the exchange in a strong position to satisfy the growing demand for digital assets from Argentinians looking to protect their investment. Numerous Argentinians believe that cryptocurrencies could be a solution to their economic problems, according to research that Coinbase commissioned. Based on the research, 87% of Argentinians think that cryptocurrency might help them become more financially independent, and 76% think that it can help them deal with challenges like high transaction prices and inflation. Coinbase Strategy In Latin America Since more and more people and companies are using cryptocurrency for financial security, Coinbase has the chance to improve its ties with the Argentine people by registering as a CNV. Coinbase’s decision to enter Argentina is consistent with its broader strategy to expand throughout Latin America, where there has been a notable surge in the popularity of bitcoin. For the organization, which has previously established offices in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, among other Latin American countries, Argentina represents a significant turning point.

According to a January 27 statement from the research university, his focus will now shift to artificial intelligence (AI), fintech, finance, and public policy. Gensler’s New Role “I am honored to return to MIT, whose faculty, staff, and students have long been at the cutting edge of research and technology,” Gensler said following his appointment. He added that he looks forward to collaborating with scholars at the institution to drive innovation and create a better future through AI, finance, and tech. Before leading the SEC, Gensler worked at Goldman Sachs and later became a professor at MIT, where he studied the impact of AI on financial systems and published research on the risks it could pose to global finance. In his new role, the 67-year-old will co-direct the FinTech AI @CSAIL initiative alongside Professor Andrew W. Lo. This program connects companies with MIT researchers to explore AI’s role in the financial industry. Additionally, the academic will collaborate with Nobel laureate Simon Johnson to teach a course on economic topics billed as being “of great importance to the global economy.” While Gensler’s new position lacks the regulatory authority he held as the financial watchdog’s head, it is expected to be influential. MIT maintains strong partnerships with U.S. tech firms and policymakers, potentially allowing him to continue shaping discussions around finance, AI, and crypto regulations in an academic capacity. Criticism and Concern However, the ex-chair’s return to the institution has not been well received by all. Devin Walsh, executive director and co-founder of the Uniswap Foundation, condemned the decision, stating she was “incredibly embarrassed and disappointed” by the school’s rehiring of Gensler. She highlighted that her introduction to crypto happened through MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative (mitDCI), suggesting that any student of his would be wasting their time, tuition, and energy if they hoped to learn about and support new and innovative technologies. During his tenure at the SEC, Gensler shaped crypto policy through a regulation-by-enforcement approach. Under his leadership, the agency initiated over 125 enforcement actions against crypto firms, classifying many cryptocurrencies, save for Bitcoin and Ethereum , as securities and thus falling under the regulator’s purview. His actions received much criticism from the industry, with some saying that they stifled innovation and created regulatory uncertainty. However, one of the bright lights of his reign was the approval last year of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Bitcoin and Ethereum.

According to a Bloomberg report , information from sources participating in the discussions indicates the Japanese firm plans to make an investment between $15 billion and $25 billion. Details about the investment are at the initial stage and may not go through. OpenAI requires additional data centers immediately to improve its AI capabilities during increased competition. Chinese firm DeepSeek, among other emerging competitors, captured market share by providing equivalent AI capabilities with reduced expenses. At present, OpenAI depends extensively on Microsoft for its cloud computing infrastructure. Led by Masayoshi Son, SoftBank seeks an advantageous moment to enter the AI hardware business. SoftBank shares decreased by 1% in Tokyo’s market on Thursday Sam Altman of OpenAI introduced himself to SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son in 2019 when Son proposed a $1 billion investment that subsequently collapsed. The companies grew closer over their economic worries about semiconductor shortages which threaten AI development. The Vision Fund committed $500 million to OpenAI and introduced a $1.5 billion executive share buyback offer last month. The potential investment news from SoftBank provided a boost to Asian chip stocks, including Advantest Corp., but SoftBank shares decreased by 1% in Tokyo’s market on Thursday. While semiconductor-related stocks gained momentum from the news, Takehiko Masuzawa, head of equity trading at Phillip Securities Japan predicts “SoftBank, which is putting up the money, isn’t going to see the same buying momentum”.

Here’s how,https://timestabloid.com/entrepreneur-bet-on-xrp-pays-off-one-year-later-heres-how/,"Versan Aljarrah, co-founder of Black Swan Capitalist, recently shared a clip from an old interview he and Vandell Aljarrah conducted with entrepreneur Gary Cardone. In his post, Versan highlighted Cardone’s perspective on Ripple and XRP, emphasizing how his calculated investment decision aligns with XRP’s growing use case in global payments. A year ago, we interviewed Gary Cardone about Ripple. He shared that he bought XRP as an option call, betting that global institutions and banks managing the world’s capital would adopt #XRP for their payment rails. Guess what? His bet paid off. The use case speaks for itself. pic.twitter.com/nILuubWbtr — Black Swan Capitalist (@VersanAljarrah) January 28, 2025 Cardone’s Strategic View on XRP During the interview, Gary Cardone admitted to having limited knowledge of Ripple and XRP but revealed a pragmatic approach to his investment. “I literally bought XRP as a call option that the institutional payment system will want to use rails they’re familiar with, and that that could be a benefit,” he stated. Cardone explained that his XRP holdings are not significant enough to impact him financially but represent a calculated bet on adopting Ripple’s technology by major financial institutions. This perspective highlights how investors with minimal exposure to XRP still recognize its potential in transforming global payment infrastructures. Cardone’s outlook reflects a broader belief that Ripple’s solutions could appeal to institutions already managing vast amounts of capital. Ripple’s Expanding Role in Payment Systems Ripple’s payment protocol continues to gain traction worldwide, with integrations aimed at streamlining the movement of digital value. According to Versan, Ripple’s technology is being adopted by payment providers, central banks, and financial institutions to enhance cross-border transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 “We believe it’s going to play a big role in where all of this is going,” Versan noted in the interview, highlighting the growing relevance of Ripple’s solutions in addressing inefficiencies in the global financial ecosystem. The adoption of XRP as a bridge currency for these payment rails further reinforces its utility, demonstrating how blockchain technology can reduce costs and improve transaction speeds across borders. A Reflection on Cardone’s Bet Aljarrah stated in his post, “Guess what? His bet paid off. The use case speaks for itself,” highlighting XRP’s increasing adoption as validation of Cardone’s calculated decision. Over the past year, Ripple has strengthened its partnerships with financial institutions, showcasing the practical application of its payment protocol. The digital asset has also grown significantly, trading at $3.13, surging 495% from its price last year. As XRP continues to gain traction, its utility as a bridge currency and role in transforming the financial landscape becomes increasingly evident. This will be reflected in the asset’s price, as many experts have predicted massive price surges in the immediate future.

The following altcoins are being tipped to lead the way, as Rollblock ($RBLK), Ethereum, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Solana are all showing signs of phenomenal potential in the coming months. These tokens deserve an allocation in any well-balanced crypto portfolio. Here’s why Rollblock in particular is experiencing massive growth that could cause its token price to 50x this year. Rollblock ($RBLK) Ready To Change The Game In 2025 Rollblock ($ RBLK ) is a brand-new Web3 take on traditional gaming platforms that is entering a period of rapid growth. The price of $RBLK recently hit a new high of $0.052 as this revolutionary DeFi project remained unfazed by the recent crypto dip. This has come about due to the insatiable demand for $RBLK among both retail and institutional investors. The $RBLK presale has raised more than $9.7 million since its inception as it recently smashed into stage 10 of its ICO token launch. Word has spread about the revolutionary blockchain-backed approach that Rollblock offers. Since all transactions are immortalized onto the steadfast Ethereum blockchain, there can be no risk of the house manipulating any bids to their advantage. Rollblock gamers are spoiled for choice with a range of more than 7,000 classic games, from Monopoly to slot machines and poker. A sports prediction league has also gone over incredibly well with the community and added yet another lucrative revenue stream. $RBLK holders also benefit from its bullish deflationary supply. Each week, up to 30% of the platform’s profits are used to purchase $RBLK on decentralized exchanges. 60% of these tokens are immediately destroyed, which potentially removes millions of tokens from the overhanging supply each week. The remaining tokens fund a generous staking reward scheme through which committed community members can earn an attractive APY of up to 30%. $RBLK supply will continue to shrink as demand ramps up in 2025. In December alone, Rollblock detected a 600% spike in new registrations , meaning that Rollblock is one of the fastest-growing projects in the gaming space. Ethereum ($ETH) DeFi Activity On The Rise Ethereum has crashed by nearly 6% this week and is attempting to find support at $3,100 at the current time. The past month has seen a 7% drop, as trading volume has also fallen on the Ethereum chain. Just today this fell by 13% as just $20.3 billion of Ethereum changed hands in the last 24 hours. The Ethereum DeFi ecosystem is coming back to life after it was revealed that the network saw its supply of stablecoins increase by over $2 billion. This reveals a rising demand for Ethereum services, including staking and lending on-chain. Ethereum is the leading provider of DeFi services and will likely remain so for the remainder of this cycle. This uptick in demand could send the price of ETH upward of $4k in the coming weeks. Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Rolls Out Upgrade To Shib.io Shiba Inu has tumbled this week along with the rest of the highly volatile meme coin market. Shiba Inu’s price fell by 11% in the last seven days to reach $0.000018. This remains the second largest meme coin in the space behind Dogecoin. Recently developers rolled out a swap and bridge protocol on the Shib.io platform. This is the latest update of the Shiba Inu OS operating system and is set to improve the UI for users of Shiba Inu. This follows hot on the heels of the release of the TREAT airdrop for $SHIB holders. Clearly there is much innovation on this meme chain and Shiba Inu could easily become a top 10 coin in the coming months. Pepe ($PEPE) Whales Spook Holders Pepe’s value has declined by 2.3% in the last 24 hours as its price fell to $0.0000123. This has sent Pepe down to 28th position in the CoinMarketCap top crypto index and follows Pepe’s recent trend. This meme is down by more than 20% in a month. Pepe has been more volatile than usual recently as the market was spooked by the movement of over 1.1 trillion Pepe tokens, which were sent to Binance in a single transaction. Pepe’s concentration of large holders is particularly high, meaning that whales have the ability to move the market with their moves. Once the selling stops, then Pepe should see a decent bounce and could well regain the important $0.000017 price point. Solana ($SOL) Trumps Its Rivals With Presidential Nod Solana has fallen by 11% in the last week, having faced significant selling pressure after its recent sprint to all-time highs. Solana is currently trading at $227, which still represents a 21% gain on the monthly time frame. Much of Solana’s recent rally was attributed to the Trump effect, as the incoming president used the Solana chain to launch his very own meme coin last week. Trump’s coin was a huge vindication for Solana, which now enjoys the presidential stamp of approval. Solana is likely to remain the chain of choice for PoliFi tokens, as politicians of all parties are now likely to follow suit and launch a token. Many analysts are confident that Solana could see a four-figure price tag this cycle. Rollblock Will Deliver Life-Changing Gains This Year Heading into 2025 and what is likely to be the most parabolic stage in the crypto cycle, investors should consider allocating to Ethereum, Shiba Inu, Pepe, and Solana before the coming blow-off top. However, Rollblock ($RBLK) stands out as a golden opportunity thanks to its rapidly rising adoption and comparatively smaller size, which will enable it to grow many multiples from its current bargain-bin valuation. Experts have recently doubled down on their 50x price predictions for $RBLK, as many now see the $1 level as a lock. Stage 10 tokens are already flying off the shelves at $0.052 as demand is far outpacing the supply. Discover the Exciting Opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) Presale Today!

Musk Buys Solana (MUSKSOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because MUSKSOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Musk Buys Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Musk Buys Solana could become the next viral memecoin. Musk Buys Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Musk Buys Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Musk Buys Solana by entering its contract address (CA) – HZgXdFhQK1KTn8wM6hfRPtyGuKskETTzWM31qAdXJVRV – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like MUSKSOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|DOGE|TRADING|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-30 05:28:00

As long as XRP holds above the $3levels, the current bullish scenario remains plausible, with the expectation of moving towards the upside. While the primary scenario is bullish, there is a possibility that the market could still be in a corrective phase. In the short term, XRP has shown a strong reaction to support and is currently in a pullback phase. After a 20% move up from a support area, the price has encountered a minor pullback. It is important to monitor the micro-level support and the potential for the price to continue its upward trajectory. Micro Support Levels: $2.76 – $2.97: These are the immediate support levels for the current pullback. XRP should ideally not break below $2.76 in the short term to maintain the bullish outlook. If the price holds within this range and forms a higher low, it will signal a continuation of the bullish trend. Upside Price Targets: Breakout and Bullish Continuation Should the pullback hold and the price find support above the $2.76 level, the price could see a potential breakout to the upside. The following price targets are critical for confirming the continuation of the bullish trend: Resistance and Target Levels: $3.40: A breakout above this level would be a key signal for further upside movement. This level has already proven to be a significant resistance point in recent price action. $3.42: This level represents the 138% retracement of the previous wave and acts as a crucial resistance point. $4.20: The next Fibonacci resistance level above $3.40. A successful breakout above $3.40 would likely bring XRP to test this level. $5.00: The ultimate upside target for XRP, based on larger Fibonacci extensions.

The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) has announced its expansion into financial services and cryptocurrency under the brand Truth.Fi, offering managed accounts, ETFs, and digital asset services. At the same time, President Donald Trump’s official meme coin, TRUMP, is now accepted for purchases of branded merchandise, marking a new step in integrating crypto into his business ecosystem. These moves show the administration’s growing embrace of digital assets, a notable shift from Trump’s earlier skepticism toward cryptocurrencies. However, they have also raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, given the Trump family’s significant holdings in the sector. Trump Expands Crypto Footprint: Official Meme Coin TRUMP Now Accepted for Merchandise In a move that further integrates cryptocurrency into his business ventures, US President Donald Trump has tied his official meme coin, Official Trump (TRUMP), to a range of merchandise, allowing holders to purchase sneakers, watches, and fragrances using the token. This shift not only strengthens Trump’s crypto presence but also marks a stark contrast to his earlier stance, when he dismissed crypto as being “based on thin air.” According to a Jan. 29 Bloomberg report, three websites —GetTrumpSneakers.com, GetTrumpWatches.com, and GetTrumpFragrances.com—now accept payments in TRUMP and Bitcoin (BTC). These platforms, reportedly owned by CIC Ventures LLC, a Trump-linked company, represent a significant push by the 47th president into digital assets. The Trump meme coin (TRUMP) initially emerged as a speculative asset, primarily traded as a political statement or a show of support. However, by incorporating direct utility—enabling TRUMP holders to buy branded products—President Trump is taking a step further into the crypto-commerce sector. Blockchain data from Solscan indicates that TRUMP currently has around 700,000 holders, though reports suggest that 80% of the total supply remains in the hands of Trump Organization affiliates. This level of control over a major cryptocurrency asset raises questions about potential market influence and financial implications. Trump’s involvement in digital assets extends beyond meme coins. His Web3 initiatives date back to 2022, when he released a series of non-fungible token (NFT) collections, capitalizing on blockchain-based collectibles. Since then, his ventures have grown significantly. Most notably, the Trump family has been linked to World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform that has been on a cryptocurrency buying spree in recent months. Additionally, First Lady Melania Trump has debuted her own meme coin, MELANIA, further signaling the family’s strategic commitment to digital assets. Trump’s crypto-friendly stance appears to be resonating with the digital asset community. He has already taken several steps to legitimize and support the crypto industry, including: Pardoning Ross Ulbricht, the creator of Silk Road, the infamous dark net marketplace. Launching a working group to explore the feasibility of a national digital asset reserve. Directing the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to form a dedicated crypto task force, a shift away from the enforcement-heavy approach seen during the Biden administration. The shift marks a profound change in federal regulatory policy toward crypto assets, positioning Trump as the first US president to actively promote and integrate cryptocurrency into the mainstream economy. Despite the enthusiasm from the crypto sector, critics warn that Trump’s deepening involvement in digital assets could present a serious conflict of interest. Danielle Brian, head of the watchdog group Project On Government Oversight, voiced concerns over the president’s financial entanglement with the industry. Watchdogs have also highlighted that the Trump family’s control over the majority of TRUMP’s supply raises ethical concerns about potential price manipulation or policy decisions that could benefit their personal holdings. Crypto’s Growing Political Influence Trump’s embrace of cryptocurrency comes at a time when digital assets are playing an increasingly significant role in US politics. With the industry growing in influence, both Democrats and Republicans are beginning to adopt clearer positions on regulation, taxation, and institutional adoption of blockchain technology. Earlier this month, Senator Elizabeth Warren and other lawmakers called for an investigation into Trump’s crypto-related financial dealings, further intensifying the scrutiny on how digital assets intersect with politics and governance. With meme coins, NFTs, DeFi, and now a crypto-friendly regulatory push, Trump’s administration is undeniably steering the US towards a new digital asset economy. However, how crypto regulation under Trump will unfold remains to be seen. Will his administration continue to encourage crypto adoption, or will concerns over conflicts of interest and centralization lead to increased oversight? One thing is certain—crypto is no longer a niche market; it’s a mainstream economic and political force. Trump Media and Technology Group Expands Into Crypto and Finance With Truth.Fi In related news, the Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), a media conglomerate partially owned by US President Trump , has officially announced its expansion into financial services and cryptocurrency under the brand Truth.Fi. The move signals a growing commitment by Trump and his inner circle to the digital asset industry and aligns with the administration’s broader push to reshape financial regulations around crypto. According to the Jan. 29 announcement , Truth.Fi will provide: Separately managed accounts in partnership with Charles Schwab, Customized exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tailored for investors, and Cryptocurrency services integrated into the platform. This expansion marks another bold step in Trump’s post-presidential business empire, further embedding digital assets within the economic landscape of his presidency. TMTG CEO Devin Nunes, who also serves as chairman of the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, framed the expansion as a mission to protect Americans from financial censorship and “debanking.” The move comes amid increased government scrutiny over digital assets, as well as growing concerns about financial exclusion in the traditional banking sector. By positioning Truth.Fi as an alternative, TMTG appears to be capitalizing on Trump’s pro-crypto stance while challenging Big Tech and centralized financial institutions. The launch of Truth.Fi follows months of speculation that Trump-linked enterprises would enter the cryptocurrency space. In September 2024, President Trump unveiled World Liberty Financial, a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, which has since become a major crypto investor. A $394 Million Crypto War Chest According to Arkham Intelligence , World Liberty Financial has already accumulated over $394 million worth of cryptocurrencies, including: 62,000 ETH (~$3,151 per ETH) 646 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) (~$101,928 per WBTC) 19,000 Lido Staked Ether (stETH) (~$3,147 per stETH) On Jan. 20—the day of Trump’s second inauguration—World Liberty Financial purchased over $100 million in ETH and WBTC, doubling down on its crypto holdings. The Trump family's deepening ties to Ethereum have not gone unnoticed. The DeFi platform has also acquired Trump-related Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains, such as: barrontrump.eth erictrump.eth trumpcoin.eth worldliberty.eth These acquisitions have sparked speculation that Trump and his family may eventually launch new business ventures on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin commented on the Trump family's strategic focus on ETH, suggesting they could be building Ethereum-based applications. However, no official announcements have been made about specific Ethereum-based projects from the Trump family. Trump's deepening involvement in cryptocurrency, financial services, and decentralized finance has sparked a range of reactions across the political and financial sectors. For crypto enthusiasts, Trump’s push into digital assets and blockchain technology represents a pivotal moment for the industry. Under his administration, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has shifted away from enforcement-driven regulation, forming a dedicated crypto task force to create a comprehensive regulatory framework. For critics, Trump’s expanding financial empire presents conflict of interest concerns. With Truth.Fi offering crypto services and Trump-affiliated businesses holding significant stakes in major digital assets, some watchdog groups are raising alarms over potential policy influence. Despite the controversy, Trump’s continued embrace of digital assets has resonated with a large base of crypto investors and entrepreneurs. With Truth.Fi and World Liberty Financial now fully operational, it’s evident that Trump is positioning cryptocurrency at the center of his economic strategy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ETH|BUSINESS|TECHNOLOGY|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-30 05:30:00

Tesla, one of the largest corporate Bitcoin holders, has reported a massive $600 million gain on its holdings in Q4 2024, thanks to a new accounting rule that allows firms to reflect the market value of their crypto assets. Tesla’s Bitcoin Value Surges Tesla’s financial report for Q4 2024, released on Jan. 29, shows that its Bitcoin holdings are now worth over $1 billion. This is a major jump from the previously recorded $184 million. The company currently holds 9,720 BTC, according to Bitcoin Treasuries . Bitcoin Holdings by Category: Who Holds What? Tesla first bought Bitcoin in 2021, accumulating 42,902 BTC before selling 75% of its holdings in 2022 for $936 million. Other companies, such as Semler Scientific, Genius Group, and Rumble, have adopted Bitcoin as part of their treasury strategy. However, MicroStrategy remains the largest corporate Bitcoin holder, with 471,000 BTC worth around $48 billion. Now let’s dive into the different categories. Bitcoin’s 21 million total supply , around 1.34 million BTC is held by ETFs, ETFs hold the largest share, followed by governments, public companies, and Private firms, along with BTC mining companies and DeFi platforms. Bitcoin Holdings by Category Source : Bitcoin Treasuries New Rule Changes How Bitcoin Is Recorded However this new rule by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), introduced in December 2023, now allows companies to report the market value of their crypto holdings. Before this, firms had to record losses if Bitcoin’s price dropped but couldn’t recognize gains unless they sold the asset. This change provides a more accurate picture of companies’ financial positions and has significantly benefited Tesla. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Senator Lummis Urges US Action as Czech Republic Moves to Adopt Bitcoin Reserve , Tesla’s Q4 Earnings Fall Short Despite the Bitcoin boost, Tesla’s total Q4 revenue came in at $25.71 billion, a 2% increase from last year but below analyst expectations of $27.22 billion. The company also reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.73, slightly missing the projected $0.76. Operating expenses rose to $2.59 billion, marking a 9% increase from the previous quarter. After the earnings release, Tesla’s stock (TSLA) dropped by 2.26%. However, after-hours trading saw a rebound of 4.44%, bringing the stock to $406.36. Over the past year, Tesla’s share price has surged by 103.79%, reaching an all-time high of $479 in December. This massive accumulation by companies is a sign of growing interest in the asset which created a global interest in adding Bitcoin to their mainstream finance to support their economy. Moreover, many US regions have already passed Bitcoin Strategic Reserve plans like Utah and Arizona. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

The narrative, however, differs in the crypto market, where such selling indicates bullishness, according to analysts observing historical trends in the supply held by long-term investors or wallets holding coins for at least 155 days or over five months. ""Based on our analysis, sharp declines in long-term holder supply (purple line) have frequently coincided with strong bitcoin rallies (white line), as seen in Q1 and Q4 of 2024. As long as long-term holders continue reducing their balances, Bitcoin remains at risk of a short squeeze to the upside,"" Markus Thielen, founder of 10x Research , said in a report shared with CoinDesk. The total supply held by these wallets has dropped to roughly 13 million BTC. According to analytics firm Glassnode, over 1 million BTC have changed hands during the recent price rise above $100,000 as short-term traders snapped up the long-term holder distribution. ""During the recent rally above $100K, 1.1M BTC have transferred from long-term to short-term holders, representing an impressive inflow of demand to absorb this supply at prices above $90K,"" Glassnode said in its weekly report. Note, however, that the pace at which long-term holders are selling has slowed. This slowdown is evident from the monthly rate of change in the long-term to short-term holder supply ratio. It's no longer as harmful as it was earlier this month, indicating a more measured approach to selling by long-term holders. Exchange balance slides The number of BTC held in wallets tied to centralized exchanges has declined to 2.7 million BTC from over three million about six months ago, according to Glassnode. The exodus of BTC from exchanges, which results in reduced availability of coins for quick sales, is widely viewed as a bullish indicator. The dynamics, however, have changed since the debut of spot ETFs in the U.S. a year ago. ""While many interpret this as a form of supply shock caused by a mass of coins being withdrawn by individual investors—potentially creating upward price pressure—we believe the majority of this decline stems from coins reshuffling into ETF wallets managed by custodians like Coinbase,"" Glassnode said. In other words, these coins have ended up in an ETF, an alternative investment vehicle that is liquid or active and can be bought and sold just as quickly as actual coins. Per Glassnode, the exchange balance adjusted for coins that have been moved to alternative vehicles is over 3 million BTC.",Markets|Bitcoin|Markets|Blockchain,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-30 05:57:32

The milestone comes amid growing investor interest and an evolving crypto landscape shaped by technological advancements and market dynamics. Bitcoin ($BTC) recently experienced a dip to a weekly low of $100,768 following Donald Trump’s return to office, with no mention of cryptocurrency in his opening remarks. However, it has since recovered to $104,000 at the time of writing. Despite this initial market reaction, analysts remain optimistic, projecting that Trump’s second term could pave the way for a new “golden era” of cryptocurrency growth. No-one actually listened to what Trump said. Instead they’re all tweeting “Trump doesn’t know much about Trump coin” when: > He acknowledges it > Knows he launched it > Says 7 billion is peanuts Watch $TRUMP remain very bullish imo. pic.twitter.com/Ltr7FNzUJt — hoeem (@crypthoem) January 21, 2025 Amid these changes, having a state-of-the-art crypto wallet is more essential than ever, and Best Wallet is quickly emerging as a top choice for investors.

Furthermore, industry leaders like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong and Senator Cynthia Lummis continue to advocate for the development of a US-based Bitcoin reserve, which could drive global competition and increase Bitcoin’s valuation. Brian Armstrong at WEF makes a compelling case – a strategic Bitcoin reserve would position the US to lead in the digital economy era while strengthening national financial security.

The SEC will now officially begin the review process. Before rendering a decision, the regulatory body will take into account market risks, investor protections, and other compliance with financial rules. Eric Balchunas, Senior ETF Analyst at Bloomberg, says the SEC will open a public comment period, have several review phases to finish, and can approve, reject, or postpone the decision for up to a combined 240 days. He also notes that just the LTC ETF received the temporary acknowledgement on the ETF among all the other filings. First alt coin 19b-4 to be acknowledged, rest were told to withdraw by Genz SEC.

In 2018 and 2022, it also showcased -73.3% and -64.3% changes, respectively. This implies that the Bitcoin market follows a four-year boom and bust cycle. In short, every fourth year, the market experiences a crash. In that sense, the year 2026 may be a tough year for BTC. A recent statement from Matt Hougan, the Global Head of Research for Bitwise Asset Management, indicates that not many experts believe BTC would experience a severe crash in 2016. Why? Curious to know more? Read on! Bitcoin’s Traditional 4-Year Cycle Explained The -57.6% change that the Bitcoin market recorded in 2014 was the lowest in the first cycle. In 2011 and 2012, the market experienced +1,435% and +183.5% change, respectively. In 2013, the third year of the cycle, the market demonstrated a massive growth of +5,435%. Likewise, the -73.3% decline that the BTC market registered in 2018 was the lowest in the second cycle. In 2015 and 2016, the market saw +34.4% and +123.8%, respectively. In 2017, the market reported an impressive growth of +1,369%. The scenario was not different in the third cycle, in which the market reported a change of -64.3% in the fourth year (2022), except for the market’s inability to perform better than second year’s +304.1 in the third year (+59.6%). Causes of the Past Crypto Market Crashes One of the primary reasons for the Bitcoin market’s collapse in 2014 was the failure of Mt. Gox. In 2018, the main reason was the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crackdown on Initial Coin Offerings. In 2022, the cause was the bankruptcies of major players like FTX, Three Arrows Capital, Celsius and BlockFi. Could the Bitcoin Cycle Change? Considering the historical trend, it is reasonable to expect a crash in 2026. Then, why do experts like Matt Hougan disagree? Well! Hougan’s primary argument is that the crypto market is far more mature than it was in 2014, 2018 or 2022. The political climate in the US shifted in favour of the crypto industry after Donald Trump’s victory last November . Soon after assuming office as the president of the United States, he signed an executive order , aimed at bringing more clarity to the crypto regulation framework and exploring the possibility of creating a digital assets reserve for the country. Experts like Hougan believe that this development could bring trillions of dollars into the Bitcoin market. Highlighting the favourable environment created by the withdrawal of the controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 rule , which required financial firms holding crypto to record them as liabilities on their balance sheets, Hougan, in a recent statement, shared his extreme optimistic view about the BTC market. However, he added that Bitcoin may not see the impact of these developments immediately. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Tesla Bitcoin Holding Sees Explosive Growth, Boosting Q4 Earnings by $600 Million , Bitcoin’s Price Prediction Hougan forecasted that the Bitcoin market will reach as high as $200,000 before the end of this year 2025. Interestingly, he claimed that the creation of a Bitcoin reserve by the US is not a prerequisite to achieving this price milestone. Bitcoin’s four-year cycle has been a strong pattern in the past, but Trump’s crypto-friendly policies and Wall Street’s increasing involvement may change the game. While 2026 could still bring volatility, experts believe the market is stronger than ever. With predictions of $200,000 BTC by 2025, the coming years could reshape the future of crypto. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

""President Trump has asked us to study that issue, so we are not ready to comment on it yet. But it's one of the things our working groups are going to look at,"" Sacks said in a recent appearance on Fox. Senator Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican who is known for her bitcoin-friendly policy stance, has submitted a bill proposing the creation of a reserve, but this is a separate measure from the White House's efforts. The bill proposes establishing a ""Bitcoin Purchase Program"" of up to 200,000 BTC a year over a five-year period, and will be partially funded by revaluing Federal Reserve's gold, CoinDesk previously reported . Right now the bill is before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. Among the supporters of such a move is MicroStrategy's (MSTR) Michael Saylor, who said the plan will protect the dollar. “The best way to protect the dollar is make sure you retire the debt and become rich,"" said the MicroStrategy (MSTR) executive chairman during a November conference . ""The next best way to protect the dollar is to make sure that if anybody ever considers a different capital asset other than the treasury bill, you own it.""

The legislative change comes as part of the country’s commitment to conditions set in its $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF. According to Reuters , lawmakers passed the bill just minutes after President Nayib Bukele sent it to the Legislative Assembly on Jan. 29. El Salvador Drops Bitcoin Mandate for Businesses The reform, approved by 55 votes in favor and only two against, eliminates the legal requirement for businesses to accept Bitcoin as payment, making its use optional for private merchants. Elisa Rosales, a ruling party lawmaker, emphasized that the amendment ensures Bitcoin’s “permanence as legal tender” while refining its practical implementation. Despite the IMF-driven policy shift, El Salvador continues to expand its Bitcoin holdings, recently acquiring 12 BTC for its national reserves. An official from the country’s Bitcoin Office told Cointelegraph last month that the government intends to continue purchasing Bitcoin, with an intensified strategy planned for 2025. El Salvador's Congress has quickly approved legislation to amend its Bitcoin laws to comply with an agreement with the IMF to adjust its cryptocurrency exposure.

The portfolio has reportedly yielded a 127% profit. El Salvador made history in 2021 by becoming the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. Meanwhile, on the same day Congress passed the amendment, former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez—who had opposed El Salvador’s Bitcoin adoption—was sentenced to 11 years in prison for bribery involving gold bars and cash, according to the Associated Press. FBI agents reportedly discovered $480,000 in cash and gold bars worth $150,000 at his home. Notably, El Salvador’s National Bitcoin Office Director, Stacy Herbert, indicated in a Dec. 19 social media post that the country could accelerate its Bitcoin acquisitions. The government has also clarified it has no plans to sell its holdings, reaffirming that Bitcoin remains central to its economic strategy. The Chivo wallet, El Salvador’s official Bitcoin wallet, will reportedly be sold or phased out, with private-sector wallets expected to fill the gap. New Hampshire and North Dakota Latest U.S. States to Propose Bitcoin Reserves New Hampshire and North Dakota have introduced legislation to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves, marking a growing trend among U.S. states to diversify their treasuries with cryptocurrency. Previously, Ohio proposed adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves , following the introduction of a new bill by House Republican leader Derek Merrin. Likewise, on 12 December 2024, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which proposes that the state comptroller hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset for at least five years. Pennsylvania took a similar step in November, with Representative Mike Cabell proposing a bill to allow its treasury to allocate up to 10% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin, citing the asset’s potential to hedge against economic uncertainty.

The local media reports that a person referred to by the initials “JL” sued the exchange platform for refusing to return his €67,550 investment. Judge María Ángeles Velázquez, who presided over the case, was satisfied that JL presented sufficient criminal motive in his arguments on Binance . Spanish judge opens investigation into Binance over €67,550 misappropriation claim Binance is facing court claims of market manipulation, and it is supposed to comply with the responses to these claims. The head of the 27th Court of Instruction of Madrid, María Ángeles Velázquez, stated that there are enough criminal motives. Because of the circumstances, the court has not commented further on the case. Velázquez granted the wishes of JL, a Spanish businessman who had filed a case against Binance in 2023. JL was aggrieved that the exchange stole his €67,550 investment in their platform. The businessman claims he deposited money on the exchange platform, but it never issued him an access code. He said he resorted to court two years after attempting to retrieve his money in vain. The Judge’s order is a progressive step for JL, who now must present sufficient evidence in 10 days and request penalties. After the evidence is presented, the Judge will determine if it is sufficient to institute a legal battle in the Spanish courts. However, the ruling may be entirely dismissed if JL offers insufficient evidence. Binance faces several lawsuits across the globe The Spanish judge launched a new investigation into Binance just a day after a French court ordered inquiries into the exchange platform for money laundering. On Tuesday, Paris prosecutors said investigators would check whether Binance failed to fulfill its know-your-client obligations and, therefore, allowed laundering to take place on its platform. The exchange denied the claims and stated that it would vigorously fight any charges against it. Paris prosecutors also said in their statement that the investigation will also focus on whether Binance unlawfully acted as a digital-asset service provider before it secured regulatory approval from France in 2022. The allegations under examination began as early as 2019 in France and throughout the European Union. A few weeks ago, Binance faced a similar case in the US, where the Supreme Court allowed a class action lawsuit to proceed. Former investors accused the exchange of illegally selling unregistered tokens. Binance had argued that the lawsuit was invalid since the US didn’t have jurisdiction over the case. Despite its legal challenges, Binance is striving to rebuild. Binance Labs has rebranded as an “independent” research institution, enabling CZ to join despite his official lifetime ban from the exchange.

Trump Buys SUI (TRUMPSUI), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 17,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMPSUI is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump Buys SUI can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump Buys SUI could become the next viral memecoin. Trump Buys SUI launched with over $29,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump Buys SUI on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet and swap Solana for Trump Buys SUI by entering its contract address (CA) – 7chY3Yw9cArR4CGQQ2N6mciszZvWB3rW6WoBNTfwyitu – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMPSUI. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,SHIB|SOL|SUI|BUSINESS|DOGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-30 06:55:00

SEC’s Shocking Move After Gensler’s Exit!,https://coinpedia.org/news/litecoin-etf-in-the-works-secs-shocking-move-after-genslers-exit/,"The post Litecoin ETF in the Works? SEC’s Shocking Move After Gensler’s Exit! appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The US cryptocurrency market is heating up with a flood of new ETF applications in 2025. From Solana to Ripple, asset managers like VanEck, ProShares, and others are racing to bring you the next wave of investment opportunities in digital assets. The U.S. SEC is currently reviewing a proposal for the Canary Litecoin ETF, marking a potential step toward approval. This move follows the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, signaling growing regulatory openness to altcoin-based investment products. The SEC has opened a public comment period for feedback on the proposed ETF, which aims to simplify Litecoin investing for mainstream investors. This massive flow came right after Gensler’s exit which shows institutions are back in action. Is this the start of a regulatory breakthrough? Institutions are gearing up for the next big move—bullish sentiment is through the roof! Let’s get into the details of the first-ever altcoin ETF prospect. A New Chapter for Crypto ETFs? Canary Capital’s Litecoin ETF is the first altcoin ETF filing to be officially reviewed, according to Bloomberg’s Senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. If approved, it would let investors buy Litecoin without needing to deal with crypto wallets or security keys. Instead, they could trade it like a regular stock, making Litecoin investing much easier. First alt coin 19b-4 to be acknowledged, rest were told to withdraw by Genz SEC. Throw in the comments from SEC on the S-1 and this filing is by far the furthest along checking all the boxes. Q now is will this SEC wait the full 240 days or approve more rapidly. Unknown. https://t.co/iXwq9PkLGr — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) January 29, 2025 This initiative follows Canary Capital’s previous attempt to launch an XRP-based ETF. Meanwhile, other companies are also pushing for crypto ETFs , including funds for Solana and XRP. Some firms have even proposed ETFs for memecoins linked to Donald Trump and Melania Trump, as interest in crypto investment grows. SEC’s Changing Leadership and Crypto Outlook The SEC has been strict on crypto in the past, especially under former Chair Gary Gensler . But now, with Mark Uyeda as the acting Chair and Hester Peirce leading a new crypto task force, things might be changing for betterment. The fact that the SEC is even considering a Litecoin ETF could mean they are becoming more open to crypto investments. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Gensler’s Exit Opens Door for XRP, Solana ETFs, But Litecoin May Lead the Way , The ETF Approval Process Nasdaq filed a 19b-4 application for the Canary Litecoin ETF on January 15, marking a crucial phase in the approval process. This filing allows self-regulatory organizations like Nasdaq to propose rule changes for new financial products. The SEC now has up to 240 days to approve or reject the ETF, though some speculate the decision could come sooner. How the Canary Litecoin ETF Works The ETF is designed to track the CoinDesk Litecoin Price Index (LTX) and would hold Litecoin through a secure custody framework. Instead of buying Litecoin directly, investors would own shares in the ETF, making it simpler and safer to invest. Special financial firms would handle large purchases and redemptions using cash, keeping things smooth and regulated. If approved, this Litecoin ETF could be a big step for crypto, making it easier for regular investors to get involved without dealing with the complexities of digital wallets. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

According to Reuters , El Salvador Congress has approved the reforms within minutes of receiving them from President Nayib Bukele, aligning the country’s Bitcoin policies with the terms of its $1.4 billion loan agreement with the IMF. El Salvador, once locked out of traditional financial markets due to its high debt and unconventional Bitcoin experiment, had little choice but to seek a lifeline. With soaring bond yields and limited access to fresh capital, the IMF deal became a necessary pivot to support the government’s economic overhaul agenda The move was necessary to ensure Bitcoin’s “permanence as legal tender” while facilitating its “practical implementation,” said ruling party lawmaker Elisa Rosales as the amendment was passed with 55 votes in favor. Under the amended legislation, businesses are no longer mandated to accept Bitcoin as payment, thereby making its use voluntary. It also restricts tax payments to U.S. dollars and paves the way for scaling back government-led crypto initiatives, including the state-backed Chivo wallet . Nevertheless, Bitcoin remains a legal tender in the nation as it continues to accumulate more of the flagship currency. According to data from the National Bitcoin Office, El Salvador currently holds 6,049 BTC, valued at approximately $633 million, with an unrealized profit of 127%.

At the time, the National Bitcoin Office’s director, Stacy Herbert, said the country plans to accumulate Bitcoin at an “accelerated pace.” As a part of its latest purchase, the country added 12 BTC on Jan. 21. El Salvador adds another 11 BTC to our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve! 🇸🇻🚀 https://t.co/6NnNIdJtY5 — The Bitcoin Office (@bitcoinofficesv) January 20, 2025 El Salvador became the first nation to accept Bitcoin as legal tender on Sept. 6, 2021, and has since launched several crypto-focused initiatives to integrate Bitcoin into its economy. The government has installed over 200 Bitcoin ATMs, making the country one of the most Bitcoin-friendly regions for transactions. Other initiatives include Volcano Energy , a Bitcoin mining project that uses renewable energy from volcanic sources to mine Bitcoin, and Volcano Bonds , a Bitcoin-backed bond initiative designed to raise funds for infrastructure projects and the development of Bitcoin City—a proposed tax-free crypto hub powered by geothermal energy. On January 13, crypto industry giant Tether Group said it would relocate its entire operations to El Salvador after it secures a Digital Asset Service Provider license in El Salvador via Bitfinex Derivatives, its Seychelles-based affiliate.

In a lengthy blog post , Paradigm CTO and General Partner Georgios Konstantopoulos, Managing Partner Matt Huang, and General Partners Dan Robinson and Charlie Noyes argue that by deliberately slowing updates, Ethereum endangers its ability to stay competitive. “It’s easy to forget that the first version of the Ethereum protocol shipped in less than two years—a pace that drew many of us to the project as a developer platform in the first place,” they write. “But today, we think Ethereum’s core protocol could be improving much faster… without sacrificing its values.” To continue reading this as well as other DeFi and Web3 news, visit us at thedefiant.io",,EN,0,0,ETH|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'The Defiant', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/101/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thedefiant,2025-01-30 07:05:40

Nearly 5% of all tokens launched across various networks in 2024 year had patterns similar to pump-and-dump schemes, blockchain forensic firm Chainalysis claims. In a blog post on Jan. 29, the New York-based firm revealed that more than 3 million tokens were launched in 2024, with nearly 1.3 million (over 40%) listed on decentralized exchanges. Monthly number of tokens associated with pump-and-dump schemes on select blockchains | Source: Chainalysis Despite the figure, only a small fraction — just 1.7% — has been actively traded in the last 30 days. Chainalysis suggests the gap could be because many tokens were “abandoned shortly after creation,” possibly due to lack of interest. The analysts also note that some of these tokens could have been part of short-lived schemes such as pump-and-dumps or rug pulls. “It is also possible that some of these tokens facilitate intentional short-lived schemes designed to exploit initial hype before fading away, also known as pump-and-dumps or rug pulls.” Chainalysis You might also like: Over 72% of PENGU holders dump all tokens immediately after launch On top of that, nearly 90% of decentralized exchange pools suspected of being involved in pump-and-dump schemes were “rugged” by the address that created the DEX pool, Chainalysis note. The rest were rugged by addresses funded by the pool or token creator. In some cases, the pool creator and the address that rugged the pool seemed to be funded by the same source, suggesting a coordinated effort to exploit users. The analysts point out that the wash trading volume across Ethereum , BNB Chain , and Coinbase’s Base reached about $2.57 billion in 2024, though the firm acknowledges using “different methodologies” to detect various types of wash trading.

However, its macro bullish trend remains intact but the market is still under correction. The past week marked another major milestone for Ray as it exploded significantly to a new high of $8.7 after taking a little break. It later failed to advance above the mentioned high and cooled off at once. This led to a sharp decline and the price entered a pullback mode. Up till now, the asset is still yet to find a solid ground. Although the $6.2 level has provided a temporary support since the start of the week, there’s no assurance if it will hold. A strong hold above this temporal support could bring buying pressure back in the market while the bulls slowly regroup. If that happens, we can expect another bullish phase until the market reaches an overbought condition on the daily chart. On the other hand, Ray may continue to lose momentum daily. A drop below the $6 level should set the market for a bigger loss until the asset finds a strong threshold to initiate a buy. Ray’s price may look weak daily, but it is important to note that its long-term structure remains bullish. RAY’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview As it stands now, Ray is facing down, eyeing the minor $5.85 level. Losing this minor level could drag the price down to the $4.78 support and potentially $3.8 in the near term before bouncing back. While there’s currently no move to the upside, the potential resistance level for a test is $7.42 and $8.7. If those level flips, a new high may come around $10 or even beyond.

The historical correlation between Bitcoin’s bull rally and the altseason has continued to grow negatively due to the extreme dilution of liquidity by thousands of new altcoins in the market. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs and spot ETH ETFs in the United States last year has made it more difficult for the crypto cash rotation to thrive akin to previous macro bull markets. As a result, the next altcoin season , led by Ethereum, will be fueled by new cash inflows to projects with better fundamentals and prospects of real-world utility. Ethereum Whales Remain Timid in the Short Term Since the beginning of 2025, the overall supply of Ether on centralized exchanges has increased from 15.39 million to about 16.04 million at the time of this writing. The notable increase in Ether supply on CEXes has continued to weigh down on bullish sentiment. Furthermore, the overall cash flow to the US spot Ether ETFs has continued to shrink in the past few weeks. Since the beginning of this week, the US spot Ether ETFs have registered a net cash outflow of about $141 million. According to on-chain data analysis by Glassnode , long-term Ether investors have started to feel anxious after depicting belief and denial in the last three months. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Bitcoin, Ethereum, & XRP Price Today: Will the Bulls Maintain Dominance? , What’s Next for ETH? As Bitcoin dominance continues to gain more ground against the majority of the altcoins, crypto analyst Benjamin Cowen has predicted a major downturn for Ether before a bullish recovery in the near future. Moreover, Cowen noted that the Federal Reserve did not kick start its Quantitative Easing (QE) program akin to the Canadian counterpart. One risk for #ETH is if the Fed comes out this week and says no QE, maybe that would cause ETH to finally go home on its USD pair, leading the Fed to reverse course in March 2025 causing a quick recovery.

Recent events highlight the volatility in the space, with some projects surging in value while others struggle to maintain momentum. The launch of Abstract, an Ethereum layer-2 network by Igloo Inc., has impacted the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem, leading to a steep decline in both the PENGU token and Pudgy Penguins NFTs. The PENGU token has dropped 24% in just 24 hours and is down 49% over the past month, settling at $0.0173. Meanwhile, Pudgy Penguins NFTs on Ethereum have declined by 20% in a single day and 39% over the past week, with the floor price now hovering around $37,950. While some meme coins face downturns, others are thriving. One such rising star is BTFD Coin , a project that has gained strong community backing and is making waves with its impressive staking rewards. BTFD offers a massive 90% APY staking incentive, making it an attractive option for investors looking for both short-term gains and long-term potential. With a growing user base, successful presale performance, and a well-structured ecosystem, BTFD is positioning itself as one of the best new meme coins to join now. BTFD Coin: Unlocking High Returns with 90% APY Staking BTFD Coin is gaining significant traction as one of the best new meme coins to join now. Unlike many meme tokens that rely purely on hype, BTFD is integrating a broader ecosystem that includes high-yield staking, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and a dedicated community known as the Bulls Squad. This multi-faceted approach ensures that the project has real value beyond short-term speculation. One of BTFD’s biggest selling points is its 90% APY staking reward. Staking allows investors to earn passive income while contributing to the network’s stability. The high staking rewards set BTFD apart from many other meme coins, offering holders the opportunity to significantly grow their holdings simply by locking up their tokens. Additionally, the project’s P2E game provides another avenue for earning rewards, further strengthening its ecosystem. BTFD Coin’s presale numbers demonstrate its strong investor confidence. Currently in its 14th presale stage, BTFD is priced at $0.00016 per token. The presale has already raised over $5.78 million, attracting more than 9,800 investors. Over 68 billion BTFD tokens have been sold, signaling a growing adoption rate and strong market enthusiasm. To maximize their holdings, investors can take advantage of the LAUNCH100 bonus code, which doubles the number of tokens purchased. For instance, an investor buying 25 million BTFD tokens for $4,000 would receive an additional 25 million tokens, totaling 50 million. If the price of BTFD rises to $0.0006 per token, that initial $4,000 investment would be worth $30,000. With its attractive staking rewards, successful presale, and engaged community, BTFD is one of the best new meme coins to join now. Dogs: A Growing Contender in the Meme Coin Arena Dogs (DOGS) is making its mark in the meme coin landscape, standing out as a project that is working to integrate decentralized finance (DeFi) elements into its ecosystem. While many meme coins struggle with sustainability beyond the initial hype, Dogs aims to provide real utility by allowing its token to be used in various Web3 applications. This approach has helped it gain traction among both speculative traders and long-term investors looking for meme coins with added value. At present, Dogs is trading at approximately $0.00028073, reflecting a minor 0.03846% decline from the previous close. The token’s intraday high reached $0.00029338, while its low sat at $0.0002589. Despite minor fluctuations, Dogs has maintained steady trading volume, suggesting that investors remain engaged. The ability of Dogs to sustain interest amid market corrections makes it an interesting token to watch, especially as the broader meme coin market experiences waves of volatility. However, meme coins are known for their unpredictable price swings, and investors should approach them with careful consideration. While Dogs shows promise, success in the meme coin market often depends on community engagement, sustained hype, and strategic partnerships. With the growing interest in new meme coins, Dogs could see further upside, but as with any speculative investment, risk management is essential. Pudgy Penguins: A Community-Driven Meme Coin with Recent Market Challenges Pudgy Penguins has long been one of the most recognizable brands in the NFT space, known for its unique artistic appeal and strong community support. However, recent market conditions have presented significant challenges for both the PENGU token and the Pudgy Penguins NFT collection. The introduction of Abstract, an Ethereum layer-2 network developed by Igloo Inc., appears to have shifted investor attention away from Pudgy Penguins, resulting in substantial losses across the ecosystem. The PENGU token has suffered a 24% decline in a single day and a 49% drop over the past month, currently trading at $0.0173. Meanwhile, Ethereum-based Pudgy Penguins NFTs have seen a 20% decrease in one day and a 39% drop over the past week, bringing their floor price down to $37,950. This sharp decline highlights the risks associated with NFT-linked meme coins, especially when external developments influence market sentiment. Despite these setbacks, Pudgy Penguins still maintains a loyal following, and the brand’s popularity in the NFT space could provide a foundation for a future recovery. If the project can introduce new incentives or adapt to shifting market conditions, there is potential for a rebound. However, in the short term, its performance has been affected by broader market movements, making it a more volatile investment option. Conclusion The best new meme coins to join now offer a mix of high-reward opportunities, strong community engagement, and market momentum. Among them, BTFD Coin stands out due to its 90% APY staking program, successful presale, and investor incentives like the LAUNCH100 bonus code. For those looking to maximize returns while benefiting from staking rewards, BTFD presents a compelling choice. Meanwhile, Dogs continues to hold its ground as a meme coin with real-world utility, while Pudgy Penguins is currently navigating a challenging market downturn. While both projects have their own strengths, BTFD Coin’s strong fundamentals and growing community support make it the most attractive option for investors seeking short-term and long-term gains. As always, market conditions can shift rapidly, so conducting thorough research before making any investment decisions is crucial.

A recovery above the previous monthly high should set the stage for a big increase. Last week, Jup showed signs of strength and went offensive after seeing a notable increase in the volume level. Things escalated positively fast as many traders became optimistic about a possible rally, but the asset faced rejection and the buying pressure faded off quickly. Interestingly, the $1 level provided support in the past few days and became a critical trading level for Jup since it faced rejection last weekend. Though, like many altcoins, the price currently appears weak. Losing this critical trading level could cause a serious decline in the price. This could roll the price back to the $0.7 range before picking up again. Failure to bounce back might result in a heavy loss, which may slide the price to a yearly low. However, Jup’s next move is still indecisive. A push above the previous weekly high should give room for more positive actions daily. Apart from that, we can expect a new high to surface before rallying hard. It is currently gathering momentum for another major swing. JUP’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview On the daily chart, the bulls are still having the upper hand. If they regroup back, the $1.28 level would be their target before charging at the $1.44 resistance on the way up. The $1.6 level is the next resistance to watch. Losing $1, there’s a minor support at $0.9. A further drop from there could pull us to a low of $0.8, followed by $0.71. Key Resistance Levels: $1.28, $1.44, $1.6 Key Support Levels: $0.9, $0.8, $0.71 Spot Price: $1.1 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Payments options now include TRUMP and will be processed by Solana Pay, a decentralized payment system that allows users to send money directly to merchants without intermediaries. The watches will be made-to-order and start shipping from October onward, an FAQ on the website shows. As such, these official products are not sold by Trump directly but are part of a licensed agreement with CIC Digital LLC - one of the companies that helmed the issuance of TRUMP tokens. The move bumps utility and usability for the TRUMP token, which launched on Jan. 17 and has since entered the top-thirty tokens with a market cap above $5.5 billion as of Thursday.

Cardano has just completed a major milestone: the Plomin Hard Fork, which means it is now fully decentralized. This is a big deal because Cardano is now fully governed by ADA token holders, who will vote on important decisions like upgrades and treasury spending. This makes Cardano one of the few top 10 cryptos with true decentralization. Even though the price of Cardano isn’t seeing much action at the moment, the fundamentals behind the project are stronger than ever. More and more whales are buying ADA, and institutions like grayscale Investment grayscale Investment - Investment platform are showing interest in Cardano. As more people see the value of Cardano’s decentralized system, demand could increase, which may lead to higher prices in the future. Price Action: Consolidation Phase Looking at the price chart, Cardano is currently in a consolidation phase. After a previous surge of over 300%, it’s normal for ADA to experience this type of sideways movement. However, there’s still clear momentum on the weekly chart, showing higher highs and higher lows since the spring of 2024. The current key levels to watch are $1 : The 20-day moving average is at this level. ADA needs to break above this to signal any further upside. $1.25 : The next resistance level is just above $1.20, with significant price action happening around this zone. If Cardano can break through these levels, a major bull move could be in play. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Ethereum Price Analysis: Will ETH Bounce Back After Recent Outflows? , A Comparison with Ethereum’s Previous Cycle Looking at Ethereum’s cycle as a reference, it’s clear that Cardano is primed for similar gains.

The comments came as the Federal Reserve maintained interest rates at 4.25% to 4.5% following last week’s CPI data that showed inflation was not as high as many anticipated. Don’t Debank Crypto Customers Powell also said the central bank was “not against innovation” with regard to cryptocurrencies. Speaking about banking restrictions, he added, “We certainly don’t want to take actions that would cause banks to, you know, terminate customers who are perfectly legal just because of excess risk aversion, maybe related to regulation and supervision.” Powell’s remarks at the first FOMC meeting under the Trump administration came as concerns about so-called “debanking” efforts have risen to the highest ranks of government. “Banks are perfectly able to serve crypto customers, as long as they understand and can manage the risks, and it’s safe and sound,” Powell said before adding, “The threshold has been a little higher for banks engaging in crypto activities, and that’s because they’re so new.” He noted that individual investors needed better protection as the risks may not be fully understood. He also compared crypto to stocks and mutual funds, saying that similar consumer safeguards should apply. No Disagreements With Trump The central bank chair has avoided responding directly to comments made or actions taken by Donald Trump in recent weeks. He said there has been “no contact” with the new president, noting that disagreements would undermine the Fed’s credibility. “We stand ready to take appropriate action to support the smooth transmission of monetary policy, including adjusting the details of our approach for reducing the size of our balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments,” he said. More economic data is expected this week, with fourth-quarter GDP Growth Annualized advance estimates due on Thursday and December’s Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report due on Friday.

Co-founder of Gemini , Tyler Winklevoss, said in a recent X post that the crypto exchange will stop hiring graduates from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The decision came shortly after it was announced that former SEC Chairman Gary Gensler will return to MIT’s Sloan School of Management as a professor and co-director of FinTechAI at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. “As long as MIT has any association with Gary Gensler, Gemini will not hire any graduates from this school. Not even interns for our summer intern program,” wrote Winklevoss in his post. Ranked as the second-best university in the U.S. in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025, MIT is known as the alma mater of many crypto figureheads, including Executive Director & Co-Founder of Uniswap ( UNI ) Devin Walsh, co-founder of the Bitcoin ( BTC ) Foundation Patrick Murck and former FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried . According to RootData , there are at least 54 projects in the crypto sphere that were founded by MIT alumni. As long as @MIT has any association with Gary Gensler, @Gemini will not hire any graduates from this school. Not even interns for our summer intern program. https://t.co/fi0WMIVCLp — Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) January 30, 2025 You might also like: Former SEC Chair Gary Gensler returns to MIT and alumni are incredibly embarrassed On Jan. 29, MIT announced that former SEC Chairman and infamous crypto enemy Gary Gensler will be returning to the MIT’s Sloan School of Management as a Professor of the Practice in the Global Economics and Management Group and the Finance Group. He will be teaching artificial intelligence , finance, financial technology, and public policy. He will have a specific role in the academic institution’s FinTech and AI research, as he will also be filling in as co-director of the FinTechAI at the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT’s largest research lab. Many crypto industry players have labeled Gensler as antagonistic towards crypto, due to his harsh stance on crypto. The SEC under Gensler’s leadership has been accused of waging war against the crypto industry by insisting all tokens distributed fall under securities. Crypto industry’s crackdown on Gary Gensler’s SEC Gemini is not the first crypto firm to cut ties with institutions associated with former officials linked to the Biden Administration. In early December, Coinbase said that it would stop working with firms that hire people linked to the Biden Administration’s “bad deeds” after law firm hired ex-SEC chief Gurbir Grewal as a partner. “It’s an ethics violation in my book to try and unlawfully kill an industry while refusing to publish clear rules. If you were senior there, you cannot say you were just following orders,” Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong wrote in his post, encouraging other firms to do the same. As Gary Gensler will be teaching a new generation of innovators and influencing their views on fintech, AI and most definitely crypto, many crypto traders see his return to MIT as a major disappointment. UniSwap executive and MIT graduate Devin Walsh said that she felt “incredibly embarrassed and disappointed to see them rehire Gensler” and that joining the program would be “a waste of time, tuition funds, and energy” for students hoping to learn about new technologies in the finance field.

With $1 million raised in minutes during its presale and unmatched momentum, OFFICIALMAGACOIN is becoming the most sought-after token, even as MATIC, ADA, SEI, and APT aim for their share of the spotlight. How It Stands Against the Competition Bitcoin (BTC): A proven store of value, but its mature market makes 50,000% returns unlikely. XRP: A leader in payments, but it doesn’t match the exclusivity and early-stage growth potential of this token. Polygon (MATIC): Known for scaling Ethereum, but it lacks the demand and momentum driving THE OFFICIALMAGACOIN.

He also confirmed that the exchange would exclude MIT students from its summer internship program. Gemini Settled SEC Case for $21 Million The conflict between Gemini and the SEC dates back to at least March 2023 , when Gemini settled with the SEC by paying $21 million in fines over allegations that it sold unregistered securities through its Gemini Earn program. The now-bankrupt Genesis, which partnered with Gemini on the program, was also implicated. Gensler spearheaded the regulatory action before stepping down on Jan. 20, when former President Donald Trump was re-inaugurated. Following his exit from the SEC, Gensler returned to MIT to teach and research artificial intelligence in finance, financial technology, and regulatory policy. As long as @MIT has any association with Gary Gensler, @Gemini will not hire any graduates from this school. Not even interns for our summer intern program. https://t.co/fi0WMIVCLp — Tyler Winklevoss (@tyler) January 30, 2025 Winklevoss’ decision gained support from notable crypto advocates, including Bitcoin proponent Erik Voorhees, who urged crypto firms to boycott MIT graduates until Gensler is removed. This is not the first time the crypto industry has taken a stand against SEC-affiliated professionals. In December 2023, Coinbase cut ties with the law firm Milbank after it hired former SEC official Gurbir Grewal. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong stated that his firm would avoid working with law firms that hire individuals who tried to “unlawfully kill” the crypto industry while failing to establish clear regulations. He also encouraged other companies to adopt a similar approach. However, not everyone in the industry agrees with Gemini’s blanket policy against MIT graduates. Axelar Network co-founder Sergey Gorbunov criticized the move, saying there was “no reason to punish students” for the actions of one professor and even offered to hire MIT graduates himself. Arkham’s head of UK legal, Preston Byrne, also called the decision excessive, arguing that while boycotting law firms that employ SEC enforcers is reasonable, blacklisting an entire institution’s graduates is too extreme. I actually think a university is a perfectly fine place for Gensler to land. Was he bad for our industry? Yes. Will he be able to teach students a hell of a lot about how government works? Also yes — Preston Byrne (@prestonjbyrne) January 30, 2025 Others, such as George Mason University associate professor Jiasun Li, suggested a more targeted approach, proposing that the boycott focus solely on students who enroll in Gensler’s classes rather than all MIT graduates. Winklevoss: Gensler’s Actions Are Unforgivable Winklevoss has remained vocal in his criticism of Gensler, arguing that any organization hiring him is betraying the crypto industry. In a Nov. 16 post on X, he stated that no amount of apology could undo the damage Gensler inflicted on both cryptocurrency and the United States. Following Gensler’s departure, the SEC is now led by Mark Uyeda, who was among the three commissioners who voted in favor of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January 2024. Hester Peirce, another commissioner who voted in favor, has since taken the lead in the SEC’s newly established crypto task force unit.

Are the Bulls in? Analyst Explains the Latest Situation,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/whats-the-latest-on-ethereum-are-the-bulls-in-analyst-explains-the-latest-situation/,"Cryptocurrency analyst IT Tech has provided insight into the current market conditions of Ethereum, explaining the key trends in whale activity and price movements. According to IT Tech, Ethereum’s large trading volume (LTV) remains lower compared to previous bull cycles in 2017 and 2021. This suggests that the market is currently driven more by retail investors rather than institutional-scale transactions that usually signal speculative swings. While small increases in whale activity have been observed, these are not at levels that typically precede a major rally or significant sell-off. However, IT Tech warns that sudden increases in whale transactions are often a sign of impending price changes, making on-chain activity an important metric to watch. Related News: Howard Lutnick, Donald Trump's Nominee for Secretary of Commerce and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Speaks on Tether (USDT) in the Senate Ethereum has successfully reclaimed the $3,000 level, but the analyst notes that a move towards $3,500 and beyond would require rising LTV as confirmation. Without this, Ethereum could consolidate or experience a pullback. IT Tech warns that if whale activity suddenly increases amid price weakness, it could signal dispersion and lead to a correction towards the $2,800-$2,500 range. *This is not investment advice.

This is an important step in determining whether the agency will approve the exchange-traded fund. The SEC opened a 21-day public comment period after the proposal was published in the Federal Register, according to a published document. The move signals that the agency is actively evaluating the product and invites market participants to provide feedback. Nasdaq officially kicked off the second phase of the regulatory process by filing Form 19b-4 for Canary’s spot Litecoin ETF on Jan. 16. The 19b-4 filing is a key step in which exchanges submit proposals on behalf of ETF issuers. Once approved by the SEC, the document is published in the Federal Register, triggering the agency’s formal review. Related News: Howard Lutnick, Donald Trump's Nominee for Secretary of Commerce and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Speaks on Tether (USDT) in the Senate Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas touched on the importance of the application, noting that this is the first altcoin ETF to reach this stage. “When we include the SEC’s comments on the S-1, this filing is by far the furthest along in terms of checking all the boxes,” Balchunas wrote in a post on X (formerly Twitter). However, he questioned whether the SEC would take the full 240-day review period or move forward with a quicker decision.

Table of Contents Dogecoin’s historic rise: Blueprint for massive returns How Lightchain AI could transform $320 into $9,600 in just 6 weeks Lightchain AI: Game-changer in the crypto space Dogecoin’s legendary rise to the moon captured the imagination of the crypto world, but a new contender is poised to deliver similar explosive returns. Lightchain AI, a new project combining blockchain with artificial intelligence, is gaining momentum as the next big opportunity. Currently in its presale phase at $0.005625 per token, Lightchain AI has already raised $13.5 million, reflecting strong investor confidence. Analysts predict a $320 investment could skyrocket to $9,600 within just six weeks, making Lightchain AI a must-watch project. Dogecoin’s historic rise: Blueprint for massive returns Dogecoin , launched in 2013 as a playful cryptocurrency, experienced a meteoric rise in 2021. In January, its value surged over 800% within 24 hours, reaching $0.07, driven by Reddit users and figures like Elon Musk. By May 2021, Dogecoin’s market capitalization exceeded $85 billion, with prices peaking above $0.50. This ascent was fueled by social media buzz, celebrity endorsements, and a growing community. Investors seeking substantial returns observed that early engagement in emerging digital assets, even those originating as jokes, can yield significant profits.

Fund CIO Explores New Market Reality,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/no-more-bitcoin-bear-market-fund-cio/,"In a new investor note published on January 29, 2025, Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, questioned whether the historical four-year market cycle of Bitcoin could finally be coming to an end. His reasoning is rooted in seismic shifts in US policy toward crypto, highlighted by a recent executive order from President Trump aimed at solidifying the nation’s leadership in digital assets. Could 2026 Buck The Bitcoin Bear Trend? Hougan’s note begins with an explanation of the so-called “four-year cycle,” where Bitcoin has typically seen three years of substantial gains followed by a pullback. This cycle, he explains, mirrors broader boom-bust patterns in traditional markets:“The four-year cycle in crypto is driven by the same forces that drive broader cycles of growth and recession in the general economy,” he wrote. Related Reading: Bitcoin Preparing For A February Rally? Analyst Says New High Is Two Weeks Away These expansions, fueled by technological breakthroughs or increased investor interest, often lead to over-leverage, occasionally resulting in fraud or industry-wide strain. Eventually, something “breaks” and triggers a market correction—such as the 2014 Mt. Gox collapse or the 2018 SEC crackdown on ICOs. Hougan describes the current crypto upswing as the “Mainstream Cycle,” emerging out of 2022’s “massive deleveraging” caused by failures like FTX, Three Arrows Capital, and others. According to him, the latest bull phase took off in March 2023, when Grayscale convincingly “won the opening argument” in its legal challenge against the SEC over a spot Bitcoin ETF. “Bitcoin was trading at $22,218 when Grayscale mounted its argument. It’s trading at $102,674 today. The mainstream era has arrived.” Once a spot Bitcoin ETF was approved and launched in January 2024, investor inflows surged, further cementing Bitcoin’s acceptance among both retail and institutional players. The most striking component of Hougan’s analysis is his examination of last week’s executive order issued by President Trump. The order not only deemed the development of the US digital asset ecosystem a “national priority,” but it also set in motion a clearer regulatory framework for crypto. Related Reading: DeepSeek Predicts Bitcoin Bull Run Peak At $500,000 – Here’s When “Last week, President Trump issued an executive order that was so overwhelmingly bullish for the space that it’s making me wonder,” Hougan wrote, noting how the document outlines plans for a potential “national crypto stockpile” and encourages banks and financial institutions to accelerate their adoption of digital assets. Combined with a now more welcoming stance from the SEC, Hougan believes these measures could unleash trillions in new investment over the coming years, far surpassing the hundreds of billions that an ETF-driven market was already expected to generate. Hougan’s analysis acknowledges that Bitcoin has historically followed its pattern of eventual pullbacks after surging bull runs. But with Wall Street behemoths and major banks preparing to integrate crypto at every level, there’s a growing possibility that the market may not face the traditional plunge in 2026: “If it’s not until next year that we feel those impacts, will we really have a new ‘crypto winter’ in 2026?” he posited. “If BlackRock CEO Larry Fink is calling for $700k Bitcoin, are we really going to see a 70% pullback?” While he concedes that leverage continues to build in the system—citing an uptick in Bitcoin-backed lending programs, derivatives, and levered exchange-traded products—he also highlights an increasingly diverse pool of crypto investors. This diversity, he argues, could dampen severe drawdowns. “My guess is that we haven’t fully overcome the four-year cycle. Leverage will build up as the bull market builds. Excess will appear. Bad actors will emerge. And at some point, there could be a sharp pullback when the market gets over its skis,” Hougan argued. However, Hougan expects that any future market correction will be “shorter and shallower” than previous cycles. With the industry’s infrastructure now significantly more robust and mainstream participants treating crypto as a legitimate asset class, a dramatic bear market akin to those of 2014 or 2018 may be less likely. “As for now, it’s full steam ahead,” he concluded. “The crypto train is leaving the station.” At press time, BTC traded at $105,275.

Recently Indiana has joined the list with the introduction of House Bill 1322, to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. However, this bill will allow the state’s pension funds to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. Indiana Pension Funds To Invest in Bitcoin ETFs Indiana is taking a slightly different approach with the introduction of House Bill 1322 , authored by state Representative Jake Teshka and co-authored by Representatives Shane Lindauer and Cory Criswell, that could potentially allow state pension funds to invest in Bitcoin ETFs. The proposal, currently under review, aims to diversify the investment options for Indiana’s pension funds. These funds are crucial for the retirement savings of many public employees, including teachers, firefighters, and government workers. By allowing investments in Bitcoin ETFs, the state could tap into the growing cryptocurrency market, which has gained significant attention in recent years. While the bill’s specifics remain under legislative review and if the bill is approved, it will go into effect on July 1, 2025, as this could be a big step for Indiana. Taping Into Blockchain for Better Government Apart from this Indiana’s HB 1322 doesn’t just focus on Bitcoin ETFs it also looks at how blockchain technology could help the government work better. The bill asks the Department of Administration to study how blockchain can improve things like cost efficiency, data security, and even the experience of people using government services. Supporters Praise the Bill Meanwhile, many supporters of the bill believe that adding Bitcoin ETFs to the mix could help diversify investments. Diversification is important because it spreads risk and can lead to better returns over time. Well-known crypto expert MMCrypto said in an X post that this is one of the huge move by Indiana states.

As its presale garners attention from investors, early entrants are perfectly positioned to benefit from unprecedented ROI and the highly anticipated staking rewards launching on Valentine’s Day this year. It’’s a project for serious financial gains. For those who act now, the rewards could be monumental. With the right timing, Doge Uprising has the potential to multiply your investments in ways that rival the most explosive crypto success stories. Why Early Action Is Key Cryptocurrency rewards those who seize opportunities before the masses catch on. Take a moment to reflect on Dogecoin, which transformed early investments of just a few hundred dollars into fortunes worth millions. Doge Uprising is poised to follow a similar trajectory, but the key is getting in now, while prices are still low and the potential for exponential returns remains untapped. As momentum builds, demand for $DUP tokens is set to surge, and with it, the price. Investing during the presale phase ensures the lowest entry point, offering early buyers the chance to maximize returns before the token hits major exchanges. The Power of Staking Rewards A major highlight of Doge Uprising is its staking rewards program, launching on February 14th. While the specific APY is yet to be announced, the very concept of staking opens up an avenue for passive income. Investors can lock their tokens and earn additional rewards simply for holding onto their investment, creating a compounding effect that enhances overall returns. Consider the possibilities: by staking your $DUP holdings, you not only benefit from the token’s price appreciation but also see your total number of tokens increase over time. This creates a dual income stream that amplifies your financial growth. While other cryptocurrencies offer staking, Doge Uprising’s rapidly growing community and unique momentum make it one of the most attractive staking opportunities on the market today. Unmatched ROI Potential For those aiming for life-changing gains, Doge Uprising stands out as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The combination of presale pricing, staking rewards, and projected market demand positions it as a coin with 1000X potential. Imagine turning a modest $500 investment into half a million dollars, or a $5,000 stake into a cool $5 million. These aren’t just numbers plucked out of thin air; they’re grounded in the historical performance of other meme coins that exploded onto the scene with much less strategic planning than Doge Uprising. Doge Uprising benefits from a robust roadmap, a dedicated community, and a staking system designed to reward investors handsomely. For those who act early, the financial possibilities are virtually limitless. The Cost of Hesitation Every moment spent waiting is a missed opportunity. Crypto markets move at lightning speed, and the window to secure a position in Doge Uprising’s presale is narrowing with each passing day. The difference between those who invest now and those who wait could mean missing out on millions. Unlike speculative projects with no real value proposition, Doge Uprising offers a clear path to sustainable growth. Early action not only secures your position at the lowest price but also gives you the chance to benefit from staking rewards as soon as they launch. Your Opportunity to Build Wealth Starts Now With Doge Uprising’s staking program offering passive income and its explosive growth potential, it’s clear why early buyers are rushing to secure their stake. Don’t let hesitation hold you back. Take action today, and position yourself to reap the rewards of one of the most exciting crypto opportunities of 2025. Doge Uprising is your chance to turn ambition into reality, and the time to act is now.

Simultaneously, The Graph (GRT) bullish pattern suggests an imminent breakout, with experts predicting a 15% upswing supported by robust technical indicators. Yet, the most captivating news this week is about BlockDAG (BDAG) and its LAUNCH300 bonus, giving enthusiasts a chance to get 300% extra BDAG coins for the next 2 days only. Enthusiasts are quickly grabbing this unique offer, projecting BDAG’s potential to reach $20 by 2027. The window to participate in this excitement is closing fast, as experts suggest BDAG is the best crypto to buy now! The Graph Bullish Pattern: 15% Surge Points to Upswing The Graph bullish pattern signals a potential breakout, with experts forecasting a 15% increase as prices near the upper trendline. Recent figures show $15.77 million in GRT outflows from exchanges, indicating accumulation by long-term holders. Additionally, 55% of leading traders are adopting long positions, supported by a Long/Short Ratio of 1.20, reflecting a positive outlook. Technical analysis reveals a falling wedge pattern, typically a precursor to upward movements. If The Graph’s price exceeds $0.22, the GRT bullish pattern may amplify up to 50%, potentially reaching $0.34 soon. Ethereum Grabs Institutional Focus: $5B on ETF Ethereum ETFs have achieved a new milestone, drawing over $5 billion in inflows since November 2024, highlighting increasing institutional focus. Trading volumes in December topped $1 billion on peak days, demonstrating strong confidence in Ethereum as a growth asset. Market watchers, like @CenkCrypto, are reviewing Ethereum’s historical Q1 outcomes, including rises of 518% in 2017 and 160% in 2021, raising expectations for another possible 100% increase in Q1 2025. Significant advancements like the Shanghai upgrade, facilitating efficient staked ETH withdrawals, and blockchain’s role in asset tokenization, have made Ethereum ETFs a top pick. Although Bitcoin ETFs are prevalent, Ethereum ETFs’ embrace of DeFi and scalability features are altering institutional investment patterns. Countdown on BlockDAG’s Triple Bonus Offer: LAUNCH300 Ends in 2 Days As the clock winds down, BlockDAG’s LAUNCH300 bonus enters its final 48 hours, offering an unprecedented opportunity for participants to receive triple the BDAG coins at checkout. By applying the code LAUNCH300 in the BlockDAG dashboard , participants are granted 300% extra BDAG coins instantly. This is the most significant bonus ever provided by BlockDAG, and with its conclusion imminent, there is a rush among enthusiasts to secure this unique offer before it disappears. BlockDAG’s presale has been extraordinary, amassing $186 million and distributing over 18 billion coins thus far. The coin’s value has soared impressively by 2380%, from $0.001 in the initial batch to $0.0248 in the latest batch 27. Given these remarkable statistics, it’s clear why BDAG is acclaimed as the best crypto to buy now . The presale continues to accelerate, and the dwindling supply is only heightening the anticipation. In these closing moments of LAUNCH300, enthusiasts are capitalizing on the last chance to enhance their holdings, setting the stage for potential substantial returns. Projections already suggest BDAG could reach $20 by 2027, driven by its growth and broader acceptance. Missing these final moments means forgoing a pivotal opportunity to be part of one of the most promising ventures in the crypto world before the price escalates further. Wrapping Up Ethereum ETFs have become a cornerstone for sophisticated participants, with $5 billion in inflows demonstrating Ethereum’s expanding influence in decentralized finance and asset tokenization. The Graph is also creating excitement, with The Graph bullish pattern indicating a breakout that could yield substantial gains. However, the focus remains on BlockDAG, as enthusiasts rapidly acquire BDAG coins through the LAUNCH300 bonus. With only two days left to secure 300% extra coins, the buzz around the project and its ongoing presale is intensifying. The presale’s groundbreaking success, achieving $186 million and a boost in enthusiast activity as the bonus offer concludes, coupled with BDAG’s prospects of reaching $20 by 2027, solidifies BlockDAG as the best crypto to buy this week.

However, he believes these entities are not going to rotate their profits into alts. “The money that bought and is responsible for moving Bitcoin is fragmented away from this market. It’s ETFs and Saylor. Most people here jumped into alts thinking this flow would follow, meanwhile it is on IBKR (electronic trading firm Interactive Brokers) and ThinkorSwim [trading platform]. Market structure has changed, adapt or die.” He previously said that another reason there won’t be an altseason when altcoins outperform Bitcoin is because there are now more digital assets than prior cycles and not enough liquidity to go around. “The idea of altseason is just like these rotations that are happening and they’ll get more concentrated. But a rising tide just isn’t happening. It’s just not happening. There’s too much garbage and there’s not enough money to go around to lift it.” The analyst keeps an eye on the Bitcoin dominance (BTC.D) chart, which currently sits at 59.88%. Traders use BTC.D to track if altcoins are outperforming Bitcoin as the metric calculates how much of the crypto market cap belongs to BTC. Lastly, the trader suggests that dogwifhat ( WIF ) may be gearing up for a breakout after a severe correction, dropping below $1. “To be honest, if there was a place to take a shot at WIF it is probably around here. Study retracements to Binance spot listing prices.” WIF is trading for $1.18 at time of writing, up 9.9% in the last 24 hours.
