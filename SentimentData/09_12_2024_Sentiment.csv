These moments remind us of one thing: the best always push beyond their limits. And now, the crypto world has its own record-setter: XYZ, the first-ever all-sports meme coin. Combining the energy of sports with the explosive potential of meme coins, XYZ is breaking presale records faster than a Conor McGregor knockout. In just 12 days, Stage 7 of the XYZ presale sold out, raising over $2,000,000. This record signals exceptional demand and strong market interest, outperforming typical presale timelines, even for well-hyped meme coins. Now, with Stage 8 live, the race is on to beat that record. The momentum is real, the stakes are high, and the question is: how fast XYZ will crush this stage? The Stats Don’t Lie—Here’s Why You Need to Act Fast The $XYZ presale is live and already moving faster than a championship sprint. Here’s where the numbers stand: 💥 Current Price (Stage 8): $0.001 – This represents a 100x potential gain compared to the listing price. 🔥 Next Stage Price: $0.001333 – Still a massive opportunity, with a 75x gain potential versus the listing price. 🎯 Final Presale Price: $0.1 – The ultimate destination, where the token prepares to launch into the broader market. 🚀 Upside Potential: A jaw-dropping 9,900%, giving investors the chance to turn small investments into life-changing gains.

This Crypto is Your Chance Now for Massive Gains in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-chance-to-join-algorand-this-crypto-is-your-chance-now-for-massive-gains-in-2025/,"If you’ve been keeping tabs on the crypto market lately, you know it’s been a whirlwind. Algorand (ALGO) has been at the center of attention, skyrocketing in price thanks to its fast, secure, and eco-friendly blockchain. But let’s face it—if you didn’t jump in during its earlier days, you’re probably wondering if it’s too late to see those jaw-dropping returns. Don’t worry, though. Missing the ALGO train isn’t the end of the line. There’s a new player in town, and it’s got analysts buzzing. Say hello to Qubetics ($TICS), the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for anyone looking to make massive gains in 2025. While Algorand has been making waves in scalability and decentralisation, Qubetics is carving out its own lane with real-world asset tokenisation. Imagine owning a slice of prime real estate, fine art, or even small businesses, all without the massive upfront costs. That’s the power of Qubetics. And right now, it’s in its presale phase, which means you’ve got a golden opportunity to jump in early and ride the wave to potentially life-changing returns. Qubetics ($TICS): A New Frontier in Asset Tokenisation Let’s get one thing straight: Qubetics isn’t just another “hype” token. It’s solving a real-world problem that most crypto projects barely scratch the surface of—making high-value assets accessible to everyday investors. Think about it. How many of us dream about owning a piece of a luxury condo, investing in a startup, or putting money into rare art? For most folks, those opportunities feel about as out of reach as winning the lottery. But Qubetics is changing all that with its Web3 aggregator platform. Here’s how it works: Qubetics takes real-world assets—like real estate, businesses, and even fine art—and breaks them into smaller, tokenised shares. That means you don’t need millions to get in the game. For example, say you’re a small-town teacher in Kansas with $300 to invest. With Qubetics, you could own a piece of a high-end Manhattan apartment or a slice of a growing café in Seattle. It’s like crowdfunding, but on steroids. And it’s not just individuals who benefit. Businesses are loving this model, too. A local brewery in Texas could tokenize its equity to fund a new taproom, while an artist in LA could sell shares of their latest painting to collectors worldwide. By democratizing asset ownership, Qubetics is opening doors that were once slammed shut for anyone without deep pockets. Now, let’s talk numbers. Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 11, priced at just $0.0282 per $TICS. So far, it’s raised over $5 million, with more than 288 million tokens sold to a growing community of 7,500+ holders. And here’s the kicker: a 10% price increase happens every week, with a final phase bump of 20% before the token launches at $0.25. That’s a potential 900% ROI for early investors. Let’s break it down with an example. If you invest $300 today, you’ll snag roughly 10,638 $TICS tokens. When the price hits $0.25 after the presale, your investment could be worth a cool $2,659.50. That’s enough to kickstart your 2025 goals, whether it’s paying off bills, starting a side hustle, or just treating yourself to something nice. Algorand (ALGO): A Green Giant Making Big Moves Algorand has been a darling of the crypto world for a reason. It’s fast, secure, and, most importantly, eco-friendly—a major selling point in a world where sustainability is top of mind. Designed by MIT professor Silvio Micali, Algorand’s blockchain is a marvel of efficiency, capable of handling thousands of transactions per second without breaking a sweat. Over the past year, ALGO has seen a massive resurgence, fueled by partnerships with governments, institutions, and even DeFi projects. Its price surged by over 75% in just one week, reaching a new yearly high of $0.5208. Open Interest (OI) in ALGO futures has also skyrocketed, jumping from $75.69 million to $204 million in a matter of days. This influx of capital has analysts buzzing, with some predicting ALGO could hit $0.75 in the short term and potentially cross the $1 mark by mid-2025. But here’s the rub: While Algorand’s tech is undeniably impressive, its gains might not be as explosive as they once were. For early adopters, the ride has been thrilling. But for new investors jumping in at these higher price levels, the upside might feel more like a gradual climb than a rocket launch. That said, ALGO is still a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable blockchain project with long-term potential. Its use cases in areas like supply chain management, digital identity, and carbon offset tracking make it a cornerstone of the green blockchain movement. But if you’re hunting for those “life-changing gains,” you might want to look at newer projects like Qubetics. Don’t Miss Out—Get in on Qubetics Before It’s Too Late So, where should you put your money—Qubetics or Algorand? Honestly, it depends on your goals. If you’re looking for a tried-and-true blockchain project with a focus on sustainability and scalability, Algorand is a safe bet. It’s already proven itself, and its partnerships give it a strong foundation for growth. But if you’re chasing those big, juicy returns that make your friends go, “Wait, you made how much?” Qubetics is the clear winner. Its presale phase is a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a project that’s tackling a massive market. With its real-world asset tokenisation model, Qubetics is poised to become a household name in 2025. And let’s not forget that potential 900% ROI—that’s the kind of growth most crypto investors dream about. Crypto is all about timing, and the clock is ticking on Qubetics’ presale. If you’ve been kicking yourself for missing the Algorand frenzy, now’s your chance to turn things around. With a growing community, innovative technology, and analysts calling it the best crypto to buy in December 2024 , Qubetics has all the makings of a breakout star. Head to the Qubetics presale page today and lock in your investment before the next price hike. Whether you’re putting down $300 or going all in, this could be your ticket to massive gains in 2025. Don’t wait until you’re reading about its success next year—be a part of it now.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful take on cryptocurrency. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's scarcity, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Starting as a joke, it quickly gained a following, showing the power of community and social media. In 2021, Dogecoin's value soared, fueled by online buzz and endorsements from Elon Musk. It entered the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value over $50 billion. Is Dogecoin worth considering now? Its technology is simple, similar to early cryptocurrencies but without a supply limit. This means it's less about scarcity and more about usage and community support. While some see it as a fun entry into crypto, others are cautious due to its meme origins and volatility. Compared to coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features like smart contracts. Yet, its strong community keeps it popular. In the current market, if you're drawn to a coin with a passionate following and accept the risks, Dogecoin might be attractive. Conclusion While coins like DOGE, PEPE, and MOG offer strong potential, XYZVerse stands out as the pioneering all-sport memecoin poised for exceptional growth in the current bull run.

In the current market, if you're drawn to a coin with a passionate following and accept the risks, Dogecoin might be attractive. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene in August 2020, inspired by Dogecoin. Unlike its predecessor, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, opening up possibilities in the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Launched by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens. To gain credibility, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin's donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply brought significant attention to SHIB. SHIB's place on Ethereum allows it to support smart contracts and decentralized apps. This led to ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade SHIB and other tokens. The team also plans an NFT platform and a governance system using a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). These features give SHIB real utility beyond being a meme. In the current market, where investors seek coins with real-world uses, SHIB's technology and growth plans make it attractive. While sharing Dogecoin's meme appeal, SHIB's Ethereum foundation could give it an edge in the long run. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB remain popular, XYZVerse offers a unique blend of sports and memes, aiming for massive growth and to become the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

As Inflation is going up, cash and bonds aren’t the best way to protect a company’s money anymore. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has been increasing in value. In 2024, Bitcoin grew by 131%, which is much better than bonds. Over the last five years, Bitcoin’s value went up by more than 1,200%, which is far outpacing bonds. Shareholders believe that with Amazon’s $585 billion in assets, including $88 billion in cash and bonds, the company should consider adding Bitcoin to its reserves. Holding Bitcoin could help Amazon protect its profits from inflation and possibly earn better returns in the future. Following the proposal, which is already making rounds on X (formerly Twitter), former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) made a post by asking the company to simply add support for crypto as a payment option on the leading e-commerce platform. “Simple. Accept bitcoin payments?,” CZ posted. Simple. Accept bitcoin payments? 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/ud5PVNYHrj — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 8, 2024 Companies like MicroStrategy, which holds a lot of Bitcoin, have seen their stock prices increase. Other companies like Tesla and Block (formerly Square) have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The proposal suggests that Amazon could do the same to increase shareholder value. While Bitcoin is a volatile asset, having some Bitcoin in its reserves could give Amazon more long-term value, even if its value fluctuates in the short term. The shareholders suggest that Amazon could start by holding just 5% of its assets in Bitcoin in the initial. This proposal reflects a bigger trend of companies starting to see Bitcoin as a safe investment to protect against inflation. Microsoft’s shareholders are voting soon on whether to add Bitcoin to their balance sheet. As Bitcoin becomes more accepted by big companies, it may soon become a regular part of how companies manage their assets. Amazon has yet to decide whether to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. However, one can say that more companies are likely to follow suit with firms like Microsoft and Amazon now joining the discussion.

Following Bitcoin’s milestone, the crypto-focused X account Autism Capital asked Bukele to disclose El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio to “dunk on the haters.” In response, Bukele posted the portfolio, revealing the nation’s nearly $270 million investment in Bitcoin. The portfolio confirms that no Bitcoin has been sold, and unrealized gains now exceed $333 million, a significant validation of the country’s strategy. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Journey El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on September 7, 2021, when its Bitcoin Law came into effect. A day prior, the government made its inaugural purchase of 200 BTC. Since then, the country has continued accumulating Bitcoin. On November 17, 2022, Bukele announced a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, committing to purchasing one Bitcoin daily. According to Nayib Tracker, a platform monitoring El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings, the country currently owns 6,180 BTC, with an average purchase price of $44,739.88. Based on current prices, the portfolio has gained approximately 122%. Beyond financial gains, El Salvador has also seen increased tourism and international recognition since adopting Bitcoin. IMF Urges El Salvador to Reconsider Despite the reported benefits, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly advised El Salvador to scale back its Bitcoin initiatives. On January 25, 2022, the IMF urged the country to stop recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender, citing financial stability risks but acknowledging its potential for financial inclusion. The IMF renewed its concerns on October 3, 2024, with communications director Julie Kozack recommending the country narrow the Bitcoin Law’s scope and limit public sector exposure to Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 21:32:44

As the altcoin season approaches, Polkadot could be set for significant gains, possibly exceeding previous highs. Conclusion Though AVAX and DOT show promise, their short-term potential is limited.

Nest Services Ltd., a company linked to Binance Group, stands out as one of the most significant offenders. The firm is accused of evading $86.8 million in GST. India Recovers $14.7M in Crypto Tax Crackdown According to an Economic Times report , Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary revealed in a written response to the Lok Sabha that investigations have been launched into these firms. The investigation has already led to the recovery of $14.7 million in taxes, penalties, and interest, with further recoveries expected as authorities continue their probe. Among the other exchanges under scrutiny, Zanmai Labs Pvt (WazirX) faces allegations of evading $4.9 million, CoinDCX is accused of evading $2 million, and CoinSwitch Kuber is linked to $1.7 million in GST evasion. The agency is also investigating four crypto investors who were found to have evaded $210,000 in GST. Authorities have already recovered $290,000 from these individuals, covering taxes, penalties, and interest. Chaudhary also highlighted the government’s growing efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency sector, noting that 47 Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers (VDA SPs) have been registered as Reporting Entities with the Financial Intelligence Unit-India under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. This is not the first instance of the government acting against crypto exchanges. In 2021-22, 11 platforms were penalized for tax evasion, with $1.08 million in unpaid taxes identified. At the time, authorities successfully recovered $1.2 million, including penalties. Crackdown on Binance’s Tax Evasion This report comes months after Indian law enforcement agencies demanded around $86 million in unpaid taxes from Binance in August. Binance and several other offshore crypto exchanges were banned in India in January 2024 for non-compliance with local regulations. However, in April, the exchange announced its intention to resume operations in the country after settling pending taxes. Despite this, in August 2024, the Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence (DGGI) demanded $86 million from Binance under GST. According to The Times of India, the platform had reportedly earned $480 million from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. Investigations revealed that these earnings were credited to an account belonging to Nest Services Ltd. Authorities also sent email notices to Binance’s offices in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands, and Switzerland, which the exchange initially ignored. Binance later appointed local counsel to address its tax obligations. India requires all crypto service providers and investors to pay a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on every transaction, regardless of its value. Additionally, all profits from crypto investments are subject to a 30% tax.

Just last month, the SHIB Army organised a charity event, raising thousands of dollars while promoting the coin. With the launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain, Shiba Inu is entering uncharted territory. This move could lower transaction fees and boost adoption, paving the way for even more significant growth. Dogs: The Underrated Contender with a Strong Bite While lesser-known than its counterparts, Dogs is making a name for itself in the meme coin world. Its focus on creating a sustainable, community-driven model sets it apart. Dogs doesn’t overcomplicate things. The coin’s mission is straightforward: to create a fun, engaging community while delivering steady growth for its investors. This simplicity resonates with a wide audience, from crypto newbies to seasoned traders. Dogs is all about its people.

One recent event saw Dogs’ developers answer hundreds of questions from eager investors, showcasing their transparency and dedication. Dogs might not have the hype of BTFD Coin or the legacy of Shiba Inu, but it has the potential for steady, long-term growth. Its low market cap and focus on community engagement make it a hidden gem for those willing to take a chance. Conclusion Meme coins are here to stay, and each of these tokens proves why. BTFD Coin shines as a presale powerhouse with its Play2Earn game, staking rewards, and vibrant community.

The trend currently looks bullish following a 14% increase since yesterday. Last week saw WIF through an end to a three-week retracement after retesting the key $3 level. Holding this level as support, the meme coin entered a consolidation phase and remained calm throughout the week. Things changed this week due to enhanced volatility and the price tests broke out of the consolidation phase yesterday. Trading looks indecisive today as the bulls are yet to reiterate actions due to low buying pressure. While today may end strong, more positive actions should be expected in the future. An increase above $5 should set WIF up for bigger moves. Looking at the daily chart, it seems to be repeating last month’s pattern and if that comes into play, this current buying phase could reach $6. The bears are currently off the market. If they return with a pull below the mentioned key level, it may navigate the ascending trendline, which has been acting as diagonal support over the past months. From the look of things, WIF will likely increase rather than decrease in the coming week. WIF’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The potential resistance level for the latest surge is $4.86 – November’s high. A successful break above it should soar the price to a new high of $6. The next key level to watch above this high is $7. Losing the holding key support, the close level to watch for a rebound is $2.54, testing the ascending trendline. Breaking it could roll us back to last month’s $1.9 low.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 21:55:00

Pepe ended last month’s trading super strong after going through a short pullback. This brought a little pause in the bullish momentum as the price revisited the previously broken resistance (yearly high) as support. Bouncing back in the late month, the price increased but fell slightly earlier this week. Intercepting the $0.0000188 level, the buyers pushed back and briefly broke higher to a new high of $0.000027 yesterday. That high was rejected, and the price dropped to $0.000025, where it traded calmly. As volatility turned low in the past hours, the buyers are finding it difficult to sustain pressure. A further drop could bring a little retest at the $0.000023 level that broke on the lower timeframe. However, from the look of things, the buyers are likely to gain more dominance in the coming days. But if yesterday’s rejection turned out to be a double-top pattern, it may lose grip until it finds a solid level for a rebound. As of now, the trend remains strongly bullish daily. Looking at the daily chart, Pepe has provided a notable discount during the last leg down, and considering the latest bounce back, we can expect a huge rally in the coming week. Pepe’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview While trading under the key $0.00003 level, the higher price level to watch for an increase is $0.00004, followed by the $0.00005 level. The long-term target to keep in mind is $0.0001. The $0.0000173 level has been providing support since Pepe bounced back in late November. If by any chance it collapses, the $0.0000131 and $0.0000101 levels are lower supports to keep in mind for a test. Key Resistance Levels: $0.00003, $0.00004, $0.00005 Key Support Levels: $0.0000173, $0.0000131, $0.0000101 Spot Price: $0.0000245 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This marks a significant development for the meme coin, as it had struggled to break past this level for weeks. The move has sparked renewed optimism among traders and investors who see potential for further upside. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast – Analyst Sets $4 Target After Potential Retrace Key data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment highlights that Dogecoin, along with other meme coins, is experiencing mini breakouts this weekend. This trend suggests increasing bullish momentum in the meme coin sector, often viewed as a precursor to broader market rallies. The data indicates rising trading volumes and heightened on-chain activity, both of which point to sustained interest in Dogecoin. If this momentum continues, Dogecoin could be on the verge of extending its recent gains, with many market participants eyeing the $0.50 psychological level as the next target. A successful breakout above $0.50 could pave the way for even higher levels, further fueling the ongoing rally. However, failure to maintain its upward trajectory might lead to a period of consolidation. Dogecoin Sets The Stage For New Highs Dogecoin is positioning itself for higher prices as it continues its upward trajectory, but the latest breakout lacked the explosive momentum many anticipated. Despite pushing past critical levels, Dogecoin failed to sustain its price above the previous high, signaling a need for more significant buying pressure to maintain its rally. Blockchain analytics platform Santiment has shed light on the recent activity, revealing that meme coins like Dogecoin, Pepe, Dogewithhat, and Bonk are experiencing mini breakouts this weekend. According to their data, larger wallets, often referred to as “whales,” have been instrumental in driving up market caps for these coins. This trend is expected to continue until retail FOMO (fear of missing out) resurfaces, potentially pushing prices higher in the short term. However, the dynamics of meme coin markets suggest caution. Santiment’s analysis shows that when social dominance for these tokens spikes significantly, it often signals a market top. Whales typically capitalize on heightened retail enthusiasm, offloading their holdings at inflated prices. This pattern frequently results in a sharp retrace as prices correct following the sell-off. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Keep Buying – Price Holds Above Crucial Mark Santiment also shared a comparative chart tracking social dominance across these meme coins, highlighting past instances where peaks in attention preceded pullbacks. For Dogecoin, maintaining its current momentum while avoiding overbought conditions will be critical to sustaining its rally. Price Testing Fresh Supply Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.46, following a failed attempt to break decisively above the $0.48 level. The price remains in a consolidation phase, struggling to build enough momentum to push beyond the psychological $0.50 mark. Despite this, the broader market sentiment remains bullish, offering a supportive backdrop for potential price advances. The current environment suggests that Dogecoin is likely to continue ranging below $0.50 in the near term. However, if bulls can muster the strength to break above this critical level and sustain it for a few days, a massive breakout could be on the horizon. Breaking and holding above $0.50 would likely signal renewed buying interest, setting the stage for a strong rally. The bullish market conditions driving other major cryptocurrencies could also work in Dogecoin’s favor, provided that overall sentiment continues to improve. Still, traders should watch for clear confirmation of a breakout before expecting significant price movements. Related Reading: SUI About To Break ATH Again – Can Bulls Target $4.20 This Week?

For investors eyeing the best altcoins to invest in for short-term ROIs, it’s all about spotting the next big wave before it crests. And boy, do we have some movers and shakers for you! Today, we’re diving into three altcoins that are making serious noise: Qubetics, AAVE, and Near Protocol. These projects aren’t just riding the crypto hype train—they’re powering it. Take Qubetics , for example: this blockchain disruptor has raised a jaw-dropping $5 million in its presale, selling over 288 million $TICS tokens. With its price currently sitting at $0.0282 and climbing, it’s no wonder analysts are predicting massive short-term ROIs. Meanwhile, AAVE and Near Protocol are flexing their muscles in DeFi and scalability, proving there’s plenty of room for innovation in this volatile market. Buckle up, because this ride’s about to get interesting. Qubetics: The New Blockchain on the Block If you haven’t heard of Qubetics , you’re missing out on one of the hottest presales of the year. This revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain aims to unify networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum with its groundbreaking chain abstraction technology. Translation? Qubetics makes it ridiculously easy to manage real-world tokenised assets , conduct cross-border payments, and launch decentralised applications. It’s not just a blockchain; it’s a next-gen digital economy. The numbers speak for themselves: Qubetics has raised over $5 million in its presale, selling a whopping 288 million $TICS tokens. That’s not hype—it’s proof that investors are seeing the long-term potential here. At a current presale price of $0.0282, you’d snag about 177,304 $TICS tokens for a $5,000 investment. Now, let’s dream a little: analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, giving you an ROI of 785%. And if post-launch momentum propels it to $1 or more? We’re talking about life-changing gains. Why is Qubetics standing out? Because it solves major pain points in the crypto world—scalability, interoperability, and security—all in one sleek package. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious newbie, this one’s worth watching closely. Learn more by watching this video . AAVE: The DeFi Darling Moving over to AAVE, the poster child for decentralised finance. If Qubetics is the bold new kid on the block, AAVE is the savvy veteran redefining how we interact with money. Its protocol lets users lend and borrow assets without a middleman—kind of like Venmo but decentralised and with way cooler tech. AAVE has been making waves recently, with its total value locked (TVL) climbing steadily. But the real appeal here is its short-term potential. With the launch of its AAVE v3 upgrade, which improves cross-chain functionality and liquidity efficiency, the token is expected to see significant price action. Imagine investing in AAVE at its current price of $246.79. With analysts predicting a potential ROI of 30% in just a few weeks, the gains can simply be mind-blowing. Sure, it’s not Qubetics-level explosive growth, but in the world of crypto, steady gains can still add up. AAVE isn’t just a token; it’s an ecosystem. From staking to governance to seamless DeFi applications, it’s a must-watch for anyone serious about crypto investments. Near Protocol: The Quiet Powerhouse Now, let’s talk about Near Protocol—a blockchain that flies a little under the radar but is quietly building the future. Near combines user-friendly tech with serious scalability, making it a top choice for developers creating dApps and DeFi platforms. Near’s short-term potential lies in its growing ecosystem. Recent partnerships and the buzz around its sharding technology (which splits the blockchain into smaller pieces for faster transactions) have analysts bullish. Let’s do the math: If you invest your money at its current price of $7.36 and the price climbs to $18.76 in the short term, as some experts suggest, you’re looking at a little bit over a cool 150% ROI. Not bad at all! Near is proof that you don’t need to be flashy to be effective. It’s quietly building a foundation for long-term success, which is why it’s a solid choice for both short-term traders and long-term holders. Why Timing Matters When Buying the Best Altcoins to Invest in for Short-Term ROIs Investing in crypto for short-term ROIs is all about timing. Whether it’s Qubetics smashing presale records, AAVE revolutionising DeFi, or Near Protocol scaling to new heights, the window of opportunity doesn’t stay open forever. Crypto moves fast, and today’s underdog can become tomorrow’s champion in the blink of an eye. Wrapping Up: The Big Picture Qubetics, AAVE, and Near Protocol each bring something unique to the table. Qubetics offers mind-blowing growth potential with its disruptive blockchain tech. AAVE continues to lead the DeFi charge with innovation and reliability. And Near Protocol proves that quiet powerhouses can still deliver massive returns. If you’re looking to make moves in the crypto world, don’t sleep on these projects. Qubetics’ presale is already setting the stage for historic returns, and with the token price expected to skyrocket, now’s the time to act. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the Qubetics presale, stack up on AAVE and Near Protocol, and get ready to ride the wave of short-term ROIs. Because in the world of crypto, fortune favours the bold.

This proposal is the same as Microsoft’s proposed by Michael Taylor a few weeks ago. The National Center for Public Policy Research, an independent global conservative think tank based in Washington D.C, has proposed the Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategic reserve to the 5th world’s largest company, Amazon. This proposal aims to bid the cash and cash equivalent of the company, which accounts for $88 billion that includes the U.S. government, corporate, and foreign bonds, to consider adding Bitcoin to its strategic reserve by the next annual meeting in April 2025. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding asset to its treasury that appriciate more than bonds, even if those asset are more volatile short-term,” Based on the document that was shared by Tim Kotzman X’s post on Dec. 09 The U.S. inflation rate reached a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, which is the main reason why the company should adopt Bitcoin as the other company did. As their bond rates also did not exceed the real inflation, it’s not adequate to protect billions of dollars of shareholders by holding these assets. National Center also noted that Bitcoin’s performance in the past year has risen to 131%, surpassing the bonds by 126%. It also outperforms the corporate bonds by 1.246% in a single year.

A few weeks ago, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor also presented the Bitcoin reserve for Microsoft; the company will decide it within this week. They also mentioned that Saylor’s action is followed by many companies and institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, which are releasing Bitcoin’s ETF to the stock market earlier this year. In conclusion, the National Center has advised Amazon to diversify its balance sheet by adding at least 5% of its assets into Bitcoin. It’s not only part of the move that technological companies need to make, but they should preserve their asset and the value of the shareholders with the unbeaten inflation of digital assets.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIBTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 23:26:00

In an opinion piece for Hankyoreh , the author and crypto journalist Kim Oe-hyeon identified four key reasons why domestic traders responded to Yoon’s move with a mass sell-off. Martial Law Decree Sparked ‘Crypto Chaos’ Kim noted that “a number of structural problems” worked in tandem behind the scenes to cause chaos on South Korean crypto exchanges . Trading volumes spiked on platforms like Upbit and Bithumb late on December 3 when Yoon declared martial law. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past seven days. (Source: CoinGecko) Crypto traders continued to sell off their coins in the early hours of December 4. But the sell-off came to an abrupt halt after Yoon accepted the National Assembly’s decision to block his martial law decree. Trading volumes have since shrunk back to their lowest level in almost a month. South Korean media outlets on December 8 reported that parliament’s subsequent failed motion to impeach Yoon had so far failed to move investors to act. The market has also been unmoved by a series of prosecution service attempts to arrest the President on “treason” charges. Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past month. (Source: CoinGecko) Kim wrote that Yoon’s “absurd” decision to declare martial law had “sent huge shock waves” across the crypto market “in real-time.” Bitcoin (BTC) prices tumbled by up to 30% on major exchanges, at a time when the token was trading for just under $96,000 on overseas platforms. The leader of South Korea’s ruling People Power Party says that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will manage the nation’s affairs as the country deals with the fallout from a political crisis sparked by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s bungled martial law. https://t.co/trWbLHg1yk — Bloomberg (@business) December 8, 2024 ‘Uncertainty and Anxiety’ Kim wrote that the first major fact influencing the price drop was a sudden rush of “uncertainty and anxiety.” He added that traders were concerned about the “possibility of additional regulations such as asset freezes or the suspension of exchange operations.” Hong (first name withheld), a Seoul-based crypto investor, told Cryptonews.com that he “slept through the whole thing,” but noted that some of his acquaintances joined the sell-off. He said: “When I woke up, I checked my [crypto-themed chat app] groups and saw that once a few people said they were selling their tokens for cash, others said they’d do the same. I think that once a few traders said they were selling, it had a snowball effect.” The Special Prosecutor’s Office said Sunday that President Yoon Suk Yeol is now a suspect facing potential charges of insurrection and abuse of power. https://t.co/WdqVq7ef5j — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 8, 2024 Kim, meanwhile, noted that the “structural characteristics” of the South Korean market had “amplified” anxiety levels. He remarked that, unlike the United States, the South Korean market is “overwhelmingly dominated by individual investors.” He explained: “This means that the market is structured to be easily swayed by news and sentiment.” A ‘Vicious Cycle’ And the expert noted that ill-timed network issues may also have spooked the market. He added that late on December 3, “many investors” were complaining “about connection problems with major exchanges such as Upbit and Bithumb.” Kim wrote: “This further fueled investor anxiety. And it led to a vicious cycle of sudden sales whenever orders became available. This is a chronic problem that occurs every time there is a market crash. And it is not being fixed.” Online Korean-language crypto- and stock trading-related forums also contained accounts of “crashes” on Bithumb and Upbit. One investor claimed he had successfully tried to “buy” the 30% “dip,” but “couldn’t buy more” because Bithumb’s site was down. Another trader said they had “sold” their holdings at a “low price,” and then mused: “I regret acting so quickly. The news came like a bolt from the blue in the middle of the night.” US calls for 'proper' functioning of democratic processes in S. Korea after scrapped impeachment motion https://t.co/VIVbwGL1WC — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 8, 2024 Lack of Market Makers ‘a Problem’ Kim, meanwhile, noted that a fourth factor had also helped fuel the panic. He noted that since the launch of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in July, “market-making activities have been prohibited.” The act classifies many traditional market-making activities as a form of “unfair” crypto trading. As such, there is no longer anyone to “fill in the gaps between bids” and help “mitigate volatility.” The expert explained: “Market makers provide liquidity in the market and mitigate price volatility by simultaneously presenting buy and sell prices. If they had provided buy prices and acted as a buffer [on December 3-4], the price drop would not have been so large.” The post Expert Explains Why Martial Law Threw South Korea’s Crypto Markets into Chaos appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Bitcoin Price|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-08 23:30:00

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed the breach in a social media post. However, before action was taken, the scam token generated about $500,000 in trading volume, only to crash by 99%.

Frequent X Account Hacks Targeting Crypto Projects The Cardano Foundation joins a growing list of entities impacted by social media hacks involving crypto scams. In December 2023, Compound Finance’s X account was hacked, with phishing links posted to a counterfeit website advertising fake COMP tokens. These links drained funds from unsuspecting users. In October 2024, Symbiotic’s X account was hacked, and the attacker posted fake interaction checklists resembling airdrop campaigns. These led users to phishing sites that stole legitimate tokens. The same month, Eigenlayer’s X account was compromised to promote a fraudulent airdrop campaign. Even non-crypto accounts have been targeted. On October 29, the Truth Terminal AI account was hacked to market a scam memecoin.

37401173,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624631,1733701841,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37401173.jpeg,President Trump says he never wanted to kick Jerome Powell out of the Federal Reserve,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/president-trump-says-he-never-wanted-to-kick-jerome-powell-out-of-the-federal-reserve/,"President-elect Donald Trump has shut down speculation about removing Jerome Powell from his position as Federal Reserve Chair. These speculations come from him saying during campaign that he would take over the central bank and be in charge of the economy himself. But now, in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press , Trump said , “Fire him? No, I don’t see it.” “I think if I told him to, he would,” the president added. “But if I asked him to, he probably wouldn’t.” Sounds like he knows his man all too well. He did appoint him, after all. And Powell has made it clear that he’s not going anywhere. Days after Trump’s victory, the Fed chair reaffirmed the central bank’s independence, telling reporters he wouldn’t step aside if asked and that the president doesn’t have the authority to fire him or other senior Fed leaders. Trump’s take on Powell and monetary policy Trump’s views on the Federal Reserve have always been controversial. He genuinely believes that the president should have more influence over monetary policy. In an October interview with Bloomberg, Trump said, “I think I have the right to say, ‘I think you should go up or down a little bit.’ I don’t think I should be allowed to order it, but I think I should be able to comment.” He didn’t stop there. Trump ridiculed Powell’s job, calling it “the greatest job in government.” In his words, “You show up to the office once a month, and you say, ‘Let’s see, flip a coin.’” It’s no secret that Trump’s frustration with Powell stems from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes during his first term, which Trump believed slowed economic growth. Back in 2018, Trump even considered firing Powell but didn’t follow through. Legal scholars pointed out that removing a Federal Reserve Chair isn’t as simple as giving the order. The Federal Reserve Act only allows board members to be removed “for cause,” which means serious misconduct or abuse of power, not just disagreements over policy. “Looks like I’m stuck with you,” Trump told him over the phone one night from the Oval. Despite their past clashes, Powell has said he isn’t anticipating new tensions with Trump’s administration. While Powell’s term as Chair runs through 2026, his 14-year tenure as a Federal Reserve Governor doesn’t expire until 2028, which gives Trump limited room to replace him outright. POTUS’ power over the Federal Reserve The president of the United States has the power to appoint members to the Board of Governors. This includes selecting key roles like Chair and Vice-Chair. Governors serve 14-year terms, and chairs serve four-year terms. All of them sit on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the group that decides interest rates. During his next term, Trump will have at least two opportunities to appoint members to the Fed Board. One of those openings will come in January 2026 when Fed Governor Adriana Kugler’s term ends. These appointments will require Senate confirmation, but with a Republican majority in the Senate, Trump is likely to face less resistance than he did during his first presidency, when several of his Fed picks were blocked. Even with these appointments, Trump’s influence is limited. The Fed’s policymaking structure includes 12 regional bank presidents who are selected independently by the boards of their respective banks, subject to approval from the Federal Reserve Board. This decentralized system reduces the president’s ability to directly control monetary policy. Trump isn’t the first president to try to influence the Federal Reserve, but his approach has been one of the most public. He often airs his grievances in press conferences and interviews, accusing Powell of making poor policy decisions. He also criticizes the Fed’s track record, saying they’ve “sort of gotten it wrong a lot.” According to Trump, Powell’s timing on key decisions has been “a little bit too early and a little bit too late.” The case for Fed independence The central bank’s role is to manage inflation and employment without political interference, which Powell believes is essential for maintaining credibility with investors and the public. “Without question, the Fed must remain apolitical,” Powell said earlier this year. But the reality is more complicated. The Federal Reserve often operates within a political context, collaborating with the Treasury Department and considering the economic impact of government policies like tax cuts or spending initiatives. Critics argue this interaction makes it impossible for the Fed to be entirely apolitical. Economists like Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the Wharton School, describe the Federal Reserve as a “deeply political institution.” However, he distinguishes between politics and partisanship, emphasizing that the Fed’s decisions often reflect input from multiple factions. Despite these challenges, the Federal Reserve has maintained its independence for over a century. Central banks around the world rely on this model to make tough decisions, such as raising interest rates to fight inflation, without fear of political retaliation.

Cardano eyes a $1.3 breakout as momentum builds With the Cardano price up over 20% in the previous week, the altcoin has been showing notable positive momentum. Moreover, the Cardano price has exceeded the $1 resistance level and rallied to the $1.3 zone . Still, the past month has been even more remarkable since Cardano (ADA) jumped around 270%, mirroring its rising investor sentiment. The Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin has displayed great market confidence by maintaining above the $1.2 support despite encountering resistance at the $1.3 level. Experts believe Cardano might rapidly break above the $1.3 resistance and maybe even surge to $2 very soon if the bullish trend keeps up. Technical indicators are also bolstering Cardano’s positive view. As the Cardano price chart shows, key indicators, including the MACD, Moving Averages, and Awesome Oscillator all show a strong increasing trend. A classic indication of ongoing bullish pressure, Cardano (ADA) keeps producing higher highs and higher lows. Dogecoin Targets breakout to ATH Rising by almost 10% in just the past week, the Dogecoin price has been on a notable upward path. Although the Dogecoin price has lately consolidated between the $0.48 and $0.38 levels, it has had an amazing 165% growth over the previous month, therefore rekindling investor excitement. Many of the Dogecoin holders who bought the dips are now keenly awaiting the next breakout. Given the Dogecoin price chart showing that the altcoin’s present price remains around 40% below its all-time high of $0.737 from 2021, there is clearly room for notable gains particularly should Dogecoin be able to break over the $0.47 resistance level. Strong buy signals from the MACD and Moving Averages on the Dogecoin price chart help to further validate the momentum building for a possible comeback. Should Dogecoin be able to exceed its present resistance levels, we could see a rally toward the $1 mark this cycle. Lunex Network could outpace Cardano and Dogecoin Lunex Network is positioned to outpace Cardano and Dogecoin with its special mix of security, privacy, and ultra-low transaction fees, even though both altcoins exhibit encouraging indications of bullish momentum. Lunex Network is creating major excitement with over 50% of its presale tokens sold already, and early investors are already getting significant returns.

At the same time, popular meme coins, like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE, have continued their exponential growth trajectory. PEPE, for instance, has now forged a new all-time high price of $0.00002644 less than a month after shattering its previous record-high price. This latest price spike highlights the bullish momentum the meme token has been enjoying over the past few weeks. PEPE Price Overview As of this writing, the value of the Pepe token stands around $0.00002597, reflecting an impressive 21% price surge in the past 24 hours. This single-day performance is in stark contrast to how the meme coin had moved all week long. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breakout: Charting The Uncertain Part Of ETH To $18,000 According to data from CoinGecko, the price of PEPE has soared by nearly 27% in the past seven days. However, it is worth noting that the altcoin was locked in a consolidation range around the $0.000022 region for most of the past week. On a broader timeframe, the price action of PEPE has been remarkable, with the meme coin more than doubling its value in the month of November. CoinGecko data shows that the price of the meme-inspired token has increased by more than 140% in the last 30 days. After a positive September, which saw the value of PEPE briefly cross the $0.00001 mark, investors expected the meme coin to take off. However, Pepe’s price failed to live up to expectations in the month of October. In November, the meme coin went on a parabolic run to crash its previous all-time high of $0.00001665 and set a new one at $0.00002343. This bullish momentum coincided with the positive climate of the general market, which saw Bitcoin reach successive all-time highs. As a result of its red-hot performance, various crypto exchanges, including Binance.US, have now listed the popular Pepe meme coin on Thursday, December 5. It appears that its listing on one of the largest crypto exchanges in the United States has helped renew its bullish momentum. PEPE Market Cap Hits $10 Billion According to data from CoinGecko, the market capitalization of PEPE has now surpassed the $10 billion mark. This value places the meme coin as the 25th largest cryptocurrency in the digital asset sector.
