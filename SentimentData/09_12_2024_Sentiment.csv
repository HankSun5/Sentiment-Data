These moments remind us of one thing: the best always push beyond their limits. And now, the crypto world has its own record-setter: XYZ, the first-ever all-sports meme coin. Combining the energy of sports with the explosive potential of meme coins, XYZ is breaking presale records faster than a Conor McGregor knockout. In just 12 days, Stage 7 of the XYZ presale sold out, raising over $2,000,000.

The momentum is real, the stakes are high, and the question is: how fast XYZ will crush this stage? The Stats Don’t Lie—Here’s Why You Need to Act Fast The $XYZ presale is live and already moving faster than a championship sprint. Here’s where the numbers stand: 💥 Current Price (Stage 8): $0.001 – This represents a 100x potential gain compared to the listing price. 🔥 Next Stage Price: $0.001333 – Still a massive opportunity, with a 75x gain potential versus the listing price. 🎯 Final Presale Price: $0.1 – The ultimate destination, where the token prepares to launch into the broader market. 🚀 Upside Potential: A jaw-dropping 9,900%, giving investors the chance to turn small investments into life-changing gains.

This Crypto is Your Chance Now for Massive Gains in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-chance-to-join-algorand-this-crypto-is-your-chance-now-for-massive-gains-in-2025/,"If you’ve been keeping tabs on the crypto market lately, you know it’s been a whirlwind. Algorand (ALGO) has been at the center of attention, skyrocketing in price thanks to its fast, secure, and eco-friendly blockchain. But let’s face it—if you didn’t jump in during its earlier days, you’re probably wondering if it’s too late to see those jaw-dropping returns. Don’t worry, though. Missing the ALGO train isn’t the end of the line. There’s a new player in town, and it’s got analysts buzzing. Say hello to Qubetics ($TICS), the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for anyone looking to make massive gains in 2025. While Algorand has been making waves in scalability and decentralisation, Qubetics is carving out its own lane with real-world asset tokenisation. Imagine owning a slice of prime real estate, fine art, or even small businesses, all without the massive upfront costs. That’s the power of Qubetics. And right now, it’s in its presale phase, which means you’ve got a golden opportunity to jump in early and ride the wave to potentially life-changing returns. Qubetics ($TICS): A New Frontier in Asset Tokenisation Let’s get one thing straight: Qubetics isn’t just another “hype” token. It’s solving a real-world problem that most crypto projects barely scratch the surface of—making high-value assets accessible to everyday investors. Think about it. How many of us dream about owning a piece of a luxury condo, investing in a startup, or putting money into rare art? For most folks, those opportunities feel about as out of reach as winning the lottery. But Qubetics is changing all that with its Web3 aggregator platform. Here’s how it works: Qubetics takes real-world assets—like real estate, businesses, and even fine art—and breaks them into smaller, tokenised shares. That means you don’t need millions to get in the game. For example, say you’re a small-town teacher in Kansas with $300 to invest. With Qubetics, you could own a piece of a high-end Manhattan apartment or a slice of a growing café in Seattle. It’s like crowdfunding, but on steroids. And it’s not just individuals who benefit. Businesses are loving this model, too. A local brewery in Texas could tokenize its equity to fund a new taproom, while an artist in LA could sell shares of their latest painting to collectors worldwide. By democratizing asset ownership, Qubetics is opening doors that were once slammed shut for anyone without deep pockets. Now, let’s talk numbers. Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 11, priced at just $0.0282 per $TICS. So far, it’s raised over $5 million, with more than 288 million tokens sold to a growing community of 7,500+ holders. And here’s the kicker: a 10% price increase happens every week, with a final phase bump of 20% before the token launches at $0.25. That’s a potential 900% ROI for early investors. Let’s break it down with an example. If you invest $300 today, you’ll snag roughly 10,638 $TICS tokens. When the price hits $0.25 after the presale, your investment could be worth a cool $2,659.50. That’s enough to kickstart your 2025 goals, whether it’s paying off bills, starting a side hustle, or just treating yourself to something nice. Algorand (ALGO): A Green Giant Making Big Moves Algorand has been a darling of the crypto world for a reason. It’s fast, secure, and, most importantly, eco-friendly—a major selling point in a world where sustainability is top of mind. Designed by MIT professor Silvio Micali, Algorand’s blockchain is a marvel of efficiency, capable of handling thousands of transactions per second without breaking a sweat. Over the past year, ALGO has seen a massive resurgence, fueled by partnerships with governments, institutions, and even DeFi projects. Its price surged by over 75% in just one week, reaching a new yearly high of $0.5208. Open Interest (OI) in ALGO futures has also skyrocketed, jumping from $75.69 million to $204 million in a matter of days. This influx of capital has analysts buzzing, with some predicting ALGO could hit $0.75 in the short term and potentially cross the $1 mark by mid-2025. But here’s the rub: While Algorand’s tech is undeniably impressive, its gains might not be as explosive as they once were. For early adopters, the ride has been thrilling. But for new investors jumping in at these higher price levels, the upside might feel more like a gradual climb than a rocket launch. That said, ALGO is still a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable blockchain project with long-term potential. Its use cases in areas like supply chain management, digital identity, and carbon offset tracking make it a cornerstone of the green blockchain movement. But if you’re hunting for those “life-changing gains,” you might want to look at newer projects like Qubetics. Don’t Miss Out—Get in on Qubetics Before It’s Too Late So, where should you put your money—Qubetics or Algorand? Honestly, it depends on your goals. If you’re looking for a tried-and-true blockchain project with a focus on sustainability and scalability, Algorand is a safe bet. It’s already proven itself, and its partnerships give it a strong foundation for growth. But if you’re chasing those big, juicy returns that make your friends go, “Wait, you made how much?” Qubetics is the clear winner. Its presale phase is a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a project that’s tackling a massive market. With its real-world asset tokenisation model, Qubetics is poised to become a household name in 2025. And let’s not forget that potential 900% ROI—that’s the kind of growth most crypto investors dream about. Crypto is all about timing, and the clock is ticking on Qubetics’ presale. If you’ve been kicking yourself for missing the Algorand frenzy, now’s your chance to turn things around. With a growing community, innovative technology, and analysts calling it the best crypto to buy in December 2024 , Qubetics has all the makings of a breakout star. Head to the Qubetics presale page today and lock in your investment before the next price hike. Whether you’re putting down $300 or going all in, this could be your ticket to massive gains in 2025. Don’t wait until you’re reading about its success next year—be a part of it now.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful take on cryptocurrency. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's scarcity, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Starting as a joke, it quickly gained a following, showing the power of community and social media. In 2021, Dogecoin's value soared, fueled by online buzz and endorsements from Elon Musk. It entered the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value over $50 billion. Is Dogecoin worth considering now? Its technology is simple, similar to early cryptocurrencies but without a supply limit. This means it's less about scarcity and more about usage and community support. While some see it as a fun entry into crypto, others are cautious due to its meme origins and volatility. Compared to coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features like smart contracts. Yet, its strong community keeps it popular. In the current market, if you're drawn to a coin with a passionate following and accept the risks, Dogecoin might be attractive. Conclusion While coins like DOGE, PEPE, and MOG offer strong potential, XYZVerse stands out as the pioneering all-sport memecoin poised for exceptional growth in the current bull run.

In the current market, if you're drawn to a coin with a passionate following and accept the risks, Dogecoin might be attractive. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene in August 2020, inspired by Dogecoin. Unlike its predecessor, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, opening up possibilities in the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Launched by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens. To gain credibility, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin's donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply brought significant attention to SHIB. SHIB's place on Ethereum allows it to support smart contracts and decentralized apps. This led to ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade SHIB and other tokens. The team also plans an NFT platform and a governance system using a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). These features give SHIB real utility beyond being a meme. In the current market, where investors seek coins with real-world uses, SHIB's technology and growth plans make it attractive. While sharing Dogecoin's meme appeal, SHIB's Ethereum foundation could give it an edge in the long run. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB remain popular, XYZVerse offers a unique blend of sports and memes, aiming for massive growth and to become the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

As Inflation is going up, cash and bonds aren’t the best way to protect a company’s money anymore. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has been increasing in value. In 2024, Bitcoin grew by 131%, which is much better than bonds. Over the last five years, Bitcoin’s value went up by more than 1,200%, which is far outpacing bonds. Shareholders believe that with Amazon’s $585 billion in assets, including $88 billion in cash and bonds, the company should consider adding Bitcoin to its reserves. Holding Bitcoin could help Amazon protect its profits from inflation and possibly earn better returns in the future. Following the proposal, which is already making rounds on X (formerly Twitter), former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) made a post by asking the company to simply add support for crypto as a payment option on the leading e-commerce platform. “Simple. Accept bitcoin payments?,” CZ posted. Simple. Accept bitcoin payments? 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/ud5PVNYHrj — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 8, 2024 Companies like MicroStrategy, which holds a lot of Bitcoin, have seen their stock prices increase. Other companies like Tesla and Block (formerly Square) have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The proposal suggests that Amazon could do the same to increase shareholder value. While Bitcoin is a volatile asset, having some Bitcoin in its reserves could give Amazon more long-term value, even if its value fluctuates in the short term. The shareholders suggest that Amazon could start by holding just 5% of its assets in Bitcoin in the initial. This proposal reflects a bigger trend of companies starting to see Bitcoin as a safe investment to protect against inflation. Microsoft’s shareholders are voting soon on whether to add Bitcoin to their balance sheet. As Bitcoin becomes more accepted by big companies, it may soon become a regular part of how companies manage their assets. Amazon has yet to decide whether to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. However, one can say that more companies are likely to follow suit with firms like Microsoft and Amazon now joining the discussion.

Following Bitcoin’s milestone, the crypto-focused X account Autism Capital asked Bukele to disclose El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio to “dunk on the haters.” In response, Bukele posted the portfolio, revealing the nation’s nearly $270 million investment in Bitcoin. The portfolio confirms that no Bitcoin has been sold, and unrealized gains now exceed $333 million, a significant validation of the country’s strategy. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Journey El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on September 7, 2021, when its Bitcoin Law came into effect. A day prior, the government made its inaugural purchase of 200 BTC. Since then, the country has continued accumulating Bitcoin. On November 17, 2022, Bukele announced a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, committing to purchasing one Bitcoin daily. According to Nayib Tracker, a platform monitoring El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings, the country currently owns 6,180 BTC, with an average purchase price of $44,739.88. Based on current prices, the portfolio has gained approximately 122%. Beyond financial gains, El Salvador has also seen increased tourism and international recognition since adopting Bitcoin. IMF Urges El Salvador to Reconsider Despite the reported benefits, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly advised El Salvador to scale back its Bitcoin initiatives. On January 25, 2022, the IMF urged the country to stop recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender, citing financial stability risks but acknowledging its potential for financial inclusion. The IMF renewed its concerns on October 3, 2024, with communications director Julie Kozack recommending the country narrow the Bitcoin Law’s scope and limit public sector exposure to Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 21:32:44

As the altcoin season approaches, Polkadot could be set for significant gains, possibly exceeding previous highs. Conclusion Though AVAX and DOT show promise, their short-term potential is limited.

Nest Services Ltd., a company linked to Binance Group, stands out as one of the most significant offenders. The firm is accused of evading $86.8 million in GST. India Recovers $14.7M in Crypto Tax Crackdown According to an Economic Times report , Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary revealed in a written response to the Lok Sabha that investigations have been launched into these firms. The investigation has already led to the recovery of $14.7 million in taxes, penalties, and interest, with further recoveries expected as authorities continue their probe. Among the other exchanges under scrutiny, Zanmai Labs Pvt (WazirX) faces allegations of evading $4.9 million, CoinDCX is accused of evading $2 million, and CoinSwitch Kuber is linked to $1.7 million in GST evasion. The agency is also investigating four crypto investors who were found to have evaded $210,000 in GST. Authorities have already recovered $290,000 from these individuals, covering taxes, penalties, and interest. Chaudhary also highlighted the government’s growing efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency sector, noting that 47 Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers (VDA SPs) have been registered as Reporting Entities with the Financial Intelligence Unit-India under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. This is not the first instance of the government acting against crypto exchanges. In 2021-22, 11 platforms were penalized for tax evasion, with $1.08 million in unpaid taxes identified. At the time, authorities successfully recovered $1.2 million, including penalties. Crackdown on Binance’s Tax Evasion This report comes months after Indian law enforcement agencies demanded around $86 million in unpaid taxes from Binance in August. Binance and several other offshore crypto exchanges were banned in India in January 2024 for non-compliance with local regulations. However, in April, the exchange announced its intention to resume operations in the country after settling pending taxes. Despite this, in August 2024, the Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence (DGGI) demanded $86 million from Binance under GST. According to The Times of India, the platform had reportedly earned $480 million from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. Investigations revealed that these earnings were credited to an account belonging to Nest Services Ltd. Authorities also sent email notices to Binance’s offices in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands, and Switzerland, which the exchange initially ignored. Binance later appointed local counsel to address its tax obligations. India requires all crypto service providers and investors to pay a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on every transaction, regardless of its value. Additionally, all profits from crypto investments are subject to a 30% tax.

Just last month, the SHIB Army organised a charity event, raising thousands of dollars while promoting the coin. With the launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain, Shiba Inu is entering uncharted territory. This move could lower transaction fees and boost adoption, paving the way for even more significant growth. Dogs: The Underrated Contender with a Strong Bite While lesser-known than its counterparts, Dogs is making a name for itself in the meme coin world. Its focus on creating a sustainable, community-driven model sets it apart. Dogs doesn’t overcomplicate things. The coin’s mission is straightforward: to create a fun, engaging community while delivering steady growth for its investors. This simplicity resonates with a wide audience, from crypto newbies to seasoned traders. Dogs is all about its people.

One recent event saw Dogs’ developers answer hundreds of questions from eager investors, showcasing their transparency and dedication. Dogs might not have the hype of BTFD Coin or the legacy of Shiba Inu, but it has the potential for steady, long-term growth. Its low market cap and focus on community engagement make it a hidden gem for those willing to take a chance. Conclusion Meme coins are here to stay, and each of these tokens proves why. BTFD Coin shines as a presale powerhouse with its Play2Earn game, staking rewards, and vibrant community.

The trend currently looks bullish following a 14% increase since yesterday. Last week saw WIF through an end to a three-week retracement after retesting the key $3 level. Holding this level as support, the meme coin entered a consolidation phase and remained calm throughout the week. Things changed this week due to enhanced volatility and the price tests broke out of the consolidation phase yesterday. Trading looks indecisive today as the bulls are yet to reiterate actions due to low buying pressure. While today may end strong, more positive actions should be expected in the future. An increase above $5 should set WIF up for bigger moves. Looking at the daily chart, it seems to be repeating last month’s pattern and if that comes into play, this current buying phase could reach $6. The bears are currently off the market. If they return with a pull below the mentioned key level, it may navigate the ascending trendline, which has been acting as diagonal support over the past months. From the look of things, WIF will likely increase rather than decrease in the coming week. WIF’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The potential resistance level for the latest surge is $4.86 – November’s high. A successful break above it should soar the price to a new high of $6. The next key level to watch above this high is $7. Losing the holding key support, the close level to watch for a rebound is $2.54, testing the ascending trendline. Breaking it could roll us back to last month’s $1.9 low.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 21:55:00

Pepe ended last month’s trading super strong after going through a short pullback. This brought a little pause in the bullish momentum as the price revisited the previously broken resistance (yearly high) as support. Bouncing back in the late month, the price increased but fell slightly earlier this week. Intercepting the $0.0000188 level, the buyers pushed back and briefly broke higher to a new high of $0.000027 yesterday. That high was rejected, and the price dropped to $0.000025, where it traded calmly. As volatility turned low in the past hours, the buyers are finding it difficult to sustain pressure. A further drop could bring a little retest at the $0.000023 level that broke on the lower timeframe. However, from the look of things, the buyers are likely to gain more dominance in the coming days. But if yesterday’s rejection turned out to be a double-top pattern, it may lose grip until it finds a solid level for a rebound. As of now, the trend remains strongly bullish daily. Looking at the daily chart, Pepe has provided a notable discount during the last leg down, and considering the latest bounce back, we can expect a huge rally in the coming week. Pepe’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview While trading under the key $0.00003 level, the higher price level to watch for an increase is $0.00004, followed by the $0.00005 level. The long-term target to keep in mind is $0.0001. The $0.0000173 level has been providing support since Pepe bounced back in late November. If by any chance it collapses, the $0.0000131 and $0.0000101 levels are lower supports to keep in mind for a test. Key Resistance Levels: $0.00003, $0.00004, $0.00005 Key Support Levels: $0.0000173, $0.0000131, $0.0000101 Spot Price: $0.0000245 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This marks a significant development for the meme coin, as it had struggled to break past this level for weeks. The move has sparked renewed optimism among traders and investors who see potential for further upside. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast – Analyst Sets $4 Target After Potential Retrace Key data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment highlights that Dogecoin, along with other meme coins, is experiencing mini breakouts this weekend. This trend suggests increasing bullish momentum in the meme coin sector, often viewed as a precursor to broader market rallies. The data indicates rising trading volumes and heightened on-chain activity, both of which point to sustained interest in Dogecoin. If this momentum continues, Dogecoin could be on the verge of extending its recent gains, with many market participants eyeing the $0.50 psychological level as the next target. A successful breakout above $0.50 could pave the way for even higher levels, further fueling the ongoing rally. However, failure to maintain its upward trajectory might lead to a period of consolidation. Dogecoin Sets The Stage For New Highs Dogecoin is positioning itself for higher prices as it continues its upward trajectory, but the latest breakout lacked the explosive momentum many anticipated. Despite pushing past critical levels, Dogecoin failed to sustain its price above the previous high, signaling a need for more significant buying pressure to maintain its rally. Blockchain analytics platform Santiment has shed light on the recent activity, revealing that meme coins like Dogecoin, Pepe, Dogewithhat, and Bonk are experiencing mini breakouts this weekend. According to their data, larger wallets, often referred to as “whales,” have been instrumental in driving up market caps for these coins. This trend is expected to continue until retail FOMO (fear of missing out) resurfaces, potentially pushing prices higher in the short term. However, the dynamics of meme coin markets suggest caution. Santiment’s analysis shows that when social dominance for these tokens spikes significantly, it often signals a market top. Whales typically capitalize on heightened retail enthusiasm, offloading their holdings at inflated prices. This pattern frequently results in a sharp retrace as prices correct following the sell-off. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Keep Buying – Price Holds Above Crucial Mark Santiment also shared a comparative chart tracking social dominance across these meme coins, highlighting past instances where peaks in attention preceded pullbacks. For Dogecoin, maintaining its current momentum while avoiding overbought conditions will be critical to sustaining its rally. Price Testing Fresh Supply Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.46, following a failed attempt to break decisively above the $0.48 level. The price remains in a consolidation phase, struggling to build enough momentum to push beyond the psychological $0.50 mark. Despite this, the broader market sentiment remains bullish, offering a supportive backdrop for potential price advances. The current environment suggests that Dogecoin is likely to continue ranging below $0.50 in the near term. However, if bulls can muster the strength to break above this critical level and sustain it for a few days, a massive breakout could be on the horizon. Breaking and holding above $0.50 would likely signal renewed buying interest, setting the stage for a strong rally. The bullish market conditions driving other major cryptocurrencies could also work in Dogecoin’s favor, provided that overall sentiment continues to improve. Still, traders should watch for clear confirmation of a breakout before expecting significant price movements. Related Reading: SUI About To Break ATH Again – Can Bulls Target $4.20 This Week?

For investors eyeing the best altcoins to invest in for short-term ROIs, it’s all about spotting the next big wave before it crests. And boy, do we have some movers and shakers for you! Today, we’re diving into three altcoins that are making serious noise: Qubetics, AAVE, and Near Protocol. These projects aren’t just riding the crypto hype train—they’re powering it. Take Qubetics , for example: this blockchain disruptor has raised a jaw-dropping $5 million in its presale, selling over 288 million $TICS tokens. With its price currently sitting at $0.0282 and climbing, it’s no wonder analysts are predicting massive short-term ROIs. Meanwhile, AAVE and Near Protocol are flexing their muscles in DeFi and scalability, proving there’s plenty of room for innovation in this volatile market. Buckle up, because this ride’s about to get interesting. Qubetics: The New Blockchain on the Block If you haven’t heard of Qubetics , you’re missing out on one of the hottest presales of the year. This revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain aims to unify networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum with its groundbreaking chain abstraction technology. Translation? Qubetics makes it ridiculously easy to manage real-world tokenised assets , conduct cross-border payments, and launch decentralised applications. It’s not just a blockchain; it’s a next-gen digital economy. The numbers speak for themselves: Qubetics has raised over $5 million in its presale, selling a whopping 288 million $TICS tokens. That’s not hype—it’s proof that investors are seeing the long-term potential here. At a current presale price of $0.0282, you’d snag about 177,304 $TICS tokens for a $5,000 investment. Now, let’s dream a little: analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, giving you an ROI of 785%. And if post-launch momentum propels it to $1 or more? We’re talking about life-changing gains. Why is Qubetics standing out? Because it solves major pain points in the crypto world—scalability, interoperability, and security—all in one sleek package. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious newbie, this one’s worth watching closely. Learn more by watching this video . AAVE: The DeFi Darling Moving over to AAVE, the poster child for decentralised finance. If Qubetics is the bold new kid on the block, AAVE is the savvy veteran redefining how we interact with money. Its protocol lets users lend and borrow assets without a middleman—kind of like Venmo but decentralised and with way cooler tech. AAVE has been making waves recently, with its total value locked (TVL) climbing steadily. But the real appeal here is its short-term potential. With the launch of its AAVE v3 upgrade, which improves cross-chain functionality and liquidity efficiency, the token is expected to see significant price action. Imagine investing in AAVE at its current price of $246.79. With analysts predicting a potential ROI of 30% in just a few weeks, the gains can simply be mind-blowing. Sure, it’s not Qubetics-level explosive growth, but in the world of crypto, steady gains can still add up. AAVE isn’t just a token; it’s an ecosystem. From staking to governance to seamless DeFi applications, it’s a must-watch for anyone serious about crypto investments. Near Protocol: The Quiet Powerhouse Now, let’s talk about Near Protocol—a blockchain that flies a little under the radar but is quietly building the future. Near combines user-friendly tech with serious scalability, making it a top choice for developers creating dApps and DeFi platforms. Near’s short-term potential lies in its growing ecosystem. Recent partnerships and the buzz around its sharding technology (which splits the blockchain into smaller pieces for faster transactions) have analysts bullish. Let’s do the math: If you invest your money at its current price of $7.36 and the price climbs to $18.76 in the short term, as some experts suggest, you’re looking at a little bit over a cool 150% ROI. Not bad at all! Near is proof that you don’t need to be flashy to be effective. It’s quietly building a foundation for long-term success, which is why it’s a solid choice for both short-term traders and long-term holders. Why Timing Matters When Buying the Best Altcoins to Invest in for Short-Term ROIs Investing in crypto for short-term ROIs is all about timing. Whether it’s Qubetics smashing presale records, AAVE revolutionising DeFi, or Near Protocol scaling to new heights, the window of opportunity doesn’t stay open forever. Crypto moves fast, and today’s underdog can become tomorrow’s champion in the blink of an eye. Wrapping Up: The Big Picture Qubetics, AAVE, and Near Protocol each bring something unique to the table. Qubetics offers mind-blowing growth potential with its disruptive blockchain tech. AAVE continues to lead the DeFi charge with innovation and reliability. And Near Protocol proves that quiet powerhouses can still deliver massive returns. If you’re looking to make moves in the crypto world, don’t sleep on these projects. Qubetics’ presale is already setting the stage for historic returns, and with the token price expected to skyrocket, now’s the time to act. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the Qubetics presale, stack up on AAVE and Near Protocol, and get ready to ride the wave of short-term ROIs. Because in the world of crypto, fortune favours the bold.

This proposal is the same as Microsoft’s proposed by Michael Taylor a few weeks ago. The National Center for Public Policy Research, an independent global conservative think tank based in Washington D.C, has proposed the Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategic reserve to the 5th world’s largest company, Amazon. This proposal aims to bid the cash and cash equivalent of the company, which accounts for $88 billion that includes the U.S. government, corporate, and foreign bonds, to consider adding Bitcoin to its strategic reserve by the next annual meeting in April 2025. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding asset to its treasury that appriciate more than bonds, even if those asset are more volatile short-term,” Based on the document that was shared by Tim Kotzman X’s post on Dec. 09 The U.S. inflation rate reached a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, which is the main reason why the company should adopt Bitcoin as the other company did. As their bond rates also did not exceed the real inflation, it’s not adequate to protect billions of dollars of shareholders by holding these assets. National Center also noted that Bitcoin’s performance in the past year has risen to 131%, surpassing the bonds by 126%. It also outperforms the corporate bonds by 1.246% in a single year.

A few weeks ago, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor also presented the Bitcoin reserve for Microsoft; the company will decide it within this week. They also mentioned that Saylor’s action is followed by many companies and institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, which are releasing Bitcoin’s ETF to the stock market earlier this year. In conclusion, the National Center has advised Amazon to diversify its balance sheet by adding at least 5% of its assets into Bitcoin. It’s not only part of the move that technological companies need to make, but they should preserve their asset and the value of the shareholders with the unbeaten inflation of digital assets.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIBTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 23:26:00

In an opinion piece for Hankyoreh , the author and crypto journalist Kim Oe-hyeon identified four key reasons why domestic traders responded to Yoon’s move with a mass sell-off. Martial Law Decree Sparked ‘Crypto Chaos’ Kim noted that “a number of structural problems” worked in tandem behind the scenes to cause chaos on South Korean crypto exchanges . Trading volumes spiked on platforms like Upbit and Bithumb late on December 3 when Yoon declared martial law. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past seven days. (Source: CoinGecko) Crypto traders continued to sell off their coins in the early hours of December 4. But the sell-off came to an abrupt halt after Yoon accepted the National Assembly’s decision to block his martial law decree. Trading volumes have since shrunk back to their lowest level in almost a month. South Korean media outlets on December 8 reported that parliament’s subsequent failed motion to impeach Yoon had so far failed to move investors to act. The market has also been unmoved by a series of prosecution service attempts to arrest the President on “treason” charges. Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past month. (Source: CoinGecko) Kim wrote that Yoon’s “absurd” decision to declare martial law had “sent huge shock waves” across the crypto market “in real-time.” Bitcoin (BTC) prices tumbled by up to 30% on major exchanges, at a time when the token was trading for just under $96,000 on overseas platforms. The leader of South Korea’s ruling People Power Party says that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will manage the nation’s affairs as the country deals with the fallout from a political crisis sparked by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s bungled martial law. https://t.co/trWbLHg1yk — Bloomberg (@business) December 8, 2024 ‘Uncertainty and Anxiety’ Kim wrote that the first major fact influencing the price drop was a sudden rush of “uncertainty and anxiety.” He added that traders were concerned about the “possibility of additional regulations such as asset freezes or the suspension of exchange operations.” Hong (first name withheld), a Seoul-based crypto investor, told Cryptonews.com that he “slept through the whole thing,” but noted that some of his acquaintances joined the sell-off. He said: “When I woke up, I checked my [crypto-themed chat app] groups and saw that once a few people said they were selling their tokens for cash, others said they’d do the same. I think that once a few traders said they were selling, it had a snowball effect.” The Special Prosecutor’s Office said Sunday that President Yoon Suk Yeol is now a suspect facing potential charges of insurrection and abuse of power. https://t.co/WdqVq7ef5j — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 8, 2024 Kim, meanwhile, noted that the “structural characteristics” of the South Korean market had “amplified” anxiety levels. He remarked that, unlike the United States, the South Korean market is “overwhelmingly dominated by individual investors.” He explained: “This means that the market is structured to be easily swayed by news and sentiment.” A ‘Vicious Cycle’ And the expert noted that ill-timed network issues may also have spooked the market. He added that late on December 3, “many investors” were complaining “about connection problems with major exchanges such as Upbit and Bithumb.” Kim wrote: “This further fueled investor anxiety. And it led to a vicious cycle of sudden sales whenever orders became available. This is a chronic problem that occurs every time there is a market crash. And it is not being fixed.” Online Korean-language crypto- and stock trading-related forums also contained accounts of “crashes” on Bithumb and Upbit. One investor claimed he had successfully tried to “buy” the 30% “dip,” but “couldn’t buy more” because Bithumb’s site was down. Another trader said they had “sold” their holdings at a “low price,” and then mused: “I regret acting so quickly. The news came like a bolt from the blue in the middle of the night.” US calls for 'proper' functioning of democratic processes in S. Korea after scrapped impeachment motion https://t.co/VIVbwGL1WC — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 8, 2024 Lack of Market Makers ‘a Problem’ Kim, meanwhile, noted that a fourth factor had also helped fuel the panic. He noted that since the launch of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in July, “market-making activities have been prohibited.” The act classifies many traditional market-making activities as a form of “unfair” crypto trading. As such, there is no longer anyone to “fill in the gaps between bids” and help “mitigate volatility.” The expert explained: “Market makers provide liquidity in the market and mitigate price volatility by simultaneously presenting buy and sell prices. If they had provided buy prices and acted as a buffer [on December 3-4], the price drop would not have been so large.” The post Expert Explains Why Martial Law Threw South Korea’s Crypto Markets into Chaos appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Bitcoin Price|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-08 23:30:00

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed the breach in a social media post. However, before action was taken, the scam token generated about $500,000 in trading volume, only to crash by 99%.

Frequent X Account Hacks Targeting Crypto Projects The Cardano Foundation joins a growing list of entities impacted by social media hacks involving crypto scams. In December 2023, Compound Finance’s X account was hacked, with phishing links posted to a counterfeit website advertising fake COMP tokens. These links drained funds from unsuspecting users. In October 2024, Symbiotic’s X account was hacked, and the attacker posted fake interaction checklists resembling airdrop campaigns. These led users to phishing sites that stole legitimate tokens. The same month, Eigenlayer’s X account was compromised to promote a fraudulent airdrop campaign. Even non-crypto accounts have been targeted. On October 29, the Truth Terminal AI account was hacked to market a scam memecoin.

37401173,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624631,1733701841,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37401173.jpeg,President Trump says he never wanted to kick Jerome Powell out of the Federal Reserve,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/president-trump-says-he-never-wanted-to-kick-jerome-powell-out-of-the-federal-reserve/,"President-elect Donald Trump has shut down speculation about removing Jerome Powell from his position as Federal Reserve Chair. These speculations come from him saying during campaign that he would take over the central bank and be in charge of the economy himself. But now, in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press , Trump said , “Fire him? No, I don’t see it.” “I think if I told him to, he would,” the president added. “But if I asked him to, he probably wouldn’t.” Sounds like he knows his man all too well. He did appoint him, after all. And Powell has made it clear that he’s not going anywhere. Days after Trump’s victory, the Fed chair reaffirmed the central bank’s independence, telling reporters he wouldn’t step aside if asked and that the president doesn’t have the authority to fire him or other senior Fed leaders. Trump’s take on Powell and monetary policy Trump’s views on the Federal Reserve have always been controversial. He genuinely believes that the president should have more influence over monetary policy. In an October interview with Bloomberg, Trump said, “I think I have the right to say, ‘I think you should go up or down a little bit.’ I don’t think I should be allowed to order it, but I think I should be able to comment.” He didn’t stop there. Trump ridiculed Powell’s job, calling it “the greatest job in government.” In his words, “You show up to the office once a month, and you say, ‘Let’s see, flip a coin.’” It’s no secret that Trump’s frustration with Powell stems from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes during his first term, which Trump believed slowed economic growth. Back in 2018, Trump even considered firing Powell but didn’t follow through. Legal scholars pointed out that removing a Federal Reserve Chair isn’t as simple as giving the order. The Federal Reserve Act only allows board members to be removed “for cause,” which means serious misconduct or abuse of power, not just disagreements over policy. “Looks like I’m stuck with you,” Trump told him over the phone one night from the Oval. Despite their past clashes, Powell has said he isn’t anticipating new tensions with Trump’s administration. While Powell’s term as Chair runs through 2026, his 14-year tenure as a Federal Reserve Governor doesn’t expire until 2028, which gives Trump limited room to replace him outright. POTUS’ power over the Federal Reserve The president of the United States has the power to appoint members to the Board of Governors. This includes selecting key roles like Chair and Vice-Chair. Governors serve 14-year terms, and chairs serve four-year terms. All of them sit on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the group that decides interest rates. During his next term, Trump will have at least two opportunities to appoint members to the Fed Board. One of those openings will come in January 2026 when Fed Governor Adriana Kugler’s term ends. These appointments will require Senate confirmation, but with a Republican majority in the Senate, Trump is likely to face less resistance than he did during his first presidency, when several of his Fed picks were blocked. Even with these appointments, Trump’s influence is limited. The Fed’s policymaking structure includes 12 regional bank presidents who are selected independently by the boards of their respective banks, subject to approval from the Federal Reserve Board. This decentralized system reduces the president’s ability to directly control monetary policy. Trump isn’t the first president to try to influence the Federal Reserve, but his approach has been one of the most public. He often airs his grievances in press conferences and interviews, accusing Powell of making poor policy decisions. He also criticizes the Fed’s track record, saying they’ve “sort of gotten it wrong a lot.” According to Trump, Powell’s timing on key decisions has been “a little bit too early and a little bit too late.” The case for Fed independence The central bank’s role is to manage inflation and employment without political interference, which Powell believes is essential for maintaining credibility with investors and the public. “Without question, the Fed must remain apolitical,” Powell said earlier this year. But the reality is more complicated. The Federal Reserve often operates within a political context, collaborating with the Treasury Department and considering the economic impact of government policies like tax cuts or spending initiatives. Critics argue this interaction makes it impossible for the Fed to be entirely apolitical. Economists like Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the Wharton School, describe the Federal Reserve as a “deeply political institution.” However, he distinguishes between politics and partisanship, emphasizing that the Fed’s decisions often reflect input from multiple factions. Despite these challenges, the Federal Reserve has maintained its independence for over a century. Central banks around the world rely on this model to make tough decisions, such as raising interest rates to fight inflation, without fear of political retaliation.

Table of Contents Lunex Network: The future of secure and cost-effective trading Cardano eyes a $1.3 breakout as momentum builds Dogecoin Targets breakout to ATH Lunex Network could outpace Cardano and Dogecoin Major players like Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Lunex Network (LNEX) are drawing interest as investors search for the next big thing in crypto.

Early buyers at $0.0012 have already witnessed a 200% return on investment. Cardano eyes a $1.3 breakout as momentum builds With the Cardano price up over 20% in the previous week, the altcoin has been showing notable positive momentum. Moreover, the Cardano price has exceeded the $1 resistance level and rallied to the $1.3 zone . Still, the past month has been even more remarkable since Cardano (ADA) jumped around 270%, mirroring its rising investor sentiment. The Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin has displayed great market confidence by maintaining above the $1.2 support despite encountering resistance at the $1.3 level. Experts believe Cardano might rapidly break above the $1.3 resistance and maybe even surge to $2 very soon if the bullish trend keeps up. Technical indicators are also bolstering Cardano’s positive view. As the Cardano price chart shows, key indicators, including the MACD, Moving Averages, and Awesome Oscillator all show a strong increasing trend. A classic indication of ongoing bullish pressure, Cardano (ADA) keeps producing higher highs and higher lows. Dogecoin Targets breakout to ATH Rising by almost 10% in just the past week, the Dogecoin price has been on a notable upward path. Although the Dogecoin price has lately consolidated between the $0.48 and $0.38 levels, it has had an amazing 165% growth over the previous month, therefore rekindling investor excitement. Many of the Dogecoin holders who bought the dips are now keenly awaiting the next breakout. Given the Dogecoin price chart showing that the altcoin’s present price remains around 40% below its all-time high of $0.737 from 2021, there is clearly room for notable gains particularly should Dogecoin be able to break over the $0.47 resistance level. Strong buy signals from the MACD and Moving Averages on the Dogecoin price chart help to further validate the momentum building for a possible comeback. Should Dogecoin be able to exceed its present resistance levels, we could see a rally toward the $1 mark this cycle. Lunex Network could outpace Cardano and Dogecoin Lunex Network is positioned to outpace Cardano and Dogecoin with its special mix of security, privacy, and ultra-low transaction fees, even though both altcoins exhibit encouraging indications of bullish momentum. Lunex Network is creating major excitement with over 50% of its presale tokens sold already, and early investors are already getting significant returns.

At the same time, popular meme coins, like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE, have continued their exponential growth trajectory. PEPE, for instance, has now forged a new all-time high price of $0.00002644 less than a month after shattering its previous record-high price. This latest price spike highlights the bullish momentum the meme token has been enjoying over the past few weeks. PEPE Price Overview As of this writing, the value of the Pepe token stands around $0.00002597, reflecting an impressive 21% price surge in the past 24 hours. This single-day performance is in stark contrast to how the meme coin had moved all week long. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breakout: Charting The Uncertain Part Of ETH To $18,000 According to data from CoinGecko, the price of PEPE has soared by nearly 27% in the past seven days. However, it is worth noting that the altcoin was locked in a consolidation range around the $0.000022 region for most of the past week. On a broader timeframe, the price action of PEPE has been remarkable, with the meme coin more than doubling its value in the month of November. CoinGecko data shows that the price of the meme-inspired token has increased by more than 140% in the last 30 days. After a positive September, which saw the value of PEPE briefly cross the $0.00001 mark, investors expected the meme coin to take off. However, Pepe’s price failed to live up to expectations in the month of October. In November, the meme coin went on a parabolic run to crash its previous all-time high of $0.00001665 and set a new one at $0.00002343. This bullish momentum coincided with the positive climate of the general market, which saw Bitcoin reach successive all-time highs. As a result of its red-hot performance, various crypto exchanges, including Binance.US, have now listed the popular Pepe meme coin on Thursday, December 5. It appears that its listing on one of the largest crypto exchanges in the United States has helped renew its bullish momentum. PEPE Market Cap Hits $10 Billion According to data from CoinGecko, the market capitalization of PEPE has now surpassed the $10 billion mark. This value places the meme coin as the 25th largest cryptocurrency in the digital asset sector.

Pepe Unchained is also gaining hype as it prepares for the official token launch and claim which is scheduled to start on December 10. Meanwhile, Rollblock’s presale is giving traders the perfect entrance to the explosive altcoin market as this GambleFi project is poised for 880% gains before its official launch. Cardano expected to target $10 by early 2025 Cardano ’s price has already surged by a massive 241.72% during the last month as investors regained interest in altcoins. Since Cardano has recently announced its Hydra upgrade for more scalability and Mithril upgrade to streamline consensus, analysts expect Cardano to attract even more investors in the next few weeks. If these bullish predictions stand true, Cardano’s price could reach a new high at $10 in early 2025. Cardano is currently trading for $1.21 after an intraday decrease of 1.34%. Cardano’s volume has also dropped by 21.68% during this period which suggests low network activity. If Cardano can breach its nearest resistance at $1.38 soon, analysts believe Cardano could target a price level of $2.51 before the end of Q4. Pepe Unchained gains momentum 3 days before token launch Pepe Unchained experienced an explosive presale which raised more than $73 million in record time. Since Pepe Unchained’s presale is completely sold out, analysts are expecting a massive rally on the token’s official launch day. Pepe Unchained will be available on DEXs in 3 days which is creating a strong bullish momentum around the token. Since Pepe Unchained is giving traders 100 times faster speeds and cheaper gas fees than Ethereum, analysts expect Pepe Unchained to become a top exchange for meme coins. Since Ethereum’s price has also crossed the $4000 milestone this week, Pepe Unchained is likely to attract a variety of ETH investors to its Layer 2 blockchain. Rollblock investors prepare for 880% gains ahead of official token launch Rollblock has been on an uptrend ever since its presale launch, but it is completely dominating the ongoing altseason. As Rollblock draws closer to raising $7 million in its viral presale, analysts are expecting RBLK’s early investors to enjoy up to 880% gains even before the token’s official launch on the open market. These bullish predictions for Rollblock are fueled by a unique strategy to bring decentralized and centralized gaming experiences together on a single platform. By resolving the problem of third-party manipulation and subpar security, Rollblock is ready to take over the entire global gambling market, which is already worth more than $500 billion per annum. Since Rollblock prioritizes user security and experience, the platform has integrated Ethereum’s immutable blockchain technology to encrypt all financial information and bets. This means that traders can access more than 7,000 AI-powered games on Rollblock’s GambleFi platform and enjoy a fully secure and provably fair experience. If that wasn’t enough, then Rollblock has already announced a new betting feature that will be available on its platform soon. Through this feature, users will be able to place bets on top sports leagues around the world by using their digital assets and protecting themselves from bet manipulation. Considering these features, Rollblock’s current selling price of $0.041 per token is a massive steal for savvy traders who want to capitalize on this low entry point before the RBLK token skyrockets. Although Rollblock has just entered its ninth presale round, analysts are expecting RBLK’s limited supply to run out soon.

Discover This December 2024 Blockchain Gem,https://thecoinrise.com/did-the-eos-hype-pass-you-by-discover-this-december-2024-blockchain-gem/,"The cryptocurrency market is ablaze with innovation and growth, making headlines daily. As December 2024 unfolds, blockchain projects like EOS have left an indelible mark on the space. EOS emerged as a major contender in the blockchain arena, offering a robust ecosystem for decentralised applications (dApps). However, while its initial promise was undeniable, new opportunities have surfaced to capture the attention of investors. Qubetics ($TICS) has entered the spotlight, showcasing a clear vision to address critical challenges that other projects, including EOS, have yet to resolve. With a focus on real-world applications like Real World Asset Tokenisation, Qubetics is cementing itself as one of the best crypto investments for 2024. Let’s explore how these two projects stack up and why Qubetics is capturing significant interest. EOS: The Blockchain Pioneer That Fell Short of Expectations EOS gained notoriety for its ambitious goal of becoming the “Ethereum killer.” As a high-performance blockchain, EOS promised unparalleled scalability and transaction speeds, drawing significant attention during its record-breaking $4 billion ICO. For a time, it seemed like EOS could revolutionise the way dApps were built and operated. Developers flocked to the platform, attracted by its zero transaction fees and efficient consensus mechanism. In recent months, EOS has seen renewed interest as it works to re-establish its foothold in the market. The network’s advancements in resource allocation, such as the PowerUp model, have addressed some of its early shortcomings. Analysts predict that if EOS continues on its current trajectory, its price could surge by mid-2025, especially as more projects integrate onto its platform. However, lingering concerns around centralisation and governance have dampened its appeal. Despite its historical significance, EOS faces stiff competition from newer, more versatile platforms. Investors seeking the best crypto investments are increasingly exploring options that prioritise interoperability, scalability, and user-centric solutions. Enter Qubetics, a blockchain project designed to meet these demands. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain Utility Qubetics has positioned itself as a revolutionary blockchain with a focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation. This approach aims to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and practical applications, making it accessible to businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. The platform’s QubeQode IDE is an intuitive development environment that simplifies the creation and deployment of blockchain-based solutions. Real World Asset Tokenisation is a standout feature of Qubetics. Picture a manufacturing company looking to streamline its supply chain. By tokenising inventory assets, the company can track shipments in real-time, reducing inefficiencies and enhancing transparency. Similarly, a property management firm can tokenize real estate assets to facilitate fractional ownership, broadening access to investment opportunities for a global audience. For individuals, the benefits are equally transformative. Consider an artist aiming to monetise digital creations. Qubetics makes it possible to mint and sell NFTs seamlessly, removing the complexity that often deters creators. By integrating multiple blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, the platform ensures users can operate within a unified, cross-chain ecosystem. The Presale That Stand Out The ongoing $TICS presale has captured significant attention, solidifying Qubetics’ position as one of the best crypto investments for 2024. Over 288 million tokens have been sold to more than 7,500 holders, raising $5 million. With a current price of $0.0282, $TICS presents an accessible opportunity for investors ahead of an anticipated 10% price increase in the 12th stage of the presale. An investment of $1,500 in $TICS today secures approximately 53,191 tokens. By the end of the presale, when $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, the investment grows to $13,297.75. If $TICS reaches $5 post-presale, the value rises to $265,955. At $15, following the mainnet launch, this initial investment could soar to an extraordinary $797,865. These figures illustrate the transformative potential of investing in Qubetics early. Conclusion While EOS remains a significant name in the cryptocurrency world, Qubetics offers a fresh perspective and innovative solutions to some of the blockchain industry’s most pressing challenges. Its emphasis on real-world applications, combined with its presale success and ambitious roadmap, makes $TICS a standout contender for those seeking the best crypto investments. With the presale nearing completion and projections indicating substantial returns, the opportunity to invest in Qubetics at a competitive price is closing fast. For investors aiming to position themselves at the forefront of blockchain innovation, securing $TICS tokens today could be the key to unlocking remarkable growth in 2024 and beyond.

If you’re hunting for a solid investment, it’s time to stop gambling and start planning. In a market teeming with volatility, wouldn’t it be nice to back a project with groundbreaking utility and unbeatable growth potential? Look no further. Qubetics, Filecoin, and EOS are making waves this week, and it’s time to see why. Qubetics is creating hype with its innovative approach to blockchain technology, specifically its real-world asset tokenisation. Meanwhile, Filecoin and EOS continue to hold their spots as powerhouses in the crypto community, providing unique alternatives to traditional investments. But let’s be real—only one of these is poised to deliver life-changing returns. Qubetics: Transforming Blockchain with Real-World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics isn’t your average crypto project—it’s a Web3 aggregator with ambitions as big as its achievements. As of its 11th presale stage, Qubetics has raised over $5 million, sold 288 million tokens, and amassed more than 7,500 token holders. The token is priced at $0.0282 but is set to jump by 10% soon, making it the best crypto to join this week. What sets Qubetics apart is its real-world asset tokenisation feature. Imagine owning a piece of a skyscraper in New York or investing in fine art from your smartphone. Qubetics makes this possible by digitising real assets into blockchain tokens, breaking down barriers for businesses and individuals. For instance, a small business owner could sell shares of their company via tokenisation, while an artist could monetise their work without middlemen taking a hefty cut. This isn’t just theoretical. Picture a professional in London needing quick liquidity for a rare wine collection. Instead of lengthy bank negotiations, they tokenize their assets through Qubetics, selling shares globally in minutes. This level of flexibility is what makes Qubetics revolutionary. Analysts predict $TICS will surge to $0.25 by the end of the presale, delivering a whopping 871% ROI. And if the stars align post-mainnet launch, it could skyrocket to $15, a mind-blowing 58,213% ROI. Want in? This is the moment. Click here to learn more about this revolutionary project. Filecoin: The Storage Giant When it comes to decentralised storage, Filecoin is the name on everyone’s lips. Launched in 2020, this project revolutionised how data is stored and shared. Forget cloud servers; Filecoin uses blockchain technology to create a decentralised network where users can rent out storage space. The community loves its eco-friendly approach, too—Filecoin optimises unused computer storage, cutting down on waste. For years, Filecoin has been a go-to for crypto enthusiasts looking for stability. Unlike speculative tokens, Filecoin provides a service that’s always in demand. Think about it: as data becomes more valuable than oil, a decentralised storage solution is a no-brainer. It’s no wonder Filecoin has earned its reputation as a secure, innovative investment. Despite its established position, Filecoin doesn’t quite offer the explosive growth potential seen in new players like Qubetics. However, as a complementary investment, it remains a reliable choice for diversifying portfolios. EOS: The Developer’s Playground EOS burst onto the crypto scene with a mission to outdo Ethereum. Promising lightning-fast transactions and zero gas fees, it aimed to solve the scalability issues that plagued early blockchains. Today, EOS is best known for its ability to host decentralised applications (dApps) seamlessly, making it a favourite among developers. What’s kept EOS relevant is its flexibility. Developers building games, DeFi projects, or NFT platforms turn to EOS for its robust infrastructure. And the ecosystem is thriving—thousands of active dApps are proof of its resilience in a competitive market. But let’s not sugarcoat it: while EOS offers solid utility, its growth trajectory has been relatively flat compared to rising stars like Qubetics. Still, its loyal community and established use cases make it a stronghold in the crypto world. Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Join This Week Filecoin and EOS are great for what they do, but neither matches the sheer ROI potential Qubetics offers. With analysts forecasting astronomical returns, it’s clear why this project is stealing the limelight. Add its groundbreaking real-world asset tokenisation to the mix, and you’ve got a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Qubetics is more than just a promising investment; it’s a movement. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a crypto newbie, now is the time to join the 7,500+ holders who’ve already seen its potential. So, what’s next? Dive into the Qubetics presale while the price is still $0.0282, and watch your investment grow. Don’t wait for the weekend price surge—secure your $TICS tokens today. Conclusion: Your Move If you’re serious about making money in crypto, it’s time to act. Filecoin and EOS offer stability and utility, but Qubetics is the best crypto to join this week for life-changing ROI. Imagine looking back in a year and realising you hesitated at $0.0282. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers. Discover the future of blockchain today. Ready to make your move?

Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains Now, if you’re into the idea of blockchain interoperability, Cosmos is one to watch. Dubbed the “Internet of Blockchains,” Cosmos aims to solve one of the biggest challenges in the crypto space—making different blockchains work together. Cosmos achieves this by providing an ecosystem that allows individual blockchains to communicate and share data, without compromising their independence. It’s built around the Cosmos SDK, which enables developers to build custom blockchains tailored to their needs. This makes Cosmos a unique player in the blockchain space, offering scalability, security, and flexibility for a wide variety of use cases. What sets Cosmos apart is its Tendermint Core—the consensus engine that ensures transactions are processed quickly and securely, all while keeping fees low. The demand for interoperable blockchains is growing rapidly, and with the launch of projects like Cosmos Hub, this ecosystem is only going to continue expanding. If you’re looking for a crypto that offers scalability and decentralised governance, Cosmos is certainly one of the best cryptos to join today. Polygon: Scaling Ethereum to New Heights Anyone who’s used Ethereum knows that while it’s powerful, it’s also notoriously slow and costly, especially when the network gets congested. Enter Polygon, which acts as a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, providing faster and cheaper transactions without compromising on security. Polygon’s sidechains enable Ethereum-based applications to scale seamlessly, making it a favourite among developers building decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and other dApps. The platform has gained immense traction due to its low gas fees, fast transaction speeds, and strong ecosystem. It’s no surprise that Polygon has partnered with industry giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Google Cloud. With the rapid growth of Ethereum’s ecosystem, Polygon is at the forefront of Ethereum’s scalability solutions, making it one of the best cryptos to join today if you’re looking for a coin with a solid use case and a proven track record. The future of Ethereum is likely to be closely tied to Polygon, and as the demand for scalable solutions grows, Polygon’s value is poised to follow suit. Why These Three Coins Should Be On Your Radar So why are Qubetics, Cosmos, and Polygon considered the best cryptos to join today? Each of these coins is tackling a major problem in the blockchain space, from interoperability to scalability and security. They all have solid use cases, strong communities, and innovative tech that sets them apart from the competition. Qubetics is positioning itself as a key player in cross-chain communication and decentralised finance, Cosmos is building the framework for the future of blockchain interoperability, and Polygon is scaling Ethereum to make it faster and more affordable. These coins have a lot of potential, and they’re only going to become more important as the world of blockchain and crypto continues to evolve.

The altcoin could end the year better than it started, positioning patient investors for more profit. XRP is targeting the $3 price zone, rallying from $1.88 to a new yearly high within a week.

Florida’s state officials announced that the pension fund will invest $1.85 billion worth of members’ contributions into Bitcoin to diversify its investment portfolio. Bitcoin Exposure The head of the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA) announced that $1.85 billion of Florida’s pension fund is being considered for Bitcoin investment, a move backed by state leaders. FBBA president Samuel Armes said in a post that Florida will launch a “strategic Bitcoin reserve”, adding that the state has a great chance of creating the BTC reserve in the first quarter of next year. Armes believes that the Bitcoin investment would push through because of the pro-Bitcoin leaders such as the Speaker of the Florida House, Danny Perez, and Governor Ron DeSantis, saying that Perez “understands the technology very well” while DeSantis is among the most pro-Bitcoin governors in the United States. Florida is going to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and here’s how we’re going to do it Florida has a very good chance of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve this session, which starts in Q1 of 2025. Here’s what you need to know: The Speaker of the Florida House, Danny… pic.twitter.com/JJRNU1V7ZI — Samuel Armes (@samuelarmes) December 3, 2024 Pension Fund Goes Crypto Armes suggested that one way to build a Bitcoin reserve in Florida is by allowing the state pension fund to invest $1.85 billion in Bitcoin. “Leverage our $185.7B pension fund to allocate a small percentage to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation ,” Armes said in a post. The FBBA head explained that it would not be the first time that Florida will invest in digital assets using the pension fund because the state has already made investments in Bitcoin and crypto-related assets through this fund. He explained that the fourth largest pension fund in the United States can utilize 1% of its fund to establish a Bitcoin reserve, providing the retirement savings scheme an opportunity to diversify and get exposure to the growing cryptocurrency market. “The pension allocates its funds to hedge funds, and some of those hedge funds have bought various stocks in the Bitcoin space (miners, MSTR, Coinbase as examples) while also buying liquid tokens,” he added. $800 Million In Crypto Florida is not new in digital assets since it already has $800 million in crypto investments. Florida’s Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis urged other pension funds to try investing their money into Bitcoin, adding the firstborn cryptocurrency to their state’s investment portfolio. “Crypto’s not going anywhere. It will continue expanding, and we’d be foolish not to harness its opportunities there,” Patronis said as he pointed out the need to prepare for the growth of digital currencies. However, some critics voiced concerns about the state’s Bitcoin investment plans, warning about crypto’s volatility. Charles Bobrinskoy of Ariel Investments argued that Bitcoin is a “momentum-driven bubble”, adding that it has an “unstable price” and does not have real value. Meanwhile, state officials defended the move believing that Bitcoin is a “good long-term investment” and a better option to safeguard against traditional financial risks.

This surge in interest was observed when the token appeared to be struggling near a strong resistance level. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA has been consolidating within a tight range between $1.12 and $1.23, near a strong resistance level of $1.24, for the past week. However, the chart shows that since the beginning of November 2024, ADA has consolidated near different resistance levels four times before experiencing massive upside momentum. Source: Trading View This time, however, experts and investors are anticipating a similar upside momentum. Based on recent price action, if ADA breaks out of this consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $1.25 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 30% to reach $1.65 in the coming days. On the other hand, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 71, indicating that it is in an overbought zone and suggesting a potential price correction in the coming days. $121 Million in ADA Outflow From Exchanges In addition to ADA’s bullish technical analysis, whales and institutions appear to have shown strong interest and confidence in the altcoin, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from ADA’s spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $121 million in ADA during this ongoing consolidation. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency context, outflow refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallet addresses, which is considered a bullish sign. This notable outflow also suggests a potential buying opportunity, reduces selling pressure, and indicates further upside momentum in the coming days. The combination of these bullish on-chain metrics and technical analysis indicates that bulls are currently dominating the asset and could support ADA in breaking out of the consolidation zone. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $1.18 and has registered a price decline of 3.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 30%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-09 01:33:34

Table of Contents Unlock massive growth potential with Lunex Network TRON bullish momentum continues Shiba Inu surges 80% in a month Lunex Network could outshine TRON and Shiba Inu As the crypto market heats up, top altcoins including Shiba Inu (SHIB) and TRON (TRX) , are seeing incredible rises. While Shiba Inu has had an incredible 80% rise over the past month, suggesting a probable breakthrough, TRON’s price swung to a new all-time high prior to a 20% decline. Among the hype, though, one project— Lunex Network (LNEX) —is taking center stage with its creative features and incredible presale performance. Lunex Network is positioned as a game-changer in decentralized finance with over 2 billion presale tokens sold in just weeks. Read on to discover why analysts predict significant expansion for Lunex Network.

Lunex Network gives investors peace of mind that top-notch security mechanisms cover their investments. Highly reputable security company SolidProof has extensively examined Lunex Network to verify that its smart contracts are free from major flaws. Lunex Network appeals to traders who respect privacy and wish to bypass the intrusive Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures sometimes seen in conventional DEXs because of its emphasis on strong security and commitment to user anonymity. Irrespective of your level of experience with investing, Lunex Network provides a safe, simple-to-use platform for trading over 50,000 coins over more than 40 blockchains with some of the lowest fees in the market. LNEX is currently merely $0.0036 during its presale, well below its expected launch price of $0.0216; so investors have a rare chance to engage early. Those who bought the token at its original $0.0012 have already experienced an amazing 200% ROI; now is the ideal moment to grab the chance and be a part of Lunex Network’s growth as analysts project an additional 300% rally before the presale finishes. TRON bullish momentum continues With an amazing 66% increase over the previous week, the TRON price has been on an incredible upward path. Driven by a steady pattern of higher highs and higher lows, this great momentum has propelled the TRON price to a new ATH of $0.44. But the TRON price chart shows that the altcoin has just dropped by more than 20% from its ATH to less than $0.35. The price of TRON is still testing the vital $0.33 support zone; it has shown indications of rejection, suggesting a possible bullish bounce. Should the trend carry on, TRON (TRX) might shortly retest its ATH, hence initiating another notable surge. With an amazing 105% increase over the previous month, TRON (TRX) keeps displaying great upward potential. The MACD and Moving Averages among other technical indicators are clearly showing buy signals on the TRON price chart, thereby supporting the altcoin’s positive projection. These encouraging signals together with the current price action point to TRON (TRX) perhaps soon pushing past its ATH and rallying to the long-awaited $1 this cycle. Shiba Inu surges 80% in a month Showing incredible positive momentum lately, the Shiba Inu price jumped by nearly 25% in one week. Given its climb follows a period of consolidation between $0.000033 and $0.000026, the Shiba Inu price might be preparing itself for a bigger breakout. Recovering about 80% over the past month, Shiba Inu has given investors hope. On the Shiba Inu price chart, strong technical indicators including the MACD and Moving Averages flash buy signals pointing to potential continuous upward price movement of the altcoin. Notwithstanding recent increases, Shiba Inu is currently well below its all-time high of $0.000088, which was reached in 2021. Still, the positive price movement on the Shiba Inu price chart and rising market sentiment suggest that a new ATH may be within reach in the current cycle. Many analysts believe that Shiba Inu (SHIB) could soon break out from its present range based on strong buy indications on the charts, so generating fresh chances for investors. Lunex Network could outshine TRON and Shiba Inu While TRON and Shiba Inu produce waves with their bullish price movements, Lunex Network is set to redefine decentralized trading with its revolutionary features, unmatched cross-chain compatibility, and dedication to user protection and anonymity. With over two billion tokens sold already, the presale frenzy reveals the confidence of investors in the project.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA.

Garlinghouse criticized the SEC’s approach, stating that it was a key reason why Ripple and two other companies formed the industry super PAC, FairShake, to fight back against what he described as a “war on crypto.” He suggested that FairShake might not have existed if the SEC had a different chairman than Gary Gensler. When an SEC spokesperson said that the amount spent by the crypto industry on legal defense is minimal compared to the losses investors have faced due to frauds and market failures, Garlinghouse revealed Ripple’s financial contributions, revealing that the company has spent over $150 million fighting the SEC’s stance on XRP. He said that Ripple argues XRP should not be treated like a stock and be subject to the same registration and disclosure requirements. Garlinghouse stressed that Ripple is not seeking to be deregulated but instead asking for clear regulations from Congress to address the unique nature of digital assets. “I went to Harvard Business School. I think I’m reasonably intelligent about something like, “What is a security?” So never once had I considered the possibility– that, “Okay, maybe XRP’s a security. We haven’t been asking to be deregulated. We’ve been asking to be regulated. So we have been saying, “Hey, look, just give us clear rules of the road,” he said. XRP Price Reacts : XRP, Ripple’s cryptocurrency, is currently experiencing a surge, approaching the $2.60 mark. At the time of writing, it was trading at $2.55, a 4.5% increase. Investors are optimistic about the future of the crypto industry, especially under a potential Trump presidency, as Ripple’s blockchain-based payment system continues to gain attention.

As we dive into the final chapter of the memecoin trilogy, the stakes are higher than ever. Both tokens ride Dogecoin’s ($ DOGE ) coattails while carving unique paths in a volatile crypto jungle, fueled by the constant flux of hype, community strength, and speculative mania. Adding fuel to the speculative fire is a shaky macro backdrop: the U.S. CPI data unveiling on Wednesday, potentially steering the Fed’s rate decisions, and a still-indecisive Ethereum/BTC ($ETH/BTC ) pair unable to close above 0.04. Meanwhile, Total2 (altcoin market cap) flirts with 2021’s bull-run levels, signaling an overheated environment and perhaps a looming 25% correction for altcoins. Will Shiba Inu, a project born from Ethereum’s ecosystem with Vitalik Buterin's accidental ""blessing,"" and Floki, the people's Viking dog, survive the storm? Let’s dig in. Fundamentals: Shiba Inu vs. Floki – Community Power and Ecosystem Ambitions Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Born as an experiment in decentralized community-building, Shiba Inu exploded onto the scene with its adorable mascot and cult-like investor following. Anchored in Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin once received 50% of the SHIB supply, burned most of it, and in doing so, became its ""reluctant godfather."" As a meme coin with utility aspirations, SHIB has expanded into a multifaceted ecosystem. Key Strengths: The ecosystem boasts the ShibaSwap DEX, plans for an algorithmic stablecoin (SHI), and SHIB: The Metaverse, where users can explore and monetize virtual land. Its DeFi angle keeps it relevant beyond mere speculation. Tokenomics: With a total supply of 589 trillion tokens, $SHIB battles inflationary challenges. However, its whale holdings at 59% indicate continued confidence from big players. Challenge: Its massive supply makes sustained price growth difficult, necessitating robust utility adoption to support its valuation. Floki ($FLOKI) Inspired by Elon Musk’s dog and backed by a strong social media presence, Floki combines memecoin charisma with tangible utility ambitions. The self-proclaimed “people’s cryptocurrency” blends narrative and community power with aggressive branding. Key Strengths: With an NFT gaming metaverse (Valhalla), a DeFi suite (FlokiFi), and partnerships with Chainlink, Floki’s ecosystem promises substance beyond hype. Its FlokiFi Locker for digital assets strengthens its DeFi offering. Tokenomics: A tighter circulating supply of 9.6 trillion gives $FLOKI a structural advantage over $SHIB. However, whale dominance at 72% highlights risks of sudden sell-offs. Challenge: Floki’s reliance on hype and retail speculation makes it vulnerable in bearish or flat market conditions. Key Comparison Takeaway: SHIB offers a broader ecosystem with diversified ambitions, but FLOKI’s tighter tokenomics could lead to stronger short-term performance in bullish environments. Technical Analysis: SHIB and FLOKI – Bullish or Barking Up the Wrong Tree? Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Since its summer bottom, SHIB has been in a healthy uptrend, confirming bullish momentum with a multi-month Cup & Handle breakout above $0.0000267. However, the breakout came on low volume, raising the probability of a pullback to this level or even deeper into the Golden Pocket (Fib 0.618) at $0.0000228. Key Targets: The Cup & Handle target sits at $0.0000415, but the $0.0000350 resistance zone, a critical level from March and 2021’s bull run, is the true test. A break above $0.0000350 could open the door for an attack on SHIB’s ATH of $0.00008845, a distant but enticing possibility. Momentum Check: Rising moving averages provide dynamic support, signaling sustained bullish momentum. Strategies: Accumulate during dips to $0.0000228–$0.0000267 for a discounted entry. Breakout traders should monitor volume closely at $0.0000350 to avoid potential bull traps. For trend-followers, buying now and riding the broader momentum with trailing stop-losses is an option. Floki ($FLOKI) FLOKI has shown a similar Cup & Handle breakout, with its next critical resistance at $0.0003. However, low volume compared to March highs suggests retail participation remains subdued, increasing the likelihood of pullbacks to the accumulation range of $0.00022–$0.00025. Key Targets: A confirmed breakout above $0.0003 sets the stage for a move to the $0.0004 Cup & Handle target. Beyond this, the ATH of $0.00035 from June looms as the next critical level. Momentum Check: A bullish market structure flip is confirmed, but sustained volume is crucial to maintain the rally. Strategies: Patient traders can accumulate within $0.00022–$0.00025, aligning with Fib retracements. Breakout traders must ensure volume spikes above $0.0003 to validate continuation toward $0.0004. Defensive players should place stink orders near $0.00018 for potential deep corrections. 3 Key Takeaways from the Comparison: SHIB’s Broader Resistance Levels: $SHIB faces significant overhead at $0.0000350 before targeting its ATH, while FLOKI’s path to $0.0004 appears less obstructed. Volume Signals Caution: Both tokens suffer from weak breakout volumes, necessitating patience and vigilance for any sustained moves. Accumulation Zones: FLOKI’s tighter range ($0.00022–$0.00025) offers clearer buy signals, while SHIB’s support zones ($0.0000228–$0.0000267) align with broader market trends. The Verdict: Which Dog Has the Sharpest Bite? When comparing these two meme-heavyweights, SHIB offers a more robust long-term narrative with its expanding ecosystem, while FLOKI thrives on short-term hype and retail-driven momentum. If you’re chasing immediate upside, FLOKI’s tighter tokenomics and aggressive branding might appeal to you. However, SHIB’s integration into the Ethereum ecosystem and ambitious roadmap for DeFi and metaverse adoption make it a safer bet for long-term believers. But remember: memecoins are speculative by nature. With Total2 signaling a potential blow-off top, volatility is the name of the game. Smart investors should keep stop-losses tight, accumulate during dips, and avoid FOMO-fueled breakouts without volume confirmation. In this crowded dog park, the real winners are the ones who plan their exits just as carefully as their entries. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While Dogecoin price remains the leading player in the meme coin space, PropiChain is emerging as a strong competitor. With its innovative platform and robust market position, PropiChain is projected to reach $1, offering potential gains of up to 10,000x by 2025. This projection positions PropiChain as a compelling alternative, possibly delivering greater returns than Dogecoin for investors Dogecoin Price Race to $2: Is the Bullish Trend Sustainable? In November 2024, Dogecoin price rose by over 165%, sparking discussions about its potential to reach $2. Currently trading at around $0.4332, the Dogecoin price has steadily increased. It experienced a 4.71% price gain in the last 24 hours, reflecting growing market demand. However, Dogecoin price hitting $2 remains a significant challenge. Achieving this would require dramatic market growth and increased adoption. Despite its popularity as a meme coin, Dogecoin needs strong institutional backing or substantial use cases. Regulatory risks, market competition, and inflationary tokenomics also limit its capacity to sustain a massive price increase shortly​. PropiChain Targets $1 from $0.004: Breaking Down the 10,000x Potential PropiChain (PCHAIN) , currently in its presale phase, is gaining attention for its ability to simplify real estate investment through blockchain technology. With tokens priced at $0.004, projections suggest it could reach $1, offering a 10,000x return for early adopters. This surge is rooted in PropiChain’s innovative use of tokenization and artificial intelligence to make real estate accessible and efficient. Fractionalized NFTs form a core part of PropiChain’s offering, allowing investors to purchase small portions of high-value properties. This lowers traditional entry barriers and democratizes real estate investment. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the platform provides detailed market analyses, asset valuations, and tailored investment suggestions. Additionally, PropiChain incorporates metaverse features, enabling users to virtually explore properties and make informed decisions, eliminating geographical limitations. PropiChain also automates transactions, enhancing efficiency in leasing and rental payments. This functionality, combined with its user-centric approach and CoinMarketCap listing, positions it as a game-changer in the global real estate market. Analysts highlight that capturing even a small fraction of this market could result in significant growth. Early investors in PropiChain are projected to see massive returns as the token advances to its next stage at $0.032, with further growth anticipated as the platform scales. This positions PropiChain as an attractive long-term investment option, especially considering the rising Dogecoin price spurring the crypto community. PropiChain’s ability to address accessibility and efficiency in real estate investment makes it a major contender. With its unique value proposition, it could outpace meme coins like Dogecoin. Propichain’s (PCHAIN) ’s Race to $1: A Game-Changer in Real Estate Tokenomics Propichain (PCHAIN) is set to revolutionize real estate investing with its innovative platform. As part of a $300 trillion real estate market projected to grow significantly over the next decade. Backed by a BlockAudit security review, PCHAIN offers trust, confidence, security, transparency, and compliance as the project scales, attracting investors eager to capitalize on its growth. The presale launched at $0.004, with projections suggesting a 10,000x return when it lists at $0.032. Analysts estimate this could translate to even more substantial gains in the long term, with a $1,000 investment potentially growing to $100,000. These figures highlight PCHAIN’s explosive potential, reinforced by its strategic focus on tokenized real estate investments. The current presale phase offers a unique opportunity for early adopters seeking to maximize returns. Click the links below to learn more and take advantage of this innovative investment today.

VCs May Start Aggressive Selling Hartmann noted that traders’ optimism might soon face reality. “Traders may stay irrational, but we are at the point where teams and VCs start clipping more aggressively,” he explained. He warned of significant corrections, saying, “Once momentum tips, we’ll have to get that lever out, and see some murder wicks.” Hartmann added that altcoins’ funding rates are now “north” of 100% annualized, with recent price movements driven largely by perpetual traders rather than spot market activity. “Leg down will be ugly,” he concluded. Top Gainers and Historical Volatility Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Hedera (HBAR) led with a 99.31% gain since Nov. 1, followed by IOTA (79.61%) and JasmyCoin (72.47%), according to CoinMarketCap data. However, historical patterns suggest caution. In late 2021, Solana (SOL) plummeted 64% within two months after a record high, while XRP shed 51% in the same period. Diverging Trader Sentiments Despite Hartmann’s warnings, some traders remain bullish. Crypto trader MilkyBull Crypto suggested on Dec. 6 that altcoin season could extend into March, noting, “Lasts about 90 days.” Similarly, trader Sensei declared, “Altseason has just started,” to his 72,900 followers. Key Metrics to Watch Bitcoin dominance, often seen as an altcoin season indicator, stood at 55.11% at publication, down 7.88% over the past month, per TradingView.

XRP is currently holding above its 2021 breakout point and the price has stayed above $1.96, which is an important level. Right now, XRP is moving between the all-time high of $1.96 and the 2021 high of around $3.30. These levels create support and resistance zones. Wave Structure and Price Predictions XRP is still in a larger price structure that suggests it’s in the third wave of a bigger cycle. After the bottom in June 2022, the market has already seen waves 1 and 2. Now, it is in wave 3, and this could push the price higher in the coming months. The next target is between $5 and $10, though it’s too early to predict this accurately until the price tops in wave 3 and bottoms in wave 4. Key Support Levels to Watch The main support for XRP is currently between $1.79 and $1.96. If the price falls below these levels, the next key area of support is the orange zone, signaling a possible larger correction. However, as of now, the correction appears to be part of the third wave in a larger uptrend, so the outlook remains positive. Rapid Price Action and Potential Pullbacks The third wave has already extended to the upside, which is not unusual, but the speed of the rise is faster than typical, meaning pullbacks could be stronger. This rapid price action can lead to short-term corrections, but as long as the support levels hold, XRP should continue to rise in the longer term. Small Time Frame Correction On the smaller time frame, XRP is currently correcting, which could be a sideways movement or a counter-trend move. It’s possible we are seeing a triangle pattern forming, which often leads to a breakout. Triangles are common in crypto markets, and this could be a signal for the next price movement.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-09 02:21:12

The price is trading below $100,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $99,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could regain momentum if it closes above the $101,250 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Holds Key Support Bitcoin price started another increase above the $95,500 resistance zone. BTC was able to clear the $96,500 and $98,000 resistance levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $104,015 swing high to the $91,800 low. However, the bears seem to be active above the $101,000 level. They protected a close above the $102,000 level. The price struggled to settle above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $104,015 swing high to the $91,800 low. Bitcoin price is now trading below $100,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $99,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $100,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $101,250 level. A clear move above the $101,250 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $102,000. A close above the $102,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $104,200 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $108,000 level. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $101,250 resistance zone, it could start another downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $99,000 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $97,800 level. The next support is now near the $96,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $95,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $99,000, followed by $97,800.

Ripple, alongside two other crypto firms, funneled $144 million into super PACs supporting pro-crypto candidates across party lines. These efforts weren’t subtle, and the results were loud. Of the 62 congressional candidates backed by the industry (29 Republicans and 33 Democrats) 85% walked away with victories. “Do I think we had an impact? Absolutely,” he said. Crypto cash and political clout Ripple’s role in the 2024 election cycle was a calculated move, with one-third of all corporate donations to super PACs coming from the crypto industry. The stakes were high, and Brad, along with other industry elites, knew that they needed to seize control of the Congress. Margaret Brennan, the interviewer, pressed him on whether Ripple’s financial contributions amounted to “buying elections.” Brad dismissed the notion, arguing that voters ultimately made their choices, but he didn’t deny Ripple’s heavy hand in funding candidates’ campaigns. “We educated voters, as many industries do, about candidates,” he said, while also acknowledging, “We absolutely supercharged candidates with money.” President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks signaled a confirmation of his expected crypto-friendly approach. Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent has said that “Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay.” The president also tapped Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner with ties to crypto companies, to replace outgoing Chair Gary Gensler at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He has also appointed the first-ever White House Crypto czar. The SEC’s hostile crackdown and Ripple’s fightback Ripple’s battles with the SEC are nothing new. The agency filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging that XRP was an unregistered security. Brad called the lawsuit a symptom of a broader “war on crypto,” a conflict he says was fueled by Gensler’s leadership. “Why did these companies come together and organize Fairshake? It’s a reaction to a war on crypto,” Brad said, referring to the super PAC Ripple helped create. It is now the largest crypto super PAC. Brad emphasized that Ripple has spent over $150 million fighting the SEC in court, arguing that XRP doesn’t fit the traditional definition of a security. “I think I’m reasonably intelligent about something like, ‘What is a security?’ Never once had I considered the possibility that XRP is a security,” he said. Not everyone agrees with Ripple’s position. John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, argued that courts have consistently ruled in favor of the SEC, describing the designation of XRP as a security as “an obvious call.” Stark, who owns no crypto and has never worked for the industry, doubled down on his critique, calling crypto “a scourge” and pointing out its use in crimes like ransomware, sanctions evasion, and money laundering. “North Korea is financing their nuclear weapons program using crypto,” he has said. Brad dismissed such broad-brush accusations, pointing out that bad actors exist in every industry. “Bernie Madoff went to jail. That doesn’t make every hedge fund manager a criminal,” he countered, adding that Ripple is one of the “good actors,” working with financial institutions to improve cross-border payments using XRP. “We’ve been asking to be regulated. Just give us clear rules of the road,” Brad said. Another thing Trump also wants to do is move the regulatory authority of crypto entirely from the SEC to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an agency with a reputation for being more industry-friendly. But Stark said that the lighter regulatory touch will not adequately protect investors. “The SEC’s mandate is investor protection. The CFTC is about market integrity. It’s a much easier regulatory regime for the crypto industry,” he said. XRP’s resurgence and Ripple’s next moves Since Election Day, XRP’s value has surged over 300%, reinforcing its position as a market leader. Ripple hasn’t wasted time capitalizing on this momentum. Brad recently announced an additional $25 million contribution to Fairshake, bringing its total funds to $103 million. The super PAC is already preparing for the next election cycle, ensuring that pro-crypto candidates remain well-funded. Despite the growing acceptance of crypto, skeptics like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and legendary investor Warren Buffet continue to dismiss it as a “pet rock” and “rat poison squared.” Brad brushed off such criticism, pointing to the success of the Bitcoin ETF, which launched earlier this year and attracted record-breaking investments. “It attracted more assets in less time than any ETF ever before.” At press time, XRP was worth $2.50, down by 3.5% in the past twenty-four hours.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-09 03:03:02

Qubetics Offers a Path to Redemption,https://thecoinrise.com/left-behind-in-the-sui-surge-qubetics-offers-a-path-to-redemption/,"The crypto space is buzzing with activity, and SUI has been at the centre of it all. This Layer 1 blockchain took the market by storm with its explosive rally, capturing the imagination of investors worldwide. Those who entered the SUI ecosystem early have likely seen exponential gains, but not everyone had the chance to capitalise on its meteoric rise. Fortunately, a new opportunity has emerged. Qubetics ($TICS) offers a fresh perspective and innovative features, positioning itself as the best crypto for 2024. At the heart of its success is a game-changing application: its multi-chain wallet. Designed to revolutionise asset management across blockchains, Qubetics promises to fill the gaps left by its predecessors and chart a new course in the blockchain landscape. SUI: The Trailblazer That Set the Stage SUI earned its stripes as a next-generation blockchain optimised for decentralised applications (dApps) and digital asset creation. Boasting remarkable scalability and efficiency, the network’s innovative consensus mechanism supports high transaction throughput with minimal energy consumption. It’s no wonder SUI captured the attention of developers and enterprises looking for robust solutions. Over the past year, SUI has gained significant traction, with numerous dApps integrating onto its platform and a growing ecosystem of DeFi projects. Analysts project its price could climb further, especially as more use cases emerge within its ecosystem. However, despite its success, SUI is not without limitations. Cross-chain compatibility remains a challenge, leaving users juggling multiple wallets and platforms to manage their assets. SUI’s rally was undoubtedly a highlight of 2024, but it’s clear that the blockchain industry needs solutions that bridge the gap between networks. This is where Qubetics steps in to redefine the playing field. Qubetics ($TICS): Multi-Chain Wallet Innovation Qubetics has introduced a multi-chain wallet that reimagines how users interact with blockchain networks . By integrating Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other major chains into a single interface, the wallet streamlines asset management like never before. For users frustrated by the fragmentation of the crypto ecosystem, Qubetics delivers a seamless, unified experience. Imagine a freelancer who receives payments in various cryptocurrencies. Switching between wallets and converting tokens often leads to wasted time and unnecessary fees. Qubetics’ multi-chain wallet simplifies this process, consolidating transactions into one platform with real-time analytics and cross-chain functionality . This isn’t just convenient—it’s transformative. For enterprises, the wallet’s potential is equally compelling. A global retailer managing supply chain payments across multiple jurisdictions can leverage Qubetics to settle transactions efficiently, reducing operational overhead. Meanwhile, an NFT creator can mint, store, and sell tokens on different blockchains without leaving the platform. Market Confidence and Investment Potential The presale performance of $TICS underscores the market’s confidence in Qubetics. Over 288 million tokens have been sold to more than 7,500 holders, raising $5 million. At $0.0282 per token, investors are entering at an attractive price point before an anticipated 10% surge in the next stage. Analysts predict $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating to a 783% ROI. Long-term forecasts place $TICS at $1 post-presale and $15 following the mainnet launch, making it one of the best crypto for 2024. A $100 investment in $TICS today secures approximately 3,546 tokens. If the token reaches $0.25, that investment grows to $886.50. At $5, it becomes $17,730, and at $15, a staggering $53,190. These projections illustrate the significant upside potential for early adopters. Conclusion While SUI set a high bar with its innovative approach and successful rally, Qubetics emerges as a blockchain project with the tools and vision to build on that momentum. Its multi-chain wallet is not just a solution to existing pain points; it’s a forward-thinking application that redefines how users and businesses interact with cryptocurrencies. For those seeking the best crypto for 2024 , Qubetics offers more than just a token—it provides a pathway to a streamlined, efficient, and interoperable blockchain experience. With its presale nearing completion and projections pointing to extraordinary returns, the time to act is now. Secure your $TICS tokens and position yourself for the future of blockchain innovation.

Following Bitcoin’s milestone, the crypto-focused X account Autism Capital asked Bukele to disclose El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio to “dunk on the haters.” In response, Bukele posted the portfolio, revealing the nation’s nearly $270 million investment in Bitcoin. The portfolio confirms that no Bitcoin has been sold, and unrealized gains now exceed $333 million, a significant validation of the country’s strategy. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Journey El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on September 7, 2021, when its Bitcoin Law came into effect. A day prior, the government made its inaugural purchase of 200 BTC. Since then, the country has continued accumulating Bitcoin. On November 17, 2022, Bukele announced a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, committing to purchasing one Bitcoin daily. According to Nayib Tracker, a platform monitoring El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings, the country currently owns 6,180 BTC, with an average purchase price of $44,739.88. Based on current prices, the portfolio has gained approximately 122%. Beyond financial gains, El Salvador has also seen increased tourism and international recognition since adopting Bitcoin. IMF Urges El Salvador to Reconsider Despite the reported benefits, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly advised El Salvador to scale back its Bitcoin initiatives. On January 25, 2022, the IMF urged the country to stop recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender, citing financial stability risks but acknowledging its potential for financial inclusion. The IMF renewed its concerns on October 3, 2024, with communications director Julie Kozack recommending the country narrow the Bitcoin Law’s scope and limit public sector exposure to Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-09 03:25:00

Atkins, who served under President George W. Bush, will replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. After this big announcement, the financial community has been buzzing about the SEC’s alleged settlement offer to Ripple Labs and legal experts are split on whether the SEC will appeal the ruling or ask for more time A user asked former SEC employee Marc Fagel about the likelihood of the SEC dropping the Ripple lawsuit, especially since it’s at the second court of appeals. Fagel responded, saying that while the SEC could technically dismiss the appeal, it’s difficult to predict. “The SEC could presumably dismiss the appeal. It’s hard to predict; Atkins is no fan of crypto enforcement actions, but he also respects the SEC and its mission and might be reluctant to take such a largely unprecedented, purely political step,” he wrote. He explained that new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins is not a fan of crypto enforcement actions but also respects the SEC’s role. As a result, he may be hesitant to make such a politically charged decision. What’s Next? The outcome of Donald Trump’s election could have an impact on crypto regulation. Experts believe that under Trump’s leadership, the SEC may adopt a different approach to overseeing cryptocurrency. This could lead to more crypto-friendly policies and less aggressive enforcement. Furthermore, Trump has appointed David Sacks, a venture capitalist and co-host of the All-In Podcast, as the “White House AI & Crypto Czar.” Sacks, who is also the former COO of PayPal, is known for supporting Ripple in its ongoing lawsuit with the US SEC.

Enter Lightchain Protocol AI , a revolutionary blockchain merging artificial intelligence (AI) with DeFi to create unparalleled opportunities for developers, investors, and innovators alike. With groundbreaking features like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and cutting-edge AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain is poised to reshape the decentralized landscape. Curious why Ethereum whales are paying attention? Read on to uncover what makes Lightchain the hottest topic in DeFi circles. What Is Lightchain Protocol AI? Lightchain Protocol AI isn’t just another blockchain; it’s a first-of-its-kind ecosystem that combines the power of blockchain and AI to create scalable, privacy-focused, and highly efficient decentralized solutions. Key features like PoI and AIVM redefine traditional approaches to blockchain governance, dApp development, and decentralized AI computing. What truly sets Lightchain apart is its focus on meaningful contributions . Instead of merely rewarding holding power (Proof of Stake) or computational effort (Proof of Work), PoI incentivizes nodes to perform valuable AI computations . This groundbreaking approach minimizes wasted resources while securing the network. Why Are Ethereum Whales Interested? Ethereum whales—the major movers and shakers of the crypto ecosystem—know how to spot value early in up-and-coming projects. Here’s why Lightchain has captured their interest: Revolutionary Consensus Mechanism The Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus is unlike anything the blockchain world has seen before . By focusing on AI-driven computations, it not only secures the network but actively contributes to AI development. Whales see this as a way to create both utility and value for the blockchain ecosystem. Scalable and Efficient Ethereum, while powerful, has often struggled with scalability issues. Lightchain’s architecture emphasizes speed, scalability, and efficiency , solving the congestion and high gas fee challenges prevalent in traditional DeFi ecosystems. High Developer Appeal The AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) empowers developers to build smarter, data-driven dApps. This focus on innovation offers endless possibilities for new use cases—from predictive analytics in DeFi trading to AI-enhanced NFTs.

Dogecoin (DOGE) has been one of the top performers in the ongoing market-wide upsurge that began on the back of the Donald Trump victory on Nov. 5. For context, DOGE traded at a price of $0.1595 on Nov. 3. However, as developments around the U.S. election gained steam, it spiked, closing November at $0.4416, a 164% gain.Amid the bullish price momentum, several entities have projected new timelines for Dogecoin to claim some lofty targets. Previously, analysts predicted DOGE to claim ambitious heights. For instance, in October, Ali Martinez predicted a Dogecoin rally to $10. Meanwhile, market watcher Trader Tardigrade expects a possible run to $20.Interestingly, Trader Tardigrade also presented a more audacious Dogecoin target in early October, when the token had not witnessed its recent uptrend. The analyst projected that DOGE could rally to a peak of $30 before facing correction.New Projected Timelines for Dogecoin to Hit $10, $20 and $30Amid its latest 164% spike, some market speculators have adjusted the possible timelines for Dogecoin to reach these targets. For instance, analysts at the crypto exchange platform Changelly believe that DOGE has immense potential. However, they do not expect it to reach $1 until January 2030. Dogecoin Price Predictions Changelly Dogecoin Price Predictions | Changelly Further, these analysts see Dogecoin rising gradually as the year's progress. According to them, Dogecoin could reach the $10 price in January 2040 and further grow exponentially to $20 in March 2040, two months later. They then expect DOGE to hit $30 a month after in April 2040.ChatGPT and Grok AI RespondMeanwhile, we queried AI chatbots ChatGPT and Grok on potential timelines for Dogecoin to reach the $10, $20 and $30 price levels. Notably, ChatGPT predicts Dogecoin could reach $10 by 2029–2034 under optimistic scenarios. According to ChatGPT, this requires rapid adoption, institutional support, and integration into global payments.However, the chatbot’s moderate timeline for DOGE to reach $10 extends to 2035–2040, while it deems the price target unlikely under pessimistic conditions. This pessimistic scenario could be the case without massive changes to its supply mechanics.For $20, ChatGPT suggests an optimistic timeline of 2035–2040, depending on revolutionary use cases and supply control. A moderate projection spans 2040–2045, while the pessimistic timeline places it beyond 2045.Interestingly, ChatGPT forecasts an optimistic timeline of 2045–2055 for DOGE to reach $30, requiring Dogecoin to dominate global finance. The chatbot presents a moderate timeline beyond 2055 but believes the $30 price target is unlikely in a pessimistic scenario.Nonetheless, Grok provides alternative views. For $10, sources suggest timelines ranging from 2025 to 2044. Predictions for $20 and $30 are sparse and often deemed improbable without extraordinary conditions. Grok references some analysts projecting speculative peaks but fails to provide detailed timelines.",Market|Dogecoin Price Prediction|Latest Dogecoin (DOGE) News Today,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-12-09 04:34:10

That’s the big idea Amazon shareholders are pitching right now. They want the company to put 5% of its assets into the cryptocurrency. Why? They see it as a way to protect against inflation and, honestly, just make better use of Amazon’s massive reserves. But, is this as smart as they think? Or is it one of those ideas that sounds good until it’s not? Let’s figure it out. Why Bitcoin? Let’s Look at the Numbers Okay, here’s the thing. Bitcoin’s been on a wild ride lately. It grew by 131% in 2024 alone. Over the last five years, it’s jumped more than 1,200%. That’s a lot, right? Now compare that to corporate bonds or cash—what Amazon usually keeps in reserve. Those are safe, sure, but they don’t grow like this. That’s why the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), the group behind the proposal , is pushing hard. They’re basically saying, “Hey, Amazon, don’t sit on this. Even a 5% Bitcoin allocation could be huge for long-term value.” The National Center for Public Policy Research has submitted the attached shareholder proposal to https://t.co/Lve7Kg1nVI , Inc. for consideration at the 2025 annual shareholder meeting. Shareholders request that the Board assess adding #Bitcoin to the Company’s Treasury pic.twitter.com/lsgHC0aGrt — Tim Kotzman (@TimKotzman) December 8, 2024 And they’re not wrong. Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy have already gone for it, and they’ve seen some solid gains. Even Microsoft shareholders will vote on a similar idea soon. It’s becoming a trend. But not everyone’s convinced—yet. As institutions increasingly adopt Bitcoin, its market potential continues to grow—read our Bitcoin price prediction for expert insights on what’s next! What If Amazon Goes for It? If Amazon says yes, it won’t be instant. First, the board has to agree to let shareholders vote on the proposal in April 2025. And even then, they’d probably start small. Nobody’s talking about going all-in on Bitcoin here. Source: NCPPR Still, this could shake things up. Some people, like Binance’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao, are even speculating that Amazon might take it a step further—like accepting Bitcoin payments. That sounds futuristic, right? Imagine buying your next Kindle or headphones with Bitcoin. But, honestly, there’s no guarantee Amazon will go for it. They haven’t said a word about this idea publicly. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here’s where it gets interesting. Big players like Vanguard and BlackRock—two of Amazon’s top shareholders—will have a lot of influence on this. If they’re on board, this could actually happen. But either way, this debate shows how much things are changing. Inflation is making traditional investments less appealing. Companies are looking at Bitcoin , even if it’s risky, as a possible answer. It’s not perfect, but maybe that’s the point. The world of corporate finance isn’t standing still anymore.

At the time of writing, ADA is trading slightly below the $1 mark and has drifted into the red zone. However, the coin has gained more than 12 percent in the last one week. Currently, there is support between $0.83 and $1.16, with the most relevant support levels being $0.93 and $0.83. A drop below $0.83 would shift towards a larger correction taking place. At the moment, the market is primarily showing a sideways consolidation, and this is being respected by the micro support levels we’ve outlined. Key Levels to Watch If ADA breaks below the $1.11 level, which is also a Fibonacci support level, it would make it more likely that the market is forming a larger wave. For now, ADA remains in a consolidation phase, and while the price action might seem a bit dull, it could soon break out of this sideways movement. The most recent low of $1.16 from December 5th could be the key level to watch. Below that, the next support levels would be between $0.83 and $1.16, though it’s not guaranteed that ADA will dip all the way down to $0.83. Instead, if this assumption holds, the support may be found in the upper half of that range. With Cardano’s price showing signs of consolidation and exciting market opportunities ahead, read our long-term Cardano price prediction for insights on its future potential! Next Target After a Breakout The primary level to watch for an upside breakout is the trendline forming the triangle pattern. If ADA breaks above the $1.24–$1.25 range, this would signal a potential upward breakout. The next target after that would be the $1.42 level, with $1.72 as an important target. However, this scenario is contingent on whether the market confirms that we are indeed in a triangle pattern, as this is still not fully confirmed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a recent video shared on X, Pantoja outlined several factors driving his prediction, including XRP’s growing adoption, the potential for significant price increases, and a favorable risk-to-reward profile. Real-World Use Cases Strengthen XRP’s Appeal Pantoja emphasized that real-world use case makes XRP different from many other cryptocurrencies. According to him, XRP’s core purpose as a blockchain platform for efficient and low-cost international payments is already gaining traction among major financial institutions. “XRP is built for fast borderless payments and is already being adopted by major financial institutions,” Pantoja stated. He highlighted that the cryptocurrency’s real-world adoption gives it a strong foundation, providing stability and long-term growth potential in an otherwise volatile market. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, XRP’s integration into global financial systems positions it favorably to benefit from ongoing digital transformation. Ambitious Price Predictions Pantoja offered an optimistic outlook for XRP, projecting that its price could reach between $8 and $20 within 12 months. At the time of his analysis, XRP was trading at $2.40. Achieving the upper end of his forecast would represent a significant 733% increase in value. This bold prediction is grounded in three key factors: Increased Adoption: Pantoja anticipates that broader institutional adoption of XRP will boost its demand and, in turn, its value. Regulatory Clarity: The cryptocurrency sector is gradually receiving more regulatory clarity, which could enhance XRP’s credibility and attract additional investors. Pro-Crypto Administration: With Donald Trump expected to take office in January 2025, Pantoja believes a pro-cryptocurrency U.S. administration could create a favorable environment for XRP’s growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Compelling Risk-to-Reward Profile The analyst further highlighted XRP’s promising risk-to-reward ratio. He suggested that a modest investment of $1,000 to $2,000 in XRP could yield returns of $8,000 to $10,000 within a year. “The risk-to-reward ratio here is ridiculous,” he stated, framing the opportunity as an attractive option for individuals aiming to grow their wealth. For those earning $30,000 annually, Pantoja advised allocating a portion of their income to XRP, emphasizing its potential to deliver significant returns. He pointed out that XRP has experienced a 338% price surge over the past 30 days, with most of these gains occurring in November. Historical Performance and Considerations Despite the recent rally, long-term holders of XRP are still navigating challenges. Investors who purchased XRP at its peak seven years ago face a 36% loss. This underscores the importance of timing and market conditions when considering cryptocurrency investments.

Savvy investors who took profits are now rotating capital into undervalued gems primed for explosive growth in 2025. One such project is Lunex Network , which has consistently gained traction throughout its viral presale, raising over $4.6 million in record time. Let’s delve deeper and discover why this newcomer could leave Solana and Ripple in the dust. Solana Continues To Consolidate Just Below ATH After reaching a new all-time high at $263, Solana corrected by about 11% and is currently ranging around $240 as it found rock-solid support at $230. At press time, Solana sells for $238 with a 2.1% intraday increase and a 43% decline in volume, with roughly $4.6 billion worth of SOL traded in the last 24 hours. However, holders are still decisively bullish on Solana as every dip has been bought up almost immediately. According to on-chain readings from Lookonchain , whale activity has skyrocketed over the past few days, with large buyers acquiring massive quantities of Solana at discounted prices. Over the week, roughly $42 million, or 185,000 SOL tokens, has been withdrawn from Binance. Ripple Fails To Reclaim $3 At First Try, What’s Next? In November, Ripple (XRP) became one of the top performers with a 400% rally that saw it tear through resistance levels and reach a new peak at $2.80. As traders booked profits, a pullback followed, and today, Ripple trades at $2.44 with a 6.9% daily increase. Between the reported settlement with the SEC and the incoming release of a Ripple stablecoin, major bullish catalysts are lining up for the XRP price. After months of intensive testing, the RLUSD stablecoin’s launch is inching closer. Many Ripple investors are positioning themselves to capitalize on this significant liquidity event that could see Ripple soar above $3 by the end of the year. Lunex Network Is Spearheading The New DEX Revolution Lunex Network is more than just another run-of-the-mill decentralized exchange. It’s a non-custodial protocol that integrates all major blockchains and allows for seamless swaps between more than 50,000 assets at the lowest possible fee without any of the liquidity issues typical of most DEXs. Aside from providing an intuitive and frictionless DEX experience, Lunex Network boasts a wide array of features that could see its adoption skyrocket in the upcoming months. Institutional investors and businesses will find an exclusive B2B payment bridge API. This means that they can easily integrate cryptocurrencies into their payment options and have them instantly converted into fiat. Developers will have access to 65 RPC nodes to build highly scalable, decentralized applications. Users who want to take their trading to the next level can subscribe to Lunex Pro. This is a premium service that offers advanced trading tools, cashback on every transaction, and AML wallet checks. Moreover, Lunex Network will also grant loyal holders the opportunity to earn passive income through its revenue-sharing mechanism. Every week, Lunex Network will reinvest part of its earnings to buy back $LNEX tokens on the open market and redistribute them as staking rewards. During the ongoing presale, $LNEX tokens are priced at just $0.0038. This is the perfect entry point for buyers who want to be on the winning side of the upcoming DEX revolution led by Lunex Network.

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs, a blockchain-based global payments solution, met with CBS News on Dec. 6 to discuss political action committees and their influence on the U.S. Presidential election. The CEO said that If SEC chair Gary Gensler hadn’t aggressively regulated cryptocurrencies, Fairshake , a federal-independent expenditure-only committee registered with the Federal Election Commission, wouldn’t exist. He said, “ I’m not sure Fairshake would exist “. You might also like: XRP loses 3rd largest crypto spot as Ripple confirms postponing stablecoin launch The antidote to the ‘war on crypto’ Speaking to CBS News on Dec. 6, Garlinghouse said the Fairshake was a joint response to what he terms to be a “war on crypto,” as the SEC significantly worked up its regulatory crackdowns during Gensler’s period. In fact, the agency had filed more than 120 lawsuits against crypto companies, including Ripple Labs, Uniswap, Terraform Labs, Coinbase, Binance , and Kraken-citing violations of securities laws. According to Garlinghouse, the enforcement actions created an unlikely unity within the crypto industry, giving rise to the PAC. You might also like: Cardano reaches $1 but experts believe Pepe Unchained and Rollblock have more potential “ So if there had been a different SEC chair than Gary Gensler…I’m not sure Fairshake would exist. Why did these companies come together and organize and say, ‘This matters’? It’s a reaction to a war on crypto.” – said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs. On being asked whether the PAC is charged with a political motive in mind, the 53-year-old CEO elaborated that the mission of the PAC is not political influence but rather a framework to push for a balanced legal framework to ensure blockchain technology can scale and grow in the U.S. This aligns with President-elect Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign manifesto, which emphasized transforming the U.S. into a global leader in cryptocurrency in Nashville in Jul. 2024. Crypto made its debut on @60Minutes tonight – there’s no doubt that these technologies will continue to become more and more mainstream – with influence and reach that will only continue to grow. A few things I do want to comment on after watching: I spoke with Margaret… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 9, 2024 Ripple CEO shares more insights on his interview on X. Garlinghouse further revealed that the company has spent over $150 million in legal expenses defending its position. The legal battle centered around whether XRP ( XRP ), the native token of Ripple, should be classified as exempt from the registration and disclosure requirements applicable to securities. Garlinghouse took to X to highlight that the CBS News segment did not cover Ripple’s victory, which was a federal judge’s ruling that XRP is not a security.

ADA is consolidating and facing hurdles near the $1.20 and $1.240 levels. ADA price started a pullback after it failed to stay above $1.30. The price is trading below $1.20 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.20 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $1.240 resistance zone. Cardano Price Eyes Fresh Increase After struggling above $1.30, Cardano started a downside correction. ADA unperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum with a drop below the $1.20 level. The price even spiked below $1.150 before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $1.1173 before the price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $1.140 and $1.1550 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.326 swing high to the $1.117 low. However, the bears are now active near the $1.25 zone. They protected the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.326 swing high to the $1.117 low. Cardano price is now trading below $1.20 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.20 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.20 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $1.2250. The next key resistance might be $1.2450. If there is a close above the $1.2450 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.2780 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.320. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $1.20 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $1.150 level. The next major support is near the $1.120 level. A downside break below the $1.120 level could open the doors for a test of $1.080. The next major support is near the $1.0450 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $1.120 and $1.080.

That said, shares in bitcoin holder MicroStrategy have seen even more significant gains, more than 500% versus Amazon's 49% rise. The shareholders' proposal highlighted MSTR's outperformance, along with BTC adoption by companies like Tesla and Block, while emphasizing that the online retailer has a fiduciary duty to look beyond short-term volatility in assets like BTC, which appreciate more than bonds and add those to its Treasury. At the end of the third quarter, Amazon had $585 billion in total assets, of which $88 billion represented cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including Treasury notes, foreign government and corporate bonds. The asset mix isn't adequately protecting the shareholder value, the proposal said. Last month, the NCPPR submitted a similar shareholder from Microsoft shareholders, urging the tech giant to diversify into bitcoin.

These Two Projects Could be Next appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Although a breakout was already brewing on the charts, Ripple (XRP)’s 400% explosion took many by surprise. Investors who were left sidelined are now looking into projects that have just started rising or are gearing up for the next massive leg up. While Pepe (PEPE) is an obvious choice, Lunex Network could vastly outperform it thanks to its magnitudes lower market cap, and significantly greater room for growth. Let’s dive deeper! Ripple Is Cooling Off After Memorable Rally Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections has reignited investor sentiment and the market reacted immediately, with Ripple (XRP) leading the surge. Ripple in a single uninterrupted move from $0.55 to $2.80 in a matter of weeks. However, at the peak, selling pressure intensified, forcing a pullback. Today, Ripple trades at $2.47 following a 7.5% intraday increase. The worst has now passed for Ripple, as years of ongoing legal battles with the SEC have tanked morale and suppressed the XRP price. With reports of a settlement being finalized between Ripple Labs and the SEC. And the highly-anticipated release of the proprietary stablecoin, RLUSD, Ripple is now the star of the show. Pepe Is Teasing An Imminent Breakout Pepe (PEPE) is currently among the hottest meme coins and has dominated the landscape for the past year while minting its fair share of millionaires along the way. In November, Pepe rose by a staggering 115% and reached a new all-time high of $0.0000248. Shortly after, it entered a consolidation phase where it found support around the $0.000020 mark. As buyers quickly stepped in to take advantage of the discount. At the time of writing, Pepe sells for $0.0000222 with an 8.5% daily increase. Analysts agree that Pepe is just getting started. UnknownTrader has shared a chart reading showing that Pepe has broken out of a descending trendline and followed with a successful retest. This means that Pepe is primed to enter bullish price discovery, with the next major milestone being the $0.000030 target.

Here’s What You Should Know,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/has-cardano-rally-called-off-will-ada-price-remain-within-consolidated-range-heres-what-you-should-know/,"The post Has Cardano Rally Called Off? Will ADA Price Remain Within Consolidated Range? Here’s What You Should Know appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The ADA price is the short timeframe that hints at a probable pullback as the bulls remain passive. Being in the top 10, the token tends to follow the star token, Bitcoin, struggling to rise and sustain above the threshold at $100K. Besides, Ethereum has also plunged below $4000, which is circulating Berish waves across the markets, including the Cardano price rally. The third-generation token reached the levels not tested in the past couple of years and is also expected to breach the upper resistance if held firmly. The ADA price traded within a massive falling wedge since the rejection from its ATH and after breaking out from the range, the token set off a 125% rise. The current trading pattern suggests the bulls have entered an exhaustion phase after printing massive bullish candles for 5 consecutive weeks. Therefore, the price of Cardano crypto is believed to trade within a range-bound for a few days until the liquidity flows back into the asset. The weekly chart of the ADA price rally suggests the token remains under bearish influence regardless of the recent rally. Although the price underwent a more than 125% jump, the Gaussian channel remains bearish. This channel indicates the trend pattern of the rally and also suggests the potential trading opportunities. A rise above the upper bands of the channel suggests the token reaching the highest level of volatility, which may open the doors of a trend reversal or correction. As a result, the channel remains bearish and the divergence in RSI substantiates the claim. Meanwhile, the current pullback can also offer a good entry point at around $0.984 or at $0.748 if the markets are correcting wider. After a rebound, a new ATH could be imminent, as it happened previously before the 2021 bull run. Therefore, the ADA price rally is expected to set off after a brief reversal to the lower targets and any range below $1 can be a good entry point as the price is primed to rise above $5 in the upcoming bullish cycle.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-09 05:29:13

These incidents, which resulted in significant financial losses for victims, bring attention to the importance of vigilance as bad actors exploit the growth and innovation within the crypto and NFT markets. Cardano Foundation’s X Account Hacked: Fraudulent Token Scheme Exploits Users The Cardano Foundation faced a significant cybersecurity incident on Dec. 8, 2024, when its official X account was compromised by a threat actor. The hacker used the platform to promote a fraudulent token, ”ADAsol,” falsely claiming it was the successor to Cardano's native ADA token. Additionally, the attacker asserted that Cardano would cease support for ADA due to an alleged lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fake ADAsol token garnered approximately $500,000 in trading volume before crashing by 99%. Many users fell victim to the scam in the brief window before the account was secured and the fraudulent posts removed. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed the hack on social media, urging the community to remain vigilant. The compromised account no longer hosts the scam-related content, but the incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with malicious activities in the crypto space. The Cardano Foundation emphasized that no other parts of its ecosystem were affected by the breach. However, it cautioned users against interacting with links shared via its X account until further notice. The Cardano Foundation's hack is part of a broader trend of cybersecurity breaches targeting prominent crypto and public figures' X accounts. These incidents often result in significant financial losses and erode trust within the community. In December 2023, Compound Finance’s X account fell prey to hackers, who posted phishing links disguised as legitimate protocol content. These links redirected users to a site mimicking Compound's official website, promoting fraudulent COMP tokens. Unsuspecting users who interacted with these links found their crypto assets drained. October 2024 saw multiple high-profile X account hacks. Symbiotic, a restaking protocol, was targeted by a phishing scheme disguised as an airdrop checklist. Similarly, Eigenlayer, another restaking protocol, had its X account used to promote a fake airdrop campaign. Both incidents resulted in losses for users who were tricked into connecting their wallets to malicious sites. On Oct. 29, 2024, the founder of Truth Terminal AI reported their X account had been hijacked to promote a fraudulent meme coin. In November 2024, the X account of rapper Wiz Khalifa was also compromised, with the threat actor pushing a fake celebrity meme coin named ”WIZ.” This incident leveraged Khalifa’s fame to exploit unsuspecting fans. Community Vigilance: The First Line of Defense The rise of social media account hacks targeting crypto entities stresses the need for increased vigilance. The Cardano Foundation's swift acknowledgment of the incident and efforts to secure its compromised account are commendable. However, such incidents show the necessity for enhanced security measures and community awareness. Users should adopt the following best practices to avoid falling victim to similar schemes: Verify Sources: Always confirm the authenticity of announcements by cross-referencing them with official websites or verified channels. Avoid Suspicious Links: Refrain from clicking on links in social media posts, even if they appear legitimate. Enable 2FA: Secure your own accounts with two-factor authentication (2FA) to reduce the risk of being hacked. Use Wallet Security Features: Leverage hardware wallets or wallet apps with robust phishing detection. While the crypto industry must address vulnerabilities within its community, social media platforms also bear responsibility. These platforms need to prioritize security for high-profile accounts, including enhanced monitoring and rapid response mechanisms for compromised accounts. The Cardano Foundation hack serves as another cautionary tale in the crypto space, reminding users of the importance of vigilance and proactive measures to protect their assets. As the Foundation works to secure its ecosystem and restore trust, the broader crypto community must remain alert to the persistent threat of social media scams. With better security practices and community collaboration, the industry can mitigate the risks posed by malicious actors. Brooklyn DA Shuts Down 40 Fake NFT Marketplaces After Artist Loses $135,000 in Scam The Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office has dismantled a network of 40 fraudulent non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace websites that targeted unsuspecting artists, including an 85-year-old victim who was scammed out of $135,000. The operation, announced on Dec. 6, sheds some light on the growing sophistication of digital art scams and the vulnerability of artists navigating the NFT space. The victim, an elderly artist, was contacted on LinkedIn by a scammer posing as an art dealer. Convincing the artist to mint his work on a counterfeit NFT marketplace designed to mimic the popular platform OpenSea, the scammer lured him with promises of lucrative profits. The victim was later informed that his artwork had generated $300,000 in sales, but there was a catch: to access these earnings, he needed to pay a $135,000 “fee.” Trusting the scheme, the artist liquidated his retirement account, maxed out his credit cards, and even took out a loan to cover the amount. Once the payment was made, the promised profits never materialized, leaving the artist financially and emotionally devastated. A Network of Fraudulent Sites Uncovered Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez revealed that the tactics used in this case led investigators to uncover a broader network of 40 fraudulent websites targeting artists. The investigation, spearheaded by the DA’s Virtual Currency Unit, traced the stolen funds to accounts in Nigeria. The funds were primarily converted to Nigerian currency, closing off avenues for recovery. Some of the fake NFT marketplaces went beyond scamming users for money. They also sought to gain access to victims’ cryptocurrency wallets by asking for seed phrases. This would allow scammers to completely drain a user’s wallet, further compounding financial losses. This case is not an isolated incident. The DA’s office disclosed that two additional artists, one from Georgia and another from California, were duped by the same scam. The counterfeit marketplaces’ resemblance to legitimate platforms like OpenSea demonstrate the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals in the NFT and crypto sectors. The case has drawn attention to the vulnerabilities artists face in the evolving NFT market, where the promise of high profits often clouds judgment. Scams involving fake NFT marketplaces, phishing attacks, and seed phrase theft are becoming alarmingly common, exposing both novice and seasoned creators to significant financial risks. District Attorney Gonzalez emphasized the importance of raising awareness to prevent further victims. “It is my hope that by shutting these domains and raising awareness about this scheme, we will prevent others from falling victim to this scam,” he stated. The DA’s office offered the following advice to artists: Use Established Platforms: Sell your work only on well-known, reputable NFT marketplaces. Platforms like OpenSea and Rarible have established trust in the community and have mechanisms to report suspicious activity. Beware of Phishing Attempts: Avoid clicking on links in unsolicited emails or messages, especially those that direct you to mint or sell NFTs on unfamiliar platforms. Protect Your Wallet: Never share your cryptocurrency wallet’s seed phrase. Legitimate platforms and transactions will never require this information. Verify Opportunities: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Seek advice from fellow artists or trusted sources before proceeding. The Brooklyn DA’s investigation shows the need for increased vigilance in the digital art and cryptocurrency spaces. The lack of regulatory oversight in these emerging markets has made them fertile ground for scams and fraudulent activities. While shutting down the fraudulent websites is a significant victory, the recovery of funds remains a challenge, especially when the money is quickly transferred and converted in jurisdictions with limited cooperation. This case highlights the need for international collaboration in addressing crypto-related crimes and protecting victims. As NFTs continue to grow in popularity, so too do the risks associated with their adoption. This case serves as a stark reminder that while the digital art market offers new opportunities for creators, it also comes with unique challenges. Artists and collectors alike must remain vigilant and take proactive steps to safeguard their work and investments. For now, the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office hopes that its efforts to shut down fraudulent websites and educate the public will deter future scams and provide a measure of justice for victims of these schemes.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-09 05:30:23

On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) seems ready to fly as it recently broke through crucial resistance, however, bulls must defend this level at any cost if they want to see upward price discovery. Lunex Network is another contender that could experience a massive rally in the upcoming weeks. Thousands of investors have already rushed to the presale, as over $4.6 million has been raised in record time. Bitcoin Enters Cool-Off Phase Just Below $100k All eyes are on Bitcoin (BTC) as it finally reaches the $100k milestone, and then added a few thousand for good measure. Predictably, at the top, selling pressure grew and Bitcoin retraced, briefly tapping the $96k support before rebounding. Today, Bitcoin sells for $99,569, reflecting a 3% gain. A deeper correction could be in store, on Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart, a bearish divergence has appeared, as the RSI is dipping while the price has been moving above an ascending trendline. A break below this trendline could confirm a short-term bearish scenario for Bitcoin. Trading volume has dipped by 45%, or roughly $65 billion worth of BTC traded across exchanges, this decline goes to show that buyers are taking a step back and redirecting attention to other altcoins that could be primed for new surges, such as Dogecoin and Lunex Network. Dogecoin Reclaims $0.45, What’s Next? After consolidating around $0.40 for the past few weeks, Dogecoin (DOGE) has soared by 3.8% on the daily timeframe, reaching $0.45. If this resistance is flipped into support, the way would be paved for Dogecoin to surge above $0.50 by the end of the year and possibly, reach the prophesied $1 landmark in early 2025. Analyst and trader Eliz has shared a Dogecoin chart reading, showing that DOGE has been moving into an ascending channel, with consistent rebounds from the trendline. Today, Elon Musk also did his part to elevate the sentiment of Dogecoin holders, as he reposted the same viral meme that he shared in 2021, during the memorable DOGE run. Why Lunex Network Could Be One Of The Best Plays Of 2025 Groundbreaking DeFi exchange Lunex could significantly disrupt the exchange industry with its innovative framework. The platform integrates isolated blockchains and allows for instantaneous swaps between more than 50,000 assets.

Pepe and Shiba Inu are still in the green, though memes in general have lost steam as large-cap utility plays gain traction. Gaming is yet to experience significant upward momentum, though some analysts believe a DeFi gaming rally is well overdue. In this lucrative hype-based sector, Rollblock stands out as a particularly profitable venture to look into heading into 2025. Read on to learn more. Whale Activity Bolsters Investor Confidence In Pepe Pepe has solidified its position as the third-largest memecoin, driven by recent listings on Coinbase, Robin Hood, and most recently Binance US. These significant listings have increased Pepe’s accessibility in the USA, contributing to Pepe’s 166% rise in a 30-day timeframe. Whales have further boosted confidence in Pepe ahead of the bull run, accumulating 337 million tokens worth over $6 million collectively. A recent trend of moving Pepe tokens off of exchanges has reduced selling pressure and supports Pepe’s bullish long-term growth prospects. With strong community support and increasing adoption, Pepe is well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory, as some crypto influencers like “Murad” predict that a meme supercycle is on the precipice. Burns And Increasing Interest From Whales Puts Shiba Inu In Bullish Stead Shiba Inu has regained momentum just in time for the bull run, with notable whale activity signaling renewed confidence amongst large investors. Two transactions in particular have garnered significant attention, one being a major transfer of over 80 billion SHIB from Coinbase and a separate 54 billion SHIB migration from a US government-linked wallet. In addition, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium, has seen its total value locked surge past $10 million, an 850% jump since September. Deflationary mechanisms, including a 4500% spike in the token’s burn rate, are also strengthening Shiba Inu’s supply dynamics, rendering Shiba Inu as more scarce. With further burns anticipated around Christmas, analysts anticipate Shiba Inu to continue its impressive growth trajectory at a time when memes are more popular than ever. Don’t Miss Out On Rollblock Before The Gaming Rally Rollblock is reshaping the iGaming industry with its innovative play-to-earn platform, seamlessly integrating decentralized and traditional gaming with lucrative rewards and a strong overall foundation that sets it up perfectly for further growth. Featuring a collection of over 7,000 games, Rollblock offers something for everyone , from classic favorites like poker and roulette to groundbreaking blockchain-based titles. The soon-to-launch sports betting feature will further expand its offerings, enabling the platform’s 20,000+ users to place wagers on major sporting events, enhancing the utility of the RBLK token while offering another avenue to have fun and make a profit.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-09 05:43:00

The U.S. government is publicly known as one of the largest nations that owns gold as its reserve, which accounts for 72% of the total. Based on TradingEconomics data on Dec. 09, the U.S. owned 8,133 tons of gold and dominated international commodity trading. However, Michael Saylor urges the government not to buy more gold but to buy more Bitcoin ( BTC ) instead for future assets against inflation. As a national reserve, in his belief, Bitcoin will rise to trillions of dollars. “Dump your gold, sell all the U.S. gold, and buy Bitcoin because you can buy 5 million Bitcoin for the cost of the gold. You’ll demonitize the entire gold asset class and our enemies hold gold in their banks, and so their asset would go to zero, while our asset go to trillion dollars,” Saylor says on Yahoo Finance’s Market Domination interview on X’s post On another occasion, Saylor also expects Bitcoin’s market capitalization to skyrocket to $280 trillion, surpassing the gold market cap, which accounts for $45 trillion. The recent Bitcoin market cap is $2 trillion. Through these projections, Saylor will keep buying Bitcoin every week and urge more investors and institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin.

This vision was followed by the BITCOIN Act, which was proposed by the Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis to Congress. Both of the figure’s vision, Trump and Saylor, was driven by Bitcoin’s utility and use cases against inflations. This move also inspired other institutions and nations to acquire or keep their Bitcoin. Polish and Suriname’s presidential candidates were two examples of how Bitcoin could influence their vision for their respective nations.

But the real buzz is coming from a surprising presale, 1FUEL. With DeFi booming and multi-chain ecosystems becoming the norm, this might be the best time to bet on the next altcoin to explode. Curious about why 1FUEL’s cryptocurrency wallet is stealing the spotlight from the likes of HBAR and Solana? Let’s see what makes this project a potential 100x crypto in 2025. Binance’s New Altcoin Picks: HBAR & Solana Altcoin season is in full swing, and Binance exchange just rolled out six new listings, with Hedera (HBAR) and Solana (SOL) leading the charge, alongside some meme coins that are keeping things spicy. Solana-based platforms like Raydium and Meteora are taking center stage for meme coin trading on Binance, but the real intrigue lies in HBAR and OM. HBAR is the leader in distributed ledger tech, and OM is all about connecting digital and physical assets. Binance knows how to keep both speculators and utility-focused investors hooked. At press time, BNB keeps printing green candles with nearly 40% gains this month. Also, BNB now has more than $111 billion in market cap. HBAR Rides The Altcoin season momentum Hedera Hashgraph has been quietly building a blockchain empire, backed by heavyweights like Google, IBM, and Ubisoft. That credibility is paying off, with HBAR’s price hitting $0.40, its best run since 2021. With a $12.5 billion market cap and climbing, HBAR is proving that this altcoin season is about delivering real-world value while riding the crypto rally wave. Can Solana Hit $200 This Season? Solana’s 2024 performance has been nothing short of spectacular. It’s up 270% this year, with a November rally pushing prices past $260 to a new ATH and analysts now eyeing the $300 mark. SOL’s fate is tied to Bitcoin’s stability and broader market sentiment. But with its blazing-fast transaction speeds and thriving ecosystem, Solana is riding the bullish altcoin trend like a pro. If Bitcoin holds steady, Solana could easily smash new records by year-end. For those watching the altcoin season play out, SOL is the textbook example of how a network can thrive when sentiment turns green. 1FUEL – The Best Cryptocurrency In 2025 That’s Breaking The DeFi Mold For those chasing high-growth altcoins this season, new entrants like 1FUEL naturally offer more 100x potential than established players like SOL or HBAR. While blue-chip tokens dominate the headlines, smaller projects often yield the most dramatic returns during altcoin rallies. With one-click cross-chain crypto transactions, cold storage for crypto, and privacy so tight even the nosiest blockchain won’t crack it, and crypto staking rewards of up to 10% APR, you’ve got an investment that works as hard as you do. The presale offers early birds exclusive bonuses, making this the perfect time to jump in. In a market hungry for innovation, this project checks all the boxes for investors seeking big gains with utility baked right in. Conclusion HBAR and Solana are undeniably riding the altcoin season high on Binance, but 1FUEL offers something different, something game-changing. It’s not just a token; it’s a secure cryptocurrency wallet, a staking platform, and a secure haven for your crypto, all rolled into one. While HBAR and Solana are great plays for those riding the momentum, 1FUEL is where innovation meets opportunity. Its presale bonuses and unique features make it the dark horse of this altcoin cycle. If you’re looking to make moves in a market primed for explosive growth, 1FUEL may be the best cryptocurrency to buy ahead of the new year. Learn more about 1FUEL.

Last week, spot Bitcoin ETFs netted inflows of $2.73 billion, reaching the highest-ever weekly inflows since inception. Of these, BlackRock Bitcoin ETF IBIT alone netted inflows of $2.6 billion, while crossing $50 billion AUM. So what actually led to the Bitcoin price pump to an all-time high of $104K? Similar to the previous bull cycles, it’s the retail frenzy and shot-term holders that are capturing all the limelight. Recent data indicates that retail demand has surged to yearly highs over the past 30 days, reflecting increased activity during a strong upward trend. Courtesy: Maartunn Short-term holders, often dominated by retail investors, are absorbing much of the supply. Furthermore, Maartunn noted that retail participation extends beyond spot markets with the altcoin open interest surging to $53.3 billion while the Bitcoin open interest surging to $30.6 billion. This heavy retail presence in both spot and derivatives markets underscores a high-stakes “musical chairs” dynamic, noted the analyst while advising caution when market sentiment shifts. Signs of Extreme Fear and Greed The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has surged to 84, signaling “extreme greed” in the market—a level often associated with heightened risk and potential market tops. Source: Maartunn In addition to the Fear & Greed Index, other metrics, such as the Sell-Side Risk Ratio and Net Taker Volume (ETH) , are also pointing toward the possibility of a market top. These signals align with bearish on-chain data observed during last week’s price movements. Source: Maartunn The Bitcoin price movement will depend on macro indicators with the release of U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation figures. Adding to the spotlight, the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI)—a key inflation gauge closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for rate-cut decisions—is also set to be announced this week.

Lately, one project’s presale has been making big waves as blockchain investment experts forecast an expected 50x ROI in the coming months. Keep reading to get in early on 50x forecast as 1Fuel ’s token presale gains increasing appeal across the cryptocurrency playfield. Solana Passes Moving Average: Set to Hit $500 Solana (SOL) is keeping its bulls on their toes as it just broke through a key resistance trendline and surged above the $240 mark. SOL just passed its 100-day moving average and technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) now point to a strong upward trend in the market. Grayscale Investment’s recent filing for a Solana ETF with the SEC has triggered most of the excitement around the price surge. If this ETF is granted, it could boost Solana’s institutional appeal, and the coin could level up to join the list of top cryptocurrencies. SOL’s price shot up by 5% almost immediately the filing was announced, and now optimistic blockchain investment experts are forecasting that it could even reach the $500 price mark. Currently valued at $243 and reaching the $500 mark means Solana would deliver an impressive 100% ROI from its current price. Yet, even this notable ROI pales compared to the returns anticipated for 1Fuel (OFT) if it hits its target price of $0.5. Tron Reaches New Heights as TVL Hits $36.2 Billion Solana is not the only beneficiary of Grayscale’s recent moves. On December 4, the total value locked (TVL) on Tron hit $36.2 billion, and Tron’s TRX token recently reached a record-breaking price of $0.44. Although it then corrected to $0.33, it still posted impressive weekly gains of 66% and reclaimed its position as the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The recent rally has been speculatively fueled by TRX’s potential inclusion in Grayscale’s portfolio. Grayscale has listed TRX among 35 tokens under evaluation and quarterly updates are expected. This prospect has raised the prospects for increased institutional interest in Tron. Adding to the momentum is Tron founder Justin Sun, whose high-profile moves have drawn attention to the network. Sun recently made a blockchain investment of $30 million in WLFI tokens tied to Donald Trump’s ‘World Liberty Financial’ initiative and accepted an advisory role with the project. His involvement has also extended to the conceptual artwork “Comedian”, driving community engagement and indirectly boosting interest in related tokens like BAN. 1Fuel Token Presale Ignites Investor Interest with Explosive Potential Although it seems like Solana and Tron are setting unstoppable trends in the market at the moment, their investors have picked up on 1Fuel as the top new project for 2025 . Currently trading at just $0.01, 1Fuel’s token presale has attracted significant attention, including from blockchain investment experts, due to its explosive growth potential. Should it climb to $0.5, investors could see an extraordinary 500% return that would far eclipse the impressive gains predicted for Solana. Participants in stage 1 of the presale receive a 20% bonus on all purchases which is a great entry point for those looking to secure a stake before the platform’s public launch. With 500 million tokens (half of the total supply) allocated for the presale, 1Fuel is not only raising capital but also empowering early adopters to shape its future trajectory. One of 1Fuel’s best features is that it allows seamless cross-chain transactions which simplifies token swaps by removing the unnecessary fees and multiple wallets. The project has allocated 40 million tokens as staking rewards, encouraging holders to lock up their tokens and actively participate in the network. Additionally, 110 million tokens are reserved for liquidity providers, ensuring ample liquidity for smooth trading. Active traders are also rewarded, with 40 million tokens designated to incentivize high-volume transactions and market activity. Conclusion Solana and Tron may be trending upward in the crypto market, but investors have 1Fuel’s token presale marked out as a chance to make huge returns. By focusing on accessibility, security, and ecosystem growth, 1Fuel positions itself as a gateway to innovative blockchain solutions and sustainable growth for its community.
