These moments remind us of one thing: the best always push beyond their limits. And now, the crypto world has its own record-setter: XYZ, the first-ever all-sports meme coin. Combining the energy of sports with the explosive potential of meme coins, XYZ is breaking presale records faster than a Conor McGregor knockout. In just 12 days, Stage 7 of the XYZ presale sold out, raising over $2,000,000. This record signals exceptional demand and strong market interest, outperforming typical presale timelines, even for well-hyped meme coins. Now, with Stage 8 live, the race is on to beat that record. The momentum is real, the stakes are high, and the question is: how fast XYZ will crush this stage? The Stats Don’t Lie—Here’s Why You Need to Act Fast The $XYZ presale is live and already moving faster than a championship sprint. Here’s where the numbers stand: 💥 Current Price (Stage 8): $0.001 – This represents a 100x potential gain compared to the listing price. 🔥 Next Stage Price: $0.001333 – Still a massive opportunity, with a 75x gain potential versus the listing price. 🎯 Final Presale Price: $0.1 – The ultimate destination, where the token prepares to launch into the broader market. 🚀 Upside Potential: A jaw-dropping 9,900%, giving investors the chance to turn small investments into life-changing gains.

This Crypto is Your Chance Now for Massive Gains in 2025,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-the-chance-to-join-algorand-this-crypto-is-your-chance-now-for-massive-gains-in-2025/,"If you’ve been keeping tabs on the crypto market lately, you know it’s been a whirlwind. Algorand (ALGO) has been at the center of attention, skyrocketing in price thanks to its fast, secure, and eco-friendly blockchain. But let’s face it—if you didn’t jump in during its earlier days, you’re probably wondering if it’s too late to see those jaw-dropping returns. Don’t worry, though. Missing the ALGO train isn’t the end of the line. There’s a new player in town, and it’s got analysts buzzing. Say hello to Qubetics ($TICS), the best crypto to buy in December 2024 for anyone looking to make massive gains in 2025. While Algorand has been making waves in scalability and decentralisation, Qubetics is carving out its own lane with real-world asset tokenisation. Imagine owning a slice of prime real estate, fine art, or even small businesses, all without the massive upfront costs. That’s the power of Qubetics. And right now, it’s in its presale phase, which means you’ve got a golden opportunity to jump in early and ride the wave to potentially life-changing returns. Qubetics ($TICS): A New Frontier in Asset Tokenisation Let’s get one thing straight: Qubetics isn’t just another “hype” token. It’s solving a real-world problem that most crypto projects barely scratch the surface of—making high-value assets accessible to everyday investors. Think about it. How many of us dream about owning a piece of a luxury condo, investing in a startup, or putting money into rare art? For most folks, those opportunities feel about as out of reach as winning the lottery. But Qubetics is changing all that with its Web3 aggregator platform. Here’s how it works: Qubetics takes real-world assets—like real estate, businesses, and even fine art—and breaks them into smaller, tokenised shares. That means you don’t need millions to get in the game. For example, say you’re a small-town teacher in Kansas with $300 to invest. With Qubetics, you could own a piece of a high-end Manhattan apartment or a slice of a growing café in Seattle. It’s like crowdfunding, but on steroids. And it’s not just individuals who benefit. Businesses are loving this model, too. A local brewery in Texas could tokenize its equity to fund a new taproom, while an artist in LA could sell shares of their latest painting to collectors worldwide. By democratizing asset ownership, Qubetics is opening doors that were once slammed shut for anyone without deep pockets. Now, let’s talk numbers. Qubetics is currently in Presale Phase 11, priced at just $0.0282 per $TICS. So far, it’s raised over $5 million, with more than 288 million tokens sold to a growing community of 7,500+ holders. And here’s the kicker: a 10% price increase happens every week, with a final phase bump of 20% before the token launches at $0.25. That’s a potential 900% ROI for early investors. Let’s break it down with an example. If you invest $300 today, you’ll snag roughly 10,638 $TICS tokens. When the price hits $0.25 after the presale, your investment could be worth a cool $2,659.50. That’s enough to kickstart your 2025 goals, whether it’s paying off bills, starting a side hustle, or just treating yourself to something nice. Algorand (ALGO): A Green Giant Making Big Moves Algorand has been a darling of the crypto world for a reason. It’s fast, secure, and, most importantly, eco-friendly—a major selling point in a world where sustainability is top of mind. Designed by MIT professor Silvio Micali, Algorand’s blockchain is a marvel of efficiency, capable of handling thousands of transactions per second without breaking a sweat. Over the past year, ALGO has seen a massive resurgence, fueled by partnerships with governments, institutions, and even DeFi projects. Its price surged by over 75% in just one week, reaching a new yearly high of $0.5208. Open Interest (OI) in ALGO futures has also skyrocketed, jumping from $75.69 million to $204 million in a matter of days. This influx of capital has analysts buzzing, with some predicting ALGO could hit $0.75 in the short term and potentially cross the $1 mark by mid-2025. But here’s the rub: While Algorand’s tech is undeniably impressive, its gains might not be as explosive as they once were. For early adopters, the ride has been thrilling. But for new investors jumping in at these higher price levels, the upside might feel more like a gradual climb than a rocket launch. That said, ALGO is still a solid choice for anyone looking for a reliable blockchain project with long-term potential. Its use cases in areas like supply chain management, digital identity, and carbon offset tracking make it a cornerstone of the green blockchain movement. But if you’re hunting for those “life-changing gains,” you might want to look at newer projects like Qubetics. Don’t Miss Out—Get in on Qubetics Before It’s Too Late So, where should you put your money—Qubetics or Algorand? Honestly, it depends on your goals. If you’re looking for a tried-and-true blockchain project with a focus on sustainability and scalability, Algorand is a safe bet. It’s already proven itself, and its partnerships give it a strong foundation for growth. But if you’re chasing those big, juicy returns that make your friends go, “Wait, you made how much?” Qubetics is the clear winner. Its presale phase is a rare opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a project that’s tackling a massive market. With its real-world asset tokenisation model, Qubetics is poised to become a household name in 2025. And let’s not forget that potential 900% ROI—that’s the kind of growth most crypto investors dream about. Crypto is all about timing, and the clock is ticking on Qubetics’ presale. If you’ve been kicking yourself for missing the Algorand frenzy, now’s your chance to turn things around. With a growing community, innovative technology, and analysts calling it the best crypto to buy in December 2024 , Qubetics has all the makings of a breakout star. Head to the Qubetics presale page today and lock in your investment before the next price hike. Whether you’re putting down $300 or going all in, this could be your ticket to massive gains in 2025. Don’t wait until you’re reading about its success next year—be a part of it now.

Dogecoin (DOGE) Dogecoin began in 2013 as a playful take on cryptocurrency. Created by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer, it featured the Shiba Inu dog from a popular meme as its logo. Unlike Bitcoin's scarcity, Dogecoin was designed to be abundant, with no maximum supply and 10,000 new coins mined every minute. Starting as a joke, it quickly gained a following, showing the power of community and social media. In 2021, Dogecoin's value soared, fueled by online buzz and endorsements from Elon Musk. It entered the top ten cryptocurrencies, with a market value over $50 billion. Is Dogecoin worth considering now? Its technology is simple, similar to early cryptocurrencies but without a supply limit. This means it's less about scarcity and more about usage and community support. While some see it as a fun entry into crypto, others are cautious due to its meme origins and volatility. Compared to coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Dogecoin lacks advanced features like smart contracts. Yet, its strong community keeps it popular. In the current market, if you're drawn to a coin with a passionate following and accept the risks, Dogecoin might be attractive. Conclusion While coins like DOGE, PEPE, and MOG offer strong potential, XYZVerse stands out as the pioneering all-sport memecoin poised for exceptional growth in the current bull run.

In the current market, if you're drawn to a coin with a passionate following and accept the risks, Dogecoin might be attractive. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu (SHIB) burst onto the crypto scene in August 2020, inspired by Dogecoin. Unlike its predecessor, SHIB runs on the Ethereum blockchain, opening up possibilities in the vast Ethereum ecosystem. Launched by an anonymous developer named Ryoshi, it started with a supply of one quadrillion tokens. To gain credibility, half of these tokens were sent to Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin's donation of SHIB to the India Covid Crypto Relief Fund and the burning of 40% of the total supply brought significant attention to SHIB. SHIB's place on Ethereum allows it to support smart contracts and decentralized apps. This led to ShibaSwap, a decentralized exchange where users can trade SHIB and other tokens. The team also plans an NFT platform and a governance system using a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). These features give SHIB real utility beyond being a meme. In the current market, where investors seek coins with real-world uses, SHIB's technology and growth plans make it attractive. While sharing Dogecoin's meme appeal, SHIB's Ethereum foundation could give it an edge in the long run. Conclusion While DOGE and SHIB remain popular, XYZVerse offers a unique blend of sports and memes, aiming for massive growth and to become the G.O.A.T of memecoins.

As Inflation is going up, cash and bonds aren’t the best way to protect a company’s money anymore. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has been increasing in value. In 2024, Bitcoin grew by 131%, which is much better than bonds. Over the last five years, Bitcoin’s value went up by more than 1,200%, which is far outpacing bonds. Shareholders believe that with Amazon’s $585 billion in assets, including $88 billion in cash and bonds, the company should consider adding Bitcoin to its reserves. Holding Bitcoin could help Amazon protect its profits from inflation and possibly earn better returns in the future. Following the proposal, which is already making rounds on X (formerly Twitter), former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) made a post by asking the company to simply add support for crypto as a payment option on the leading e-commerce platform. “Simple. Accept bitcoin payments?,” CZ posted. Simple. Accept bitcoin payments? 🤷‍♂️ https://t.co/ud5PVNYHrj — CZ 🔶 BNB (@cz_binance) December 8, 2024 Companies like MicroStrategy, which holds a lot of Bitcoin, have seen their stock prices increase. Other companies like Tesla and Block (formerly Square) have also added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. The proposal suggests that Amazon could do the same to increase shareholder value. While Bitcoin is a volatile asset, having some Bitcoin in its reserves could give Amazon more long-term value, even if its value fluctuates in the short term. The shareholders suggest that Amazon could start by holding just 5% of its assets in Bitcoin in the initial. This proposal reflects a bigger trend of companies starting to see Bitcoin as a safe investment to protect against inflation. Microsoft’s shareholders are voting soon on whether to add Bitcoin to their balance sheet. As Bitcoin becomes more accepted by big companies, it may soon become a regular part of how companies manage their assets. Amazon has yet to decide whether to add Bitcoin to its balance sheet. However, one can say that more companies are likely to follow suit with firms like Microsoft and Amazon now joining the discussion.

Following Bitcoin’s milestone, the crypto-focused X account Autism Capital asked Bukele to disclose El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio to “dunk on the haters.” In response, Bukele posted the portfolio, revealing the nation’s nearly $270 million investment in Bitcoin. The portfolio confirms that no Bitcoin has been sold, and unrealized gains now exceed $333 million, a significant validation of the country’s strategy. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Journey El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on September 7, 2021, when its Bitcoin Law came into effect. A day prior, the government made its inaugural purchase of 200 BTC. Since then, the country has continued accumulating Bitcoin. On November 17, 2022, Bukele announced a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, committing to purchasing one Bitcoin daily. According to Nayib Tracker, a platform monitoring El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings, the country currently owns 6,180 BTC, with an average purchase price of $44,739.88. Based on current prices, the portfolio has gained approximately 122%. Beyond financial gains, El Salvador has also seen increased tourism and international recognition since adopting Bitcoin. IMF Urges El Salvador to Reconsider Despite the reported benefits, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly advised El Salvador to scale back its Bitcoin initiatives. On January 25, 2022, the IMF urged the country to stop recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender, citing financial stability risks but acknowledging its potential for financial inclusion. The IMF renewed its concerns on October 3, 2024, with communications director Julie Kozack recommending the country narrow the Bitcoin Law’s scope and limit public sector exposure to Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 21:32:44

As the altcoin season approaches, Polkadot could be set for significant gains, possibly exceeding previous highs. Conclusion Though AVAX and DOT show promise, their short-term potential is limited.

Nest Services Ltd., a company linked to Binance Group, stands out as one of the most significant offenders. The firm is accused of evading $86.8 million in GST. India Recovers $14.7M in Crypto Tax Crackdown According to an Economic Times report , Minister of State for Finance Pankaj Chaudhary revealed in a written response to the Lok Sabha that investigations have been launched into these firms. The investigation has already led to the recovery of $14.7 million in taxes, penalties, and interest, with further recoveries expected as authorities continue their probe. Among the other exchanges under scrutiny, Zanmai Labs Pvt (WazirX) faces allegations of evading $4.9 million, CoinDCX is accused of evading $2 million, and CoinSwitch Kuber is linked to $1.7 million in GST evasion. The agency is also investigating four crypto investors who were found to have evaded $210,000 in GST. Authorities have already recovered $290,000 from these individuals, covering taxes, penalties, and interest. Chaudhary also highlighted the government’s growing efforts to regulate the cryptocurrency sector, noting that 47 Virtual Digital Asset Service Providers (VDA SPs) have been registered as Reporting Entities with the Financial Intelligence Unit-India under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. This is not the first instance of the government acting against crypto exchanges. In 2021-22, 11 platforms were penalized for tax evasion, with $1.08 million in unpaid taxes identified. At the time, authorities successfully recovered $1.2 million, including penalties. Crackdown on Binance’s Tax Evasion This report comes months after Indian law enforcement agencies demanded around $86 million in unpaid taxes from Binance in August. Binance and several other offshore crypto exchanges were banned in India in January 2024 for non-compliance with local regulations. However, in April, the exchange announced its intention to resume operations in the country after settling pending taxes. Despite this, in August 2024, the Directorate General of Goods and Service Tax Intelligence (DGGI) demanded $86 million from Binance under GST. According to The Times of India, the platform had reportedly earned $480 million from transaction fees charged to Indian customers. Investigations revealed that these earnings were credited to an account belonging to Nest Services Ltd. Authorities also sent email notices to Binance’s offices in Seychelles, the Cayman Islands, and Switzerland, which the exchange initially ignored. Binance later appointed local counsel to address its tax obligations. India requires all crypto service providers and investors to pay a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) on every transaction, regardless of its value. Additionally, all profits from crypto investments are subject to a 30% tax.

Just last month, the SHIB Army organised a charity event, raising thousands of dollars while promoting the coin. With the launch of Shibarium, a Layer 2 blockchain, Shiba Inu is entering uncharted territory. This move could lower transaction fees and boost adoption, paving the way for even more significant growth. Dogs: The Underrated Contender with a Strong Bite While lesser-known than its counterparts, Dogs is making a name for itself in the meme coin world. Its focus on creating a sustainable, community-driven model sets it apart. Dogs doesn’t overcomplicate things. The coin’s mission is straightforward: to create a fun, engaging community while delivering steady growth for its investors. This simplicity resonates with a wide audience, from crypto newbies to seasoned traders. Dogs is all about its people. The project regularly hosts live Q&A sessions, exclusive giveaways, and meme contests. One recent event saw Dogs’ developers answer hundreds of questions from eager investors, showcasing their transparency and dedication. Dogs might not have the hype of BTFD Coin or the legacy of Shiba Inu, but it has the potential for steady, long-term growth. Its low market cap and focus on community engagement make it a hidden gem for those willing to take a chance. Conclusion Meme coins are here to stay, and each of these tokens proves why. BTFD Coin shines as a presale powerhouse with its Play2Earn game, staking rewards, and vibrant community.

The trend currently looks bullish following a 14% increase since yesterday. Last week saw WIF through an end to a three-week retracement after retesting the key $3 level. Holding this level as support, the meme coin entered a consolidation phase and remained calm throughout the week. Things changed this week due to enhanced volatility and the price tests broke out of the consolidation phase yesterday. Trading looks indecisive today as the bulls are yet to reiterate actions due to low buying pressure. While today may end strong, more positive actions should be expected in the future. An increase above $5 should set WIF up for bigger moves. Looking at the daily chart, it seems to be repeating last month’s pattern and if that comes into play, this current buying phase could reach $6. The bears are currently off the market. If they return with a pull below the mentioned key level, it may navigate the ascending trendline, which has been acting as diagonal support over the past months. From the look of things, WIF will likely increase rather than decrease in the coming week. WIF’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview The potential resistance level for the latest surge is $4.86 – November’s high. A successful break above it should soar the price to a new high of $6. The next key level to watch above this high is $7. Losing the holding key support, the close level to watch for a rebound is $2.54, testing the ascending trendline. Breaking it could roll us back to last month’s $1.9 low.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 21:55:00

Pepe ended last month’s trading super strong after going through a short pullback. This brought a little pause in the bullish momentum as the price revisited the previously broken resistance (yearly high) as support. Bouncing back in the late month, the price increased but fell slightly earlier this week. Intercepting the $0.0000188 level, the buyers pushed back and briefly broke higher to a new high of $0.000027 yesterday. That high was rejected, and the price dropped to $0.000025, where it traded calmly. As volatility turned low in the past hours, the buyers are finding it difficult to sustain pressure. A further drop could bring a little retest at the $0.000023 level that broke on the lower timeframe. However, from the look of things, the buyers are likely to gain more dominance in the coming days. But if yesterday’s rejection turned out to be a double-top pattern, it may lose grip until it finds a solid level for a rebound. As of now, the trend remains strongly bullish daily. Looking at the daily chart, Pepe has provided a notable discount during the last leg down, and considering the latest bounce back, we can expect a huge rally in the coming week. Pepe’s Key Levels To Watch Source: Tradingview While trading under the key $0.00003 level, the higher price level to watch for an increase is $0.00004, followed by the $0.00005 level. The long-term target to keep in mind is $0.0001. The $0.0000173 level has been providing support since Pepe bounced back in late November. If by any chance it collapses, the $0.0000131 and $0.0000101 levels are lower supports to keep in mind for a test. Key Resistance Levels: $0.00003, $0.00004, $0.00005 Key Support Levels: $0.0000173, $0.0000131, $0.0000101 Spot Price: $0.0000245 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This marks a significant development for the meme coin, as it had struggled to break past this level for weeks. The move has sparked renewed optimism among traders and investors who see potential for further upside. Related Reading: XRP Price Forecast – Analyst Sets $4 Target After Potential Retrace Key data from blockchain analytics firm Santiment highlights that Dogecoin, along with other meme coins, is experiencing mini breakouts this weekend. This trend suggests increasing bullish momentum in the meme coin sector, often viewed as a precursor to broader market rallies. The data indicates rising trading volumes and heightened on-chain activity, both of which point to sustained interest in Dogecoin. If this momentum continues, Dogecoin could be on the verge of extending its recent gains, with many market participants eyeing the $0.50 psychological level as the next target. A successful breakout above $0.50 could pave the way for even higher levels, further fueling the ongoing rally. However, failure to maintain its upward trajectory might lead to a period of consolidation. Dogecoin Sets The Stage For New Highs Dogecoin is positioning itself for higher prices as it continues its upward trajectory, but the latest breakout lacked the explosive momentum many anticipated. Despite pushing past critical levels, Dogecoin failed to sustain its price above the previous high, signaling a need for more significant buying pressure to maintain its rally. Blockchain analytics platform Santiment has shed light on the recent activity, revealing that meme coins like Dogecoin, Pepe, Dogewithhat, and Bonk are experiencing mini breakouts this weekend. According to their data, larger wallets, often referred to as “whales,” have been instrumental in driving up market caps for these coins. This trend is expected to continue until retail FOMO (fear of missing out) resurfaces, potentially pushing prices higher in the short term. However, the dynamics of meme coin markets suggest caution. Santiment’s analysis shows that when social dominance for these tokens spikes significantly, it often signals a market top. Whales typically capitalize on heightened retail enthusiasm, offloading their holdings at inflated prices. This pattern frequently results in a sharp retrace as prices correct following the sell-off. Related Reading: Cardano Whales Keep Buying – Price Holds Above Crucial Mark Santiment also shared a comparative chart tracking social dominance across these meme coins, highlighting past instances where peaks in attention preceded pullbacks. For Dogecoin, maintaining its current momentum while avoiding overbought conditions will be critical to sustaining its rally. Price Testing Fresh Supply Dogecoin (DOGE) is currently trading at $0.46, following a failed attempt to break decisively above the $0.48 level. The price remains in a consolidation phase, struggling to build enough momentum to push beyond the psychological $0.50 mark. Despite this, the broader market sentiment remains bullish, offering a supportive backdrop for potential price advances. The current environment suggests that Dogecoin is likely to continue ranging below $0.50 in the near term. However, if bulls can muster the strength to break above this critical level and sustain it for a few days, a massive breakout could be on the horizon. Breaking and holding above $0.50 would likely signal renewed buying interest, setting the stage for a strong rally. The bullish market conditions driving other major cryptocurrencies could also work in Dogecoin’s favor, provided that overall sentiment continues to improve. Still, traders should watch for clear confirmation of a breakout before expecting significant price movements. Related Reading: SUI About To Break ATH Again – Can Bulls Target $4.20 This Week?

Among these emerging options, two notable contenders have attracted attention for their performance and potential: Toncoin and Fantom.

For investors eyeing the best altcoins to invest in for short-term ROIs, it’s all about spotting the next big wave before it crests. And boy, do we have some movers and shakers for you! Today, we’re diving into three altcoins that are making serious noise: Qubetics, AAVE, and Near Protocol. These projects aren’t just riding the crypto hype train—they’re powering it. Take Qubetics , for example: this blockchain disruptor has raised a jaw-dropping $5 million in its presale, selling over 288 million $TICS tokens. With its price currently sitting at $0.0282 and climbing, it’s no wonder analysts are predicting massive short-term ROIs. Meanwhile, AAVE and Near Protocol are flexing their muscles in DeFi and scalability, proving there’s plenty of room for innovation in this volatile market. Buckle up, because this ride’s about to get interesting. Qubetics: The New Blockchain on the Block If you haven’t heard of Qubetics , you’re missing out on one of the hottest presales of the year. This revolutionary Layer 1 blockchain aims to unify networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum with its groundbreaking chain abstraction technology. Translation? Qubetics makes it ridiculously easy to manage real-world tokenised assets , conduct cross-border payments, and launch decentralised applications. It’s not just a blockchain; it’s a next-gen digital economy. The numbers speak for themselves: Qubetics has raised over $5 million in its presale, selling a whopping 288 million $TICS tokens. That’s not hype—it’s proof that investors are seeing the long-term potential here. At a current presale price of $0.0282, you’d snag about 177,304 $TICS tokens for a $5,000 investment. Now, let’s dream a little: analysts predict $TICS could hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, giving you an ROI of 785%. And if post-launch momentum propels it to $1 or more? We’re talking about life-changing gains. Why is Qubetics standing out? Because it solves major pain points in the crypto world—scalability, interoperability, and security—all in one sleek package. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a curious newbie, this one’s worth watching closely. Learn more by watching this video . AAVE: The DeFi Darling Moving over to AAVE, the poster child for decentralised finance. If Qubetics is the bold new kid on the block, AAVE is the savvy veteran redefining how we interact with money. Its protocol lets users lend and borrow assets without a middleman—kind of like Venmo but decentralised and with way cooler tech. AAVE has been making waves recently, with its total value locked (TVL) climbing steadily. But the real appeal here is its short-term potential. With the launch of its AAVE v3 upgrade, which improves cross-chain functionality and liquidity efficiency, the token is expected to see significant price action. Imagine investing in AAVE at its current price of $246.79. With analysts predicting a potential ROI of 30% in just a few weeks, the gains can simply be mind-blowing. Sure, it’s not Qubetics-level explosive growth, but in the world of crypto, steady gains can still add up. AAVE isn’t just a token; it’s an ecosystem. From staking to governance to seamless DeFi applications, it’s a must-watch for anyone serious about crypto investments. Near Protocol: The Quiet Powerhouse Now, let’s talk about Near Protocol—a blockchain that flies a little under the radar but is quietly building the future. Near combines user-friendly tech with serious scalability, making it a top choice for developers creating dApps and DeFi platforms. Near’s short-term potential lies in its growing ecosystem. Recent partnerships and the buzz around its sharding technology (which splits the blockchain into smaller pieces for faster transactions) have analysts bullish. Let’s do the math: If you invest your money at its current price of $7.36 and the price climbs to $18.76 in the short term, as some experts suggest, you’re looking at a little bit over a cool 150% ROI. Not bad at all! Near is proof that you don’t need to be flashy to be effective. It’s quietly building a foundation for long-term success, which is why it’s a solid choice for both short-term traders and long-term holders. Why Timing Matters When Buying the Best Altcoins to Invest in for Short-Term ROIs Investing in crypto for short-term ROIs is all about timing. Whether it’s Qubetics smashing presale records, AAVE revolutionising DeFi, or Near Protocol scaling to new heights, the window of opportunity doesn’t stay open forever. Crypto moves fast, and today’s underdog can become tomorrow’s champion in the blink of an eye. Wrapping Up: The Big Picture Qubetics, AAVE, and Near Protocol each bring something unique to the table. Qubetics offers mind-blowing growth potential with its disruptive blockchain tech. AAVE continues to lead the DeFi charge with innovation and reliability. And Near Protocol proves that quiet powerhouses can still deliver massive returns. If you’re looking to make moves in the crypto world, don’t sleep on these projects. Qubetics’ presale is already setting the stage for historic returns, and with the token price expected to skyrocket, now’s the time to act. So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the Qubetics presale, stack up on AAVE and Near Protocol, and get ready to ride the wave of short-term ROIs. Because in the world of crypto, fortune favours the bold.

This proposal is the same as Microsoft’s proposed by Michael Taylor a few weeks ago. The National Center for Public Policy Research, an independent global conservative think tank based in Washington D.C, has proposed the Bitcoin ( BTC ) strategic reserve to the 5th world’s largest company, Amazon. This proposal aims to bid the cash and cash equivalent of the company, which accounts for $88 billion that includes the U.S. government, corporate, and foreign bonds, to consider adding Bitcoin to its strategic reserve by the next annual meeting in April 2025. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding asset to its treasury that appriciate more than bonds, even if those asset are more volatile short-term,” Based on the document that was shared by Tim Kotzman X’s post on Dec. 09 The U.S. inflation rate reached a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, which is the main reason why the company should adopt Bitcoin as the other company did. As their bond rates also did not exceed the real inflation, it’s not adequate to protect billions of dollars of shareholders by holding these assets. National Center also noted that Bitcoin’s performance in the past year has risen to 131%, surpassing the bonds by 126%. It also outperforms the corporate bonds by 1.246% in a single year.

A few weeks ago, MicroStrategy executive chairman Michael Saylor also presented the Bitcoin reserve for Microsoft; the company will decide it within this week. They also mentioned that Saylor’s action is followed by many companies and institutions, including BlackRock and Fidelity, which are releasing Bitcoin’s ETF to the stock market earlier this year. In conclusion, the National Center has advised Amazon to diversify its balance sheet by adding at least 5% of its assets into Bitcoin. It’s not only part of the move that technological companies need to make, but they should preserve their asset and the value of the shareholders with the unbeaten inflation of digital assets.

Shiba Loves Trump (SHIBTRUMP), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 19,000% in price in the coming days. This is because SHIBTRUMP is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Shiba Loves Trump can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Shiba Loves Trump could become the next viral memecoin. Shiba Loves Trump launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Shiba Loves Trump on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Shiba Loves Trump by entering its contract address – 66NhPn1KuGuEqJRmV2zqxQHuQzMBx6wKqPDLXaZiRJL3 – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like SHIBTRUMP. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-08 23:26:00

In an opinion piece for Hankyoreh , the author and crypto journalist Kim Oe-hyeon identified four key reasons why domestic traders responded to Yoon’s move with a mass sell-off. Martial Law Decree Sparked ‘Crypto Chaos’ Kim noted that “a number of structural problems” worked in tandem behind the scenes to cause chaos on South Korean crypto exchanges . Trading volumes spiked on platforms like Upbit and Bithumb late on December 3 when Yoon declared martial law. Trading volumes on the Upbit crypto exchange over the past seven days. (Source: CoinGecko) Crypto traders continued to sell off their coins in the early hours of December 4. But the sell-off came to an abrupt halt after Yoon accepted the National Assembly’s decision to block his martial law decree. Trading volumes have since shrunk back to their lowest level in almost a month. South Korean media outlets on December 8 reported that parliament’s subsequent failed motion to impeach Yoon had so far failed to move investors to act. The market has also been unmoved by a series of prosecution service attempts to arrest the President on “treason” charges. Trading volumes on the Bithumb crypto exchange over the past month. (Source: CoinGecko) Kim wrote that Yoon’s “absurd” decision to declare martial law had “sent huge shock waves” across the crypto market “in real-time.” Bitcoin (BTC) prices tumbled by up to 30% on major exchanges, at a time when the token was trading for just under $96,000 on overseas platforms. The leader of South Korea’s ruling People Power Party says that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will manage the nation’s affairs as the country deals with the fallout from a political crisis sparked by President Yoon Suk Yeol’s bungled martial law. https://t.co/trWbLHg1yk — Bloomberg (@business) December 8, 2024 ‘Uncertainty and Anxiety’ Kim wrote that the first major fact influencing the price drop was a sudden rush of “uncertainty and anxiety.” He added that traders were concerned about the “possibility of additional regulations such as asset freezes or the suspension of exchange operations.” Hong (first name withheld), a Seoul-based crypto investor, told Cryptonews.com that he “slept through the whole thing,” but noted that some of his acquaintances joined the sell-off. He said: “When I woke up, I checked my [crypto-themed chat app] groups and saw that once a few people said they were selling their tokens for cash, others said they’d do the same. I think that once a few traders said they were selling, it had a snowball effect.” The Special Prosecutor’s Office said Sunday that President Yoon Suk Yeol is now a suspect facing potential charges of insurrection and abuse of power. https://t.co/WdqVq7ef5j — The Korea Herald 코리아헤럴드 (@TheKoreaHerald) December 8, 2024 Kim, meanwhile, noted that the “structural characteristics” of the South Korean market had “amplified” anxiety levels. He remarked that, unlike the United States, the South Korean market is “overwhelmingly dominated by individual investors.” He explained: “This means that the market is structured to be easily swayed by news and sentiment.” A ‘Vicious Cycle’ And the expert noted that ill-timed network issues may also have spooked the market. He added that late on December 3, “many investors” were complaining “about connection problems with major exchanges such as Upbit and Bithumb.” Kim wrote: “This further fueled investor anxiety. And it led to a vicious cycle of sudden sales whenever orders became available. This is a chronic problem that occurs every time there is a market crash. And it is not being fixed.” Online Korean-language crypto- and stock trading-related forums also contained accounts of “crashes” on Bithumb and Upbit. One investor claimed he had successfully tried to “buy” the 30% “dip,” but “couldn’t buy more” because Bithumb’s site was down. Another trader said they had “sold” their holdings at a “low price,” and then mused: “I regret acting so quickly. The news came like a bolt from the blue in the middle of the night.” US calls for 'proper' functioning of democratic processes in S. Korea after scrapped impeachment motion https://t.co/VIVbwGL1WC — The Korea Times (@koreatimescokr) December 8, 2024 Lack of Market Makers ‘a Problem’ Kim, meanwhile, noted that a fourth factor had also helped fuel the panic. He noted that since the launch of the Virtual Asset User Protection Act in July, “market-making activities have been prohibited.” The act classifies many traditional market-making activities as a form of “unfair” crypto trading. As such, there is no longer anyone to “fill in the gaps between bids” and help “mitigate volatility.” The expert explained: “Market makers provide liquidity in the market and mitigate price volatility by simultaneously presenting buy and sell prices. If they had provided buy prices and acted as a buffer [on December 3-4], the price drop would not have been so large.” The post Expert Explains Why Martial Law Threw South Korea’s Crypto Markets into Chaos appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|News|Bitcoin Price|South Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2024-12-08 23:30:00

Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed the breach in a social media post. However, before action was taken, the scam token generated about $500,000 in trading volume, only to crash by 99%. The fraudulent posts, including the SEC lawsuit claims, have since been removed. The Cardano Foundation stated it is working to secure its account, emphasizing that no other parts of the Cardano ecosystem were affected. Users are advised to avoid clicking any links from the foundation’s X account until the issue is fully resolved. Frequent X Account Hacks Targeting Crypto Projects The Cardano Foundation joins a growing list of entities impacted by social media hacks involving crypto scams. In December 2023, Compound Finance’s X account was hacked, with phishing links posted to a counterfeit website advertising fake COMP tokens. These links drained funds from unsuspecting users. In October 2024, Symbiotic’s X account was hacked, and the attacker posted fake interaction checklists resembling airdrop campaigns. These led users to phishing sites that stole legitimate tokens. The same month, Eigenlayer’s X account was compromised to promote a fraudulent airdrop campaign. Even non-crypto accounts have been targeted.

37401173,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=624631,1733701841,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/37401173.jpeg,President Trump says he never wanted to kick Jerome Powell out of the Federal Reserve,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/president-trump-says-he-never-wanted-to-kick-jerome-powell-out-of-the-federal-reserve/,"President-elect Donald Trump has shut down speculation about removing Jerome Powell from his position as Federal Reserve Chair. These speculations come from him saying during campaign that he would take over the central bank and be in charge of the economy himself. But now, in an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press , Trump said , “Fire him? No, I don’t see it.” “I think if I told him to, he would,” the president added. “But if I asked him to, he probably wouldn’t.” Sounds like he knows his man all too well. He did appoint him, after all. And Powell has made it clear that he’s not going anywhere. Days after Trump’s victory, the Fed chair reaffirmed the central bank’s independence, telling reporters he wouldn’t step aside if asked and that the president doesn’t have the authority to fire him or other senior Fed leaders. Trump’s take on Powell and monetary policy Trump’s views on the Federal Reserve have always been controversial. He genuinely believes that the president should have more influence over monetary policy. In an October interview with Bloomberg, Trump said, “I think I have the right to say, ‘I think you should go up or down a little bit.’ I don’t think I should be allowed to order it, but I think I should be able to comment.” He didn’t stop there. Trump ridiculed Powell’s job, calling it “the greatest job in government.” In his words, “You show up to the office once a month, and you say, ‘Let’s see, flip a coin.’” It’s no secret that Trump’s frustration with Powell stems from the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes during his first term, which Trump believed slowed economic growth. Back in 2018, Trump even considered firing Powell but didn’t follow through. Legal scholars pointed out that removing a Federal Reserve Chair isn’t as simple as giving the order. The Federal Reserve Act only allows board members to be removed “for cause,” which means serious misconduct or abuse of power, not just disagreements over policy. “Looks like I’m stuck with you,” Trump told him over the phone one night from the Oval. Despite their past clashes, Powell has said he isn’t anticipating new tensions with Trump’s administration. While Powell’s term as Chair runs through 2026, his 14-year tenure as a Federal Reserve Governor doesn’t expire until 2028, which gives Trump limited room to replace him outright. POTUS’ power over the Federal Reserve The president of the United States has the power to appoint members to the Board of Governors. This includes selecting key roles like Chair and Vice-Chair. Governors serve 14-year terms, and chairs serve four-year terms. All of them sit on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the group that decides interest rates. During his next term, Trump will have at least two opportunities to appoint members to the Fed Board. One of those openings will come in January 2026 when Fed Governor Adriana Kugler’s term ends. These appointments will require Senate confirmation, but with a Republican majority in the Senate, Trump is likely to face less resistance than he did during his first presidency, when several of his Fed picks were blocked. Even with these appointments, Trump’s influence is limited. The Fed’s policymaking structure includes 12 regional bank presidents who are selected independently by the boards of their respective banks, subject to approval from the Federal Reserve Board. This decentralized system reduces the president’s ability to directly control monetary policy. Trump isn’t the first president to try to influence the Federal Reserve, but his approach has been one of the most public. He often airs his grievances in press conferences and interviews, accusing Powell of making poor policy decisions. He also criticizes the Fed’s track record, saying they’ve “sort of gotten it wrong a lot.” According to Trump, Powell’s timing on key decisions has been “a little bit too early and a little bit too late.” The case for Fed independence The central bank’s role is to manage inflation and employment without political interference, which Powell believes is essential for maintaining credibility with investors and the public. “Without question, the Fed must remain apolitical,” Powell said earlier this year. But the reality is more complicated. The Federal Reserve often operates within a political context, collaborating with the Treasury Department and considering the economic impact of government policies like tax cuts or spending initiatives. Critics argue this interaction makes it impossible for the Fed to be entirely apolitical. Economists like Peter Conti-Brown, a Fed historian at the Wharton School, describe the Federal Reserve as a “deeply political institution.” However, he distinguishes between politics and partisanship, emphasizing that the Fed’s decisions often reflect input from multiple factions. Despite these challenges, the Federal Reserve has maintained its independence for over a century. Central banks around the world rely on this model to make tough decisions, such as raising interest rates to fight inflation, without fear of political retaliation.

Table of Contents Lunex Network: The future of secure and cost-effective trading Cardano eyes a $1.3 breakout as momentum builds Dogecoin Targets breakout to ATH Lunex Network could outpace Cardano and Dogecoin Major players like Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Lunex Network (LNEX) are drawing interest as investors search for the next big thing in crypto.

Early buyers at $0.0012 have already witnessed a 200% return on investment. Cardano eyes a $1.3 breakout as momentum builds With the Cardano price up over 20% in the previous week, the altcoin has been showing notable positive momentum. Moreover, the Cardano price has exceeded the $1 resistance level and rallied to the $1.3 zone . Still, the past month has been even more remarkable since Cardano (ADA) jumped around 270%, mirroring its rising investor sentiment. The Cardano price chart shows that the altcoin has displayed great market confidence by maintaining above the $1.2 support despite encountering resistance at the $1.3 level. Experts believe Cardano might rapidly break above the $1.3 resistance and maybe even surge to $2 very soon if the bullish trend keeps up. Technical indicators are also bolstering Cardano’s positive view. As the Cardano price chart shows, key indicators, including the MACD, Moving Averages, and Awesome Oscillator all show a strong increasing trend. A classic indication of ongoing bullish pressure, Cardano (ADA) keeps producing higher highs and higher lows. Dogecoin Targets breakout to ATH Rising by almost 10% in just the past week, the Dogecoin price has been on a notable upward path. Although the Dogecoin price has lately consolidated between the $0.48 and $0.38 levels, it has had an amazing 165% growth over the previous month, therefore rekindling investor excitement. Many of the Dogecoin holders who bought the dips are now keenly awaiting the next breakout. Given the Dogecoin price chart showing that the altcoin’s present price remains around 40% below its all-time high of $0.737 from 2021, there is clearly room for notable gains particularly should Dogecoin be able to break over the $0.47 resistance level. Strong buy signals from the MACD and Moving Averages on the Dogecoin price chart help to further validate the momentum building for a possible comeback. Should Dogecoin be able to exceed its present resistance levels, we could see a rally toward the $1 mark this cycle. Lunex Network could outpace Cardano and Dogecoin Lunex Network is positioned to outpace Cardano and Dogecoin with its special mix of security, privacy, and ultra-low transaction fees, even though both altcoins exhibit encouraging indications of bullish momentum. Lunex Network is creating major excitement with over 50% of its presale tokens sold already, and early investors are already getting significant returns.

At the same time, popular meme coins, like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE, have continued their exponential growth trajectory. PEPE, for instance, has now forged a new all-time high price of $0.00002644 less than a month after shattering its previous record-high price. This latest price spike highlights the bullish momentum the meme token has been enjoying over the past few weeks. PEPE Price Overview As of this writing, the value of the Pepe token stands around $0.00002597, reflecting an impressive 21% price surge in the past 24 hours. This single-day performance is in stark contrast to how the meme coin had moved all week long. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Breakout: Charting The Uncertain Part Of ETH To $18,000 According to data from CoinGecko, the price of PEPE has soared by nearly 27% in the past seven days. However, it is worth noting that the altcoin was locked in a consolidation range around the $0.000022 region for most of the past week. On a broader timeframe, the price action of PEPE has been remarkable, with the meme coin more than doubling its value in the month of November. CoinGecko data shows that the price of the meme-inspired token has increased by more than 140% in the last 30 days. After a positive September, which saw the value of PEPE briefly cross the $0.00001 mark, investors expected the meme coin to take off. However, Pepe’s price failed to live up to expectations in the month of October. In November, the meme coin went on a parabolic run to crash its previous all-time high of $0.00001665 and set a new one at $0.00002343. This bullish momentum coincided with the positive climate of the general market, which saw Bitcoin reach successive all-time highs. As a result of its red-hot performance, various crypto exchanges, including Binance.US, have now listed the popular Pepe meme coin on Thursday, December 5. It appears that its listing on one of the largest crypto exchanges in the United States has helped renew its bullish momentum. PEPE Market Cap Hits $10 Billion According to data from CoinGecko, the market capitalization of PEPE has now surpassed the $10 billion mark. This value places the meme coin as the 25th largest cryptocurrency in the digital asset sector.

Pepe Unchained is also gaining hype as it prepares for the official token launch and claim which is scheduled to start on December 10. Meanwhile, Rollblock’s presale is giving traders the perfect entrance to the explosive altcoin market as this GambleFi project is poised for 880% gains before its official launch. Cardano expected to target $10 by early 2025 Cardano ’s price has already surged by a massive 241.72% during the last month as investors regained interest in altcoins. Since Cardano has recently announced its Hydra upgrade for more scalability and Mithril upgrade to streamline consensus, analysts expect Cardano to attract even more investors in the next few weeks. If these bullish predictions stand true, Cardano’s price could reach a new high at $10 in early 2025. Cardano is currently trading for $1.21 after an intraday decrease of 1.34%. Cardano’s volume has also dropped by 21.68% during this period which suggests low network activity. If Cardano can breach its nearest resistance at $1.38 soon, analysts believe Cardano could target a price level of $2.51 before the end of Q4. Pepe Unchained gains momentum 3 days before token launch Pepe Unchained experienced an explosive presale which raised more than $73 million in record time. Since Pepe Unchained’s presale is completely sold out, analysts are expecting a massive rally on the token’s official launch day. Pepe Unchained will be available on DEXs in 3 days which is creating a strong bullish momentum around the token. Since Pepe Unchained is giving traders 100 times faster speeds and cheaper gas fees than Ethereum, analysts expect Pepe Unchained to become a top exchange for meme coins. Since Ethereum’s price has also crossed the $4000 milestone this week, Pepe Unchained is likely to attract a variety of ETH investors to its Layer 2 blockchain. Rollblock investors prepare for 880% gains ahead of official token launch Rollblock has been on an uptrend ever since its presale launch, but it is completely dominating the ongoing altseason. As Rollblock draws closer to raising $7 million in its viral presale, analysts are expecting RBLK’s early investors to enjoy up to 880% gains even before the token’s official launch on the open market. These bullish predictions for Rollblock are fueled by a unique strategy to bring decentralized and centralized gaming experiences together on a single platform. By resolving the problem of third-party manipulation and subpar security, Rollblock is ready to take over the entire global gambling market, which is already worth more than $500 billion per annum. Since Rollblock prioritizes user security and experience, the platform has integrated Ethereum’s immutable blockchain technology to encrypt all financial information and bets. This means that traders can access more than 7,000 AI-powered games on Rollblock’s GambleFi platform and enjoy a fully secure and provably fair experience. If that wasn’t enough, then Rollblock has already announced a new betting feature that will be available on its platform soon. Through this feature, users will be able to place bets on top sports leagues around the world by using their digital assets and protecting themselves from bet manipulation. Considering these features, Rollblock’s current selling price of $0.041 per token is a massive steal for savvy traders who want to capitalize on this low entry point before the RBLK token skyrockets. Although Rollblock has just entered its ninth presale round, analysts are expecting RBLK’s limited supply to run out soon.

Discover This December 2024 Blockchain Gem,https://thecoinrise.com/did-the-eos-hype-pass-you-by-discover-this-december-2024-blockchain-gem/,"The cryptocurrency market is ablaze with innovation and growth, making headlines daily. As December 2024 unfolds, blockchain projects like EOS have left an indelible mark on the space. EOS emerged as a major contender in the blockchain arena, offering a robust ecosystem for decentralised applications (dApps). However, while its initial promise was undeniable, new opportunities have surfaced to capture the attention of investors. Qubetics ($TICS) has entered the spotlight, showcasing a clear vision to address critical challenges that other projects, including EOS, have yet to resolve. With a focus on real-world applications like Real World Asset Tokenisation, Qubetics is cementing itself as one of the best crypto investments for 2024. Let’s explore how these two projects stack up and why Qubetics is capturing significant interest. EOS: The Blockchain Pioneer That Fell Short of Expectations EOS gained notoriety for its ambitious goal of becoming the “Ethereum killer.” As a high-performance blockchain, EOS promised unparalleled scalability and transaction speeds, drawing significant attention during its record-breaking $4 billion ICO. For a time, it seemed like EOS could revolutionise the way dApps were built and operated. Developers flocked to the platform, attracted by its zero transaction fees and efficient consensus mechanism. In recent months, EOS has seen renewed interest as it works to re-establish its foothold in the market. The network’s advancements in resource allocation, such as the PowerUp model, have addressed some of its early shortcomings. Analysts predict that if EOS continues on its current trajectory, its price could surge by mid-2025, especially as more projects integrate onto its platform. However, lingering concerns around centralisation and governance have dampened its appeal. Despite its historical significance, EOS faces stiff competition from newer, more versatile platforms. Investors seeking the best crypto investments are increasingly exploring options that prioritise interoperability, scalability, and user-centric solutions. Enter Qubetics, a blockchain project designed to meet these demands. Qubetics ($TICS): Redefining Blockchain Utility Qubetics has positioned itself as a revolutionary blockchain with a focus on Real World Asset Tokenisation. This approach aims to bridge the gap between blockchain technology and practical applications, making it accessible to businesses, professionals, and individuals alike. The platform’s QubeQode IDE is an intuitive development environment that simplifies the creation and deployment of blockchain-based solutions. Real World Asset Tokenisation is a standout feature of Qubetics. Picture a manufacturing company looking to streamline its supply chain. By tokenising inventory assets, the company can track shipments in real-time, reducing inefficiencies and enhancing transparency. Similarly, a property management firm can tokenize real estate assets to facilitate fractional ownership, broadening access to investment opportunities for a global audience. For individuals, the benefits are equally transformative. Consider an artist aiming to monetise digital creations. Qubetics makes it possible to mint and sell NFTs seamlessly, removing the complexity that often deters creators. By integrating multiple blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, the platform ensures users can operate within a unified, cross-chain ecosystem. The Presale That Stand Out The ongoing $TICS presale has captured significant attention, solidifying Qubetics’ position as one of the best crypto investments for 2024. Over 288 million tokens have been sold to more than 7,500 holders, raising $5 million. With a current price of $0.0282, $TICS presents an accessible opportunity for investors ahead of an anticipated 10% price increase in the 12th stage of the presale. An investment of $1,500 in $TICS today secures approximately 53,191 tokens. By the end of the presale, when $TICS is projected to reach $0.25, the investment grows to $13,297.75. If $TICS reaches $5 post-presale, the value rises to $265,955. At $15, following the mainnet launch, this initial investment could soar to an extraordinary $797,865. These figures illustrate the transformative potential of investing in Qubetics early. Conclusion While EOS remains a significant name in the cryptocurrency world, Qubetics offers a fresh perspective and innovative solutions to some of the blockchain industry’s most pressing challenges. Its emphasis on real-world applications, combined with its presale success and ambitious roadmap, makes $TICS a standout contender for those seeking the best crypto investments. With the presale nearing completion and projections indicating substantial returns, the opportunity to invest in Qubetics at a competitive price is closing fast. For investors aiming to position themselves at the forefront of blockchain innovation, securing $TICS tokens today could be the key to unlocking remarkable growth in 2024 and beyond.

If you’re hunting for a solid investment, it’s time to stop gambling and start planning. In a market teeming with volatility, wouldn’t it be nice to back a project with groundbreaking utility and unbeatable growth potential? Look no further. Qubetics, Filecoin, and EOS are making waves this week, and it’s time to see why. Qubetics is creating hype with its innovative approach to blockchain technology, specifically its real-world asset tokenisation. Meanwhile, Filecoin and EOS continue to hold their spots as powerhouses in the crypto community, providing unique alternatives to traditional investments. But let’s be real—only one of these is poised to deliver life-changing returns. Qubetics: Transforming Blockchain with Real-World Asset Tokenisation Qubetics isn’t your average crypto project—it’s a Web3 aggregator with ambitions as big as its achievements. As of its 11th presale stage, Qubetics has raised over $5 million, sold 288 million tokens, and amassed more than 7,500 token holders. The token is priced at $0.0282 but is set to jump by 10% soon, making it the best crypto to join this week. What sets Qubetics apart is its real-world asset tokenisation feature. Imagine owning a piece of a skyscraper in New York or investing in fine art from your smartphone. Qubetics makes this possible by digitising real assets into blockchain tokens, breaking down barriers for businesses and individuals. For instance, a small business owner could sell shares of their company via tokenisation, while an artist could monetise their work without middlemen taking a hefty cut. This isn’t just theoretical. Picture a professional in London needing quick liquidity for a rare wine collection. Instead of lengthy bank negotiations, they tokenize their assets through Qubetics, selling shares globally in minutes. This level of flexibility is what makes Qubetics revolutionary. Analysts predict $TICS will surge to $0.25 by the end of the presale, delivering a whopping 871% ROI. And if the stars align post-mainnet launch, it could skyrocket to $15, a mind-blowing 58,213% ROI. Want in? This is the moment. Click here to learn more about this revolutionary project. Filecoin: The Storage Giant When it comes to decentralised storage, Filecoin is the name on everyone’s lips. Launched in 2020, this project revolutionised how data is stored and shared. Forget cloud servers; Filecoin uses blockchain technology to create a decentralised network where users can rent out storage space. The community loves its eco-friendly approach, too—Filecoin optimises unused computer storage, cutting down on waste. For years, Filecoin has been a go-to for crypto enthusiasts looking for stability. Unlike speculative tokens, Filecoin provides a service that’s always in demand. Think about it: as data becomes more valuable than oil, a decentralised storage solution is a no-brainer. It’s no wonder Filecoin has earned its reputation as a secure, innovative investment. Despite its established position, Filecoin doesn’t quite offer the explosive growth potential seen in new players like Qubetics. However, as a complementary investment, it remains a reliable choice for diversifying portfolios. EOS: The Developer’s Playground EOS burst onto the crypto scene with a mission to outdo Ethereum. Promising lightning-fast transactions and zero gas fees, it aimed to solve the scalability issues that plagued early blockchains. Today, EOS is best known for its ability to host decentralised applications (dApps) seamlessly, making it a favourite among developers. What’s kept EOS relevant is its flexibility. Developers building games, DeFi projects, or NFT platforms turn to EOS for its robust infrastructure. And the ecosystem is thriving—thousands of active dApps are proof of its resilience in a competitive market. But let’s not sugarcoat it: while EOS offers solid utility, its growth trajectory has been relatively flat compared to rising stars like Qubetics. Still, its loyal community and established use cases make it a stronghold in the crypto world. Why Qubetics Is the Best Crypto to Join This Week Filecoin and EOS are great for what they do, but neither matches the sheer ROI potential Qubetics offers. With analysts forecasting astronomical returns, it’s clear why this project is stealing the limelight. Add its groundbreaking real-world asset tokenisation to the mix, and you’ve got a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Qubetics is more than just a promising investment; it’s a movement. Whether you’re a seasoned investor or a crypto newbie, now is the time to join the 7,500+ holders who’ve already seen its potential. So, what’s next? Dive into the Qubetics presale while the price is still $0.0282, and watch your investment grow. Don’t wait for the weekend price surge—secure your $TICS tokens today. Conclusion: Your Move If you’re serious about making money in crypto, it’s time to act. Filecoin and EOS offer stability and utility, but Qubetics is the best crypto to join this week for life-changing ROI. Imagine looking back in a year and realising you hesitated at $0.0282. Don’t let this opportunity slip through your fingers. Discover the future of blockchain today. Ready to make your move?

Cosmos: The Internet of Blockchains Now, if you’re into the idea of blockchain interoperability, Cosmos is one to watch. Dubbed the “Internet of Blockchains,” Cosmos aims to solve one of the biggest challenges in the crypto space—making different blockchains work together. Cosmos achieves this by providing an ecosystem that allows individual blockchains to communicate and share data, without compromising their independence. It’s built around the Cosmos SDK, which enables developers to build custom blockchains tailored to their needs. This makes Cosmos a unique player in the blockchain space, offering scalability, security, and flexibility for a wide variety of use cases. What sets Cosmos apart is its Tendermint Core—the consensus engine that ensures transactions are processed quickly and securely, all while keeping fees low. The demand for interoperable blockchains is growing rapidly, and with the launch of projects like Cosmos Hub, this ecosystem is only going to continue expanding. If you’re looking for a crypto that offers scalability and decentralised governance, Cosmos is certainly one of the best cryptos to join today. Polygon: Scaling Ethereum to New Heights Anyone who’s used Ethereum knows that while it’s powerful, it’s also notoriously slow and costly, especially when the network gets congested. Enter Polygon, which acts as a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum, providing faster and cheaper transactions without compromising on security. Polygon’s sidechains enable Ethereum-based applications to scale seamlessly, making it a favourite among developers building decentralised finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and other dApps. The platform has gained immense traction due to its low gas fees, fast transaction speeds, and strong ecosystem. It’s no surprise that Polygon has partnered with industry giants like Microsoft, Meta, and Google Cloud. With the rapid growth of Ethereum’s ecosystem, Polygon is at the forefront of Ethereum’s scalability solutions, making it one of the best cryptos to join today if you’re looking for a coin with a solid use case and a proven track record. The future of Ethereum is likely to be closely tied to Polygon, and as the demand for scalable solutions grows, Polygon’s value is poised to follow suit. Why These Three Coins Should Be On Your Radar So why are Qubetics, Cosmos, and Polygon considered the best cryptos to join today? Each of these coins is tackling a major problem in the blockchain space, from interoperability to scalability and security. They all have solid use cases, strong communities, and innovative tech that sets them apart from the competition. Qubetics is positioning itself as a key player in cross-chain communication and decentralised finance, Cosmos is building the framework for the future of blockchain interoperability, and Polygon is scaling Ethereum to make it faster and more affordable. These coins have a lot of potential, and they’re only going to become more important as the world of blockchain and crypto continues to evolve.

The altcoin could end the year better than it started, positioning patient investors for more profit. XRP is targeting the $3 price zone, rallying from $1.88 to a new yearly high within a week.

Florida’s state officials announced that the pension fund will invest $1.85 billion worth of members’ contributions into Bitcoin to diversify its investment portfolio. Bitcoin Exposure The head of the Florida Blockchain Business Association (FBBA) announced that $1.85 billion of Florida’s pension fund is being considered for Bitcoin investment, a move backed by state leaders. FBBA president Samuel Armes said in a post that Florida will launch a “strategic Bitcoin reserve”, adding that the state has a great chance of creating the BTC reserve in the first quarter of next year. Armes believes that the Bitcoin investment would push through because of the pro-Bitcoin leaders such as the Speaker of the Florida House, Danny Perez, and Governor Ron DeSantis, saying that Perez “understands the technology very well” while DeSantis is among the most pro-Bitcoin governors in the United States. Florida is going to launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve, and here’s how we’re going to do it Florida has a very good chance of creating a strategic Bitcoin reserve this session, which starts in Q1 of 2025. Here’s what you need to know: The Speaker of the Florida House, Danny… pic.twitter.com/JJRNU1V7ZI — Samuel Armes (@samuelarmes) December 3, 2024 Pension Fund Goes Crypto Armes suggested that one way to build a Bitcoin reserve in Florida is by allowing the state pension fund to invest $1.85 billion in Bitcoin. “Leverage our $185.7B pension fund to allocate a small percentage to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation ,” Armes said in a post. The FBBA head explained that it would not be the first time that Florida will invest in digital assets using the pension fund because the state has already made investments in Bitcoin and crypto-related assets through this fund. He explained that the fourth largest pension fund in the United States can utilize 1% of its fund to establish a Bitcoin reserve, providing the retirement savings scheme an opportunity to diversify and get exposure to the growing cryptocurrency market. “The pension allocates its funds to hedge funds, and some of those hedge funds have bought various stocks in the Bitcoin space (miners, MSTR, Coinbase as examples) while also buying liquid tokens,” he added. $800 Million In Crypto Florida is not new in digital assets since it already has $800 million in crypto investments. Florida’s Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis urged other pension funds to try investing their money into Bitcoin, adding the firstborn cryptocurrency to their state’s investment portfolio. “Crypto’s not going anywhere. It will continue expanding, and we’d be foolish not to harness its opportunities there,” Patronis said as he pointed out the need to prepare for the growth of digital currencies. However, some critics voiced concerns about the state’s Bitcoin investment plans, warning about crypto’s volatility. Charles Bobrinskoy of Ariel Investments argued that Bitcoin is a “momentum-driven bubble”, adding that it has an “unstable price” and does not have real value. Meanwhile, state officials defended the move believing that Bitcoin is a “good long-term investment” and a better option to safeguard against traditional financial risks.

This surge in interest was observed when the token appeared to be struggling near a strong resistance level. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Level According to expert technical analysis, ADA has been consolidating within a tight range between $1.12 and $1.23, near a strong resistance level of $1.24, for the past week. However, the chart shows that since the beginning of November 2024, ADA has consolidated near different resistance levels four times before experiencing massive upside momentum. Source: Trading View This time, however, experts and investors are anticipating a similar upside momentum. Based on recent price action, if ADA breaks out of this consolidation and closes a daily candle above the $1.25 level, there is a strong possibility it could soar by 30% to reach $1.65 in the coming days. On the other hand, ADA’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently stands at 71, indicating that it is in an overbought zone and suggesting a potential price correction in the coming days. $121 Million in ADA Outflow From Exchanges In addition to ADA’s bullish technical analysis, whales and institutions appear to have shown strong interest and confidence in the altcoin, as reported by the on-chain analytics firm Coinglass . Data from ADA’s spot inflow/outflow revealed that exchanges have witnessed a significant outflow of $121 million in ADA during this ongoing consolidation. Source: Coinglass In the cryptocurrency context, outflow refers to the movement of assets from exchanges to wallet addresses, which is considered a bullish sign. This notable outflow also suggests a potential buying opportunity, reduces selling pressure, and indicates further upside momentum in the coming days. The combination of these bullish on-chain metrics and technical analysis indicates that bulls are currently dominating the asset and could support ADA in breaking out of the consolidation zone. Current Price Momentum At press time, ADA is trading near $1.18 and has registered a price decline of 3.5% in the past 24 hours. During the same period, its trading volume increased by 30%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors compared to the previous day.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-09 01:33:34

Table of Contents Unlock massive growth potential with Lunex Network TRON bullish momentum continues Shiba Inu surges 80% in a month Lunex Network could outshine TRON and Shiba Inu As the crypto market heats up, top altcoins including Shiba Inu (SHIB) and TRON (TRX) , are seeing incredible rises. While Shiba Inu has had an incredible 80% rise over the past month, suggesting a probable breakthrough, TRON’s price swung to a new all-time high prior to a 20% decline. Among the hype, though, one project— Lunex Network (LNEX) —is taking center stage with its creative features and incredible presale performance. Lunex Network is positioned as a game-changer in decentralized finance with over 2 billion presale tokens sold in just weeks. Read on to discover why analysts predict significant expansion for Lunex Network.

Lunex Network gives investors peace of mind that top-notch security mechanisms cover their investments. Highly reputable security company SolidProof has extensively examined Lunex Network to verify that its smart contracts are free from major flaws. Lunex Network appeals to traders who respect privacy and wish to bypass the intrusive Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures sometimes seen in conventional DEXs because of its emphasis on strong security and commitment to user anonymity. Irrespective of your level of experience with investing, Lunex Network provides a safe, simple-to-use platform for trading over 50,000 coins over more than 40 blockchains with some of the lowest fees in the market. LNEX is currently merely $0.0036 during its presale, well below its expected launch price of $0.0216; so investors have a rare chance to engage early. Those who bought the token at its original $0.0012 have already experienced an amazing 200% ROI; now is the ideal moment to grab the chance and be a part of Lunex Network’s growth as analysts project an additional 300% rally before the presale finishes. TRON bullish momentum continues With an amazing 66% increase over the previous week, the TRON price has been on an incredible upward path. Driven by a steady pattern of higher highs and higher lows, this great momentum has propelled the TRON price to a new ATH of $0.44. But the TRON price chart shows that the altcoin has just dropped by more than 20% from its ATH to less than $0.35. The price of TRON is still testing the vital $0.33 support zone; it has shown indications of rejection, suggesting a possible bullish bounce. Should the trend carry on, TRON (TRX) might shortly retest its ATH, hence initiating another notable surge. With an amazing 105% increase over the previous month, TRON (TRX) keeps displaying great upward potential. The MACD and Moving Averages among other technical indicators are clearly showing buy signals on the TRON price chart, thereby supporting the altcoin’s positive projection. These encouraging signals together with the current price action point to TRON (TRX) perhaps soon pushing past its ATH and rallying to the long-awaited $1 this cycle. Shiba Inu surges 80% in a month Showing incredible positive momentum lately, the Shiba Inu price jumped by nearly 25% in one week. Given its climb follows a period of consolidation between $0.000033 and $0.000026, the Shiba Inu price might be preparing itself for a bigger breakout. Recovering about 80% over the past month, Shiba Inu has given investors hope. On the Shiba Inu price chart, strong technical indicators including the MACD and Moving Averages flash buy signals pointing to potential continuous upward price movement of the altcoin. Notwithstanding recent increases, Shiba Inu is currently well below its all-time high of $0.000088, which was reached in 2021. Still, the positive price movement on the Shiba Inu price chart and rising market sentiment suggest that a new ATH may be within reach in the current cycle. Many analysts believe that Shiba Inu (SHIB) could soon break out from its present range based on strong buy indications on the charts, so generating fresh chances for investors. Lunex Network could outshine TRON and Shiba Inu While TRON and Shiba Inu produce waves with their bullish price movements, Lunex Network is set to redefine decentralized trading with its revolutionary features, unmatched cross-chain compatibility, and dedication to user protection and anonymity. With over two billion tokens sold already, the presale frenzy reveals the confidence of investors in the project.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA.

Garlinghouse criticized the SEC’s approach, stating that it was a key reason why Ripple and two other companies formed the industry super PAC, FairShake, to fight back against what he described as a “war on crypto.” He suggested that FairShake might not have existed if the SEC had a different chairman than Gary Gensler. When an SEC spokesperson said that the amount spent by the crypto industry on legal defense is minimal compared to the losses investors have faced due to frauds and market failures, Garlinghouse revealed Ripple’s financial contributions, revealing that the company has spent over $150 million fighting the SEC’s stance on XRP. He said that Ripple argues XRP should not be treated like a stock and be subject to the same registration and disclosure requirements. Garlinghouse stressed that Ripple is not seeking to be deregulated but instead asking for clear regulations from Congress to address the unique nature of digital assets. “I went to Harvard Business School. I think I’m reasonably intelligent about something like, “What is a security?” So never once had I considered the possibility– that, “Okay, maybe XRP’s a security. We haven’t been asking to be deregulated. We’ve been asking to be regulated. So we have been saying, “Hey, look, just give us clear rules of the road,” he said. XRP Price Reacts : XRP, Ripple’s cryptocurrency, is currently experiencing a surge, approaching the $2.60 mark. At the time of writing, it was trading at $2.55, a 4.5% increase. Investors are optimistic about the future of the crypto industry, especially under a potential Trump presidency, as Ripple’s blockchain-based payment system continues to gain attention.

As we dive into the final chapter of the memecoin trilogy, the stakes are higher than ever. Both tokens ride Dogecoin’s ($ DOGE ) coattails while carving unique paths in a volatile crypto jungle, fueled by the constant flux of hype, community strength, and speculative mania. Adding fuel to the speculative fire is a shaky macro backdrop: the U.S. CPI data unveiling on Wednesday, potentially steering the Fed’s rate decisions, and a still-indecisive Ethereum/BTC ($ETH/BTC ) pair unable to close above 0.04. Meanwhile, Total2 (altcoin market cap) flirts with 2021’s bull-run levels, signaling an overheated environment and perhaps a looming 25% correction for altcoins. Will Shiba Inu, a project born from Ethereum’s ecosystem with Vitalik Buterin's accidental ""blessing,"" and Floki, the people's Viking dog, survive the storm? Let’s dig in. Fundamentals: Shiba Inu vs. Floki – Community Power and Ecosystem Ambitions Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Born as an experiment in decentralized community-building, Shiba Inu exploded onto the scene with its adorable mascot and cult-like investor following. Anchored in Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin once received 50% of the SHIB supply, burned most of it, and in doing so, became its ""reluctant godfather."" As a meme coin with utility aspirations, SHIB has expanded into a multifaceted ecosystem. Key Strengths: The ecosystem boasts the ShibaSwap DEX, plans for an algorithmic stablecoin (SHI), and SHIB: The Metaverse, where users can explore and monetize virtual land. Its DeFi angle keeps it relevant beyond mere speculation. Tokenomics: With a total supply of 589 trillion tokens, $SHIB battles inflationary challenges. However, its whale holdings at 59% indicate continued confidence from big players. Challenge: Its massive supply makes sustained price growth difficult, necessitating robust utility adoption to support its valuation. Floki ($FLOKI) Inspired by Elon Musk’s dog and backed by a strong social media presence, Floki combines memecoin charisma with tangible utility ambitions. The self-proclaimed “people’s cryptocurrency” blends narrative and community power with aggressive branding. Key Strengths: With an NFT gaming metaverse (Valhalla), a DeFi suite (FlokiFi), and partnerships with Chainlink, Floki’s ecosystem promises substance beyond hype. Its FlokiFi Locker for digital assets strengthens its DeFi offering. Tokenomics: A tighter circulating supply of 9.6 trillion gives $FLOKI a structural advantage over $SHIB. However, whale dominance at 72% highlights risks of sudden sell-offs. Challenge: Floki’s reliance on hype and retail speculation makes it vulnerable in bearish or flat market conditions. Key Comparison Takeaway: SHIB offers a broader ecosystem with diversified ambitions, but FLOKI’s tighter tokenomics could lead to stronger short-term performance in bullish environments. Technical Analysis: SHIB and FLOKI – Bullish or Barking Up the Wrong Tree? Shiba Inu ($SHIB) Since its summer bottom, SHIB has been in a healthy uptrend, confirming bullish momentum with a multi-month Cup & Handle breakout above $0.0000267. However, the breakout came on low volume, raising the probability of a pullback to this level or even deeper into the Golden Pocket (Fib 0.618) at $0.0000228. Key Targets: The Cup & Handle target sits at $0.0000415, but the $0.0000350 resistance zone, a critical level from March and 2021’s bull run, is the true test. A break above $0.0000350 could open the door for an attack on SHIB’s ATH of $0.00008845, a distant but enticing possibility. Momentum Check: Rising moving averages provide dynamic support, signaling sustained bullish momentum. Strategies: Accumulate during dips to $0.0000228–$0.0000267 for a discounted entry. Breakout traders should monitor volume closely at $0.0000350 to avoid potential bull traps. For trend-followers, buying now and riding the broader momentum with trailing stop-losses is an option. Floki ($FLOKI) FLOKI has shown a similar Cup & Handle breakout, with its next critical resistance at $0.0003. However, low volume compared to March highs suggests retail participation remains subdued, increasing the likelihood of pullbacks to the accumulation range of $0.00022–$0.00025. Key Targets: A confirmed breakout above $0.0003 sets the stage for a move to the $0.0004 Cup & Handle target. Beyond this, the ATH of $0.00035 from June looms as the next critical level. Momentum Check: A bullish market structure flip is confirmed, but sustained volume is crucial to maintain the rally. Strategies: Patient traders can accumulate within $0.00022–$0.00025, aligning with Fib retracements. Breakout traders must ensure volume spikes above $0.0003 to validate continuation toward $0.0004. Defensive players should place stink orders near $0.00018 for potential deep corrections. 3 Key Takeaways from the Comparison: SHIB’s Broader Resistance Levels: $SHIB faces significant overhead at $0.0000350 before targeting its ATH, while FLOKI’s path to $0.0004 appears less obstructed. Volume Signals Caution: Both tokens suffer from weak breakout volumes, necessitating patience and vigilance for any sustained moves. Accumulation Zones: FLOKI’s tighter range ($0.00022–$0.00025) offers clearer buy signals, while SHIB’s support zones ($0.0000228–$0.0000267) align with broader market trends. The Verdict: Which Dog Has the Sharpest Bite? When comparing these two meme-heavyweights, SHIB offers a more robust long-term narrative with its expanding ecosystem, while FLOKI thrives on short-term hype and retail-driven momentum. If you’re chasing immediate upside, FLOKI’s tighter tokenomics and aggressive branding might appeal to you. However, SHIB’s integration into the Ethereum ecosystem and ambitious roadmap for DeFi and metaverse adoption make it a safer bet for long-term believers. But remember: memecoins are speculative by nature. With Total2 signaling a potential blow-off top, volatility is the name of the game. Smart investors should keep stop-losses tight, accumulate during dips, and avoid FOMO-fueled breakouts without volume confirmation. In this crowded dog park, the real winners are the ones who plan their exits just as carefully as their entries. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While Dogecoin price remains the leading player in the meme coin space, PropiChain is emerging as a strong competitor. With its innovative platform and robust market position, PropiChain is projected to reach $1, offering potential gains of up to 10,000x by 2025. This projection positions PropiChain as a compelling alternative, possibly delivering greater returns than Dogecoin for investors Dogecoin Price Race to $2: Is the Bullish Trend Sustainable? In November 2024, Dogecoin price rose by over 165%, sparking discussions about its potential to reach $2. Currently trading at around $0.4332, the Dogecoin price has steadily increased. It experienced a 4.71% price gain in the last 24 hours, reflecting growing market demand. However, Dogecoin price hitting $2 remains a significant challenge. Achieving this would require dramatic market growth and increased adoption. Despite its popularity as a meme coin, Dogecoin needs strong institutional backing or substantial use cases. Regulatory risks, market competition, and inflationary tokenomics also limit its capacity to sustain a massive price increase shortly​. PropiChain Targets $1 from $0.004: Breaking Down the 10,000x Potential PropiChain (PCHAIN) , currently in its presale phase, is gaining attention for its ability to simplify real estate investment through blockchain technology. With tokens priced at $0.004, projections suggest it could reach $1, offering a 10,000x return for early adopters. This surge is rooted in PropiChain’s innovative use of tokenization and artificial intelligence to make real estate accessible and efficient. Fractionalized NFTs form a core part of PropiChain’s offering, allowing investors to purchase small portions of high-value properties. This lowers traditional entry barriers and democratizes real estate investment. By leveraging artificial intelligence, the platform provides detailed market analyses, asset valuations, and tailored investment suggestions. Additionally, PropiChain incorporates metaverse features, enabling users to virtually explore properties and make informed decisions, eliminating geographical limitations. PropiChain also automates transactions, enhancing efficiency in leasing and rental payments. This functionality, combined with its user-centric approach and CoinMarketCap listing, positions it as a game-changer in the global real estate market. Analysts highlight that capturing even a small fraction of this market could result in significant growth. Early investors in PropiChain are projected to see massive returns as the token advances to its next stage at $0.032, with further growth anticipated as the platform scales. This positions PropiChain as an attractive long-term investment option, especially considering the rising Dogecoin price spurring the crypto community. PropiChain’s ability to address accessibility and efficiency in real estate investment makes it a major contender. With its unique value proposition, it could outpace meme coins like Dogecoin. Propichain’s (PCHAIN) ’s Race to $1: A Game-Changer in Real Estate Tokenomics Propichain (PCHAIN) is set to revolutionize real estate investing with its innovative platform. As part of a $300 trillion real estate market projected to grow significantly over the next decade. Backed by a BlockAudit security review, PCHAIN offers trust, confidence, security, transparency, and compliance as the project scales, attracting investors eager to capitalize on its growth. The presale launched at $0.004, with projections suggesting a 10,000x return when it lists at $0.032. Analysts estimate this could translate to even more substantial gains in the long term, with a $1,000 investment potentially growing to $100,000. These figures highlight PCHAIN’s explosive potential, reinforced by its strategic focus on tokenized real estate investments. The current presale phase offers a unique opportunity for early adopters seeking to maximize returns. Click the links below to learn more and take advantage of this innovative investment today.

VCs May Start Aggressive Selling Hartmann noted that traders’ optimism might soon face reality. “Traders may stay irrational, but we are at the point where teams and VCs start clipping more aggressively,” he explained. He warned of significant corrections, saying, “Once momentum tips, we’ll have to get that lever out, and see some murder wicks.” Hartmann added that altcoins’ funding rates are now “north” of 100% annualized, with recent price movements driven largely by perpetual traders rather than spot market activity. “Leg down will be ugly,” he concluded. Top Gainers and Historical Volatility Among the top 100 cryptocurrencies, Hedera (HBAR) led with a 99.31% gain since Nov. 1, followed by IOTA (79.61%) and JasmyCoin (72.47%), according to CoinMarketCap data. However, historical patterns suggest caution. In late 2021, Solana (SOL) plummeted 64% within two months after a record high, while XRP shed 51% in the same period. Diverging Trader Sentiments Despite Hartmann’s warnings, some traders remain bullish. Crypto trader MilkyBull Crypto suggested on Dec. 6 that altcoin season could extend into March, noting, “Lasts about 90 days.” Similarly, trader Sensei declared, “Altseason has just started,” to his 72,900 followers. Key Metrics to Watch Bitcoin dominance, often seen as an altcoin season indicator, stood at 55.11% at publication, down 7.88% over the past month, per TradingView.

XRP is currently holding above its 2021 breakout point and the price has stayed above $1.96, which is an important level. Right now, XRP is moving between the all-time high of $1.96 and the 2021 high of around $3.30. These levels create support and resistance zones. Wave Structure and Price Predictions XRP is still in a larger price structure that suggests it’s in the third wave of a bigger cycle. After the bottom in June 2022, the market has already seen waves 1 and 2. Now, it is in wave 3, and this could push the price higher in the coming months. The next target is between $5 and $10, though it’s too early to predict this accurately until the price tops in wave 3 and bottoms in wave 4. Key Support Levels to Watch The main support for XRP is currently between $1.79 and $1.96. If the price falls below these levels, the next key area of support is the orange zone, signaling a possible larger correction. However, as of now, the correction appears to be part of the third wave in a larger uptrend, so the outlook remains positive. Rapid Price Action and Potential Pullbacks The third wave has already extended to the upside, which is not unusual, but the speed of the rise is faster than typical, meaning pullbacks could be stronger. This rapid price action can lead to short-term corrections, but as long as the support levels hold, XRP should continue to rise in the longer term. Small Time Frame Correction On the smaller time frame, XRP is currently correcting, which could be a sideways movement or a counter-trend move. It’s possible we are seeing a triangle pattern forming, which often leads to a breakout. Triangles are common in crypto markets, and this could be a signal for the next price movement.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-09 02:21:12

The price is trading below $100,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average. There is a key bullish trend line forming with support at $99,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken). The pair could regain momentum if it closes above the $101,250 resistance zone. Bitcoin Price Holds Key Support Bitcoin price started another increase above the $95,500 resistance zone. BTC was able to clear the $96,500 and $98,000 resistance levels. The bulls were able to push the price above the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $104,015 swing high to the $91,800 low. However, the bears seem to be active above the $101,000 level. They protected a close above the $102,000 level. The price struggled to settle above the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $104,015 swing high to the $91,800 low. Bitcoin price is now trading below $100,500 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average . There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $99,000 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. On the upside, the price could face resistance near the $100,000 level. The first key resistance is near the $101,250 level. A clear move above the $101,250 resistance might send the price higher. The next key resistance could be $102,000. A close above the $102,000 resistance might send the price further higher. In the stated case, the price could rise and test the $104,200 resistance level. Any more gains might send the price toward the $108,000 level. Another Drop In BTC? If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $101,250 resistance zone, it could start another downside correction. Immediate support on the downside is near the $99,000 level and the trend line. The first major support is near the $97,800 level. The next support is now near the $96,000 zone. Any more losses might send the price toward the $95,000 support in the near term. Technical indicators: Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bullish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $99,000, followed by $97,800.

Ripple, alongside two other crypto firms, funneled $144 million into super PACs supporting pro-crypto candidates across party lines. These efforts weren’t subtle, and the results were loud. Of the 62 congressional candidates backed by the industry (29 Republicans and 33 Democrats) 85% walked away with victories. “Do I think we had an impact? Absolutely,” he said. Crypto cash and political clout Ripple’s role in the 2024 election cycle was a calculated move, with one-third of all corporate donations to super PACs coming from the crypto industry. The stakes were high, and Brad, along with other industry elites, knew that they needed to seize control of the Congress. Margaret Brennan, the interviewer, pressed him on whether Ripple’s financial contributions amounted to “buying elections.” Brad dismissed the notion, arguing that voters ultimately made their choices, but he didn’t deny Ripple’s heavy hand in funding candidates’ campaigns. “We educated voters, as many industries do, about candidates,” he said, while also acknowledging, “We absolutely supercharged candidates with money.” President Donald Trump’s Cabinet picks signaled a confirmation of his expected crypto-friendly approach. Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent has said that “Crypto is about freedom and the crypto economy is here to stay.” The president also tapped Paul Atkins, a former SEC commissioner with ties to crypto companies, to replace outgoing Chair Gary Gensler at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He has also appointed the first-ever White House Crypto czar. The SEC’s hostile crackdown and Ripple’s fightback Ripple’s battles with the SEC are nothing new. The agency filed a lawsuit against Ripple in December 2020, alleging that XRP was an unregistered security. Brad called the lawsuit a symptom of a broader “war on crypto,” a conflict he says was fueled by Gensler’s leadership. “Why did these companies come together and organize Fairshake? It’s a reaction to a war on crypto,” Brad said, referring to the super PAC Ripple helped create. It is now the largest crypto super PAC. Brad emphasized that Ripple has spent over $150 million fighting the SEC in court, arguing that XRP doesn’t fit the traditional definition of a security. “I think I’m reasonably intelligent about something like, ‘What is a security?’ Never once had I considered the possibility that XRP is a security,” he said. Not everyone agrees with Ripple’s position. John Reed Stark, a former SEC official, argued that courts have consistently ruled in favor of the SEC, describing the designation of XRP as a security as “an obvious call.” Stark, who owns no crypto and has never worked for the industry, doubled down on his critique, calling crypto “a scourge” and pointing out its use in crimes like ransomware, sanctions evasion, and money laundering. “North Korea is financing their nuclear weapons program using crypto,” he has said. Brad dismissed such broad-brush accusations, pointing out that bad actors exist in every industry. “Bernie Madoff went to jail. That doesn’t make every hedge fund manager a criminal,” he countered, adding that Ripple is one of the “good actors,” working with financial institutions to improve cross-border payments using XRP. “We’ve been asking to be regulated. Just give us clear rules of the road,” Brad said. Another thing Trump also wants to do is move the regulatory authority of crypto entirely from the SEC to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), an agency with a reputation for being more industry-friendly. But Stark said that the lighter regulatory touch will not adequately protect investors. “The SEC’s mandate is investor protection. The CFTC is about market integrity. It’s a much easier regulatory regime for the crypto industry,” he said. XRP’s resurgence and Ripple’s next moves Since Election Day, XRP’s value has surged over 300%, reinforcing its position as a market leader. Ripple hasn’t wasted time capitalizing on this momentum. Brad recently announced an additional $25 million contribution to Fairshake, bringing its total funds to $103 million. The super PAC is already preparing for the next election cycle, ensuring that pro-crypto candidates remain well-funded. Despite the growing acceptance of crypto, skeptics like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and legendary investor Warren Buffet continue to dismiss it as a “pet rock” and “rat poison squared.” Brad brushed off such criticism, pointing to the success of the Bitcoin ETF, which launched earlier this year and attracted record-breaking investments. “It attracted more assets in less time than any ETF ever before.” At press time, XRP was worth $2.50, down by 3.5% in the past twenty-four hours.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-09 03:03:02

Qubetics Offers a Path to Redemption,https://thecoinrise.com/left-behind-in-the-sui-surge-qubetics-offers-a-path-to-redemption/,"The crypto space is buzzing with activity, and SUI has been at the centre of it all. This Layer 1 blockchain took the market by storm with its explosive rally, capturing the imagination of investors worldwide. Those who entered the SUI ecosystem early have likely seen exponential gains, but not everyone had the chance to capitalise on its meteoric rise. Fortunately, a new opportunity has emerged. Qubetics ($TICS) offers a fresh perspective and innovative features, positioning itself as the best crypto for 2024. At the heart of its success is a game-changing application: its multi-chain wallet. Designed to revolutionise asset management across blockchains, Qubetics promises to fill the gaps left by its predecessors and chart a new course in the blockchain landscape. SUI: The Trailblazer That Set the Stage SUI earned its stripes as a next-generation blockchain optimised for decentralised applications (dApps) and digital asset creation. Boasting remarkable scalability and efficiency, the network’s innovative consensus mechanism supports high transaction throughput with minimal energy consumption. It’s no wonder SUI captured the attention of developers and enterprises looking for robust solutions. Over the past year, SUI has gained significant traction, with numerous dApps integrating onto its platform and a growing ecosystem of DeFi projects. Analysts project its price could climb further, especially as more use cases emerge within its ecosystem. However, despite its success, SUI is not without limitations. Cross-chain compatibility remains a challenge, leaving users juggling multiple wallets and platforms to manage their assets. SUI’s rally was undoubtedly a highlight of 2024, but it’s clear that the blockchain industry needs solutions that bridge the gap between networks. This is where Qubetics steps in to redefine the playing field. Qubetics ($TICS): Multi-Chain Wallet Innovation Qubetics has introduced a multi-chain wallet that reimagines how users interact with blockchain networks . By integrating Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and other major chains into a single interface, the wallet streamlines asset management like never before. For users frustrated by the fragmentation of the crypto ecosystem, Qubetics delivers a seamless, unified experience. Imagine a freelancer who receives payments in various cryptocurrencies. Switching between wallets and converting tokens often leads to wasted time and unnecessary fees. Qubetics’ multi-chain wallet simplifies this process, consolidating transactions into one platform with real-time analytics and cross-chain functionality . This isn’t just convenient—it’s transformative. For enterprises, the wallet’s potential is equally compelling. A global retailer managing supply chain payments across multiple jurisdictions can leverage Qubetics to settle transactions efficiently, reducing operational overhead. Meanwhile, an NFT creator can mint, store, and sell tokens on different blockchains without leaving the platform. Market Confidence and Investment Potential The presale performance of $TICS underscores the market’s confidence in Qubetics. Over 288 million tokens have been sold to more than 7,500 holders, raising $5 million. At $0.0282 per token, investors are entering at an attractive price point before an anticipated 10% surge in the next stage. Analysts predict $TICS could reach $0.25 by the end of the presale, translating to a 783% ROI. Long-term forecasts place $TICS at $1 post-presale and $15 following the mainnet launch, making it one of the best crypto for 2024. A $100 investment in $TICS today secures approximately 3,546 tokens. If the token reaches $0.25, that investment grows to $886.50. At $5, it becomes $17,730, and at $15, a staggering $53,190. These projections illustrate the significant upside potential for early adopters. Conclusion While SUI set a high bar with its innovative approach and successful rally, Qubetics emerges as a blockchain project with the tools and vision to build on that momentum. Its multi-chain wallet is not just a solution to existing pain points; it’s a forward-thinking application that redefines how users and businesses interact with cryptocurrencies. For those seeking the best crypto for 2024 , Qubetics offers more than just a token—it provides a pathway to a streamlined, efficient, and interoperable blockchain experience. With its presale nearing completion and projections pointing to extraordinary returns, the time to act is now. Secure your $TICS tokens and position yourself for the future of blockchain innovation.

Following Bitcoin’s milestone, the crypto-focused X account Autism Capital asked Bukele to disclose El Salvador’s Bitcoin portfolio to “dunk on the haters.” In response, Bukele posted the portfolio, revealing the nation’s nearly $270 million investment in Bitcoin. The portfolio confirms that no Bitcoin has been sold, and unrealized gains now exceed $333 million, a significant validation of the country’s strategy. El Salvador’s Bitcoin Journey El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender on September 7, 2021, when its Bitcoin Law came into effect. A day prior, the government made its inaugural purchase of 200 BTC. Since then, the country has continued accumulating Bitcoin. On November 17, 2022, Bukele announced a dollar-cost averaging (DCA) strategy, committing to purchasing one Bitcoin daily. According to Nayib Tracker, a platform monitoring El Salvador’s Bitcoin holdings, the country currently owns 6,180 BTC, with an average purchase price of $44,739.88. Based on current prices, the portfolio has gained approximately 122%. Beyond financial gains, El Salvador has also seen increased tourism and international recognition since adopting Bitcoin. IMF Urges El Salvador to Reconsider Despite the reported benefits, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly advised El Salvador to scale back its Bitcoin initiatives. On January 25, 2022, the IMF urged the country to stop recognizing Bitcoin as legal tender, citing financial stability risks but acknowledging its potential for financial inclusion. The IMF renewed its concerns on October 3, 2024, with communications director Julie Kozack recommending the country narrow the Bitcoin Law’s scope and limit public sector exposure to Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-09 03:25:00

Atkins, who served under President George W. Bush, will replace outgoing SEC Chair Gary Gensler. After this big announcement, the financial community has been buzzing about the SEC’s alleged settlement offer to Ripple Labs and legal experts are split on whether the SEC will appeal the ruling or ask for more time A user asked former SEC employee Marc Fagel about the likelihood of the SEC dropping the Ripple lawsuit, especially since it’s at the second court of appeals. Fagel responded, saying that while the SEC could technically dismiss the appeal, it’s difficult to predict. “The SEC could presumably dismiss the appeal. It’s hard to predict; Atkins is no fan of crypto enforcement actions, but he also respects the SEC and its mission and might be reluctant to take such a largely unprecedented, purely political step,” he wrote. He explained that new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins is not a fan of crypto enforcement actions but also respects the SEC’s role. As a result, he may be hesitant to make such a politically charged decision. What’s Next? The outcome of Donald Trump’s election could have an impact on crypto regulation. Experts believe that under Trump’s leadership, the SEC may adopt a different approach to overseeing cryptocurrency. This could lead to more crypto-friendly policies and less aggressive enforcement. Furthermore, Trump has appointed David Sacks, a venture capitalist and co-host of the All-In Podcast, as the “White House AI & Crypto Czar.” Sacks, who is also the former COO of PayPal, is known for supporting Ripple in its ongoing lawsuit with the US SEC.

Enter Lightchain Protocol AI , a revolutionary blockchain merging artificial intelligence (AI) with DeFi to create unparalleled opportunities for developers, investors, and innovators alike. With groundbreaking features like the Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism and cutting-edge AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) , Lightchain is poised to reshape the decentralized landscape. Curious why Ethereum whales are paying attention? Read on to uncover what makes Lightchain the hottest topic in DeFi circles. What Is Lightchain Protocol AI? Lightchain Protocol AI isn’t just another blockchain; it’s a first-of-its-kind ecosystem that combines the power of blockchain and AI to create scalable, privacy-focused, and highly efficient decentralized solutions. Key features like PoI and AIVM redefine traditional approaches to blockchain governance, dApp development, and decentralized AI computing. What truly sets Lightchain apart is its focus on meaningful contributions . Instead of merely rewarding holding power (Proof of Stake) or computational effort (Proof of Work), PoI incentivizes nodes to perform valuable AI computations . This groundbreaking approach minimizes wasted resources while securing the network. Why Are Ethereum Whales Interested? Ethereum whales—the major movers and shakers of the crypto ecosystem—know how to spot value early in up-and-coming projects. Here’s why Lightchain has captured their interest: Revolutionary Consensus Mechanism The Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus is unlike anything the blockchain world has seen before . By focusing on AI-driven computations, it not only secures the network but actively contributes to AI development. Whales see this as a way to create both utility and value for the blockchain ecosystem. Scalable and Efficient Ethereum, while powerful, has often struggled with scalability issues. Lightchain’s architecture emphasizes speed, scalability, and efficiency , solving the congestion and high gas fee challenges prevalent in traditional DeFi ecosystems. High Developer Appeal The AI Virtual Machine (AIVM) empowers developers to build smarter, data-driven dApps. This focus on innovation offers endless possibilities for new use cases—from predictive analytics in DeFi trading to AI-enhanced NFTs.

Dogecoin (DOGE) has been one of the top performers in the ongoing market-wide upsurge that began on the back of the Donald Trump victory on Nov. 5. For context, DOGE traded at a price of $0.1595 on Nov. 3. However, as developments around the U.S. election gained steam, it spiked, closing November at $0.4416, a 164% gain.Amid the bullish price momentum, several entities have projected new timelines for Dogecoin to claim some lofty targets. Previously, analysts predicted DOGE to claim ambitious heights. For instance, in October, Ali Martinez predicted a Dogecoin rally to $10. Meanwhile, market watcher Trader Tardigrade expects a possible run to $20.Interestingly, Trader Tardigrade also presented a more audacious Dogecoin target in early October, when the token had not witnessed its recent uptrend. The analyst projected that DOGE could rally to a peak of $30 before facing correction.New Projected Timelines for Dogecoin to Hit $10, $20 and $30Amid its latest 164% spike, some market speculators have adjusted the possible timelines for Dogecoin to reach these targets. For instance, analysts at the crypto exchange platform Changelly believe that DOGE has immense potential. However, they do not expect it to reach $1 until January 2030. Dogecoin Price Predictions Changelly Dogecoin Price Predictions | Changelly Further, these analysts see Dogecoin rising gradually as the year's progress. According to them, Dogecoin could reach the $10 price in January 2040 and further grow exponentially to $20 in March 2040, two months later. They then expect DOGE to hit $30 a month after in April 2040.ChatGPT and Grok AI RespondMeanwhile, we queried AI chatbots ChatGPT and Grok on potential timelines for Dogecoin to reach the $10, $20 and $30 price levels. Notably, ChatGPT predicts Dogecoin could reach $10 by 2029–2034 under optimistic scenarios. According to ChatGPT, this requires rapid adoption, institutional support, and integration into global payments.However, the chatbot’s moderate timeline for DOGE to reach $10 extends to 2035–2040, while it deems the price target unlikely under pessimistic conditions. This pessimistic scenario could be the case without massive changes to its supply mechanics.For $20, ChatGPT suggests an optimistic timeline of 2035–2040, depending on revolutionary use cases and supply control. A moderate projection spans 2040–2045, while the pessimistic timeline places it beyond 2045.Interestingly, ChatGPT forecasts an optimistic timeline of 2045–2055 for DOGE to reach $30, requiring Dogecoin to dominate global finance. The chatbot presents a moderate timeline beyond 2055 but believes the $30 price target is unlikely in a pessimistic scenario.Nonetheless, Grok provides alternative views. For $10, sources suggest timelines ranging from 2025 to 2044. Predictions for $20 and $30 are sparse and often deemed improbable without extraordinary conditions. Grok references some analysts projecting speculative peaks but fails to provide detailed timelines.",Market|Dogecoin Price Prediction|Latest Dogecoin (DOGE) News Today,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2024-12-09 04:34:10

That’s the big idea Amazon shareholders are pitching right now. They want the company to put 5% of its assets into the cryptocurrency. Why? They see it as a way to protect against inflation and, honestly, just make better use of Amazon’s massive reserves. But, is this as smart as they think? Or is it one of those ideas that sounds good until it’s not? Let’s figure it out. Why Bitcoin? Let’s Look at the Numbers Okay, here’s the thing. Bitcoin’s been on a wild ride lately. It grew by 131% in 2024 alone. Over the last five years, it’s jumped more than 1,200%. That’s a lot, right? Now compare that to corporate bonds or cash—what Amazon usually keeps in reserve. Those are safe, sure, but they don’t grow like this. That’s why the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), the group behind the proposal , is pushing hard. They’re basically saying, “Hey, Amazon, don’t sit on this. Even a 5% Bitcoin allocation could be huge for long-term value.” The National Center for Public Policy Research has submitted the attached shareholder proposal to https://t.co/Lve7Kg1nVI , Inc. for consideration at the 2025 annual shareholder meeting. Shareholders request that the Board assess adding #Bitcoin to the Company’s Treasury pic.twitter.com/lsgHC0aGrt — Tim Kotzman (@TimKotzman) December 8, 2024 And they’re not wrong. Companies like Tesla and MicroStrategy have already gone for it, and they’ve seen some solid gains. Even Microsoft shareholders will vote on a similar idea soon. It’s becoming a trend. But not everyone’s convinced—yet. As institutions increasingly adopt Bitcoin, its market potential continues to grow—read our Bitcoin price prediction for expert insights on what’s next! What If Amazon Goes for It? If Amazon says yes, it won’t be instant. First, the board has to agree to let shareholders vote on the proposal in April 2025. And even then, they’d probably start small. Nobody’s talking about going all-in on Bitcoin here. Source: NCPPR Still, this could shake things up. Some people, like Binance’s former CEO Changpeng Zhao, are even speculating that Amazon might take it a step further—like accepting Bitcoin payments. That sounds futuristic, right? Imagine buying your next Kindle or headphones with Bitcoin. But, honestly, there’s no guarantee Amazon will go for it. They haven’t said a word about this idea publicly. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

Here’s where it gets interesting. Big players like Vanguard and BlackRock—two of Amazon’s top shareholders—will have a lot of influence on this. If they’re on board, this could actually happen. But either way, this debate shows how much things are changing. Inflation is making traditional investments less appealing. Companies are looking at Bitcoin , even if it’s risky, as a possible answer. It’s not perfect, but maybe that’s the point. The world of corporate finance isn’t standing still anymore.

At the time of writing, ADA is trading slightly below the $1 mark and has drifted into the red zone. However, the coin has gained more than 12 percent in the last one week. Currently, there is support between $0.83 and $1.16, with the most relevant support levels being $0.93 and $0.83. A drop below $0.83 would shift towards a larger correction taking place. At the moment, the market is primarily showing a sideways consolidation, and this is being respected by the micro support levels we’ve outlined. Key Levels to Watch If ADA breaks below the $1.11 level, which is also a Fibonacci support level, it would make it more likely that the market is forming a larger wave. For now, ADA remains in a consolidation phase, and while the price action might seem a bit dull, it could soon break out of this sideways movement. The most recent low of $1.16 from December 5th could be the key level to watch. Below that, the next support levels would be between $0.83 and $1.16, though it’s not guaranteed that ADA will dip all the way down to $0.83. Instead, if this assumption holds, the support may be found in the upper half of that range. With Cardano’s price showing signs of consolidation and exciting market opportunities ahead, read our long-term Cardano price prediction for insights on its future potential! Next Target After a Breakout The primary level to watch for an upside breakout is the trendline forming the triangle pattern. If ADA breaks above the $1.24–$1.25 range, this would signal a potential upward breakout. The next target after that would be the $1.42 level, with $1.72 as an important target. However, this scenario is contingent on whether the market confirms that we are indeed in a triangle pattern, as this is still not fully confirmed. .article_register_shortcode { padding: 18px 24px; border-radius: 8px; display: flex; align-items: center; margin: 6px 0 22px; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1) 0%, rgba(0, 82, 204, 0.1) 100%); } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { color: #000000; font-weight: 600; font-size: 20px; line-height: 22px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 span { color: #0052CC; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-weight: 400; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; color: #171717B2; margin-top: 4px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body{ padding-right: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: right; } .article_register_shortcode .primary-button img{ vertical-align: middle; } @media (min-width: 581px) and (max-width: 991px) { .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { margin-bottom: 0; } } @media (max-width: 580px) { .article_register_shortcode { display: block; padding: 20px; } .article_register_shortcode img { max-width: 50px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body h5 { font-size: 16px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body { margin-left: 0px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-body p { font-size: 13px; line-height: 20px; margin-top: 6px; margin-bottom: 14px; } .article_register_shortcode .media-button a { float: unset; } .article_register_shortcode .secondary-button { margin-bottom: 0; } } Never Miss a Beat in the Crypto World!

In a recent video shared on X, Pantoja outlined several factors driving his prediction, including XRP’s growing adoption, the potential for significant price increases, and a favorable risk-to-reward profile. Real-World Use Cases Strengthen XRP’s Appeal Pantoja emphasized that real-world use case makes XRP different from many other cryptocurrencies. According to him, XRP’s core purpose as a blockchain platform for efficient and low-cost international payments is already gaining traction among major financial institutions. “XRP is built for fast borderless payments and is already being adopted by major financial institutions,” Pantoja stated. He highlighted that the cryptocurrency’s real-world adoption gives it a strong foundation, providing stability and long-term growth potential in an otherwise volatile market. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, XRP’s integration into global financial systems positions it favorably to benefit from ongoing digital transformation. Ambitious Price Predictions Pantoja offered an optimistic outlook for XRP, projecting that its price could reach between $8 and $20 within 12 months. At the time of his analysis, XRP was trading at $2.40. Achieving the upper end of his forecast would represent a significant 733% increase in value. This bold prediction is grounded in three key factors: Increased Adoption: Pantoja anticipates that broader institutional adoption of XRP will boost its demand and, in turn, its value. Regulatory Clarity: The cryptocurrency sector is gradually receiving more regulatory clarity, which could enhance XRP’s credibility and attract additional investors. Pro-Crypto Administration: With Donald Trump expected to take office in January 2025, Pantoja believes a pro-cryptocurrency U.S. administration could create a favorable environment for XRP’s growth. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 A Compelling Risk-to-Reward Profile The analyst further highlighted XRP’s promising risk-to-reward ratio. He suggested that a modest investment of $1,000 to $2,000 in XRP could yield returns of $8,000 to $10,000 within a year. “The risk-to-reward ratio here is ridiculous,” he stated, framing the opportunity as an attractive option for individuals aiming to grow their wealth. For those earning $30,000 annually, Pantoja advised allocating a portion of their income to XRP, emphasizing its potential to deliver significant returns. He pointed out that XRP has experienced a 338% price surge over the past 30 days, with most of these gains occurring in November. Historical Performance and Considerations Despite the recent rally, long-term holders of XRP are still navigating challenges. Investors who purchased XRP at its peak seven years ago face a 36% loss. This underscores the importance of timing and market conditions when considering cryptocurrency investments.

Savvy investors who took profits are now rotating capital into undervalued gems primed for explosive growth in 2025. One such project is Lunex Network , which has consistently gained traction throughout its viral presale, raising over $4.6 million in record time. Let’s delve deeper and discover why this newcomer could leave Solana and Ripple in the dust. Solana Continues To Consolidate Just Below ATH After reaching a new all-time high at $263, Solana corrected by about 11% and is currently ranging around $240 as it found rock-solid support at $230. At press time, Solana sells for $238 with a 2.1% intraday increase and a 43% decline in volume, with roughly $4.6 billion worth of SOL traded in the last 24 hours. However, holders are still decisively bullish on Solana as every dip has been bought up almost immediately. According to on-chain readings from Lookonchain , whale activity has skyrocketed over the past few days, with large buyers acquiring massive quantities of Solana at discounted prices. Over the week, roughly $42 million, or 185,000 SOL tokens, has been withdrawn from Binance. Ripple Fails To Reclaim $3 At First Try, What’s Next? In November, Ripple (XRP) became one of the top performers with a 400% rally that saw it tear through resistance levels and reach a new peak at $2.80. As traders booked profits, a pullback followed, and today, Ripple trades at $2.44 with a 6.9% daily increase. Between the reported settlement with the SEC and the incoming release of a Ripple stablecoin, major bullish catalysts are lining up for the XRP price. After months of intensive testing, the RLUSD stablecoin’s launch is inching closer. Many Ripple investors are positioning themselves to capitalize on this significant liquidity event that could see Ripple soar above $3 by the end of the year. Lunex Network Is Spearheading The New DEX Revolution Lunex Network is more than just another run-of-the-mill decentralized exchange. It’s a non-custodial protocol that integrates all major blockchains and allows for seamless swaps between more than 50,000 assets at the lowest possible fee without any of the liquidity issues typical of most DEXs. Aside from providing an intuitive and frictionless DEX experience, Lunex Network boasts a wide array of features that could see its adoption skyrocket in the upcoming months. Institutional investors and businesses will find an exclusive B2B payment bridge API. This means that they can easily integrate cryptocurrencies into their payment options and have them instantly converted into fiat. Developers will have access to 65 RPC nodes to build highly scalable, decentralized applications. Users who want to take their trading to the next level can subscribe to Lunex Pro. This is a premium service that offers advanced trading tools, cashback on every transaction, and AML wallet checks. Moreover, Lunex Network will also grant loyal holders the opportunity to earn passive income through its revenue-sharing mechanism. Every week, Lunex Network will reinvest part of its earnings to buy back $LNEX tokens on the open market and redistribute them as staking rewards. During the ongoing presale, $LNEX tokens are priced at just $0.0038. This is the perfect entry point for buyers who want to be on the winning side of the upcoming DEX revolution led by Lunex Network.

Brad Garlinghouse, the CEO of Ripple Labs, a blockchain-based global payments solution, met with CBS News on Dec. 6 to discuss political action committees and their influence on the U.S. Presidential election. The CEO said that If SEC chair Gary Gensler hadn’t aggressively regulated cryptocurrencies, Fairshake , a federal-independent expenditure-only committee registered with the Federal Election Commission, wouldn’t exist. He said, “ I’m not sure Fairshake would exist “. You might also like: XRP loses 3rd largest crypto spot as Ripple confirms postponing stablecoin launch The antidote to the ‘war on crypto’ Speaking to CBS News on Dec. 6, Garlinghouse said the Fairshake was a joint response to what he terms to be a “war on crypto,” as the SEC significantly worked up its regulatory crackdowns during Gensler’s period. In fact, the agency had filed more than 120 lawsuits against crypto companies, including Ripple Labs, Uniswap, Terraform Labs, Coinbase, Binance , and Kraken-citing violations of securities laws. According to Garlinghouse, the enforcement actions created an unlikely unity within the crypto industry, giving rise to the PAC. You might also like: Cardano reaches $1 but experts believe Pepe Unchained and Rollblock have more potential “ So if there had been a different SEC chair than Gary Gensler…I’m not sure Fairshake would exist. Why did these companies come together and organize and say, ‘This matters’? It’s a reaction to a war on crypto.” – said Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple Labs. On being asked whether the PAC is charged with a political motive in mind, the 53-year-old CEO elaborated that the mission of the PAC is not political influence but rather a framework to push for a balanced legal framework to ensure blockchain technology can scale and grow in the U.S. This aligns with President-elect Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign manifesto, which emphasized transforming the U.S. into a global leader in cryptocurrency in Nashville in Jul. 2024. Crypto made its debut on @60Minutes tonight – there’s no doubt that these technologies will continue to become more and more mainstream – with influence and reach that will only continue to grow. A few things I do want to comment on after watching: I spoke with Margaret… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 9, 2024 Ripple CEO shares more insights on his interview on X. Garlinghouse further revealed that the company has spent over $150 million in legal expenses defending its position. The legal battle centered around whether XRP ( XRP ), the native token of Ripple, should be classified as exempt from the registration and disclosure requirements applicable to securities. Garlinghouse took to X to highlight that the CBS News segment did not cover Ripple’s victory, which was a federal judge’s ruling that XRP is not a security.

ADA is consolidating and facing hurdles near the $1.20 and $1.240 levels. ADA price started a pullback after it failed to stay above $1.30. The price is trading below $1.20 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.20 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair (data source from Kraken). The pair could start another increase if it clears the $1.240 resistance zone. Cardano Price Eyes Fresh Increase After struggling above $1.30, Cardano started a downside correction. ADA unperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum with a drop below the $1.20 level. The price even spiked below $1.150 before the bulls appeared. A low was formed at $1.1173 before the price started a fresh increase. There was a move above the $1.140 and $1.1550 resistance levels. The price surpassed the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.326 swing high to the $1.117 low. However, the bears are now active near the $1.25 zone. They protected the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $1.326 swing high to the $1.117 low. Cardano price is now trading below $1.20 and the 100-hourly simple moving average. On the upside, the price might face resistance near the $1.20 zone. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $1.20 on the hourly chart of the ADA/USD pair. The first resistance is near $1.2250. The next key resistance might be $1.2450. If there is a close above the $1.2450 resistance, the price could start a strong rally. In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $1.2780 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $1.320. Another Decline in ADA? If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $1.20 resistance level, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $1.150 level. The next major support is near the $1.120 level. A downside break below the $1.120 level could open the doors for a test of $1.080. The next major support is near the $1.0450 level where the bulls might emerge. Technical Indicators Hourly MACD – The MACD for ADA/USD is gaining momentum in the bearish zone. Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for ADA/USD is now below the 50 level. Major Support Levels – $1.120 and $1.080.

That said, shares in bitcoin holder MicroStrategy have seen even more significant gains, more than 500% versus Amazon's 49% rise. The shareholders' proposal highlighted MSTR's outperformance, along with BTC adoption by companies like Tesla and Block, while emphasizing that the online retailer has a fiduciary duty to look beyond short-term volatility in assets like BTC, which appreciate more than bonds and add those to its Treasury. At the end of the third quarter, Amazon had $585 billion in total assets, of which $88 billion represented cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including Treasury notes, foreign government and corporate bonds. The asset mix isn't adequately protecting the shareholder value, the proposal said. Last month, the NCPPR submitted a similar shareholder from Microsoft shareholders, urging the tech giant to diversify into bitcoin.

These Two Projects Could be Next appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Although a breakout was already brewing on the charts, Ripple (XRP)’s 400% explosion took many by surprise. Investors who were left sidelined are now looking into projects that have just started rising or are gearing up for the next massive leg up. While Pepe (PEPE) is an obvious choice, Lunex Network could vastly outperform it thanks to its magnitudes lower market cap, and significantly greater room for growth. Let’s dive deeper! Ripple Is Cooling Off After Memorable Rally Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential elections has reignited investor sentiment and the market reacted immediately, with Ripple (XRP) leading the surge. Ripple in a single uninterrupted move from $0.55 to $2.80 in a matter of weeks. However, at the peak, selling pressure intensified, forcing a pullback. Today, Ripple trades at $2.47 following a 7.5% intraday increase. The worst has now passed for Ripple, as years of ongoing legal battles with the SEC have tanked morale and suppressed the XRP price. With reports of a settlement being finalized between Ripple Labs and the SEC. And the highly-anticipated release of the proprietary stablecoin, RLUSD, Ripple is now the star of the show. Pepe Is Teasing An Imminent Breakout Pepe (PEPE) is currently among the hottest meme coins and has dominated the landscape for the past year while minting its fair share of millionaires along the way. In November, Pepe rose by a staggering 115% and reached a new all-time high of $0.0000248. Shortly after, it entered a consolidation phase where it found support around the $0.000020 mark. As buyers quickly stepped in to take advantage of the discount. At the time of writing, Pepe sells for $0.0000222 with an 8.5% daily increase. Analysts agree that Pepe is just getting started. UnknownTrader has shared a chart reading showing that Pepe has broken out of a descending trendline and followed with a successful retest. This means that Pepe is primed to enter bullish price discovery, with the next major milestone being the $0.000030 target.

Here’s What You Should Know,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/has-cardano-rally-called-off-will-ada-price-remain-within-consolidated-range-heres-what-you-should-know/,"The post Has Cardano Rally Called Off? Will ADA Price Remain Within Consolidated Range? Here’s What You Should Know appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The ADA price is the short timeframe that hints at a probable pullback as the bulls remain passive. Being in the top 10, the token tends to follow the star token, Bitcoin, struggling to rise and sustain above the threshold at $100K. Besides, Ethereum has also plunged below $4000, which is circulating Berish waves across the markets, including the Cardano price rally. The third-generation token reached the levels not tested in the past couple of years and is also expected to breach the upper resistance if held firmly. The ADA price traded within a massive falling wedge since the rejection from its ATH and after breaking out from the range, the token set off a 125% rise. The current trading pattern suggests the bulls have entered an exhaustion phase after printing massive bullish candles for 5 consecutive weeks. Therefore, the price of Cardano crypto is believed to trade within a range-bound for a few days until the liquidity flows back into the asset. The weekly chart of the ADA price rally suggests the token remains under bearish influence regardless of the recent rally. Although the price underwent a more than 125% jump, the Gaussian channel remains bearish. This channel indicates the trend pattern of the rally and also suggests the potential trading opportunities. A rise above the upper bands of the channel suggests the token reaching the highest level of volatility, which may open the doors of a trend reversal or correction. As a result, the channel remains bearish and the divergence in RSI substantiates the claim. Meanwhile, the current pullback can also offer a good entry point at around $0.984 or at $0.748 if the markets are correcting wider. After a rebound, a new ATH could be imminent, as it happened previously before the 2021 bull run. Therefore, the ADA price rally is expected to set off after a brief reversal to the lower targets and any range below $1 can be a good entry point as the price is primed to rise above $5 in the upcoming bullish cycle.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-09 05:29:13

These incidents, which resulted in significant financial losses for victims, bring attention to the importance of vigilance as bad actors exploit the growth and innovation within the crypto and NFT markets. Cardano Foundation’s X Account Hacked: Fraudulent Token Scheme Exploits Users The Cardano Foundation faced a significant cybersecurity incident on Dec. 8, 2024, when its official X account was compromised by a threat actor. The hacker used the platform to promote a fraudulent token, ”ADAsol,” falsely claiming it was the successor to Cardano's native ADA token. Additionally, the attacker asserted that Cardano would cease support for ADA due to an alleged lawsuit from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The fake ADAsol token garnered approximately $500,000 in trading volume before crashing by 99%. Many users fell victim to the scam in the brief window before the account was secured and the fraudulent posts removed. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed the hack on social media, urging the community to remain vigilant. The compromised account no longer hosts the scam-related content, but the incident serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with malicious activities in the crypto space. The Cardano Foundation emphasized that no other parts of its ecosystem were affected by the breach. However, it cautioned users against interacting with links shared via its X account until further notice. The Cardano Foundation's hack is part of a broader trend of cybersecurity breaches targeting prominent crypto and public figures' X accounts. These incidents often result in significant financial losses and erode trust within the community. In December 2023, Compound Finance’s X account fell prey to hackers, who posted phishing links disguised as legitimate protocol content. These links redirected users to a site mimicking Compound's official website, promoting fraudulent COMP tokens. Unsuspecting users who interacted with these links found their crypto assets drained. October 2024 saw multiple high-profile X account hacks. Symbiotic, a restaking protocol, was targeted by a phishing scheme disguised as an airdrop checklist. Similarly, Eigenlayer, another restaking protocol, had its X account used to promote a fake airdrop campaign. Both incidents resulted in losses for users who were tricked into connecting their wallets to malicious sites. On Oct. 29, 2024, the founder of Truth Terminal AI reported their X account had been hijacked to promote a fraudulent meme coin. In November 2024, the X account of rapper Wiz Khalifa was also compromised, with the threat actor pushing a fake celebrity meme coin named ”WIZ.” This incident leveraged Khalifa’s fame to exploit unsuspecting fans. Community Vigilance: The First Line of Defense The rise of social media account hacks targeting crypto entities stresses the need for increased vigilance. The Cardano Foundation's swift acknowledgment of the incident and efforts to secure its compromised account are commendable. However, such incidents show the necessity for enhanced security measures and community awareness. Users should adopt the following best practices to avoid falling victim to similar schemes: Verify Sources: Always confirm the authenticity of announcements by cross-referencing them with official websites or verified channels. Avoid Suspicious Links: Refrain from clicking on links in social media posts, even if they appear legitimate. Enable 2FA: Secure your own accounts with two-factor authentication (2FA) to reduce the risk of being hacked. Use Wallet Security Features: Leverage hardware wallets or wallet apps with robust phishing detection. While the crypto industry must address vulnerabilities within its community, social media platforms also bear responsibility. These platforms need to prioritize security for high-profile accounts, including enhanced monitoring and rapid response mechanisms for compromised accounts. The Cardano Foundation hack serves as another cautionary tale in the crypto space, reminding users of the importance of vigilance and proactive measures to protect their assets. As the Foundation works to secure its ecosystem and restore trust, the broader crypto community must remain alert to the persistent threat of social media scams. With better security practices and community collaboration, the industry can mitigate the risks posed by malicious actors. Brooklyn DA Shuts Down 40 Fake NFT Marketplaces After Artist Loses $135,000 in Scam The Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office has dismantled a network of 40 fraudulent non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace websites that targeted unsuspecting artists, including an 85-year-old victim who was scammed out of $135,000. The operation, announced on Dec. 6, sheds some light on the growing sophistication of digital art scams and the vulnerability of artists navigating the NFT space. The victim, an elderly artist, was contacted on LinkedIn by a scammer posing as an art dealer. Convincing the artist to mint his work on a counterfeit NFT marketplace designed to mimic the popular platform OpenSea, the scammer lured him with promises of lucrative profits. The victim was later informed that his artwork had generated $300,000 in sales, but there was a catch: to access these earnings, he needed to pay a $135,000 “fee.” Trusting the scheme, the artist liquidated his retirement account, maxed out his credit cards, and even took out a loan to cover the amount. Once the payment was made, the promised profits never materialized, leaving the artist financially and emotionally devastated. A Network of Fraudulent Sites Uncovered Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez revealed that the tactics used in this case led investigators to uncover a broader network of 40 fraudulent websites targeting artists. The investigation, spearheaded by the DA’s Virtual Currency Unit, traced the stolen funds to accounts in Nigeria. The funds were primarily converted to Nigerian currency, closing off avenues for recovery. Some of the fake NFT marketplaces went beyond scamming users for money. They also sought to gain access to victims’ cryptocurrency wallets by asking for seed phrases. This would allow scammers to completely drain a user’s wallet, further compounding financial losses. This case is not an isolated incident. The DA’s office disclosed that two additional artists, one from Georgia and another from California, were duped by the same scam. The counterfeit marketplaces’ resemblance to legitimate platforms like OpenSea demonstrate the increasing sophistication of cybercriminals in the NFT and crypto sectors. The case has drawn attention to the vulnerabilities artists face in the evolving NFT market, where the promise of high profits often clouds judgment. Scams involving fake NFT marketplaces, phishing attacks, and seed phrase theft are becoming alarmingly common, exposing both novice and seasoned creators to significant financial risks. District Attorney Gonzalez emphasized the importance of raising awareness to prevent further victims. “It is my hope that by shutting these domains and raising awareness about this scheme, we will prevent others from falling victim to this scam,” he stated. The DA’s office offered the following advice to artists: Use Established Platforms: Sell your work only on well-known, reputable NFT marketplaces. Platforms like OpenSea and Rarible have established trust in the community and have mechanisms to report suspicious activity. Beware of Phishing Attempts: Avoid clicking on links in unsolicited emails or messages, especially those that direct you to mint or sell NFTs on unfamiliar platforms. Protect Your Wallet: Never share your cryptocurrency wallet’s seed phrase. Legitimate platforms and transactions will never require this information. Verify Opportunities: If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Seek advice from fellow artists or trusted sources before proceeding. The Brooklyn DA’s investigation shows the need for increased vigilance in the digital art and cryptocurrency spaces. The lack of regulatory oversight in these emerging markets has made them fertile ground for scams and fraudulent activities. While shutting down the fraudulent websites is a significant victory, the recovery of funds remains a challenge, especially when the money is quickly transferred and converted in jurisdictions with limited cooperation. This case highlights the need for international collaboration in addressing crypto-related crimes and protecting victims. As NFTs continue to grow in popularity, so too do the risks associated with their adoption. This case serves as a stark reminder that while the digital art market offers new opportunities for creators, it also comes with unique challenges. Artists and collectors alike must remain vigilant and take proactive steps to safeguard their work and investments. For now, the Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office hopes that its efforts to shut down fraudulent websites and educate the public will deter future scams and provide a measure of justice for victims of these schemes.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|MARKET|TRADING|AIRDROP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2024-12-09 05:30:23

On the other hand, Dogecoin (DOGE) seems ready to fly as it recently broke through crucial resistance, however, bulls must defend this level at any cost if they want to see upward price discovery. Lunex Network is another contender that could experience a massive rally in the upcoming weeks. Thousands of investors have already rushed to the presale, as over $4.6 million has been raised in record time. Bitcoin Enters Cool-Off Phase Just Below $100k All eyes are on Bitcoin (BTC) as it finally reaches the $100k milestone, and then added a few thousand for good measure. Predictably, at the top, selling pressure grew and Bitcoin retraced, briefly tapping the $96k support before rebounding. Today, Bitcoin sells for $99,569, reflecting a 3% gain. A deeper correction could be in store, on Bitcoin’s 4-hour chart, a bearish divergence has appeared, as the RSI is dipping while the price has been moving above an ascending trendline. A break below this trendline could confirm a short-term bearish scenario for Bitcoin. Trading volume has dipped by 45%, or roughly $65 billion worth of BTC traded across exchanges, this decline goes to show that buyers are taking a step back and redirecting attention to other altcoins that could be primed for new surges, such as Dogecoin and Lunex Network. Dogecoin Reclaims $0.45, What’s Next? After consolidating around $0.40 for the past few weeks, Dogecoin (DOGE) has soared by 3.8% on the daily timeframe, reaching $0.45. If this resistance is flipped into support, the way would be paved for Dogecoin to surge above $0.50 by the end of the year and possibly, reach the prophesied $1 landmark in early 2025. Analyst and trader Eliz has shared a Dogecoin chart reading, showing that DOGE has been moving into an ascending channel, with consistent rebounds from the trendline. Today, Elon Musk also did his part to elevate the sentiment of Dogecoin holders, as he reposted the same viral meme that he shared in 2021, during the memorable DOGE run. Why Lunex Network Could Be One Of The Best Plays Of 2025 Groundbreaking DeFi exchange Lunex could significantly disrupt the exchange industry with its innovative framework. The platform integrates isolated blockchains and allows for instantaneous swaps between more than 50,000 assets.

Pepe and Shiba Inu are still in the green, though memes in general have lost steam as large-cap utility plays gain traction. Gaming is yet to experience significant upward momentum, though some analysts believe a DeFi gaming rally is well overdue. In this lucrative hype-based sector, Rollblock stands out as a particularly profitable venture to look into heading into 2025. Read on to learn more. Whale Activity Bolsters Investor Confidence In Pepe Pepe has solidified its position as the third-largest memecoin, driven by recent listings on Coinbase, Robin Hood, and most recently Binance US. These significant listings have increased Pepe’s accessibility in the USA, contributing to Pepe’s 166% rise in a 30-day timeframe. Whales have further boosted confidence in Pepe ahead of the bull run, accumulating 337 million tokens worth over $6 million collectively. A recent trend of moving Pepe tokens off of exchanges has reduced selling pressure and supports Pepe’s bullish long-term growth prospects. With strong community support and increasing adoption, Pepe is well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory, as some crypto influencers like “Murad” predict that a meme supercycle is on the precipice. Burns And Increasing Interest From Whales Puts Shiba Inu In Bullish Stead Shiba Inu has regained momentum just in time for the bull run, with notable whale activity signaling renewed confidence amongst large investors. Two transactions in particular have garnered significant attention, one being a major transfer of over 80 billion SHIB from Coinbase and a separate 54 billion SHIB migration from a US government-linked wallet. In addition, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 blockchain, Shibarium, has seen its total value locked surge past $10 million, an 850% jump since September. Deflationary mechanisms, including a 4500% spike in the token’s burn rate, are also strengthening Shiba Inu’s supply dynamics, rendering Shiba Inu as more scarce. With further burns anticipated around Christmas, analysts anticipate Shiba Inu to continue its impressive growth trajectory at a time when memes are more popular than ever. Don’t Miss Out On Rollblock Before The Gaming Rally Rollblock is reshaping the iGaming industry with its innovative play-to-earn platform, seamlessly integrating decentralized and traditional gaming with lucrative rewards and a strong overall foundation that sets it up perfectly for further growth. Featuring a collection of over 7,000 games, Rollblock offers something for everyone , from classic favorites like poker and roulette to groundbreaking blockchain-based titles. The soon-to-launch sports betting feature will further expand its offerings, enabling the platform’s 20,000+ users to place wagers on major sporting events, enhancing the utility of the RBLK token while offering another avenue to have fun and make a profit.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-09 05:43:00

The U.S. government is publicly known as one of the largest nations that owns gold as its reserve, which accounts for 72% of the total. Based on TradingEconomics data on Dec. 09, the U.S. owned 8,133 tons of gold and dominated international commodity trading. However, Michael Saylor urges the government not to buy more gold but to buy more Bitcoin ( BTC ) instead for future assets against inflation. As a national reserve, in his belief, Bitcoin will rise to trillions of dollars. “Dump your gold, sell all the U.S. gold, and buy Bitcoin because you can buy 5 million Bitcoin for the cost of the gold. You’ll demonitize the entire gold asset class and our enemies hold gold in their banks, and so their asset would go to zero, while our asset go to trillion dollars,” Saylor says on Yahoo Finance’s Market Domination interview on X’s post On another occasion, Saylor also expects Bitcoin’s market capitalization to skyrocket to $280 trillion, surpassing the gold market cap, which accounts for $45 trillion. The recent Bitcoin market cap is $2 trillion. Through these projections, Saylor will keep buying Bitcoin every week and urge more investors and institutions to gain exposure to Bitcoin.

Read more: MicroStrategy hits $40b in Bitcoin, critics question Saylor’s strategy Michael Saylor and Trump’s vision for Bitcoin reserve Bitcoin Strategic Reserve was mainly introduced by President-elect Donald Trump when he got a chance to speak in front of the Bitcoin community earlier this July. This vision was followed by the BITCOIN Act, which was proposed by the Republican Senator Cynthia Lummis to Congress. Both of the figure’s vision, Trump and Saylor, was driven by Bitcoin’s utility and use cases against inflations. This move also inspired other institutions and nations to acquire or keep their Bitcoin. Polish and Suriname’s presidential candidates were two examples of how Bitcoin could influence their vision for their respective nations.

But the real buzz is coming from a surprising presale, 1FUEL. With DeFi booming and multi-chain ecosystems becoming the norm, this might be the best time to bet on the next altcoin to explode. Curious about why 1FUEL’s cryptocurrency wallet is stealing the spotlight from the likes of HBAR and Solana? Let’s see what makes this project a potential 100x crypto in 2025. Binance’s New Altcoin Picks: HBAR & Solana Altcoin season is in full swing, and Binance exchange just rolled out six new listings, with Hedera (HBAR) and Solana (SOL) leading the charge, alongside some meme coins that are keeping things spicy. Solana-based platforms like Raydium and Meteora are taking center stage for meme coin trading on Binance, but the real intrigue lies in HBAR and OM. HBAR is the leader in distributed ledger tech, and OM is all about connecting digital and physical assets. Binance knows how to keep both speculators and utility-focused investors hooked. At press time, BNB keeps printing green candles with nearly 40% gains this month. Also, BNB now has more than $111 billion in market cap. HBAR Rides The Altcoin season momentum Hedera Hashgraph has been quietly building a blockchain empire, backed by heavyweights like Google, IBM, and Ubisoft. That credibility is paying off, with HBAR’s price hitting $0.40, its best run since 2021. With a $12.5 billion market cap and climbing, HBAR is proving that this altcoin season is about delivering real-world value while riding the crypto rally wave. Can Solana Hit $200 This Season? Solana’s 2024 performance has been nothing short of spectacular. It’s up 270% this year, with a November rally pushing prices past $260 to a new ATH and analysts now eyeing the $300 mark. SOL’s fate is tied to Bitcoin’s stability and broader market sentiment. But with its blazing-fast transaction speeds and thriving ecosystem, Solana is riding the bullish altcoin trend like a pro. If Bitcoin holds steady, Solana could easily smash new records by year-end. For those watching the altcoin season play out, SOL is the textbook example of how a network can thrive when sentiment turns green. 1FUEL – The Best Cryptocurrency In 2025 That’s Breaking The DeFi Mold For those chasing high-growth altcoins this season, new entrants like 1FUEL naturally offer more 100x potential than established players like SOL or HBAR. While blue-chip tokens dominate the headlines, smaller projects often yield the most dramatic returns during altcoin rallies. With one-click cross-chain crypto transactions, cold storage for crypto, and privacy so tight even the nosiest blockchain won’t crack it, and crypto staking rewards of up to 10% APR, you’ve got an investment that works as hard as you do. The presale offers early birds exclusive bonuses, making this the perfect time to jump in. In a market hungry for innovation, this project checks all the boxes for investors seeking big gains with utility baked right in. Conclusion HBAR and Solana are undeniably riding the altcoin season high on Binance, but 1FUEL offers something different, something game-changing. It’s not just a token; it’s a secure cryptocurrency wallet, a staking platform, and a secure haven for your crypto, all rolled into one. While HBAR and Solana are great plays for those riding the momentum, 1FUEL is where innovation meets opportunity. Its presale bonuses and unique features make it the dark horse of this altcoin cycle. If you’re looking to make moves in a market primed for explosive growth, 1FUEL may be the best cryptocurrency to buy ahead of the new year. Learn more about 1FUEL.

Last week, spot Bitcoin ETFs netted inflows of $2.73 billion, reaching the highest-ever weekly inflows since inception. Of these, BlackRock Bitcoin ETF IBIT alone netted inflows of $2.6 billion, while crossing $50 billion AUM. So what actually led to the Bitcoin price pump to an all-time high of $104K? Similar to the previous bull cycles, it’s the retail frenzy and shot-term holders that are capturing all the limelight. Recent data indicates that retail demand has surged to yearly highs over the past 30 days, reflecting increased activity during a strong upward trend. Courtesy: Maartunn Short-term holders, often dominated by retail investors, are absorbing much of the supply. Furthermore, Maartunn noted that retail participation extends beyond spot markets with the altcoin open interest surging to $53.3 billion while the Bitcoin open interest surging to $30.6 billion. This heavy retail presence in both spot and derivatives markets underscores a high-stakes “musical chairs” dynamic, noted the analyst while advising caution when market sentiment shifts. Signs of Extreme Fear and Greed The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has surged to 84, signaling “extreme greed” in the market—a level often associated with heightened risk and potential market tops. Source: Maartunn In addition to the Fear & Greed Index, other metrics, such as the Sell-Side Risk Ratio and Net Taker Volume (ETH) , are also pointing toward the possibility of a market top. These signals align with bearish on-chain data observed during last week’s price movements. Source: Maartunn The Bitcoin price movement will depend on macro indicators with the release of U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation figures. Adding to the spotlight, the U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI)—a key inflation gauge closely monitored by the Federal Reserve for rate-cut decisions—is also set to be announced this week.

Lately, one project’s presale has been making big waves as blockchain investment experts forecast an expected 50x ROI in the coming months. Keep reading to get in early on 50x forecast as 1Fuel ’s token presale gains increasing appeal across the cryptocurrency playfield. Solana Passes Moving Average: Set to Hit $500 Solana (SOL) is keeping its bulls on their toes as it just broke through a key resistance trendline and surged above the $240 mark. SOL just passed its 100-day moving average and technical indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) now point to a strong upward trend in the market. Grayscale Investment’s recent filing for a Solana ETF with the SEC has triggered most of the excitement around the price surge. If this ETF is granted, it could boost Solana’s institutional appeal, and the coin could level up to join the list of top cryptocurrencies. SOL’s price shot up by 5% almost immediately the filing was announced, and now optimistic blockchain investment experts are forecasting that it could even reach the $500 price mark. Currently valued at $243 and reaching the $500 mark means Solana would deliver an impressive 100% ROI from its current price. Yet, even this notable ROI pales compared to the returns anticipated for 1Fuel (OFT) if it hits its target price of $0.5. Tron Reaches New Heights as TVL Hits $36.2 Billion Solana is not the only beneficiary of Grayscale’s recent moves. On December 4, the total value locked (TVL) on Tron hit $36.2 billion, and Tron’s TRX token recently reached a record-breaking price of $0.44. Although it then corrected to $0.33, it still posted impressive weekly gains of 66% and reclaimed its position as the 10th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. The recent rally has been speculatively fueled by TRX’s potential inclusion in Grayscale’s portfolio. Grayscale has listed TRX among 35 tokens under evaluation and quarterly updates are expected. This prospect has raised the prospects for increased institutional interest in Tron. Adding to the momentum is Tron founder Justin Sun, whose high-profile moves have drawn attention to the network. Sun recently made a blockchain investment of $30 million in WLFI tokens tied to Donald Trump’s ‘World Liberty Financial’ initiative and accepted an advisory role with the project. His involvement has also extended to the conceptual artwork “Comedian”, driving community engagement and indirectly boosting interest in related tokens like BAN. 1Fuel Token Presale Ignites Investor Interest with Explosive Potential Although it seems like Solana and Tron are setting unstoppable trends in the market at the moment, their investors have picked up on 1Fuel as the top new project for 2025 . Currently trading at just $0.01, 1Fuel’s token presale has attracted significant attention, including from blockchain investment experts, due to its explosive growth potential. Should it climb to $0.5, investors could see an extraordinary 500% return that would far eclipse the impressive gains predicted for Solana. Participants in stage 1 of the presale receive a 20% bonus on all purchases which is a great entry point for those looking to secure a stake before the platform’s public launch. With 500 million tokens (half of the total supply) allocated for the presale, 1Fuel is not only raising capital but also empowering early adopters to shape its future trajectory. One of 1Fuel’s best features is that it allows seamless cross-chain transactions which simplifies token swaps by removing the unnecessary fees and multiple wallets. The project has allocated 40 million tokens as staking rewards, encouraging holders to lock up their tokens and actively participate in the network. Additionally, 110 million tokens are reserved for liquidity providers, ensuring ample liquidity for smooth trading. Active traders are also rewarded, with 40 million tokens designated to incentivize high-volume transactions and market activity. Conclusion Solana and Tron may be trending upward in the crypto market, but investors have 1Fuel’s token presale marked out as a chance to make huge returns. By focusing on accessibility, security, and ecosystem growth, 1Fuel positions itself as a gateway to innovative blockchain solutions and sustainable growth for its community.

Pepe MAGA (PEPEMAGA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 18,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPEMAGA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Pepe MAGA can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-09 07:06:00

With this, the token has achieved a market capitalisation of over $11 billion, surpassing the giants like Litecoin. However, the trading volume does not appear to have completely shifted in favour of bulls and if this happens, the PEPE price rally is expected to kick off and reach the levels above $0.00004 very soon. The third largest memecoin as per the market capitalisation, PEPE, has just marked a milestone. By breaking above the bull flag, the token swelled high and marked a new ATH, which has attracted some bearish attention. The price has dropped marginally but the ongoing correction is expected to offer a strong bullish momentum as it did in May 2024, which propelled the price by over 70% to mark the highs above $0.000017. Now that the token is manifesting a similar price action, the PEPE price rally is expected to rise above $0.00004, probably in the first few days of 2025. The PEPE price rally appears to be following a pattern since the beginning of the year, with new highs being achieved at regular intervals.The current trade setup resembles the rally that occurred in mid-Q2. The price surged above the resistance zone, and after a brief retracement, it exceeded 70%. The Ichimoku cloud supports the retracement narrative, as the base and conversion lines are approaching a bearish crossover. However, the RSI sticks to the upper threshold, reviving the hope for a bullish continuation. Therefore, the current trade until the weekend could be extremely important, which may shed light on the next price action. If the price experiences a retracement, it could rise by 75%, setting a new ATH above $0.00004. Otherwise, a bullish continuation could exhaust buyers, causing the token to behave sluggishly for a while before marching towards the upper target. The PEPE price rally has taken off and is just an inch away from becoming the second largest memecoin, surpassing Shiba Inu. With over $7.5 billion trading volume compared to $2.5 billion of SHIB, the flipping seems to be inevitable, as it’s just a matter of time. The short-term and long-term charts suggest the Pepe price may soon enter a pre-Christmas rally, which could help the price to trade within a discovery phase for a long time ahead.",Price Analysis|Altcoins|Meme Coins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|SHIB|TRADING|PEPE,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-09 07:06:49

The trend has exploded over the past few years, with coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu leading the charge as alternative investments to traditional financial instruments. As 2024 nears its close, the hype around meme coins continues to build, with many investors eager to jump on the next big thing. One meme coin that’s turning heads in December 2024 is BTFD Coin. This next-gen meme coin has already raised over $1.1 million in its presale, hitting the $1.5M mark in under 15 days. Now, in Stage 8 of its presale journey, BTFD Coin has sold more than 30 billion $BTFD coins to over 3,300 holders. Its rapid rise has sparked comparisons to other meme coins that have exploded in the market in recent years, such as Turbo and Fartcoin, both of which have earned their place as go-to projects for investors looking for high-reward opportunities. But the question on everyone’s mind is: Can BTFD Coin follow in the footsteps of Turbo and Fartcoin, both of which have provided substantial returns for early investors? In this article, we’ll explore why BTFD Coin is emerging as one of the best meme coins to buy in December 2024, while also examining the market positions of Turbo and Fartcoin and their proven track records in the meme coin frenzy. Let’s see if BTFD Coin has what it takes to dominate the meme coin space in 2025. BTFD Coin: The Meme Coin Powerhouse with Play2Earn and Staking Rewards BTFD Coin has set the bar high with an explosive presale that’s already raised over $1.5 million in just a matter of days. Currently in Stage 8, BTFD Coin is rapidly gathering momentum, with over 30 billion $BTFD coins sold and more than 3,300 holders already on board. So, what makes BTFD Coin stand out from the crowd? The key to its success lies in its unique approach to meme coin utility. BTFD Coin isn’t just another pump-and-dump meme token; it’s a project with serious plans to integrate real-world functionality. One of its most exciting features is the Play2Earn game. This game allows users to engage with the coin in a way that’s not only fun but also profitable. Players can earn $BTFD coins through gameplay, providing an interactive way for the community to grow and benefit. It’s an exciting twist on traditional meme coins, which tend to focus primarily on speculation and hype. In addition to the Play2Earn game, BTFD Coin offers staking rewards for its holders. By staking $BTFD coins, investors can earn additional tokens, providing a passive income stream while supporting the coin’s ecosystem. This is a feature that adds long-term value and makes BTFD Coin more than just a meme—it turns it into a sustainable investment option. The real-life applications of meme coins like BTFD are becoming more prominent. Community-driven projects like Dogecoin have already shown that meme coins can become valuable assets. Similarly, BTFD Coin’s Play2Earn game and staking options are setting it up for a future where meme coins are not just for fun—they can also deliver real financial returns. If you invested $1,000 in the 8th stage at $0.000076 per coin, you’d get 13,157,895 $BTFD coins. Now, as the presale progresses, analysts are predicting that BTFD could surge up to $0.25 per coin once launched, which would mean your $1,000 investment could be worth over $3.28 million. That’s some serious potential for growth! Turbo Coin: Riding the Meme Coin Wave with Consistent Gains Turbo Coin is one of the most successful meme coins in recent years, thanks to its vibrant community and unique approach to marketing. Turbo Coin capitalised on the meme coin frenzy and became a go-to investment for those looking to profit from the meme coin movement. The coin’s value exploded in 2021, as it capitalised on the viral meme trend while also building a solid base of supporters who rallied behind the project. Turbo Coin is known for its active community and its ability to generate excitement around each of its releases. Its developers frequently launch new initiatives and marketing campaigns that keep the community engaged and invested. Whether it’s a new NFT drop or a viral meme, Turbo Coin knows how to capture the attention of investors and meme coin fans alike. What Turbo Coin has done particularly well is maintaining its market position even as new meme coins flood the market. By fostering a loyal community and offering exciting use cases, Turbo Coin has stayed relevant in the meme coin space, even as other coins have risen and fallen. For investors looking to get involved with one of the best meme coins to buy in December 2024, Turbo Coin remains a solid option. While it may not have the explosive potential of a fresh project like BTFD Coin, Turbo Coin has proven itself as a reliable meme coin with strong community backing and steady market growth. Fartcoin: The Meme Coin That’s Always on the Pulse of Internet Culture If you’re looking for a meme coin that embodies internet culture, Fartcoin is a prime example. Known for its humourous and often irreverent branding, Fartcoin has captured the attention of meme lovers and crypto enthusiasts alike. While its name alone makes it stand out, Fartcoin has established itself as more than just a joke—it’s a meme coin with staying power. Fartcoin has been around for a few years now, and its market position reflects the coin’s ability to maintain a loyal and engaged community. By capitalising on internet memes and popular culture, Fartcoin has remained a relevant project in the ever-evolving meme coin ecosystem. It’s a coin that’s seen steady growth, largely due to its clever use of social media and meme culture. In many ways, Fartcoin serves as the ultimate example of how meme coins can tap into the zeitgeist of internet culture and turn it into a profitable investment opportunity. Whether it’s through meme-based events or collaborations with influencers, Fartcoin continues to push the boundaries of what a meme coin can be. For investors, Fartcoin represents a stable meme coin with a long history of engagement. While its market cap may not be as large as some of the more well-established coins, it has a proven track record and a growing user base. For those looking for an established meme coin with a unique flavour, Fartcoin is one of the best meme coins to buy in December 2024. Conclusion: The Future of Meme Coins and Why BTFD Coin Leads the Pack As we head into 2025, meme coins remain a powerful force in the cryptocurrency world. BTFD Coin’s explosive presale, combined with its Play2Earn game and staking rewards, has positioned it as a true contender in the meme coin space. With analysts predicting a surge in price after the presale, BTFD Coin offers some of the most exciting growth potential for investors in 2025. Turbo Coin and Fartcoin have already proven themselves as reliable meme coin projects, but BTFD Coin’s fresh approach and real-world utility make it the best meme coin to buy in December 2024 for long-term investors. Don’t miss your chance to join the next meme coin bull run. Join the BTFD Coin presale today and get ready for explosive growth in 2025!

On December 4 (Wednesday), the cryptocurrency officially crossed the $100K mark. It now stands at $103,449.70. Overall this year the currency witnessed a 130% growth. Experts believe that Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential elections has been a driving force behind this massive surge. Ever since he started campaigning, he made it clear that his administration has some special plans to uplift the crypto market in the US. But Bitcoin’s success isn’t Bitcoin’s alone. It has huge implications for other currencies too. Here are four other currencies that have the potential of 10x gains in the near future. 4 Altcoins That Can Potential Grow By 10X Let’s now look at 4 Altcoins you can think about investing your money in. 1. Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe is a trending crypto project ideal for beginners Its official token is called $WEPE and is inspired by the Pepe the Frog meme. As per expert predictions its value is expected to increase throughout the next couple of years. Right now, $WEPE is in presale and we think it’ll continue to be in presale till the end of December. It is currently priced at $0.000221. By the end of next year, it’s expected to grow by 500%, priced at approximately $0.001094. Now, 2026 is far away and it’s hard to predict its growth by then. But if everything goes well, we can expect another 10x gain. It also offers a respite from the large whale groups that try to control the crypto market. Small traders can benefit from its special tips and market insights that are exclusively reserved for its community members 2. Crypto All-Stars Crypto All-Starts is a trending microcap meme coin and its native tokens are called $STARS. In August this year, it launched its presale which quickly went viral and has now surpassed over $2 million in sales. This is enough proof of its demand and potential. Now speaking of its expected growth, its current average price is $0.0034067. In 2025, it is expected to go through growth of more than 500% and settle at approximately $0.0217182. STARS is the proprietary meme coin of MemeVault, the popular meme NFT trading platform. It runs on the ERC-1155 standard, which allows users to integrate MemeVault into Ethereum-based dApps. 3. POPCAT POPCAT is another popular meme coin that is inspired by the viral cat meme featuring a cat called Oatmeal. It’s a little more expensive than the first two currencies. In October this year, it hit its all-time high value of $1.67 and has since managed to cross the half-a-billion-dollar market cap milestone. POPCAT was first launched in December 2023 but it didn’t gain much traction until March this year. And since then, over a mere 7 months, it has managed to grow by 400% – its current rate is $1.64. At this rate, by the end of December, its rate can go as high as $4.95 (a growth of 200%) and in 2025, it can peak at $9.65, which is a staggering 478% jump from its current value. 4. PNUT PNUT represents Peanut the Squirrel, the beloved internet mascot that was euthanized this October for rabies testing (the result came back negative). This token is a tribute to him. As you can see, this coin is very new to the market. However, since Peanut was popular and the whole incident garnered a lot of controversy, the token quickly became popular. In fact, in less than 48 hours, its market cap crossed the $1 billion mark, the credit for which also goes to it being listed on Binance. Its current trading value is $1.45. By the end of December, if it continues to receive the same level of support from the community, it might reach $2.7 to $3, which is a 106% jump at max. Buy Now It’s evident that all these currencies have a fairly good expected growth rate for the next year. However, if you want the best of the lot, Wall Street Pepe and Crypto All-Stars are the clear choice. They not only have the highest expected growth rate but both of them are cheaper which makes them perfect for small investors.",Meme coins|bitcoin|Cyrpto All Stars|PNUT|POPCAT|Wall Street Pepe,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-09 07:16:27

Some say there’s no gift like the present, especially during the year-end holiday season. Because that’s when equities and cryptocurrencies historically deliver most of their positive yearly returns. “A Santa Claus rally is the sustained increase in the stock market that occurs around the Christmas holiday on Dec. 25,” an entry on Investopedia last year reports . “Most estimate these rallies happen in the week leading up to the Christmas holiday, while others see trends that begin Christmas Day through Jan. 2.” But it’s not just the seasonal bump going for Bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets this month. There are also broad macro trends in the little orange coin’s favor. Meanwhile, there are fundamentals in BTC’s supply on-chain and on exchanges. To top that off, the Trump bump for most equities and crypto assets after his historical election win is very real. Given his pro-growth agenda for cryptocurrency, markets expect that to weigh heavily in Bitcoin’s favor as his administration gears up. Here are five reasons Bitcoin bulls expect BTC’s price to rally further through December and into the New Year. 1. Fed Expects to Cut Rates Again in Dec Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin usually rally over the long term during low Federal Reserve interest rate regimes, in addition to corporate sales and stocks. With rates held down to near 0% for years after the financial crisis of ’08, Bitcoin grew in leaps and bounds from nothing to $20,000 per BTC by Dec. 25, 2017. Then, when the Fed raised rates through 2018, Bitcoin’s price collapsed into what markets called the “crypto winter.” After that, the Fed cut rates to zero again in response to the global coronavirus pandemic in 2020. That led to new all-time high prices for BTC and many altcoins. Then the central bank went back to raising interest rates at the beginning of 2022. Now that the Fed is back to cutting rates again, Bitcoin has roared with bullish approval. The price is flying past new all-time highs in December and shows no signs of slowing down. Daily exchange volume has increased in pace with the higher prices. A top Fed official said at the beginning of December that the Fed is ready to cut rates again at its December meeting on the 17th and 18th. “At present, I lean toward supporting a cut to the policy rate at our December meeting,” said Christopher Waller, a key Federal Reserve official. 2. Bitcoin Supply Cycle In Mid-Swing Straight Up #Bitcoin Cycles Timeline. I don’t make the rules. 2016-2020 Halving to Peak: 525 days Peak to Bottom: 364 days Bottom to Halving 518 days 2020-2024 Halving to Peak: 532 days Peak to Bottom: 371 days Bottom to Halving: 532 Days The next halving date is March 26, 2028. Look how… pic.twitter.com/0305klH4WQ — Brett (@brett_eth) December 7, 2024 The dovish Fed rate regime is bullish for Bitcoin, but the supply cycle is also heavily in favor of BTC bulls. Hard-coded into Bitcoin Core, the app for running Bitcoin, is a 50% cut in daily new supplies every four years. That’s akin to the Fed raising its rates every four years, which would make each dollar stronger in purchasing power as time goes on. Instead, the Fed lowers its rates to make each dollar weaker so consumers and businesses will spend faster and make up the difference with economic growth. However, Bitcoin is designed to increase the spending power of its long-term holders. Rather than increasing its new supplies and decreasing its buying power, BTC decreases the new supply rate to shore up and consolidate its buying power. 3. Nov Blowout in Crypto Exchange BTC Outflows While the daily new supplies in Bitcoin fell by half earlier this year, the availability of BTC tokens to trade on crypto exchanges has also drastically declined. That drop in exchange liquidity is a strong price support for Bitcoin over the long term. 30-day crypto exchange outflows topped 58,440 BTC (worth $5.58 billion at the time) on Tuesday, Dec. 3, according to data from CoinGlass. By Dec. 7, just four days later, that trailing 30-day figure had risen by an extreme amount to 116,259 BTC. That represents conviction among long-term holders and the intention to save rather than cash out their Bitcoin. 4. The EOY Sales Bump Most businesses blow out their annual revenue quotas only in the final stretch of the calendar between Nov. 1 and New Year’s Eve. The New York stock market is no different and neither is Web3’s Bitcoin blockchain. According to an article in Nasdaq, a popular website for stock market traders, “Historically, Q4 is Bitcoin’s strongest quarter, and November has often been a standout month. December, which has also performed well in past bull cycles, presents a promising outlook.” In terms of its total dollar increase, Bitcoin’s price rose further in one month this past November than any month in its history. That portends a strong Santa Claus rally if market sentiment remains unchanged through the new year. 5. Pro-Bitcoin Republicans Hold Washington Donald Trump tolerated Bitcoin in his first term. In his second term, he’s pushing for government understanding and pro-growth regulations that leave room for more innovation in blockchain. A Dec. 6 segment on CNBC, a popular news outlet for the financial and investing class, highlighted the bevy of pro-crypto nominations for Trump’s second administration. As the incoming president made his selections, Bitcoin’s price on crypto exchanges hovered near a historic high of around $100,000. As Mr. Trump said in a speech to the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, TN, in July, while campaigning for the presidential election in November, “Those who say that Bitcoin is a threat to the dollar have the story exactly backward.” The post Santa Rally for Bitcoin Price This December? 5 Big BTC Supports appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Donald Trump,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2024-12-09 07:18:35

Since this currency is purely driven by community and internet hype, it’s very volatile and difficult to predict. However, with the recent Coinbase announcement, MOG is expected to see some major growth. On December 3, Coinbase announced that MOG would be added to its listing roadmap. Soon after that, its value increased by more than 20%, bringing its total market cap close to $1 billion. It is now ranked among one of the top 150 currencies in the industry. This is the best time to invest in MOG coins before it gets too late. In the meantime, we also have some other coin recommendations that are expected to go through a similar surge very soon. Do check those out. 4 Other Meme Coins To Keep An Eye On If you feel you’ve missed the MOG rally, here are four other meme coins with good potential returns. 1. Cat Slap Cat Slap , whose official token is $SLAP, is going through some massive growth right now. It is an Ethereum-based meme coin inspired by the angry cat-slapping meme. Within the first 48 hours of being listed, its value jumped by 2000%. Right now, its total market cap is $33 million. Yes, it’s less but that makes it all the more investment-worthy. Tokens with high market cap often hit a saturation point, reducing the chances of making massive profits. What makes this the best time to invest in $SLAP is that it recently received an investment from Jump Trading – one of the most respected crypto trading firms. This might push $SLAP’s value even higher. So invest before it’s too late. 2. PEPU PEPU is the official token of Pepe Unchained. Right now, it’s in the final days of its presale and has already managed to raise $64 million. This leaves interested users with only a few days in hand to get the tokens at a discounted rate. But the question is, is it really worth it? Well, we think it is. It’s not just a regular token. Pepe Unchained is actually building a Layer-2 blockchain that makes up for the shortcomings of the Ethereum network. We are all familiar with the network clogs that blockchains sometimes face. The transaction becomes slow and expensive and the investor might miss out on a bunch of amazing opportunities. Pepe Unchained, on the other hand, will be fast and cheap, providing a much simpler trading experience. Right now, its average price is $0.012 and by 2025, it’s expected to hit an average price of $0.020 which is roughly a 67% jump. 3. POPCAT POPCAT has also had a very positive year. For those who don’t know, this is a cat meme token, inspired by a viral cat named Oatmeal. It’s currently listed at $1.64. It was launched in December last year but it wasn’t until March 2024 that it started getting attention. After that, it has been an entirely uphill journey. Within 7 months, it grew by 400%. If it continues at this rate, we can easily expect a jump of more than 450% in 2025. 4. Flockerz Flockerz is another popular meme token that’s trending at the moment. It’s a type of vote-to-earn platform where users can earn FLOCK tokens by voting on simple decisions. For instance, let’s say they ask the users whether Flockerz should be listed on a certain exchange. Users can vote yes or no, and regardless of the outcome, they will receive some tokens. 25% of the total token supply is kept for such rewards. The rest are for sales, which by the way is going pretty well. The presale of its tokens is going on and it has already raised over $4 million from early investors. Some expert analysts also believe that once the tokens are finally launched on an exchange, it can make some investors millionaires overnight. The Right Time to Invest Bitcoin recently crossed the $100K mark and the entire crypto market is now heated up. Whatever tokens go on presale right now has a much higher chance of experiencing exponential growth by 2025. So if you have missed out on the MOG frenzy, remember you still have 4 amazing opportunities to cash into.",Altcoin|catslap|coinbase|flockerz|meme coins|MOG meme coin|pepe unchained|pepu|POPCAT,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|MOG,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2024-12-09 07:19:58

Ethereum ( ETH ) touched a local high of $4,100 over the weekend and has been consolidating close to that level over the last two days. The leading altcoin faced a mild 0.8% correction in the past 24 hours and is trading at $3,950 at the time of writing. ETH price | Source: crypto.news The asset’s market cap is hovering at $475 billion. Ethereum recorded a 21% rise in its daily trading volume to $24.5 billion.

The largest exchange net outflow of almost 104,000 ETH came on Dec. 4 ETH exchange net flows | Source: IntoTheBlock The large holder-to-exchange net flow ratio, currently at negative 0.65%, suggests that retail investors have been more active than whales, per ITB data. You might also like: Global think tank proposed Bitcoin reserve to Amazon Data from ITB suggests that the Ethereum large holder inflows plunged to a one-month low of 197,160 ETH on Sunday — bringing a net outflow of 4,550 ETH from whale addresses. This movement usually indicates a whale selloff, potentially triggering a short-term correction. Moreover, the whale transaction volume consisting of at least $100,000 worth of ETH also plunged from $17 billion to $4.8 billion between Dec. 6 and 8, according to data from ITB. One of the key catalysts for Ethereum’s rally to the $4,000 zone was the spot ETH exchange-traded funds in the U.S. These investment products recorded a net inflow of $836.8 last week. Ethereum’s decentralized finance sector also recorded strong growth. The ETH DeFi total value locked reached $77 billion on Monday for the first time since April 2022, per data from Defi Llama. What’s next for Ethereum? Depends on the data you’re looking at. The declining whale activity could trigger FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) among retail investors, potentially initiating a correction before another major run. Crypto Rover, a prominent crypto analyst and influencer, pointed out the similarity between the Bitcoin ( BTC ) breakout to the $100,000 mark and Ethereum’s current price action. https://twitter.com/rovercrc/status/1865787671987339352 While the ETH and BTC price movement over the last four years looks similar, investor sentiment and macroeconomic changes could push the volatile crypto market in unexpected directions.

Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) rise past $100,000 has sparked excitement, though Russian investors aren’t counting on it hitting $200,000 this cycle, according to analysts polled by Russia’s state news agency TASS. They estimate Bitcoin could climb as high as $160,000 but don’t see it doubling its current price anytime soon. As for the reason behind Bitcoin’s recent growth, analysts point to macroeconomic changes, such as the Federal Reserve’s rate cuts after a prolonged tightening phase, along with rising global liquidity and inflation concerns, which have driven investors to scarce assets like Bitcoin. Institutional adoption is also a major factor, with companies like MicroStrategy and BlackRock quickly building up their Bitcoin holdings. In early December, MicroStrategy doubled down on its crypto strategy, acquiring 15,400 BTC for $1.5 billion, with an average purchase price of $95,976 per coin. With the latest acquisition, MicroStrategy’s crypto holdings now stand at approximately 402,100 BTC, valued at nearly $40 billion. At the same time, Bitcoin options and exchange-traded funds are gaining more attention, with the latter nearing $113 billion in total net assets, per data from SoSoValue. Despite the enthusiasm, analysts remain cautious about Bitcoin’s long-term outlook. Some see two possible scenarios: a “conservative target” of $130,000 and a more optimistic ceiling of $160,000 by mid-summer 2025. However, they agree that a $200,000 level, if reached, will likely not occur in the current cycle.

With the index nearing its dot-com-era peak valuation, Hartnett predicts an “overshoot” for Bitcoin and stocks in early 2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s rise continues, with reports indicating that top tech giants are considering adding it to their balance sheets. As crypto.news previously reported , the National Center for Public Policy Research, an independent conservative think tank based in Washington D.C., has suggested that Amazon consider adding Bitcoin to its strategic reserve. The proposal aims to use the company’s $88 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which includes U.S. government, corporate, and foreign bonds, to include Bitcoin in its reserve by the next annual meeting in April 2025. A few weeks ago, MicroStrategy founder Michael Saylor also proposed a Bitcoin reserve for Microsoft, although a final decision has yet to be made.

This collaboration serves to further reinforce Chainlink’s position as a facilitator of real-world data on the blockchain, and further the use of blockchain in numerous sectors. The more projects that need reliable data feeds to interact with smart contracts, the more critical Chainlink’s decentralized oracle network.

Notably, the yet-to-be-identified hacker promoted a fake token and alleged that ADA withdrawals would stop as a result of a crackdown by the U.S. SEC. In turn, the broader market saw a flurry of concerns, with even the native coin’s price showing a waning intraday movement. Cardano Foundation X Account Faces Hack Raising Market Concerns According to an X post by the coin’s community’s account as of December 8, “the Cardano Foundation X account @Cardano_CF has been compromised.” Further, the crypto team urged users to ignore any posts from this account whilst the team addressed the issue. In the aftermath of the X account compromise, users on the social media platform saw a false promotion for a token named ADAsol. This false promotion bragged of a revolutionary bridge that came as a collaborative endeavor between the abovementioned entity and Solana. Also, users on the platform saw an X post claiming that ADA withdrawals had been stopped as the U.S. SEC tightened its grip on the crypto project. Nevertheless, this post appears to have been deleted. Overall, the X account hack saga garnered noteworthy attention, underscoring the complexities of cyber security and its vitality in the crypto realm. Further, the project’s native coin, one of the leading crypto by market cap , also faced severe market turbulence in light of the attack. ADA Price Wanes Amid Concerns At the time of reporting, ADA price slipped nearly 3% intraday and is currently trading at $1.16 after the Cardano Foundation incident. Its intraday low and high were $1.15 and $1.22, respectively. Notably, the slumping intraday movement falls in line with market concerns rising in the wake of the abovementioned hack. However, it’s also noteworthy that the monthly chart underscored gains worth 166%, conversely sparking optimism amid a bullish Q4. Market watchers remain apprehensive as the X account hack could spark negative market sentiments if not recovered. However, a recent price analysis by CoinGape revealed that Cardano whales are on an accumulation spree , further bringing optimism contrary to the hack. Intriguingly, the analysis shows that a $2 target for the coin looms ahead amid renewed crypto market interest in Q4.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Solana, Tron, and Cutoshi gear up for major moves, with whale activity boosting SOL, TRX nearing breakout levels, and Cutoshi transforming MemeFi with its smart ecosystem. Table of Contents Solana is consolidating just below the $240 resistance. Tron enters re-accumulation phase after reaching ATH Cutoshi is the new star in the meme coin galaxy Solana (SOL) appears ready for the next leg up as large buyers continue to snipe the bottoms and add more SOL to their already massive positions. Meanwhile, Tron (TRX) and Cutoshi (CUTO) are also teasing new breakouts that could send them soaring in the upcoming weeks. Cutoshi, in particular, has been capturing the attention of crypto veterans and meme enthusiasts. With its revolutionary MemeFi ecosystem, Cutoshi could soon redefine the entire meme coin space and become one of the hottest plays of 2025. Solana is consolidating just below the $240 resistance. Solana continues to play a protagonist role in the current crypto market with its $113 billion market cap that puts it at the 5th place on the crypto totem pole. Solana has been range bound over the past two weeks after it reached a new all-time high of $263. Following a retracement, Solana revisited lower levels and every dip was scooped, showing sustained buyer interest. On-chain tracker Lookonchain has drawn attention to a significant surge in whale activity over the week. 4 large Solana wallets have withdrawn around 185,000 SOL tokens from Binance, worth approximately $42 million. Moreover, Solana continues to benefit immensely from the ongoing meme season, as its meme coin factory is working overtime, with tens of new projects launching every day. Although their utility is questionable, to say the least, it’s undeniable that this euphoria is funneling insane revenue numbers back into Solana’s ecosystem. This is also significant for meme coins that provide a real use case, such as Cutoshi, built on Ethereum blockchain, for example. As this meme cycle is maturing, investors are now looking to rotate capital into utility-driven narratives built to thrive in the long run.

Even throughout the turbulent summer months, Tron demonstrated surprising stability and in November it surged by over 150%, reaching a new all-time high of $0.43. As traders booked profits, Tron experienced a pullback and is now selling for $0.31 with a 3.8% intraday decrease. Right now, Tron is regaining strength as it is constantly tapping into a high-demand zone around the $0.30 mark. Trader and analyst Mihir points out that this latest peak in Tron’s price coincides with an ascending trendline where previous cycles’ highs line up. This trendline has acted as a dynamic resistance level and if Tron breaks out, it could enter escape velocity and surge above $1 in the upcoming months. Cutoshi is the new star in the meme coin galaxy Cutoshi comes into play at the meeting point between memes and DeFi. The project introduces a cutting-edge decentralized platform, CUTO DEX, which bridges the gap between isolated blockchains and allows users to instantly swap between assets. Cutoshi draws inspiration from the Lucky Cats in Japanese folklore. These cats are believed to bring good fortune to businesses. Cutoshi tokenizes luck and brings it to the blockchain so that early investors can reap the rewards. Cutoshi will offer monetary incentives to users for staking the CUTO token or providing liquidity. Moreover, community members will have the opportunity to complete fun tasks and quests and earn additional income through the Cutoshi Farming initiative. Stage 4 of the presale is now live and CUTO is priced at just $0.031. This is the perfect point for early buyers who want to be on the winning side of the new, utility-driven meme coin project.

Yes, absolutely. Do I think we had an impact in Arizona? A Democratic senator in Arizona, Gallego?

Shiba Inu Has Shown Impressive Resilience In 2024 As one of the fastest-growing memecoins in the market, Shiba Inu (SHIB) just doesn’t seem to slow down. Frequently likened to Dogecoin (DOGE), SHIB has cleverly walked its own path, sitting at $0.00003278, with a market cap of $19.32 billion, making it a real player in the cryptosphere. Often referred to as a meme coin, Shiba Inu offers functionalities that go beyond hype, contributing to its emerging adoption. SHIB has increased by 20.45% in the past 24 hours and 31.19% in the last seven days. And has jumped up 82.62% over the past month. But like many cryptocurrencies, SHIB’s volatility is a concern. It has delivered huge short-term profits for some investors, but future performance is anything but certain. Those in pursuit of more reliable, long-term ways to build wealth beyond meme coins are turning towards alternatives such as 1FUEL, which are poised to redefine how we generate wealth. Why Dogecoin Remains A Hotspot Going by market capitalization, the largest meme coin is Dogecoin (DOGE). Though rooted in fun, DOGE has become so popular it has risen to the top of the pack as a key player in the crypto market. DOGE is trading near a major resistance area at $0.4500. Its market cap has jumped 450% from its lowest this year to over $65 billion. In a week, its time-weighted price has increased by 2.72%, and in a month, an eye-popping 169.99%. Analysts are optimistic that the ongoing consolidation could be the momentum-gathering stage before the coin jumps to $1. Experts predict that the coin may soon have a strong bullish breakout in the next few days. A likely catalyst for the DOGE price will be the ongoing Bitcoin (BTC) rally now that first broke a key resistance at $100,000 before dipping. Higher BTC prices often lead to more interest in low-priced meme coins. Can 1Fuel Be A New Millionaire Maker In 2025? As the DeFi ecosystem evolves, investors are popularizing a new privacy-centric next-generation wallet. 1FUEL is one of the most popular tokens on presale now. The new altcoin’s promising future has attracted top investors as one of the top crypto presales of 2024. With its one-click cross-chain transactions, this wallet is set to change the game in digital asset management. Some of these potential successes are deeply tied to the value 1FUEL offers. This innovative wallet simplifies managing transactions and portfolios, provides market insights, and rewards users with various incentives. What really sets 1FUEL apart is its 30% APR rewards and its advanced technology. Under the hood automation will also remove transaction complications, making it transparent for users. In fact, 1FUEL will also include a privacy mixer feature and cold storage technology positioning it as one of the best cryptos to invest in 2024. With these features, investors are able to control their money and protect their identity. Join the 1FUEL presale now because it is limited in supply and has 500X return potential. Only 500 million tokens are available. Going by the present pace of accumulation, the token price will not be at $0.01 for long. The more the presale proceeds, the higher the token’s value will go. So, the entry point is now for investors who seek maximum profit. Conclusion While Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) forecasts are bullish in the short term. They may not give the desired sustainable returns for investors seeking significant, long-term wealth creation. Experts believe in 1fuels potential to likely deliver 500X returns by 2025. Given the present pace of accumulation, the 500 million tokens will not last long. Join the 1FUEL presale now, as experts predict it will become the best cryptos to invest in 2024.

But how did we arrive at this six-figure landmark? Bitcoin's collective mining balances have been dropping since April, 2024.

Over the past seven weeks, these investors have amassed an additional 103,960 BTC—a pace of accumulation not seen since March-June 2021. Historically, this group’s behavior has played a crucial role in shaping Bitcoin’s long-term price trajectory, making it clear that cryptocurrency remains the domain of large-scale players. Bitcoin's new all-time high of ~$103,656 on @coinbase was a six-figure milestone many were anticipating following the massive crypto-wide price surges that began on US election night exactly a month ago.

Interestingly, these wallets have shown little correlation with price movements this year, while non-mining whales and sharks continue to accumulate. For now, this trend offers a mixed signal for Bitcoin’s immediate future. Bitcoin’s Price Volatility During Bitcoin’s rally past $100,000, perpetual funding rates on derivatives platforms spiked to 0.062% before cooling off, although they remain elevated. This indicates lingering leverage in the market, which could influence price volatility in the short term. During the #Bitcoin rally above $100K, the hourly perpetual funding rates spiked to around 0.062% before sharply declining. Still, rates remain high compared to earlier this week, reflecting lingering leverage in the system.

At this point, according to the data, PEPE has surpassed Uniswap (UNI) and Litecoin (LTC) and is ranked 20th in terms of market capitalization. Accordingly, PEPE continued its upward momentum, surpassing the $11.37 billion market cap and reaching new highs, leaving Uniswap (UNI) and Litecoin (LTC) behind. While PEPE has achieved great success, analysts state that this success is due to increased whale activity and increased accessibility through platforms such as MoonPay. At this point, popular cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez said that institutional interest in PEPE has increased, stating that whales increased their PEPE holdings by $1.14 billion over the weekend. The analyst noted that historically, such accumulation preceded price rallies, and that whales laid the foundation for upward momentum with their accumulation. It was also stated that PEPE’s integration with MoonPay was behind this rise. Accordingly, MoonPay now allows more than 20 million users in 180 countries to purchase tokens through platforms such as Apple Pay and Venmo. *This is not investment advice.

The latest report suggests that the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) has submitted a proposal to add BTC to its balance sheet as part of the corporate treasury strategy by April 2025. Amazon to Make the Bitcoin Move to Protect $88 Billion Reserves? NCPPR, a free-market think tank has suggested Amazon put part of its $88 billion cash reserves into Bitcoin, as a hedge against inflation. In comparison to traditional assets and corporate bonds, the think tank also highlights Bitcoin’s greater supremacy, Additionally, it also states how Tesla and MicroStrategy have been successful by gaining Bitcoin exposure over the past few years. In its report, NCPPR noted that the inflation-measuring metric – Consumer Price Index (CPI) – is currently at 4.95%, calling it a “Remarkably poor measure” of currency debasement. The author Tim Kotzman stated that the true inflation could be double of the reported CPI figure. This significantly depletes Amazon’s $88 billion in cash and short-term cash equivalents, the letter emphasized, suggesting that Bitcoin (BTC) should be utilized as a hedge to safeguard shareholder value. While comparing the Bitcoin price performance with corporate bonds, the report noted: “As of December 6, 2024, the price of Bitcoin increased by 131% over the previous year, outperforming corporate bonds by 126% on average. Over the past five years, the price of Bitcoin increased by 1,246%, outperforming corporate bonds by 1,242% on average.” Bitcoin is facing strong resistance at $100K level amid strong selling pressure from long-term holders. However, any news of a purchase from Amazon could usher in strong liquidity for the asset. Interestingly, this development comes at a time when Microsoft shareholders are set to vote for putting Bitcoin on the company’s balance sheet. MicroStrategy chairman Michael Saylor has shared a blueprint with the tech giant to bring $5 trillion additional value for MSFT shareholders. BTC to $200K In 2025? Crypto market analysts believe that this is the beginning of the Bitcoin supercycle with the BTC price rally likely to extend to $200K by 2025 end. Banking giant Standard Chartered predicted that BTC rally to $200K is very much possible by the end of 2025. In a note shared with investors, Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick said: “We would turn even more bullish if BTC saw more rapid uptake by U.S. retirement funds, global sovereign wealth funds, or a potential US strategic reserve fund. In 2025, we expect institutional flows to continue at or above the 2024 pace. MicroStrategy is running ahead of its USD 42 billion three-year plan, so its purchases in 2025 should match or exceed its 2024 purchases”. As of press time, BTC price was trading 0.45% down at $99,786 with a market cap of $1.97 trillion while its daily trading volumes surged 30% to more than $53 billion. This has significantly cooled down considering $100 billion-plus in daily trading volumes last when BTC rallied to its all-time high levels.

In a later post, they shared a false announcement claiming that the company would cease its support for Cardano’s native ADA token due to a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Cardano Foundation Hacked The hacked X account was on Sunday first used to announce a token dubbed $ADASOL, a Solana-based token that was allegedly “Cardano, reimagined for Solana’s speed and innovation.” In the 13-part thread, the hackers explained $ADASOL’s goal, citing genuine resources, including the Cardano Foundation’s website and a recent podcast episode that supposedly discussed the token. $ADASOL generated roughly $500,000 in trading volume before crashing by 99% as traders realized it was a scam token. The post was deleted an hour later when the Cardano Foundation account posted another false announcement. The new post warned the Cardano community this time that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had unleashed a lawsuit against the Swiss non-profit. “In light of this unexpected legal action, we have made the difficult decision to immediately cease all support towards the $ADA token to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements,” the fraudulent notice reads in part. At press time, both the $ADASOL scam token post and the subsequent bogus notice of imminent SEC lawsuit had been removed. Typically, such news tends to impact tokens in the ever-volatile crypto market negatively. Still, the price of Cardano’s ADA remained unfazed as Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson quickly dispelled the misinformation. “Looks like the CF account got hacked.

ADA was valued at $1.18 as of press time, a 1% drop on the day according to CoinGecko data as the Cardano Foundation is working to fix the compromised account. “The Cardano Foundation X account @Cardano_CF has been compromised,” the company announced on its LinkedIn page . “Please ignore any posts from the account at this time while we address this.

The hint comes from a tweet by Jez Corden on X. Corden often writes about Xbox news and usually posts inside information regarding the company. Therefore his tweet has many to speculate that he could be hinting towards Xbox-related reveals. Moreover, The Game Awards is also a place for future announcements as much as it is the platform for celebrating the biggest successes in the gaming world. Oh boy, @geoffkeighley cooked — Jez (@JezCorden) December 7, 2024 Corden praised the show’s producer and host Geoff Keighley in the cryptic message. He tweeted “Oh boy, Geoff Keighley cooked.” Although he didn’t give more details, his comment was more than enough for fans to start speculating and hoping. However, no such thing has been confirmed by any official source from the company. Still, it is to be noted that Xbox has a history of making some big reveals at the event, including the Xbox Series X console and their big first-party games. The gaming company could be in the spotlight again if Corden’s hint is correct. Xbox may reveal the new trailers for its 2025 lineup 2025 is shaping up to be a major year for Xbox, with games like Avowed, South of Midnight, Fable, and DOOM: It’s the Dark Ages on the release schedule. Other highly anticipated titles are State of Decay 3, Perfect Dark, Marvel’s Blade, and Gears of War: E-Day.

The movement of such large quantities of AXS into Binance may reflect an intent to enhance liquidity or capitalize on market conditions. As an early backer of Axie Infinity, Binance Labs’ involvement underscores its influential role in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The significant amount of AXS still held by Binance Labs indicates ongoing confidence in the project, even as it adjusts its holdings through calculated transfers. These developments come amid broader market movements, with investors closely watching Binance Labs’ activities for insights into potential trends. The transfer of high-value tokens like AXS and GMT suggests that Binance Labs remains deeply engaged in shaping the market landscape, leveraging its position as both an investor and liquidity provider. For now, Binance Labs’ holdings and transfer strategies continue to play a pivotal role in supporting the liquidity and stability of key projects in the crypto space.

Trump’s Tesla (TRUMTESLA), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 15,000% in price in the coming days. This is because TRUMTESLA is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Trump’s Tesla can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Trump’s Tesla could become the next viral memecoin. Trump’s Tesla launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Trump’s Tesla on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Trump’s Tesla by entering its contract address – 8T1qq1DxSqWqoR8J9hi3ULGCCoMJdqQBev4WAvJg9awR – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like TRUMTESLA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-09 08:15:00

The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was widely regarded as a viral nuisance by many of these “serious tech companies” until a few years ago. However, developments afterward have forced them to change their stance towards the crypto sector, especially BTC itself. Shareholders to Decide Investing in Bitcoin According to a press communique from Microsoft’s PR firm, the tech company’s shareholders are set to vote on a proposal to invest in digital currency on December 10. This is expected to be a major watershed moment for the tech sector and the crypto economy, as it would result in other IT firms following suit. Even more interesting is that Microsoft’s board is against specific investments in the digital currency economy. The governing body stated on record that the company has already evaluated and invested in a wide range of assets, including BTC itself. So, there is no need for a specific allocation for it. Bill Gates Opposes Move The company’s stance is in line with its founder Bill Gates’ views, who has consistently criticized the digital asset sector over the years. According to Gates, Bitcoin’s speculative nature and the environmental challenges it poses make it a less compelling financial instrument. However, the shareholders may not see it this way and can vote to overrule the board and Gates himself, who owns a large chunk of the company. $100 Billion into Bitcoin? If Microsoft decides to invest in Bitcoin , it could propel the crypto economy upwards even more. According to the latest filings, the company behind Windows and Office software has cash reserves and liquid assets worth over $78 billion. A large chunk of this money could end up in Bitcoin. The firm’s involvement may cause a snowball effect in the IT industry, potentially pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into this economy. Michael Saylor and Microstrategy could be dwarfed soon enough by these big players in the near future.

Analysts polled by Reuters expected November prices to increase by 0.5% instead of the 0.3% October increase. China’s producer price index dipped for the 26th consecutive month, with November’s drop of 2.5% lesser than the 2.8% predicted by the analysts in the Reuters poll. The decline in factory prices was also lower compared to the same period last year. Core inflation, which excluded volatile fuel and food prices, climbed 0.3% in November from October’s 0.2%. Year over year, pork and fresh vegetable prices rose by 13.7% and 10%, respectively. The prices of ferrous metal materials fell by 7.1%, leading to a decline in the purchaser price index of industrial producers. Chemical raw materials plunged 5%, while fuel and power saw a 6.5% drop. Experts believe China’s deflation will continue amid trade wars China consumer prices climb less than expected as economy slows amid trade war worries https://t.co/rC1SLLfQVd — CNBC (@CNBC) December 9, 2024 Erica Tay, the director of macro research at Maybank, said that China’s PPI deflation still seemed ‘quite entrenched’ although it had narrowed slightly. She told CNBC that accumulated producer inputs and finished goods inventories were sizable and grew from month to month. According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report, persistent near-zero retail inflation showed that China’s economy struggled with low domestic demand as wholesale prices remained deflationary. Domestic demand remained sluggish despite Beijing’s series of stimulus efforts since September, which included interest rate cuts, support for stock and property markets, and efforts to incentivize bank lending. “We believe deflation will continue in China, especially based on the previous experience during trade wars.” ~ Becky Liu , Head of China macro strategy at Standard Chartered Bank Liu said that PPI inflation typically fell to negative territory during trade wars, referencing the ongoing U.S.-China trade war. She pointed out that the situation was no different, adding that China’s producer price index inflation was likely to remain negative the following year. Goldman Sachs predicts that China’s near-zero CPI figures will continue into 2025 The investment bank’s analysts similarly projected that China’s near-zero consumer price index figures would persist next year. The analysts, however, noted that some parts of the economy showed signs of recovery. China reported strong retail sales growth in October, beating expectations from Reuters analysts. In November, the second-largest economy in the world also showed expansion in manufacturing activities for two months in a row, according to Goldman Sachs . According to CNBC, top Chinese leaders are expected to meet at the Central Economic Work Conference starting December 11th to discuss 2025’s stimulus measures and economic goals. On December 9th, Fitch Ratings reduced their forecast of China’s 2025 GDP growth from 4.5% to 4.3%. The credit rating agency adjusted its September projections for 2026 growth downwards from 4.3% to 4%. Brian Coulton, Fitch Ratings Chief Economist, assumed that the U.S. trade policies towards China would take a sharp ‘projectionist turn’ for 2025 and 2026. He noted that an extended decline in the property market posed a critical risk to the agency’s forecast, although there were ‘tentative signs of stabilization’. Notably, China will report its November trade data and retail sales on December 10th and December 16th, respectively.

That's precisely the situation facing bitcoin ( BTC ) and XRP (XRP) traders. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency by market value, is trading at record highs near $100,000, meaning it's now in uncharted waters. XRP trades at $2.44, with the 2018 record high around $3.30 as the only chart resistance before we enter the price discovery mode like BTC. One way to identify key resistances is to study the distribution of open interest, the dollar value of active option contracts, at various strike price levels. On Deribit, the world's leading crypto options exchange, BTC's $120,000 strike call option is the most popular contract at the moment, with a notional open interest of $1.93 billion, according to data source Deribit Metrics. A strike with the highest open interest often marks a resistance level because call sellers, typically institutions, face significant losses if prices rise above that point. As a result, they often act to keep prices from exceeding that level. Conversely, the strike level can also act as a magnet due to the hedging activity of market makers or entities tasked with creating order book liquidity. Recall that before and immediately after the U.S. election, the $100,000 call was the most preferred in terms of notional open interest. The price has now consolidated around the six-figure mark. At press time, the call option at the $100,000 strike is still the second-most popular contract, with open interest of $1.8 billion. It is followed by the $110,000 strike call, which boasts open interest of $1.68 billion. We can also see that $500 million is locked in the $200,000 strike call, representing a bet that the bitcoin price will double. Most open interest is concentrated in the June 2025 and September 2025 expiries. Analysts at Standard Chartered say they expect the price to reach that level by the end of 2025. Key levels for XRP In XRP's case, the $1 call option is the most popular strike, with over $3 million in open interest. The option is deeply in-the-money, or in profit, as the cryptocurrency currently trades near $2.42. The focus now is on the $2.8 call option, where traders have locked in $2 million in open interest. The next potential target is at $5. The so-called deep out-of-the-money call is the third-most active open, with open interest of $1.12 million.",Markets|Bitcoin|XRP|Options,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2024-12-09 09:11:15

The company’s expansions in Ohio and proprietary energy innovations, like two-phase immersion cooling, significantly reduce costs and improve efficiency. MARA's hybrid strategy of retaining mined Bitcoin and leveraging debt for more Bitcoin positions it well for potential price appreciation. Despite strong growth and innovative strategies, MARA faces risks from Bitcoin price volatility and reliance on external energy markets. MARA Holdings ( MARA ) is currently at the frontier of the crypto boom. The company is capitalizing on advanced technologies and strategic acquisitions to cement its position as a leader in bitcoin mining and energy-efficient computing. Mara is successfully navigating the volatile and increasingly competitive crypto industry through large expansions in mining capacity and cost-saving measures. Mining Operations MARA's recent expansion really shows its commitment to growing its scale and efficiencies. The company has increased its interconnect-approved capacity by 372 MW for three data centers in Ohio alone in Q3 of 2024. This puts MARA in a great position to expand its mining operations for the foreseeable future. The company also acquired its Hopedale and Hannibal facilities at just $270,000 per MW. This figure is far below the industry average of around $900,000-$1.5 million per MW. MARA is also developing a greenfield facility in Ohio, which should add another 150 MW of capacity. These expansions are part of MARA's strategy of growing its operations. They also allow Mara to reduce its dependence on third-party providers. MARA will be able to significantly minimize operation risks and improve cost by owning and operating 65% of its 1.5 HW of compute capacity. This vertical integration aligns with its goal to lead the digital asset sector while at the same time maintaining flexibility in energy sourcing. Energy Innovations Energy efficiency is very important in the energy-intensive Bitcoin mining industry. In fact, the overall energy consumption of Bitcoin mining is now comparable to the energy consumption of some smaller countries like Poland. MARA is successfully taking steps to address this challenge through technological advancements and a growing list of partnerships. The company has developed its own propriety Two-Phase Immersion Cooling technology, which greatly improves energy efficiency by increasing power density compared to traditional methods by up to four times. MARA has also successfully reduced cooling costs by up to 60%. MARA has also established a partnership with NGON, which converts flared natural gas into electricity. This partnership has allowed the company to reduce electricity costs to nearly $0.01 per kWh. This figure is around four times less than the market average price, showing MARA's ability to acquire energy generation at incredibly cheap costs. Because of these improvements, MARA is one of the most cost-competitive bitcoin miners in the industry by increasing efficiencies. MARA Bitcoin's Rise and MARA's Strong Strategic Positioning Bitcoin's change from a niche asset to a globally recognized digital store of value has provided companies like MARA the opportunity to thrive. MARA has seized upon Bitcoin's growing popularity by expanding operations and growing its holdings. Bitcoin has unique attributes as the first major digital asset. For instance, it has an artificially capped supply and a decentralized nature. This has made it an increasingly valuable asset for investors seeking to diversify. While companies like MicroStrategy ( MSTR ) have taken a more direct investment approach by accumulating Bitcoin as a corporate treasury asset, MARA is also focused on Bitcoin mining. MARA not only accumulates Bitcoin but also generates revenue from its production of Bitcoin by taking advantage of its increasingly large and energy-efficient mining operation. On top of this, MARA is also in a great position to copy MicroStrategy's innovative playbook of accumulating debt to buy even more bitcoin. MARA incorporates a hybrid strategy in which it retains much of the bitcoin it mines. This allows MARA to benefit from potential price appreciation while it focuses on its mining operations to ensure steady revenue generation. This also allows MARA to employ MicroStrategy's ""infinite money glitch"" strategy of borrowing money at cheap rates in order to buy more bitcoin, hoping for bitcoin to appreciate, and making money off the difference. MARA Financials MARA reported good results in Q3. The company's revenues increased to $131.6 million during the quarter, which represents a jump from $97.8 million YOY. MARA was able to maintain its production levels and mined 2,070 Bitcoins during the quarter, despite Bitcoin's volatility during the quarter. The company also holds a great deal of Bitcoin in reserve, with 26,747 Bitcoin valued at nearly $3 billion at current prices. This figure will undoubtedly increase as MARA appears to be following MicroStrategy's lead in buying Bitcoin. The company is utilizing a long-term holding strategy as a leveraged play on Bitcoin's long-term appreciation. However, investors should be wary that MARA's strategy of shareholder dilution to fund its purchases is also a double-edged sword. MARA Risks Despite its strengths, MARA is still a risky investment. The company is involved in an incredibly volatile industry where Bitcoin price fluctuations can significantly impact profitability in the positive or negative. Donald Trump's presidential election victory has only increased volatility, given how much speculation has ramped up as a result. This risk is only increased by MARA's strategy of holding a large number of Bitcoin. This Bitcoin holding is often used as leverage to buy even more Bitcoin. Another major risk facing MARA is its dependence on stranded gas and external energy markets for cheap energy. If energy supply constraints or price increases occur, this can also have a negative impact on profitability, not to mention the additional risk of Bitcoin's price itself falling. These cheap energy sources are also relatively hard to find. Furthermore, while MARA's plans to move into AI are promising, it also leaves a lot of room for execution risks due to its untested nature. Conclusion MARA is taking a relatively new approach that has allowed it to do well in the digital asset space. While MARA is certainly not risk-averse, it represents a solid investment at its current valuation of ~$8 billion. While the company does have a relatively high forward PE of 40, MARA could see its market capitalization explode if Bitcoin continues to appreciate at its current rate.",MARA,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2024-12-09 09:20:01

With the current market value of gold at $18 trillion, Saylor's estimate would put the price of Bitcoin at around $8.6 million per coin. “Bitcoin will easily go up 10 times gold,” Saylor said in a recent interview, touting Bitcoin’s superiority as a store of value and treasury asset over traditional options like gold, real estate and bonds. Saylor cited the limitations of traditional commodities and assets for institutional and corporate treasuries, noting that Bitcoin offers a superior alternative due to its higher annualized rate of return (ARR) and better liquidity. “Gold offers an ARR of 7%, real estate 10%, and bonds around 4-5%. None of these beat the S&P benchmark cost of capital,” Saylor explained. Bitcoin, by contrast, offers an ARR of 60%, making it a more attractive asset for both companies and wealthy investors. Related News: Will Donald Trump Fire Fed Chairman Jerome Powell? He Gave His Answer Saylor argued that calling Bitcoin “digital gold” underestimates its potential. “Bitcoin is digital capital,” he said, suggesting that Bitcoin could replace not just gold but also real estate, the S&P index and other institutional capital assets. Looking forward, Saylor predicts that Bitcoin could become a “hundred trillion dollar asset class” by 2045, and projects a floor price of $13 million per coin. He predicts that Bitcoin's current volatility and rates of return will gradually decrease over the next two decades, eventually stabilizing as the asset matures. *This is not investment advice.

Key Risks and Market Trends You Need to Watch,https://coinpedia.org/news/is-bitcoin-going-to-crash-the-death-zone-signals-a-potential-downturn/,"The post Is Bitcoin Going to Crash? Key Risks and Market Trends You Need to Watch appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Bitcoin’s market is showing several warning signs as investor sentiment soars to extreme greed levels. The Fear & Greed Index has surged to 84, a number that has historically been a red flag for potential price corrections. Adding to the tension are key on-chain data metrics like the Sell-Side Risk Ratio and Net Taker Volume, which suggest that Bitcoin could be nearing its market peak. Bitcoin has already dropped 0.4% to $99,439 in just a few hours due to the growing negative sentiment. Could the market be on the brink of a significant downturn, or will key economic reports this week change the game entirely? As uncertainty looms, a closer look at market trends and expert analysis could give us answers. Experts Sound the Alarm: Bitcoin Nears Its “Death Zone” 10X Research analysts are warning investors to stay cautious. Their latest report highlights that Bitcoin is entering what they call its “death zone.” The term refers to altitudes above 8,000 meters in mountaineering, where survival becomes much harder due to reduced oxygen levels. Similarly, Bitcoin’s market indicators suggest it is entering a critical phase where price momentum could weaken significantly. For the past two weeks, Bitcoin has been trading within a tight range and forming a Doji candlestick pattern. This pattern is a classic sign of market uncertainty and indecision. While it can signal a period of consolidation, 10X Research suggests other signals indicate Bitcoin could be on the verge of a correction instead. Trading volumes are falling, and buying interest at these higher price levels is weakening—both of which are key signs that Bitcoin may struggle to maintain its current price near $100,000. The Market Is At Risk Bitcoin’s on-chain data reveals more concerning signs. Trading momentum is slowing, investor interest is declining, and market sentiment is beginning to shift. These factors are raising the risk of a price correction. While analysts don’t believe Bitcoin has already reached its peak, they emphasize that careful monitoring is vital in this phase. The market could either stabilize or face a downturn in the coming days. Bitcoin Is Bleeding Supporting bearish sentiment, Bitcoin’s intraday pullback of 1.74% led to $62.89 billion being wiped from the entire cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin’s total market cap is now $3.55 trillion. Technical analysis suggests that a bearish reversal from a local resistance level could lead to a 12% price drop, with $87,680 as the next potential support level. Liquidations have surged to $290 million as a result of this market downturn, with $217 million worth of long positions being wiped out. This indicates that selling pressure is growing, as investors react to the market’s current uncertainty. Rising Wedge Pattern Adds to Bearish Signals While some traders are still holding on to a bullish stance, technical analysis warns of further downside risks. A rising wedge pattern has formed, which is typically a bearish indicator. This suggests Bitcoin could see further price declines if the pattern continues to play out. What’s Next for Bitcoin? The next few days could be critical for Bitcoin as key economic reports like CPI and PPI are released and market sentiment shifts. Will Bitcoin be able to maintain its upward trend, or will these warning signs lead to a significant correction? Investors need to stay informed and monitor these trends closely. The market is volatile, and while opportunities exist, caution is key.",News|Altcoins|Bitcoin|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-09 09:24:12

LINK Price Attempts a Breakout Eyeing to Smash a New ATH,https://coinpedia.org/price-analysis/chainlink-golden-cross-alert-link-price-attempts-a-breakout-eyeing-to-smash-a-new-ath/,"The post Chainlink Golden Cross Alert! LINK Price Attempts a Breakout Eyeing to Smash a New ATH appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Chainlink continues to expand its use cases with multiple collaborations. In a recent update, the platform has joined Banco, Microsoft, &COMm in phase 2 of Brazil’s BRX CBDC pilot. Besides, the platform’s adoption rate has been soaring, suggesting a positive impact over its native token, LINK, which has broken above the range. The LINK price is demonstrating acute strength after rising above the horizontal consolidation and appears to be primed to rise over the current ATH shortly. The long-term price action of Chainlink suggests the price has been pretty volatile since the start. Therefore, the range-bound consolidation that persisted for more than 2 years has raised many concerns. However, the token broke the trend then and now, indicating there is more room for the token to swell. Currently, the LINK price is testing the levels not seen since January 2022. Now that the bulls who were stuck at the highs are slowly coming into profit, is there any possibility of LINK price marking a 3-digit figure in the upcoming bull run? The long-term chart of Chainlink prices is about to experience the very first weekly Golden Cross since its inception. However, it has been delayed for a couple of months and the recent upswing is expected to be an outcome of the bullish event. Meanwhile, the bears seem to have held a strong grip over the resistance zone between $27.55 and $28.41, which is restricting the rally from surpassing the zone. Secondly, the +Di of DMI levels has triggered a bearish divergence while the -Di continues to head towards the lower range. This suggests the LINK bulls could be exhausted for a while, which has been seen since the start of the week as selling pressure escalates. However, the bulls are trying hard to fight the bearish heat as it holds the ascending support. Meanwhile, the token has plunged below this support in the short term, which suggests the price may drop below $25. If the Bulls manage to trigger a healthy rebound before the day’s close, the upswing could be revived, causing the price to revamp a strong rise beyond $30.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|LINK|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2024-12-09 09:27:15

Dmitry V., whose identity is partially concealed under Polish law, is accused of fraud and money laundering during his tenure at WEX. WEX, once a prominent crypto platform and successor to BTC-e, collapsed in 2018 under allegations of illicit activity. The exchange, notorious for its lax identity verification practices, is alleged to have processed funds from high-profile hacks, including the infamous Mt. Gox breach . Reports estimate $450 million in customer funds went missing during its downfall. “The individual is in custody awaiting completion of the extradition process,” a Polish police spokesperson confirmed. If extradited to the U.S., Dmitry V. could face charges carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. A History of Controversies This is not Dmitry V.’s first brush with international law enforcement. In August 2021, Polish authorities detained him, only to release him after 40 days due to a court ruling. In the summer of 2022, Interpol apprehended him at Zagreb Airport in Croatia following a separate extradition request from Kazakhstan. Earlier, in 2019, Italian authorities also arrested him, but he was released after procedural errors were found in the extradition documents. WEX’s predecessor, BTC-e, has a similarly tainted legacy. Alexander Vinnik, known as “Mr. Bitcoin” and the former head of BTC-e, was extradited to the U.S. in 2022 after serving two years in a French prison. In May this year, Vinnik pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering involving transactions worth over $9 billion from 2011 to 2017. WEX’s Shadowy Legacy Lingers At its peak, WEX handled over $9 billion in transactions, boasting a user base of more than one million, including many in the United States. However, its reputation as a “dark” exchange, coupled with links to massive crypto hacks, has kept its legacy under scrutiny. Dmitry V.’s arrest is another chapter in the ongoing saga of crypto’s early-era scandals. The global crackdown on crypto-related fraud signals an evolving regulatory landscape aimed at ensuring transparency and accountability in the sector.

The altcoins are also in the red today following the weekend gains, with XRP and DOGE being among the poorest performers on a daily scale. BTC Stopped at $101K Perhaps on the heels of the substantial inflows toward the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the States, the primary cryptocurrency was finally able to break into six-digit territory last week. Recall that the asset exploded to a new all-time high of $103,650 on Thursday after gaining about $8,000 in a day. The bears were quick to intercept the move and pushed the cryptocurrency south hard. BTC dumped by over ten grand in hours, causing a cascade of liquidations in the process. However, it bounced off and started to reclaim ground on Friday and during the weekend. The top came at $102,000 on Friday and $101,300 on Sunday evening. However, both attempts were faced by rejections that drove the asset south. As of now, bitcoin stands shy of $99,000 after a minor daily decline. Its market capitalization has dumped to $1.960 trillion on CoinGecko, but its dominance over the alts has risen to 52.1% as most of them are deeper in the red. Bitcoin/Price/Chart 9.12.2024.

The amazing price behavior of the token reminds us of its historic parabolic increase in 2017; analysts also point to another cryptocurrency, Rexas Finance (RXS), which may be on the verge of a similarly explosive surge. XRP’s historic parabolic move in 2017 XRP broke onto the cryptocurrency scene in 2017. Early 2017 trading under $0.01 saw a rapid climb over the coming year. Between March 2017 and January 2018, XRP rocketed an amazing 51,000% to $3.40. The parabolic rise was due to the growing adoption of cryptocurrency and Ripple as a blockchain for international settlement. Those who purchased XRP at its lowest points saw unmatched gains, therefore bringing the cryptocurrency into front view. But the path since then has been turbulent, dotted with legal challenges—especially the SEC lawsuit against Ripple. XRP has shown endurance despite these challenges; its present price movement points to another record surge, perhaps just around the corner. Recent developments fueling XRP’s bullish momentum The retirement of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, an event many feel would help relieve regulatory pressure on Ripple, is one of several positive reasons for XRP’s recent climb. After the news, XRP’s price shot to $2.63, an 8.83% rise in 24 hours and a 5x gain over the past month. This momentum fits rising hope about Ripple’s continuous legal battles and the continuous worldwide expansion of its payment system. Should the positive attitude continue, experts estimate that XRP might reach $8.26 in the next six weeks, a 214% rise from its present level. Such a price surge would confirm XRP’s ranking as among the best-performing cryptocurrencies of the year. Rexas Finance (RXS): the new coin poised for a parabolic rise Although XRP’s path is interesting, another cryptocurrency is creating excitement since it reflects the potential of XRP’s 2017 surge. Thanks to its creative approach to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, analysts have found Rexas Finance (RXS) to be the next crypto ready for a parabolic movement. By enabling anyone to tokenize actual assets—from real estate to intellectual property—Rexas Finance is changing the crypto scene. Because of this flawless integration of blockchain technology with practical uses, RXS is positioned as a major participant in the next wave of crypto acceptance. The presale of Rexas Finance has already generated approximately $21.64 million; it is currently in its ninth stage at $0.125 per token. This robust presale performance highlights investor belief in the project’s long-term viability and ambition. Presale stages are fast selling out, so once the official release is over, RXS is expected to rise significantly. The RXS team has chosen a community-centric strategy instead of venture capital funding, specifically avoiding it. This choice guarantees the public the ability to actively engage in the project’s expansion and builds confidence. With the token rising to $64 in the next few months, projections show RXS could follow XRP’s 2017 parabolic move. For early investors, this would represent an amazing return and help to cement RXS’s reputation as a top-performance coin. A good audit by Certik has raised investor trust by verifying the project’s security and openness. The recent listing of RXS on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko further raised its profile, drawing a fresh wave of investors and driving its price momentum. XRP keeps drawing institutional and retail investors ready to profit from its comeback as it gets closer to a possible climb above $8.26. Rexas Finance, meanwhile, promises a fresh horizon for crypto investors with the possibility for exponential gains evocative of XRP’s past surge. With its price of $0.125, RXS offers a reasonable starting point for those looking for chances for high growth. The cryptocurrency’s strong roadmap and presale momentum suggest that it may surpass even the most hopeful estimates. Rexas Finance is positioned to change the crypto scene by merging innovative technology with a user-first approach. The positive momentum of XRP indicates a possible surge to $8.26, sparking interest in one of the most durable cryptocurrencies. However, Rexas Finance (RXS) is unique among the new coins that are ready to copy XRP’s 2017 parabolic increase. Act today to guarantee your place in Rexas Finance (RXS) before prices explode.

WLD plans to release 37.23 million tokens valued at $136.25 million, representing 5.04% of its circulating supply. This positions WLD ahead of previous leader Solana (SOL), which schedules the release of 524,030 tokens worth $121.36 million. However, it impacts only 0.11% of its supply. The linear unlock schedule continues with TIA preparing to release 6.99 million tokens ($56.95 million, 1.57% of supply), while DOGE plans a release of 94.47 million tokens valued at $44.01 million.

Babylon Labs have developed an innovative solution that uses the existing features of the Bitcoin network to allow for the staking of BTC without relying on bridges or smart contracts. This ensures that the Babylon staking solution maximally benefits from the inherent security of the Bitcoin blockchain, and in turn, the incentivization of staking helps bolster the security of other L2s and projects that are secured by Bitcoin. Users who choose to stake are rewarded for their contributions with Babylon Points, similar to wildly popular protocols such as EigenLayer that have been built on other chains such as Ethereum and Solana. As an official staking provider of the Babylon Bitcoin staking protocol, Bitrue has today launched a feature that provides their users with easy access to staking via Babylon, allowing them to potentially earn Babylon Points on the platform without requiring them to transfer any of their assets away from the exchange. Simultaneously, this BTC staked on Bitrue will generate additional rewards of BTC paid directly into the user’s account at 2.3% APR. With the price of BTC continuing to grow rapidly, this provides holders of BTC with multiple avenues to increase their wealth with minimal effort. “DeFi continues to be a huge growth area for the web3 industry, and while many thought that such a service would be impossible on Bitcoin, its imminent launch showcases the unlimited potential for innovation in this sector,” said Adam O’Neill, Chief Marketing Officer at Bitrue. “Babylon Labs are unlocking enormous value for consumers and developers alike, and we are excited to work alongside them to provide a new dual rewards program to ensure that Bitrue customers receive the best returns on their investments.” Bitrue will also automatically manage users’ Babylon Points, allowing them to see their points balance directly on the website. This one-stop dual rewards solution has been designed not only to maximize the earnings potential for Bitrue users but also to make the entire process as simple as possible. Users wishing to take advantage of this feature can get started now by heading to Bitrue’s Babylon Staking Page . About Bitrue Launched in July 2018, Bitrue is a diversified digital asset exchange that supports trading, loans, and investments.

XLM surged 630% while VET gained 330% in the past few weeks. Proposed Fed adoption and retailers’ activity triggered a recent surge in utility tokens. Utility coins such as Stellar (XLM) and VeChain (VET) have seen remarkable growth during the latest cryptocurrency market rally, which has been largely driven by Bitcoin. While Bitcoin recently hit a record high of $100,000, XLM and VET delivered significantly higher percentage gains, grabbing the spotlight in the crypto community. Utility Tokens Like XLM, XRP, and VET Outpace Bitcoin’s Gains Since the start of the bull run, XLM surged by an impressive 630%, far outpacing Bitcoin’s 55% rise. Similarly, VET climbed by nearly 330%, offering retail investors nearly six times the returns Bitcoin provided over the same period. This stark difference in performance has sparked growing interest in utility tokens and their role in the evolving crypto market.

Currently priced at $0.125, as many in the sector continue to depend on Ripple (XRP), crypto whales are increasingly turning their attention to Rexas Finance (RXS), an emerging RWA altcoin. Besides being budget-friendly; RXS offers a distinctive value proposition that differentiates it from other projects like XRP. 5 Reasons Crypto Whales are Buying Rexas Finance Let’s dive into top reasons crypto whales are flocking to Rexas Finance. . 1. Unmatched Growth Potential for Crypto Whales in the Presale Stage Rexas Finance is currently in its 9th Presale stage, which has already raised a total of $21.7 million with 297,263,821 tokens sold, and plenty more is expected in the future. These are significant numbers indicating the level of interest and confidence among investors. You have a rare chance to invest in one of the most sought-after early-stage cryptocurrencies in the DeFi sector for a reasonable price of $0.125 per token. The project’s evolution looks promising, with a roadmap featuring RWA tokenization and advanced tools like Rexas Launchpad and Token Builder on the way. A predicted listing price of $0.20 suggests a potential profit for presale participants, with additional benefits as the platform gains popularity. 2. Real-World Asset Tokenization: A True Innovation Rexas Finance advances beyond Ripple by applying blockchain to real-world assets. It denotes RWA tokenization model designed for fractional ownership of valuable assets (real estate, fine art, intellectual property) through its innovative IBC module. This tool addresses a significant drawback in the crypto sector—we typically cannot transform illiquid conventional assets into tradeable tokens on a decentralized platform. By addressing real-world issues, Rexas Finance is establishing itself as a project intended to maintain relevance and possess high-value applications indefinitely. 3. A $1 Million Giveaway Adds Immediate Appeal Rexas Finance takes a daring approach to reward the community and boost engagement by distributing a total of $1 Million. Twenty fortunate investors will receive $50,000 in RXS tokens each for completing an easy task that probably doesn’t have a monetary value. The team’s support of this announcement showcases their commitment to building and meeting the needs of the investor and community. This sharp difference is in clear opposition to Ripple’s greater emphasis on institutions, as Rexas actively supports ordinary investors within its ecosystem. Simultaneously, the initial giveaway demonstrates the project’s belief in a strong growth path and serves as a means of rewarding the early adopters. 4. Better Accessibility and Long-Term Vision Undoubtedly, Ripple (XRP) stands as a giant in the blockchain realm, yet its ongoing legal disputes with the SEC are fostering uncertainty regarding its future. Conversely, Rexas Finance overcomes these regulatory issues by completing a CertiK audit, adhering to industry standards and enhancing user confidence. Furthermore, Rexas Finance operates on the Ethereum blockchain — a framework characterized by its stability, scalability, and user-friendly tools for developers. It ensures a seamless integration with other blockchain initiatives to establish a robust base for ongoing growth. Centered on community, the RWA token merges innovation with compliance effectively. This equilibrium provides it a significant edge over Ripple’s institutional strategy regarding retail investors. 5. Value-Driven Tokenomics and Presale Transparency Clear and well-structured tokenomics is a fundamental characteristic of Rexas Finance. With a presale price set at $0.125, this investment is open to a diverse range of investors, and the substantial amount already collected ($21.7 million) demonstrates that the project has gained significant support and holds great potential for success. Rexas Finance (RXS) Tokenomics While platforms such as Ripple rely on partnerships with banks and financial institutions, Rexas Finance is entering the DeFi arena entirely through grassroots community backing. This model is in strong agreement with the principles of blockchain technology and seamlessly corresponds with the decentralization paradigm that defines the space, as well as its supporters and entrepreneurs. Due to the presale, there are few tokens left, a growing number of investors seeking a share of that limited supply, and the principles of supply and demand, the project benefits from significant potential for price appreciation. Rexas Finance: The Altcoin Crypto Whales are Eyeing for the Future of DeFi However, Rexas Finance represents the next evolution of what blockchain technology is capable of, following Ripple’s role in facilitating blockchain’s entry into conventional finance. Tokenizing real-world assets, ensuring accessibility for all, and rewarding early backers are what make RXS a strong investment opportunity compared to Ripple’s institutionalized method. Although it is one of the limited companies providing services online, Rexas Finance remains one of the few firms focused on community-driven and transparent investments in technological innovation. This is the altcoin to watch as crypto whales scramble to get a share and ready to grasp the future of defi. A crypto analyst has made bold prediction for this Solana’s rival , that it could reach $21 in 2025.

Interestingly, besides establishing the most popular blockchain network and launching the third biggest cryptocurrency, XRP, Ripple has also played a role in the 2024 US election outcome, as discussed during his appearance on 60 Minutes. However, the highlight of the day is the firm spending $150M in this Ripple SEC Case, in which the current SEC chair, Gary Gensler, is to blame, claims Brad. Brad Garlinghouse Revealed Ripple Struggles With SEC Brad Garlinghounse recently appeared in a CBS 60 Minutes interview. He discussed various topics, ranging from Ripple’s struggles with the SEC to political action committees’ influences on the recent US election. As the Ripple SEC Case has been going on for years, it has heavily impacted Ripple and its native token. As per the SEC’s claims, XRP is an unregistered security and not a commodity. However, this is behind the XRP price crash and struggles over the years. More importantly, Brad Garlinghouse argues that this is a “war on crypto, ” influenced by Gary Gensler, during CBS’s interview. Gary is the current SEC Chair and the most hated personality in the crypto industry. In his leadership, the SEC has filed more than 120 lawsuits against crypto service providers, restricting the industry’s growth. Among these, the most famous one is around XRP, as it has been going for the longest. However, the Ripple CEO once again discarded the claims of XRP’s security status during the 60-minute interaction. He claimed that he does not see any similarity between security and XRP. I think I’m reasonably intelligent about something like, ‘What is a security?’ Never once had I considered the possibility that XRP is a security,” said Brad Garlinghouse. More importantly, this war on crypto does not only impact the XRP price. Brad revealed that the firm has spent more than $150M battling the Ripple SEC Case. Other SEC-challenged crypto businesses have also faced the same monetary challenges. Fairshake Wouldn’t Have Existed Without Gary Gensler During the CBS interview, Brad Garlinghouse clarified that due to the SEC’s war on crypto, Ripple and other companies formed a superpack Fairshake. While explaining why Fairshake came into existence, the host asked if the outcome would have been different with some other SEC chair instead of Gary Gensler. Brad simply replied, “I’m not sure Fareshake would have existed.” The entire crypto community is welcoming the next SEC pick Paul Atkins , including Brad, which clearly confirms his acknowledgment that things would have been different in a different leadership. Fairshake was launched in 2023, three years after the Ripple SEC case. Three firms collectively launched a federal-independent expenditure-only committee to battle the SEC Chair, as its creation alone was the outcome of Gary Gensler and the SEC’s stance on cryptos. Many might think that the crypto industry’s demand to remove the SEC’s share in crypto regulation is for profitable and unregulated benefits. However, Brad Garlinghouse explained how they are not looking for deregulation but regulation. Interestingly, the same is what Trump might be working on as he wants to move the regulatory responsibility to the CFTC from SEC. We’ve been asking to be regulated. Just give us clear rules of the road. Brad Garlinghouse Unhappy With 60 Minutes Interview The 60-minutes interview is now live but has left the Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, and the crypto community unhappy with the misguided publication. Interestingly, the interview covered many aspects, but they failed to mention Key details about XRP and Ripple operation, said Brad Garlingouse in a recent X post. Crypto made its debut on @60Minutes tonight – there’s no doubt that these technologies will continue to become more and more mainstream – with influence and reach that will only continue to grow. A few things I do want to comment on after watching: I spoke with Margaret… — Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) December 9, 2024 More importantly, they missed the part that mentioned the Federal Judge’s ruling that XRP is not a security. Instead, they aired former SEC official John Reed Stark’s interview segment, which claimed that major US Judges believe that XRP is a security. The Ripple SEC case has already caged the XRP’s price performance but the misinformation about the crypto asset is still impacting its performance. However, things might get into the better picture with Gary Gensler’s resignation. Overall, the interviews have failed many investors’ expectations, as 60 Minutes missed many important aspects of XRP and Ripple strategies. More importantly, it failed to push the XRP price to $3, which many analysts have anticipated past the interview release.

According to a report published on Dec. 6 , the attackers started laying the groundwork for the Oct. 16 attack in mid-September, when a Telegram message from what appeared to be a trusted former contractor was sent to a Radiant Capital developer. The message said the contractor was pursuing a new career opportunity related to smart contract auditing and was seeking feedback. It included a link to a zipped PDF file, which the developer opened and shared with other colleagues. The message is now believed to have come from a “DPRK-aligned threat actor” who was impersonating the contractor, according to the report. The file contained a piece of malware called INLETDRIFT that established a persistent macOS backdoor while displaying a legitimate-looking PDF to the user. Radiant Capital said that traditional checks and simulations showed no obvious discrepancies, making the threat virtually invisible during normal review stages. Through access to the computers, the hackers were able to gain control of several private keys. The North Korean link was identified by cybersecurity firm Mandiant, although the investigation is still incomplete. Mandiant said it believes the attack was orchestrated by UNC4736, a group aligned to the country’s Reconnaissance General Bureau. It is also known as AppleJeus or Citrine Sleet. The group has been implicated in several other attacks linked to cryptocurrency companies. It has previously used fake crypto exchange websites to trick people into downloading malicious software through links to job openings and fake wallets.

According to the latest data, the whale made the transfer, worth over $9 million, from one of the leading crypto exchanges, Binance. However, despite the recent buying, the Eigen price has dropped today, fueling further discussions in the crypto market. Eigen Whale Bags $9M Tokens From Binance In a recent X post, the leading on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain has highlighted the transaction. According to the report, Eigen Whale has transferred 2 million EigenLayer tokens, valued at around $9.06 million, from the top crypto exchange , Binance, over the last two days. Notably, the latest purchase of the whale was 1.6 million EIGEN from the exchange, worth around $7.25 million. Source: Lookonchain, X This massive buying indicates that the trader remains confident about the asset’s long-term potential. However, despite this hefty transfer, the EigenLayer price has noted a retreat today, sparking discussions in the broader crypto market. Meanwhile, it appears that the recent move by Tron founder Justin Sun has caused panic among some traders. For context, Sun has recently dumped 322,119 EIGEN, worth around $1.44 million, to HTX, sparking market concerns. Besides, he also dumped other tokens like ETHFI, ETH, into the same exchange recently. Will EIGEN Price Rally? Eigen price today was down around 1% and exchanged hands at $4.44. However, its one-day trading volume jumped 35% to $280 million. Notably, the crypto has touched a 24-hour high of $4.97 and a low of $4.38, while hitting its all-time high of $5.06 on December 7. CoinGlass data showed that EigenLayer Futures Open Interest also noted a slump of 0.2% to $116.9 million, indicating that the investors are taking a pause after the massive rally. Notably, the market appears to have remained optimistic on the asset. For context, Binance added Eigen to its loanable assets and VIP loans earlier this year, showcasing the exchange’s confidence in the coin. Meanwhile, the whales are also appearing to be shifting their focus towards the crypto, which could support a further rally ahead. For context, a recent report showed that a Pepe Coin whale shifted its focus towards EIGEN last month, selling 130 billion PEPE.

Analysts are now divided on whether the rally will sustain its momentum or face headwinds from declining liquidity and market dynamics. Since November 8, long-term Bitcoin (BTC) holders, those retaining the asset for at least 155 days, have offloaded approximately 827,783 BTC, equivalent to $82.59 billion at the coin’s current prices. The selling surge has sparked discussions about whether the bull market is nearing a peak. According to market analyst and CryptoQuant contributor Maartuun, investors should be wary of of potential bearish pressures. “It’s a game of musical chairs: enjoy the ride, but be prepared when the music stops,” he remarked in a post on X. 🚨Long-Term Holders sold 827,783 BTC in 30 days.

He noted that these transactions represent only one-third of the total sell-offs, which signals there’s broader market dynamics at play. Analyst: Retail investors have boosted Bitcoin demand The crypto analyst believes that despite sell-offs by seasoned investors, Bitcoin’s price resilience remains strong because of retail trader’s interest. Per CryptoQuant’s retail demand metrics, retail participation in Bitcoin has hit yearly highs. Source: X Per Maartuun, the surge in retail BTC trades extends to Bitcoin futures trading, with data from CoinGlass showing an Open Interest (OI) value of $61.18 billion. “Retail is also involved in futures trading,” the crypto analyst said. Maartuun also noted that the average purchase price for long-term holders stands at $24,481, reflecting unrealized gains of nearly 400% at Bitcoin’s current trading price of $99,203, as reported by CoinMarketCap. Technical indicators show positive trends Bitcoin is trading within a rising trend channel, signaling continued investor confidence. In the short term, the cryptocurrency is testing support at $98,000, with analysts projecting potential upward movements if this level holds. Over the long term, Bitcoin remains technically bullish. The price has climbed strongly since breaking past the $67,241 resistance level, meeting the $84,547 target and indicating further gains. Analysts see no major resistance ahead, although support around $80,000 could stabilize any pullbacks. Source: X However, amid the overall bullish market sentiment, traders’ concerns over deteriorating liquidity remains persistent. Through a thread posted on X, Real Vision’s chief crypto analyst Jamie Coutts warned on December 6 that waning liquidity could challenge BTC’s rally. Using his BTC MSI macro model, Coutts expressed caution about the rally’s sustainability if liquidity conditions worsen. “While Bitcoin has reached new all-time highs against a backdrop of declining liquidity, the sustainability of this rally is uncertain if conditions worsen further,” Coutts stated.

MicroStrategy, in particular, has experienced a 537% stock price increase in the past year, largely attributed to its Bitcoin holdings.

37418296,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108380,1733737792,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Analyst Says Likelihood of BTC Reaching $150K by January Next Year is Low,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/btc-150k-probability-analyst-view/,"In the ever-volatile landscape of cryptocurrency markets, predictions about price movements can sway investor sentiment and influence trading behaviors significantly. Recently, Sean Dawson , the head of research at decentralized finance (DeFi) derivatives protocol Derive , provided a cautious outlook on Bitcoin’s (BTC) potential to reach the $150,000 mark by January 31, 2025. According to Decrypt , Dawson assigned a 6% probability to Bitcoin surpassing $150,000 and a 10.5% chance for Ethereum (ETH) reaching $6,000 within the same timeframe. This analysis delves into Dawson’s reasoning, the factors affecting BTC’s price trajectory, and the broader implications for investors and the cryptocurrency market. Understanding the Analyst’s Perspective Sean Dawson’s Role and Expertise As the head of research at Derive , Sean Dawson is deeply entrenched in the world of DeFi and cryptocurrency derivatives. His expertise lies in analyzing market trends, assessing risk factors, and forecasting price movements based on quantitative and qualitative data. Dawson’s insights are highly regarded within the crypto community, making his cautious stance on Bitcoin’s near-term price projection noteworthy. The Probability Assessment Dawson’s assessment assigns a 6% probability to Bitcoin reaching $150,000 and a 10.5% chance for Ethereum attaining $6,000 by January 31, 2025. These figures suggest a low likelihood of both cryptocurrencies hitting these price points within the specified period, indicating a more conservative market outlook. The Mechanics Behind the Probability 25-Delta Skew: An Indicator of Market Sentiment A key element in Dawson’s analysis is the 25-delta skew , a term borrowed from options trading that refers to the difference in implied volatility between out-of-the-money (OTM) put and call options with a 25 delta. In simpler terms, it measures traders’ expectations about the probability of price movements in a specific direction. Stable 25-Delta Skew: Dawson noted that the 25-delta skew has remained stable since the previous week. This stability indicates that traders’ expectations regarding Bitcoin’s price direction haven’t significantly shifted. A stable skew suggests a balanced sentiment, where neither extreme optimism (greed) nor pessimism (fear) is prevalent among traders. Market Consolidation Dawson mentioned that the market appears to be consolidating , a phase where the price of an asset trades within a narrow range without establishing a clear upward or downward trend. Market consolidation often precedes significant price movements, as it indicates a period of balance between buying and selling pressures. Implications of Consolidation: During consolidation, the market lacks the momentum needed to push prices significantly higher or lower. For Bitcoin, this means that without new catalysts or changes in investor sentiment, the path to $150K remains challenging. Factors Influencing Bitcoin’s Price Outlook Several factors contribute to the analyst’s low probability assessment for Bitcoin reaching $150K by early 2025. Understanding these factors provides a clearer picture of the challenges and dynamics at play. 1. Macroeconomic Conditions Inflation and Interest Rates Global economic conditions, particularly inflation rates and interest rate policies, play a pivotal role in cryptocurrency valuations. High inflation can drive interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against currency devaluation, while rising interest rates can make traditional investments like bonds more attractive, diverting capital away from riskier assets like cryptocurrencies. Current Scenario: With inflation rates fluctuating and central banks around the world adjusting interest rates to manage economic stability, Bitcoin’s attractiveness as a hedge is being tested. If inflation stabilizes or decreases, the impetus for investors to seek refuge in Bitcoin may wane. Economic Uncertainty Geopolitical tensions, economic sanctions, and other forms of economic uncertainty can influence investor behavior. In times of instability, Bitcoin may be seen as a safe-haven asset, potentially driving its price upward. Conversely, periods of economic stability might reduce the urgency for such investments. 2. Regulatory Environment Increased Scrutiny As cryptocurrencies gain mainstream attention, regulatory bodies are intensifying their scrutiny. Regulations concerning anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities or commodities are evolving. Impact on Bitcoin: Stricter regulations can impede the ease with which institutional and retail investors can participate in Bitcoin markets. Potential regulatory clampdowns can lead to reduced demand and lower price projections. Global Regulatory Divergence Different countries adopt varying regulatory stances on Bitcoin, leading to a fragmented global market. While some regions embrace cryptocurrencies with favorable policies, others impose restrictive measures, affecting overall market sentiment and liquidity. 3. Market Sentiment and Psychological Factors Fear and Greed The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a widely used indicator of market sentiment. Currently, the index stands at 78 , placing it in the ‘Extreme Greed’ zone. This suggests a highly optimistic market sentiment, which can sometimes lead to overvaluation and increased volatility. Dawson’s Take: Despite the extreme greed, Dawson’s analysis indicates that this sentiment may not be sustainable in the long term, especially without significant positive catalysts to drive prices higher. Investor Behavior Retail and institutional investor behaviors significantly impact Bitcoin’s price. High levels of speculation and herd mentality can drive rapid price movements, while more cautious or strategic investment approaches can stabilize the market. 4. Technological Developments and Adoption Bitcoin’s Technological Evolution Technological advancements within the Bitcoin network, such as the implementation of the Lightning Network for faster and cheaper transactions, can enhance Bitcoin’s utility and scalability. However, slow adoption or technical challenges can hinder these benefits from translating into price gains. Integration with Financial Systems Bitcoin’s integration into traditional financial systems, including acceptance by major payment processors and financial institutions, can drive adoption and price appreciation. Limited integration slows down mainstream acceptance, affecting price growth potential. 5. Supply Dynamics Bitcoin Halving Events Bitcoin undergoes halving events approximately every four years, reducing the reward for mining new blocks by half. This event decreases the rate at which new Bitcoin is introduced into the market, potentially driving up prices due to reduced supply. Upcoming Halving: The next halving is expected to occur in 2024. While historical halvings have led to price surges, Dawson’s cautious outlook suggests that other factors may counterbalance the reduced supply’s positive impact. Institutional Holdings Large-scale purchases by institutional investors, such as ETFs and investment funds, can drive demand and increase Bitcoin’s price. Dawson’s low probability assessment indicates that, despite some institutional interest, it may not be sufficient to propel Bitcoin to $150K by January next year. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin vs. Ethereum While Dawson’s analysis focuses primarily on Bitcoin, he also provides insights into Ethereum’s (ETH) price outlook, assigning a 10.5% probability of ETH reaching $6,000 by January 31, 2025. Comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum’s trajectories offers a broader perspective on the cryptocurrency market’s dynamics. Ethereum’s Growth Drivers Smart Contracts and DeFi: Ethereum’s robust smart contract capabilities make it the backbone of the DeFi ecosystem, driving demand for ETH. Ethereum 2.0 Upgrades: Enhancements in scalability, security, and energy efficiency through Ethereum 2.0 can attract more developers and investors, potentially boosting ETH’s price.

An ETF, or Exchange-Traded Fund, allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This financial instrument bridges the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market, making it easier for institutional and retail investors to participate. The approval and launch of Bitcoin ETFs by major financial institutions have been pivotal in enhancing Bitcoin’s liquidity and legitimizing its status as a financial asset. These developments have contributed to the growing investor confidence in Bitcoin, supporting its price growth and adoption. Current Position in the Market Today, Bitcoin remains the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, serving as a benchmark for the broader crypto market. Its influence extends beyond its price movements, impacting the development and performance of altcoins. The continued growth and adoption of Bitcoin provide a solid foundation for the expansion of the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. The current Altcoin Season , with an index of 81, reflects a robust performance by altcoins, signaling a period of diversification and growth in the cryptocurrency market. This trend underscores the maturation of the market, where investors are increasingly looking beyond Bitcoin to explore the potential of a diverse range of digital assets. The Role of Institutional and Retail Investors Institutional Investors Institutional investors, including hedge funds, asset managers, and publicly traded companies, have become increasingly significant players in the cryptocurrency market. Their involvement brings substantial capital, stability, and credibility to the market, influencing price dynamics and driving adoption. Institutions view cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and select altcoins, as viable investment assets that offer diversification and potential hedging against traditional financial risks. Their strategic investments contribute to increased liquidity and market depth, supporting sustained growth and stability. Retail Investors Retail investors continue to play a crucial role in the cryptocurrency market, driven by the accessibility and potential for high returns. The proliferation of user-friendly trading platforms and mobile applications has made it easier for individual investors to participate in the market. Retail investors contribute to market liquidity and volatility, often driving short-term price movements through trading activities. Their sentiment and behavior, influenced by news, social media, and market trends, significantly impact the performance of cryptocurrencies. Balancing Institutional and Retail Interests The interplay between institutional and retail investors shapes the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. While institutions bring stability and long-term investment perspectives, retail investors add liquidity and contribute to the market’s vibrancy. Understanding the motivations and behaviors of both groups is essential for comprehending market trends and predicting future performance. Comparative Analysis: Altcoin Season Index vs. Other Market Indicators Altcoin Season Index vs. Bitcoin Dominance The Altcoin Season Index and Bitcoin Dominance are two key metrics used to assess the cryptocurrency market’s health and performance trends. Altcoin Season Index: Measures the percentage of top 100 altcoins outperforming Bitcoin over the past 90 days. An index above 75 indicates an Altcoin Season, while an index below 25 signifies a Bitcoin Season. Bitcoin Dominance: Represents Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market cap. A high Bitcoin Dominance indicates that Bitcoin is the leading force in the market, while a lower dominance suggests increased altcoin activity. Both metrics offer valuable insights, but they focus on different aspects of the market. The Altcoin Season Index provides a more granular view of altcoin performance relative to Bitcoin, while Bitcoin Dominance offers a broader perspective on Bitcoin’s influence within the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem. Altcoin Season Index vs. Market Capitalization Trends While the Altcoin Season Index focuses on performance relative to Bitcoin, Market Capitalization Trends track the total value of all cryptocurrencies in the market. An increasing market cap generally indicates growing investor interest and adoption, while a declining market cap can signal waning confidence or market corrections. Combining insights from both the Altcoin Season Index and market capitalization trends can provide a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics, helping investors make more informed decisions. Altcoin Season Index vs. On-Chain Metrics On-Chain Metrics such as transaction volume, active addresses, and network hash rate offer insights into the underlying activity and health of blockchain networks. While the Altcoin Season Index measures performance relative to Bitcoin, on-chain metrics assess the actual usage and engagement with cryptocurrencies. Integrating data from the Altcoin Season Index with on-chain metrics can provide a holistic view of both market performance and network activity, enhancing the accuracy of market assessments and predictions. Community and Ecosystem Growth A strong and active community is essential for the success of any cryptocurrency project. Projects with vibrant developer communities, active social media engagement, and continuous ecosystem development are better positioned to sustain their growth and performance. Developer Engagement Active developer communities contribute to the continuous improvement and innovation of cryptocurrency projects. Regular updates, new feature releases, and the development of dApps and other tools enhance the utility and attractiveness of altcoins, driving their performance and adoption. Social Media and Community Support Social media platforms, forums, and online communities play a crucial role in fostering engagement and support for cryptocurrency projects. Positive community sentiment can drive investor confidence, while active discussions and collaborations can lead to the discovery of new opportunities and use cases. Partnerships and Collaborations Strategic partnerships and collaborations with other blockchain projects, financial institutions, and technology companies can enhance the credibility and reach of altcoins. These alliances facilitate the integration of new technologies, expand market access, and create synergistic opportunities for growth. Case Studies: Altcoin Performances in Previous Seasons To better understand the dynamics of the current Altcoin Season, it’s insightful to examine the performances of key altcoins during previous seasons and the factors that influenced their growth. Ethereum (ETH) During Altcoin Seasons Ethereum has historically been a leading performer during Altcoin Seasons, driven by its smart contract capabilities and the expansion of the DeFi ecosystem. During previous Altcoin Seasons, Ethereum’s price surged significantly as more projects and applications were built on its platform, attracting investment and driving demand for ETH. Binance Coin (BNB) and the Rise of Exchange Tokens Binance Coin has consistently performed well during Altcoin Seasons, supported by its utility within the Binance ecosystem. The launch of Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and the proliferation of projects and dApps on BSC have driven demand for BNB, contributing to its strong performance. Cardano (ADA) and Sustainable Growth Cardano’s performance during Altcoin Seasons has been marked by steady growth, driven by its focus on academic research, peer-reviewed protocols, and the development of a robust ecosystem. The successful rollout of upgrades and the launch of new dApps have sustained investor interest and supported ADA’s market performance.

This integration can lead to the development of new financial products, services, and infrastructure, reshaping the financial landscape. Lessons Learned and Best Practices The current Altcoin Season offers valuable lessons for investors, developers, and policymakers aiming to navigate and shape the future of the cryptocurrency market. Importance of Diversification Diversification remains a fundamental investment strategy. By holding a mix of Bitcoin and altcoins, investors can capitalize on the growth potential of multiple projects while mitigating the risks associated with volatility in any single asset. Thorough Due Diligence Conducting thorough due diligence is crucial for identifying projects with strong fundamentals, active development, and supportive communities. Investors should assess the use case, technological innovation, team expertise, and market positioning of altcoins before investing.

Projects that prioritize technological advancements, address market needs, and adapt to changing conditions are more likely to outperform and contribute positively to the overall market. Community and Ecosystem Support A strong and engaged community is vital for the success of any cryptocurrency project. Projects should foster community involvement, encourage developer participation, and build partnerships that enhance their ecosystem and market presence. Risk Management Effective risk management strategies are crucial for navigating the high volatility of cryptocurrency markets. Investors should implement measures such as stop-loss orders, position sizing, and portfolio diversification to protect against significant losses. Regulatory Compliance Adhering to regulatory requirements is essential for the long-term sustainability of cryptocurrency projects. Projects should prioritize compliance with anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC), and other relevant regulations to ensure legal and operational integrity. Adaptability and Flexibility The dynamic nature of the cryptocurrency market requires projects and investors to remain adaptable and flexible. Being able to quickly respond to market changes, technological advancements, and regulatory developments is crucial for sustained success. Conclusion The Altcoin Season Index falling by one point to 81 still firmly establishes the market within an Altcoin Season , highlighting the robust performance of altcoins over Bitcoin in recent months. This trend underscores a shift in market sentiment towards diversification and the potential of altcoins to deliver substantial returns. While opportunities abound, investors must also be mindful of the inherent risks and volatility associated with the altcoin market. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, the interplay between Bitcoin and altcoins will remain a critical factor in shaping investment strategies and market dynamics. By leveraging the insights provided by the Altcoin Season Index, investors can better navigate the complexities of the cryptocurrency market and make informed decisions to optimize their portfolios. The current Altcoin Season signifies a period of growth and opportunity for altcoins, driven by factors such as increased institutional adoption, macro-economic trends, technological advancements, and growing community support. However, maintaining this momentum requires continued innovation, effective risk management, and favorable market conditions. Investors should adopt a strategic approach, emphasizing diversification, thorough due diligence, and a long-term perspective to capitalize on the potential benefits of the Altcoin Season. By staying informed about market trends, regulatory developments, and technological innovations, investors can navigate the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency markets and achieve sustained growth and stability in their investment portfolios. Furthermore, the ongoing Altcoin Season has broader implications for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, influencing technological innovation, regulatory evolution, and the integration of digital assets into mainstream financial systems. As the market matures, the role of altcoins in driving economic growth, fostering innovation, and enhancing financial inclusion will continue to expand, shaping the future of the global financial landscape. In summary, the Altcoin Season represents a transformative phase in the cryptocurrency market, offering significant opportunities for investors, developers, and the broader ecosystem. By understanding the factors driving this trend and implementing strategic measures to navigate its challenges, stakeholders can harness the full potential of altcoins and contribute to the continued growth and maturation of the cryptocurrency market.

Bitcoin (BTC), the undisputed leader of the cryptocurrency world, has maintained its position as the most trusted digital asset. As the dominant store of value, BTC remains the go-to choice for institutional investors, with its recent run to an ATH of $103,900 underscoring why it is regarded as digital gold. The Spotlight Turns to Altcoins The crypto scene is often accompanied by optimistic phrases such as “When Lambo?” or “When Moon?” referring to the eager anticipation of crypto holders for the time the market finally breaks out and delivers long-awaited gains. Crypto enthusiasts have waited years and years for this to happen and are continuously searching for a project to reap the rewards of the highly anticipated breakout. BTC finally broke out to surge above the all-important $100,000 level. While BTC leads the charge and sets the pace for the rest of the market, we have seen many projects surpass Bitcoin’s growth, with this number increasing daily. Bitcoin will forever remain the G.O.A.T (Greatest of All Time), the OG crypto held in the highest esteem, but altcoins are more likely to deliver more significant gains as we near the altcoin season. Some of the biggest altcoin opportunities include the ever-popular Ethereum (ETH), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Pepe (PEPE), and the latest newcomer from the Solana network, Husky Inu (HINU) . Ethereum (ETH) Gains Significant Ground Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency, has shown signs of relative weakness in recent months but witnessed significant gains after BTC set its new ETH. Ethereum is the backbone of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts but has struggled with declining network activity, increasing its vulnerability compared to BTC. Despite the hype around Ethereum (ETH)’s newly adopted PoS system, the demand for its blockchain services has stagnated. Lower gas fees, while beneficial for users, have reduced the income for miners and validators and impacted ETH's price. Moreover, the supply of ETH has increased, creating further pressure on the asset's value. ETH’s price battled to stay afloat as investors turned to other altcoin opportunities but finally regained some ground. ETH turned a corner after BTC’s incredible run, breaking through the crucial $4,000 mark, gaining over 26% in the past month. At the time of writing, ETH traded around the $3,854 mark. Dogecoin (DOGE) Maintains its Recent Gains Dogecoin (DOGE) is the largest memecoin by market cap and is the 7th largest crypto with a market cap exceeding $63.3 billion. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man with a net worth exceeding $354 billion, is the CEO of Tesla, owner of social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and one of the president-elect’s most prominent supporters and has long endorsed Dogecoin . Musk recently joined the Trump campaign and was integral to Trump’s victory, and his involvement with the republican party could see DOGE run to new highs in the coming months. DOGE’s surge stepped into overdrive after Donald Trump released a statement revealing that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. According to Trump, DOGE will pave the way for his administration to “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditure, and restructure Federal Agencies – Essential to the “Save America” Movement.” DOGE is expected to surge after DeFi Technologies introduced Valour Dogecoin (DOGE) ETP on Sweden’s Spotlight Stock Market. The ETP will allow retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to DOGE without directly owning the asset. Amid Dogecoin’s increasing popularity and momentum, the token managed to flip luxury car maker Porsche’s market cap. With its increased market cap, Dogecoin surpassed Porsche’s $56.1 billion market capitalization. DOGE gained over 104% over the past month and has managed to hold on to most of the gains despite a slight market correction. Pepe (PEPE) Surges Over 122% in the Past Month Pepe (PEPE) is a fan favourite among crypto investors, with a staggering 1,395% gain in the past year. The project is currently the third largest memecoin by market cap, quickly gaining popularity as a tribute to the 2000s internet meme sensation Pepe the Frog. Pepe’s likeability and continued reward streak should be enough to add to your portfolio. Pepe (PEPE) has developed a robust community and is gaining traction in the meme coin arena. Its rapid ascent has drawn parallels with other popular meme tokens, and future projections remain highly optimistic. Expectations are set for PEPE to potentially increase by over 2100% by 2030, making it an attractive option for those interested in meme coins' speculative aspects. Pepe has also handsomely gained since the Trump victory, gaining over 123% in the 30-day chart. PEPE’s popularity and value further surged after cryptocurrency exchanges Robinhood and Coinbase announced support for PEPE trading. Newcomer Husky Inu (HINU) Shines in Presale As BTC continues to trade around the $99,000 level and top altcoins reach new heights, investors must look for well-priced alternative investment opportunities to profit from the bull run, and Husky Inu is precisely that. Husky Inu (HINU) is one of the newest members of the Solana network, created to bring its holders more value and utility by harnessing the power of this popular blockchain. Husky Inu recently launched the presale of its native token, HINU , with tremendous success, and the two are on a mission to conquer the memecoin industry through a robust and supportive community with innovative features and enhanced rewards. Since going live, the presale has generated over $612,000, completing its third presale round. Husky Inu is working on some exciting things, including an Earn App and a Decentralized Exchange. The Earn App will reward users with HINU tokens for engaging with the project, and the Decentralized Exchange will facilitate decentralized trading to improve utility and value for HINU holders. Husky Inu boasts several unique features that set it apart from traditional investment opportunities, including a capped token supply, a deflationary mechanism, speedy transactions, and charity voting.

Will It Follow MicroStrategy's Footsteps?,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-btc-move-from-world-giant-amazon-will-it-follow-microstrategys-footsteps/,"The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US and the re-election of cryptocurrency supporter Donald Trump as president have boosted institutional Bitcoin adoption. At this point, while many institutions added BTC to their reserves one after another, the last move came from technology giant Amazon. Amazon (AMZN) shareholders want the company to follow MicroStrategy’s lead by allocating some of its reserves to Bitcoin (BTC) to help combat inflation and increase shareholder value. In a shareholder proposal shared by US think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), it was stated that Amazon has a responsibility to diversify into assets such as Bitcoin that outperform bonds. Accordingly, the shareholder proposal included the following statements: “While Bitcoin is currently a volatile asset (Amazon stock has been volatile throughout its history), companies have a responsibility to maximize shareholder value both in the long term and the short term. Diversifying by adding some Bitcoin to the balance sheet solves this problem without taking on too much volatility.” At this point, the suggestion was that Amazon should allocate at least some of its assets, even just 5 percent, to Bitcoin. The Amazon shareholders’ proposal also caught the attention of former Binance CEO CZ, who expressed his curiosity about whether Amazon would adopt BTC payments. CZ expressed his curiosity on X whether tech giant Amazon would adopt Bitcoin payments. Simple.

Posting on X, the analyst stated: “DOGE closed 3 weeks in a row above 0.786 log fib, which makes higher prices possible; don’t be surprised if it hits $1 or $2 in a hurry.” Why Dogecoin Is Even More Bullish Than Last Cycle In a recent YouTube video, Cantonese Cat provided in-depth technical analysis, comparing Dogecoin’s current cycle to its previous historic run. The analyst highlighted that last cycle, the price faced rejection around the 0.786 Fibonacci level (log scale) before pulling back and consolidating at the 0.618 level for approximately four weeks. This time, however, Dogecoin appears to be sustaining price action above the 0.786 log Fibonacci level without a deeper correction. According to Cantonese Cat, “So far we’re above the 0.786. That’s insane. It looks like it just wants to keep going up higher forming a very nice bull flag.” Related Reading: Dogecoin Still In Consolidation – Analyst Expects $0,63 If We Get A Breakout Reflecting on weekly Ichimoku Cloud signals and higher time frame indicators, the analyst emphasized that multiple technical factors appear aligned for further bullish momentum. “If you’re also just looking at like the weekly Ichimoku [Cloud], we broke through that convincingly,” he explained. Referencing the monthly chart, he added, “We broke through the monthly Cloud very convincingly and over here, for January 2021, we just broke through it in one stroke. Over here [last month] we broke through it in November, hit the 0.786 fib level here, got rejected and we broke through [the 0.786 in the first days of December].” Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Analysis: Ascending Triangle On 2-Hour Chart Shows DOGE Is Still Very Bullish The analyst also pointed out that, unlike the previous cycle, Dogecoin is not exhibiting a significant retrace before attempting higher levels: “It doesn’t even really want to have a big back test or anything. You got kind of close to back test of the monthly [Cloud], didn’t really quite get there so all these are very bullish.” Cantonese Cat believes Dogecoin may soon challenge its all-time high levels, citing a more bullish overall chart structure relative to the previous cycle. “I think DOGE is going to make all-time highs relatively soon. Even the SuperIchi monthly is ready… This is a fairly bullish chart,” he remarked. The analyst referenced potential Fibonacci extension targets of $2.3 (1.414 extension) or even $4 (1.618 extension), underscoring that these levels, while seemingly high, remain theoretically on the table given current market conditions. “It’s kind of insane to think about because of the market cap, but so far I can’t deny the way that this looks right now—it actually looks a little bit more bullish than last cycle.” At press time, DOGE traded at $0.44.

On December 5, Bitcoin’s price soared to an impressive $104,000, a milestone that drew widespread attention from both investors and analysts alike. However, this surge was not without its aftermath, as the rapid climb prompted a wave of sell-offs from both short-term and long-term holders, leading to a sharp decline in Bitcoin’s value. The Surge to $104,000: What Drove the Price Increase? Bitcoin’s journey to $104,000 was fueled by a confluence of factors that collectively contributed to its rapid appreciation. Key drivers included: 1. Institutional Adoption Increased institutional interest and investment played a pivotal role in propelling Bitcoin’s price. Major financial institutions and hedge funds began allocating significant portions of their portfolios to Bitcoin, viewing it as a hedge against inflation and a store of value akin to digital gold. 2. Macro-Economic Trends Global economic uncertainties, including rising inflation rates and geopolitical tensions, have driven investors towards Bitcoin as a safe-haven asset. The perception of Bitcoin as a decentralized and limited-supply asset makes it an attractive option amid fiat currency devaluation concerns. 3. Technological Advancements Advancements in blockchain technology and the integration of Bitcoin into mainstream financial systems have enhanced its utility and accessibility. Innovations such as the Lightning Network have improved transaction speeds and reduced fees, making Bitcoin more viable for everyday use. 4. Regulatory Developments Positive regulatory developments, including favorable regulations in key markets and the approval of Bitcoin ETFs, have bolstered investor confidence. Clearer regulatory frameworks reduce uncertainty and encourage more participation from institutional and retail investors. The Sell-Off: Unpacking the Downward Movement Despite the optimistic surge, Bitcoin’s rapid ascent to $104,000 triggered a significant sell-off, leading to a sharp decline in its price. This sell-off was characterized by: 1. Increased Selling Pressure Both short-term traders and long-term holders began liquidating their positions to capitalize on the price peak. Short-term traders often engage in quick buy-and-sell strategies to exploit price volatility, while long-term holders may sell to realize gains or rebalance their portfolios. 2. Large Transfers from Wallets Data from CryptoQuant’s contributor XBTManager indicated substantial Bitcoin transfers from exchange wallets. These large movements are indicative of holders moving their assets to exchanges in anticipation of selling, thereby increasing the sell-side liquidity and exerting downward pressure on prices. 3. Market Sentiment Shift The initial excitement surrounding the price surge was tempered by concerns about sustainability and overvaluation. As investors reassessed Bitcoin’s valuation metrics, fear of missing out (FOMO) gave way to fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), prompting more sell-offs. 4. Automated Selling Mechanisms Smart contracts and automated trading bots can exacerbate price movements. When Bitcoin reaches certain price thresholds, automated sell orders are triggered, amplifying the sell-off and accelerating the price decline. Price Correction and Current Market Dynamics Following the initial sell-off, Bitcoin’s price dropped sharply to $90,000 before rebounding to $102,000. This fluctuation highlights the ongoing volatility and uncertainty within the cryptocurrency market. However, the market remains wary of sustained upward momentum, as evidenced by continued selling pressure, particularly from long-term investors. 1. Long-Term Investor Activity Long-term holders, often referred to as “HODLers,” continue to exhibit a cautious stance. While some may rebuy at lower levels, the sustained selling activity suggests a broader expectation of future corrections or consolidations. 2. Technical Indicators Technical analysis points to several key support and resistance levels. The decline to $90,000 tests the lower support zones, while the rebound to $102,000 faces resistance at the previous high. Indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) suggest that Bitcoin remains in a bearish trend, with potential for further corrections. 3. Market Liquidity and Volume Trading volumes remain high, reflecting active participation from both institutional and retail investors. High liquidity can lead to swift price adjustments, making Bitcoin susceptible to rapid movements in either direction based on market sentiment and external factors. Potential Risks and Future Corrections The current market activity, especially among long-term investors, indicates sustained selling pressure, raising the possibility of further price corrections. Several factors contribute to this outlook: 1. Overextension and Bubble Concerns Bitcoin’s rapid ascent to $104,000 raises concerns about overextension and the formation of a speculative bubble. Historical precedents, such as the 2017 bull run and subsequent crash, highlight the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s price movements. 2. Regulatory Uncertainty Despite recent positive regulatory developments, ongoing uncertainties and potential crackdowns in various jurisdictions could negatively impact Bitcoin’s price. Regulatory actions can create uncertainty, leading to decreased investor confidence and increased sell-offs. 3. Macroeconomic Factors Global economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, inflation trends, and geopolitical tensions, continue to influence Bitcoin’s price. Adverse macroeconomic developments can trigger risk-off sentiments, prompting investors to liquidate crypto positions in favor of more stable assets. 4. Technological and Security Risks Security breaches, technological vulnerabilities, and scalability issues remain persistent challenges for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Any significant security incidents or failures in Bitcoin’s underlying technology could erode trust and lead to rapid sell-offs. Strategies for Navigating the Current Market Investors looking to navigate the current Bitcoin market should consider the following strategies: 1. Diversification Diversifying investment portfolios across different asset classes can mitigate risks associated with Bitcoin’s volatility. Including a mix of traditional assets, such as stocks and bonds, alongside cryptocurrencies can enhance portfolio resilience. 2. Risk Management Implementing robust risk management practices, including setting stop-loss orders and position sizing, can help protect against significant losses. Investors should define their risk tolerance levels and adhere to disciplined trading strategies. 3. Long-Term Perspective Maintaining a long-term investment perspective can help investors weather short-term volatility. Bitcoin has demonstrated substantial growth over extended periods, and long-term holders may benefit from continued adoption and technological advancements. 4. Staying Informed Staying abreast of market developments, regulatory changes, and macroeconomic trends is crucial for making informed investment decisions. Utilizing reliable sources of information and engaging with the crypto community can provide valuable insights into market dynamics. 5. Hedging Strategies Employing hedging strategies, such as using derivatives or holding stablecoins, can provide a buffer against Bitcoin’s price volatility. These strategies can help manage risk and protect investment portfolios from adverse market movements. Expert Opinions and Analysis 1. Institutional Perspectives Institutional investors remain cautiously optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term potential. While they acknowledge the current sell-off and volatility, many believe in Bitcoin’s role as a hedge against inflation and a store of value. Institutional players are likely to continue accumulating Bitcoin during price dips, anticipating future growth. 2. Technical Analysts Technical analysts emphasize the importance of key support and resistance levels in determining Bitcoin’s future price movements. The $90,000 support level is critical, and a breach could signal further downside. Conversely, sustained trading above $100,000 could indicate a reversal of the bearish trend. 3. Market Sentiment Experts Market sentiment experts highlight the psychological factors driving Bitcoin’s price movements. The initial surge to $104,000 was fueled by optimistic sentiment and fear of missing out (FOMO), while the subsequent sell-off was driven by fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). Understanding these sentiment shifts is essential for anticipating future price actions. Comparative Analysis: Bitcoin’s Market Behavior Bitcoin’s price dynamics exhibit patterns that are both unique and consistent with traditional financial markets. Comparing Bitcoin’s behavior to other asset classes can provide valuable insights: 1. Stock Market Comparisons Like stocks, Bitcoin is influenced by macroeconomic factors, investor sentiment, and regulatory developments. However, Bitcoin’s lack of intrinsic value, reliance on speculative interest, and higher volatility set it apart from traditional equities. 2. Gold and Commodities Bitcoin is often compared to gold as a store of value. Both assets share characteristics such as limited supply and decentralized nature. However, Bitcoin offers greater portability and divisibility, making it more accessible for digital transactions. 3. Forex Market Bitcoin operates in a similar vein to the forex market, where exchange rates fluctuate based on supply and demand dynamics. The rise and fall of Bitcoin’s price against fiat currencies like the USD illustrate its susceptibility to similar market forces. Future Outlook: Bitcoin’s Path Forward The future of Bitcoin remains a subject of intense debate and speculation. Several scenarios could unfold based on current market trends and external factors: 1. Continued Growth and Adoption Bitcoin could continue its trajectory of growth and adoption, driven by increased institutional investment, technological advancements, and broader acceptance as a legitimate financial asset. In this scenario, Bitcoin’s price could stabilize and climb to new highs as it integrates further into the global financial system. 2. Market Consolidation and Stability Bitcoin may enter a phase of consolidation, where its price stabilizes within a defined range. This could be achieved through a balance of buying and selling pressures, enhanced by regulatory clarity and improved market infrastructure. 3. Prolonged Bear Market Bitcoin could experience a prolonged bear market if negative factors, such as unfavorable regulatory actions, economic downturns, or significant security breaches, prevail. This scenario would lead to sustained price declines and reduced investor confidence. 4. Technological Innovations Innovations in blockchain technology and the development of layer-two solutions could enhance Bitcoin’s scalability and transaction efficiency, driving further adoption and potentially boosting its price. Strategic Recommendations for Investors Given the current market dynamics, investors should consider the following strategies to navigate Bitcoin’s volatility and potential corrections: 1. Diversify Holdings Diversifying investment portfolios to include a mix of cryptocurrencies, traditional assets, and alternative investments can reduce risk exposure. Diversification helps mitigate the impact of significant price movements in any single asset. 2. Employ Dollar-Cost Averaging Dollar-cost averaging (DCA) involves investing a fixed amount of money into Bitcoin at regular intervals, regardless of its price. This strategy reduces the impact of volatility and lowers the average cost per unit over time. 3. Utilize Stop-Loss Orders Setting stop-loss orders can help protect investments by automatically selling Bitcoin when its price reaches a predetermined level. This strategy limits potential losses in the event of a significant price decline. 4. Stay Informed and Adaptive Maintaining an informed perspective on market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements is crucial for making strategic investment decisions. Being adaptable and ready to adjust strategies based on new information can enhance investment outcomes. 5. Focus on Long-Term Value Adopting a long-term investment perspective allows investors to ride out short-term volatility and capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential for substantial long-term gains. Focusing on the fundamental value and future prospects of Bitcoin can lead to more resilient investment strategies. Case Studies: Bitcoin Corrections and Recovery 1. The 2017 Boom and 2018 Crash Bitcoin’s price surged to nearly $20,000 in late 2017, driven by speculative investment and mainstream media coverage. However, in 2018, the market experienced a significant correction, with prices dropping to around $3,200 by December 2018. This correction underscored the cyclical nature of Bitcoin’s price movements and the influence of market sentiment. 2. The 2020 Pandemic Surge and 2021 Rally During the COVID-19 pandemic, Bitcoin’s price experienced substantial growth, reaching an all-time high of over $60,000 in March 2021. This surge was driven by institutional adoption, economic stimulus measures, and growing recognition of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. The subsequent rally solidified Bitcoin’s position as a mainstream financial asset. 3. The 2023 Regulatory Impact In 2023, regulatory crackdowns in several key markets led to a temporary decline in Bitcoin’s price. However, the market rebounded as investors adapted to the new regulatory landscape and continued to view Bitcoin as a valuable asset. This case highlights the resilience of Bitcoin despite regulatory challenges. Conclusion The Bitcoin surge to 104K has highlighted the inherent volatility and complex dynamics of the cryptocurrency market. While the ascent to $104,000 demonstrated Bitcoin’s potential for rapid growth and significant returns, the subsequent sell-off and price correction underscored the risks associated with such volatile assets. Ongoing market activity, particularly among long-term investors, suggests that selling pressure remains a persistent factor, posing the potential for further price corrections. Investors must navigate these fluctuations with a strategic approach, emphasizing diversification, risk management, and a long-term perspective. Staying informed about market trends, regulatory developments, and technological advancements is essential for making informed investment decisions in this dynamic landscape. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, Bitcoin’s role as a leading digital asset remains both promising and challenging. Balancing the opportunities for substantial gains with the risks of significant corrections will be crucial for investors seeking to capitalize on Bitcoin’s potential while safeguarding their investments against volatility.

37418610,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108287,1733738554,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Former Binance CEO CZ Wonders If Amazon Will Adopt BTC Payments,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/amazon-adopt-btc-payments-cz/,"In a rapidly evolving financial landscape, Amazon adopt BTC payments has become a topic of intense speculation and discussion. Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) recently took to his social media platform, X, to express his curiosity about whether the tech giant Amazon might integrate Bitcoin (BTC) into its payment systems. This speculation gains momentum following a report that the National Center for Public Policy Research , a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, submitted a proposal urging Amazon to consider adopting a Bitcoin treasury strategy at its April 2025 shareholder meeting. This potential move by Amazon could signal a significant shift in the mainstream acceptance and utilization of cryptocurrencies in everyday commerce. The Growing Intersection of Big Tech and Cryptocurrency The intersection of big tech companies and cryptocurrency has been a focal point of discussion over the past few years. Companies like Tesla, Square, and PayPal have made significant strides in integrating Bitcoin and other digital assets into their business models, signaling a broader acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the mainstream market. Amazon, being one of the world’s largest and most influential companies, adopting BTC payments would be a monumental step towards further legitimizing Bitcoin as a viable and widely accepted medium of exchange. Amazon’s Current Stance on Cryptocurrency As of 2024, Amazon has maintained a cautious but open stance towards cryptocurrencies. While the company has not officially integrated Bitcoin into its payment options, it has shown interest in blockchain technology and digital assets through various initiatives. Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers blockchain-related services, and there have been rumors of Amazon exploring its own digital currency. However, the adoption of Bitcoin as a direct payment method remains speculative. The Proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR) , known for its advocacy and policy analysis, submitted a proposal to Amazon encouraging the adoption of a Bitcoin treasury strategy. This proposal suggests that Amazon should allocate a portion of its treasury to Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. The idea is to leverage Bitcoin’s decentralized and finite nature to protect and potentially grow the company’s reserves. Rationale Behind the Proposal The rationale behind advocating for a Bitcoin treasury strategy is multifaceted: Hedge Against Inflation: Bitcoin is often referred to as “digital gold” due to its limited supply and resistance to inflation. By holding Bitcoin, Amazon could protect its reserves from the devaluation of fiat currencies. Diversification of Assets: Diversifying treasury holdings with Bitcoin could reduce risk by spreading investments across different asset classes. Innovation and Leadership: Adopting Bitcoin could position Amazon as a leader in financial innovation, aligning with its reputation for pioneering new technologies. Market Influence: With Amazon’s massive financial resources, a treasury investment in Bitcoin could significantly impact the cryptocurrency’s market dynamics. Changpeng Zhao’s (CZ) Perspective Changpeng Zhao (CZ) , the former CEO of Binance, one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, has been a vocal advocate for the adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial systems. In his recent statement on X, CZ expressed his curiosity about Amazon’s potential adoption of BTC payments, highlighting the transformative impact such a move could have on both the company and the broader crypto market. Importance of Amazon’s Adoption CZ emphasizes that Amazon’s adoption of BTC payments could have several significant implications: Mass Adoption: Amazon’s vast customer base could lead to widespread adoption of Bitcoin, making it a more commonly used and accepted form of payment. Market Legitimization: Integration by a major corporation like Amazon would further legitimize Bitcoin, encouraging other businesses to follow suit. Economic Impact: The increased use of Bitcoin in everyday transactions could drive up its demand and, consequently, its value. Innovation Spur: Amazon’s entry into BTC payments could spur further innovation in payment technologies, blockchain applications, and financial services. Potential Benefits for Amazon Integrating Bitcoin payments could offer Amazon several strategic advantages: Enhanced Customer Experience By offering Bitcoin as a payment option, Amazon could cater to the growing number of customers who prefer using cryptocurrencies for their transactions. This could enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty among tech-savvy and crypto-enthusiast demographics. Diversified Revenue Streams Bitcoin payments could open new revenue streams for Amazon, including transaction fees and partnerships with crypto-related businesses. Additionally, holding Bitcoin in treasury could yield significant returns, bolstering the company’s financial position. Competitive Edge Being among the first major retailers to adopt Bitcoin payments could give Amazon a competitive edge, setting it apart from other e-commerce platforms and reinforcing its image as an innovator. Risk Mitigation A diversified treasury with Bitcoin holdings could act as a hedge against traditional financial risks, including currency devaluation and economic downturns, ensuring greater financial stability for the company. Challenges and Considerations While the potential benefits are substantial, Amazon would need to navigate several challenges to successfully integrate Bitcoin payments: Regulatory Compliance The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is complex and varies significantly across different jurisdictions. Amazon would need to ensure full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, including anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) requirements. Volatility of Bitcoin Bitcoin’s price volatility poses a significant risk for its adoption as a payment method. Fluctuations in value could affect both Amazon and its customers, leading to potential financial losses and dissatisfaction. Infrastructure Development Integrating Bitcoin payments would require substantial investment in infrastructure, including secure payment gateways, digital wallets, and robust cybersecurity measures to protect against fraud and hacking. Public Perception and Trust Building trust among customers regarding the safety and reliability of Bitcoin payments is crucial. Amazon would need to invest in educating consumers about the benefits and risks of using cryptocurrencies. Tax Implications The tax treatment of Bitcoin transactions is another critical consideration. Amazon would need to navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency taxation to avoid legal and financial repercussions. The Role of Think Tanks and Policy Advocacy The involvement of the National Center for Public Policy Research in advocating for Bitcoin treasury strategies underscores the growing influence of think tanks in shaping corporate policies and strategies. Think tanks play a pivotal role in conducting research, providing policy recommendations, and influencing decision-makers in both the public and private sectors. Impact of Policy Advocacy Policy advocacy by think tanks can accelerate the adoption of innovative financial strategies by highlighting the potential benefits and addressing common misconceptions. In this case, the NCPPR’s proposal to Amazon could serve as a catalyst for a broader acceptance of Bitcoin within corporate treasury management. Collaboration with Corporations Collaboration between think tanks and corporations can lead to the development of well-informed and strategically sound policies. By leveraging the expertise of both entities, companies like Amazon can make more informed decisions regarding the integration of cryptocurrencies into their business models. Comparative Analysis: Amazon vs. Other Tech Giants To contextualize Amazon’s potential adoption of BTC payments, it is useful to compare it with other tech giants that have embraced cryptocurrencies: Tesla Tesla, under Elon Musk’s leadership, became one of the first major companies to accept Bitcoin as payment for its electric vehicles. Despite facing regulatory scrutiny and Tesla’s later reversal of this decision, Tesla’s initial adoption highlighted the feasibility and benefits of integrating Bitcoin payments into a large-scale business. PayPal PayPal has integrated cryptocurrency services, allowing users to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. PayPal’s move has made crypto more accessible to mainstream consumers, demonstrating the potential for widespread adoption of digital currencies. Microsoft Microsoft was one of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin, allowing users to purchase Xbox games and other digital content with the cryptocurrency. Although Microsoft later discontinued this option, its initial adoption set a precedent for the use of cryptocurrencies in e-commerce. Lessons for Amazon Amazon can learn from the experiences of these companies by: Ensuring Regulatory Compliance: Navigating the regulatory landscape is crucial for sustainable adoption. Managing Volatility: Implementing measures to mitigate the impact of Bitcoin’s price volatility.

This could lead to a virtuous cycle of increased adoption and market growth. Innovation in Payment Technologies Amazon’s entry into BTC payments could spur innovation in payment technologies, including the development of more secure and efficient cryptocurrency payment systems. This innovation could benefit both consumers and businesses by making digital transactions faster, cheaper, and more secure. Impact on Traditional Financial Systems Widespread adoption of Bitcoin payments by major corporations could challenge traditional financial systems, prompting banks and financial institutions to innovate and adapt to the changing landscape. This could lead to a more integrated and diversified financial ecosystem. Strategic Recommendations for Amazon To successfully integrate Bitcoin payments and capitalize on the potential benefits, Amazon should consider the following strategic recommendations: 1. Develop a Comprehensive Regulatory Strategy Amazon must work closely with legal experts to navigate the complex regulatory environment surrounding cryptocurrencies. This includes ensuring compliance with all relevant laws and regulations, securing necessary licenses, and staying abreast of regulatory changes. 2. Implement Robust Risk Management Practices Given Bitcoin’s volatility, Amazon should implement robust risk management practices to mitigate potential financial losses.

Invest in Secure Payment Infrastructure Amazon should invest in developing secure and efficient payment infrastructure to support Bitcoin transactions. This includes partnering with blockchain technology providers, enhancing cybersecurity measures, and ensuring seamless integration with existing payment systems. 4. Educate Consumers and Employees Building trust and understanding among consumers and employees is crucial for successful adoption. Amazon should invest in comprehensive education programs that inform stakeholders about the benefits, risks, and usage of Bitcoin payments. 5. Foster Partnerships with Crypto Industry Leaders Collaborating with established players in the cryptocurrency industry can provide Amazon with valuable insights and expertise. Partnerships with cryptocurrency exchanges, wallet providers, and blockchain developers can enhance Amazon’s capabilities in managing Bitcoin payments. 6. Monitor and Adapt to Market Trends The cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic, with frequent technological advancements and regulatory changes. Amazon must continuously monitor market trends, adapt its strategies accordingly, and remain flexible to capitalize on new opportunities. Potential Economic Scenarios Post-Adoption The integration of Bitcoin payments by Amazon could lead to various economic scenarios, each with distinct implications: Scenario 1: Accelerated Crypto Adoption In this optimistic scenario, Amazon’s adoption of BTC payments accelerates the mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies. Increased accessibility and convenience lead to higher adoption rates among consumers, driving further investment and market growth. Scenario 2: Regulatory Backlash Should Amazon’s move face significant regulatory challenges or backlash, it could lead to stricter regulations on cryptocurrency payments. This scenario would require Amazon to adjust its strategies to comply with new regulations, potentially slowing down adoption. Scenario 3: Market Stabilization Amazon’s adoption could contribute to the stabilization of Bitcoin’s price by increasing liquidity and reducing volatility. A more stable Bitcoin market would encourage greater confidence and participation from both retail and institutional investors. Scenario 4: Innovation Surge Amazon’s entry into Bitcoin payments could spur a surge in innovation within the cryptocurrency and fintech sectors. New payment technologies, blockchain applications, and financial products could emerge, enhancing the overall ecosystem. The Broader Context: Cryptocurrency in Global Commerce Amazon’s potential adoption of Bitcoin payments fits into a broader trend of increasing cryptocurrency integration into global commerce. As digital currencies gain traction, more companies and industries are exploring their use for transactions, investments, and financial management. Cross-Border Transactions Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin facilitate seamless cross-border transactions, reducing the need for intermediaries and lowering transaction costs. This can enhance efficiency and accessibility for both businesses and consumers engaged in international trade. Financial Inclusion Cryptocurrencies have the potential to promote financial inclusion by providing access to financial services for underserved populations. By adopting Bitcoin payments, Amazon can contribute to a more inclusive financial system, enabling more people to participate in the digital economy. Sustainable and Transparent Transactions Blockchain technology, the underlying foundation of Bitcoin, offers transparency and immutability, making transactions more secure and trustworthy. Amazon’s integration of BTC payments could enhance the transparency and security of its financial operations. Public Opinion and Consumer Behavior The public’s perception of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payments plays a crucial role in the success of such initiatives. Understanding and addressing consumer concerns is essential for fostering widespread adoption. Trust and Security Consumers must trust that their Bitcoin transactions are secure and that their personal information is protected. Amazon must ensure that its Bitcoin payment systems are robust, secure, and user-friendly to build and maintain consumer trust. Ease of Use For Bitcoin payments to gain traction, the process must be as seamless and convenient as traditional payment methods. Amazon should prioritize user experience, ensuring that customers can easily and quickly use Bitcoin for their purchases without encountering technical barriers. Awareness and Education Increasing consumer awareness about the benefits and uses of Bitcoin is vital. Amazon can play a role in educating its customers about how to use Bitcoin, the advantages of digital payments, and the measures taken to ensure security and compliance. The Future of Bitcoin in E-Commerce The potential integration of Bitcoin payments by Amazon could pave the way for a broader adoption of cryptocurrencies in e-commerce. This could lead to significant changes in how online transactions are conducted and how digital currencies are perceived by the public. Evolution of Payment Systems Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could drive the evolution of payment systems, leading to more decentralized and efficient financial transactions. This could reduce reliance on traditional banking systems and payment processors, lowering costs and increasing transaction speeds. Integration with Emerging Technologies The adoption of Bitcoin payments could also spur the integration of cryptocurrencies with emerging technologies such as augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and the Internet of Things (IoT). This integration could create new opportunities for immersive and seamless shopping experiences. Impact on Traditional Financial Institutions As more companies like Amazon adopt Bitcoin payments, traditional financial institutions may need to adapt by offering more cryptocurrency-related services. Banks, payment processors, and other financial entities could develop new products and services to meet the growing demand for digital asset integration. Conclusion The Amazon adopt BTC payments speculation, voiced by former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ), highlights the increasing interplay between major tech corporations and the cryptocurrency sector. CZ’s curiosity about Amazon’s potential adoption of Bitcoin payments underscores the significance of such a move in legitimizing and mainstreaming digital assets. Following the proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research advocating for a Bitcoin treasury strategy at Amazon’s April 2025 shareholder meeting, the conversation gains further traction. Amazon’s potential integration of Bitcoin payments could catalyze widespread crypto adoption, enhance financial inclusion, and drive economic innovation. However, it also presents challenges related to regulatory compliance, market volatility, and infrastructure development. To navigate these complexities successfully, Amazon must implement strategic measures that balance innovation with stability, ensure robust security and compliance, and foster consumer trust through education and seamless user experiences. As the cryptocurrency landscape continues to evolve, the actions of influential companies like Amazon will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of digital finance.

In a recent post, CZ responded to the news about Amazon shareholders requesting board members to conduct an assessment to decide on whether the tech giant should consider adding Bitcoin ( BTC ) its strategic reserve. The former Binance head suggested that the company should start accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment for their online marketplace as a gateway to adding the asset to their reserves. That way, the company can have a better perspective on the value of Bitcoin compared to traditional currencies. “Simple. Accept Bitcoin payments?” CZ wrote in his post . https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1865854419331600533 You might also like: Microsoft asks shareholders to vote against an assessment of investing in Bitcoin in SEC filing In a separate post, Dash’s Joel Valenzuela questioned CZ about why Bitcoin should be accepted for Amazon payment when “it sucks as a payment method” compared to other cryptocurrencies in general. CZ agreed with Valenzuela, stating that he made a purchase using Bitcoin worth $17.08 and had to wait 15 minutes for the payment to be confirmed by the receiver. However, he stood by the reasoning that it was a better payment option than traditional finance options like credit transfers which tend to take longer if an error occurs. “Still better than TradFi though. I didn’t have to call anyone to fix it. It just worked after 15 min. Crypto, I agree,” said CZ. Most of the comments underneath CZ’s post echo the same sentiment, expressing optimism that Amazon may one day make the shift to investing in Bitcoin. As previously reported by crypto.news on Dec. 8, global conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research proposed that Amazon should add Bitcoin to the firm’s strategic reserve. Since a chunk of Amazon’s total assets are stored in cash, cash equivalents and government bonds, the Washington-based think tank believes that due to the weakening of cash and bond yields, Amazon’s billion-dollar shareholder value is not being adequately protected by being stored in currency-based assets. Therefore, the NCPPR argued that Amazon has a duty to add assets to its treasury that are not tied to traditional finances, such as Bitcoin. Although the proposal does acknowledge the volatile nature of Bitcoin, it suggested that Amazon should still diversify its balance sheet by investing at least 5% of its assets in Bitcoin.

37418651,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108285,1733738617,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,El Salvador BTC Target Raised to $2.2M by Senior Advisor,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/el-salvador-raises-btc-target-2-2m/,"In a groundbreaking development within the global cryptocurrency landscape, El Salvador has significantly increased its Bitcoin (BTC) target price from $220,000 to an unprecedented $2.2 million , as announced by Max Keiser, a prominent Bitcoin maximalist and senior BTC advisor to Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele. This substantial upward revision underscores El Salvador’s unwavering commitment to integrating Bitcoin into its national economy, positioning the nation as a pioneering force in the adoption and regulation of digital assets. Overview of El Salvador’s Bitcoin Strategy El Salvador has been at the forefront of cryptocurrency adoption since September 2021, when it became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. This bold move aimed to enhance financial inclusion, attract foreign investment, and reduce the nation’s reliance on the U.S. dollar. President Nayib Bukele’s administration has since been actively promoting Bitcoin, investing in infrastructure, and fostering a favorable regulatory environment to support the growth of digital assets. Max Keiser’s Role and Influence Max Keiser, known for his fervent advocacy of Bitcoin, plays a crucial role in shaping El Salvador’s cryptocurrency policies. As a senior BTC advisor, Keiser provides strategic insights and market analysis to ensure that El Salvador’s Bitcoin investments align with global trends and maximize economic benefits. His recent announcement of increasing the BTC target price to $2.2 million reflects his optimistic outlook on Bitcoin’s future and its potential to transform El Salvador’s economy. The Significance of Raising the BTC Target Price Historical Context El Salvador’s initial Bitcoin target price of $220,000 was ambitious, aiming to leverage Bitcoin’s volatility and growth potential to drive economic gains. However, the rapid increase to $2.2 million marks a tenfold rise, signaling a profound shift in the nation’s investment strategy and confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Economic Implications Increased Investment: The higher BTC target price is likely to attract more investors, both domestic and international, seeking to capitalize on Bitcoin’s projected growth. This influx of capital can bolster El Salvador’s economy, create jobs, and fund public services. Financial Inclusion: By setting a higher BTC target, El Salvador emphasizes Bitcoin’s role in promoting financial inclusion. Access to digital currencies can empower unbanked populations, providing them with secure and efficient financial services. Revenue Generation: The substantial unrealized gains from Bitcoin investments can significantly boost the nation’s revenue streams. With the country currently holding 6,180 BTC at an average purchase price of $44,739.88, the leap to a $2.2 million target could translate into unrealized gains exceeding $12 billion. El Salvador’s Current Bitcoin Holdings and Performance According to Nayib Tracker, a platform dedicated to monitoring El Salvador’s BTC investments, the nation currently holds 6,180 BTC with an average purchase price of $44,739.88 . At the current BTC price of approximately $220,000, these holdings represent an unrealized gain of over $330 million . This significant appreciation underscores the potential for even greater returns with the revised target price. Daily Bitcoin Purchases As part of its ongoing commitment, President Bukele announced in 2022 that El Salvador is dedicated to buying one BTC daily . This consistent investment strategy aims to gradually increase the nation’s Bitcoin holdings, leveraging dollar-cost averaging to mitigate the impact of price volatility and maximize long-term gains. The Role of MicroStrategy and Michael Saylor Max Keiser also highlighted the strategies of Michael Saylor, co-founder of MicroStrategy, as a key factor likely to succeed in boosting Bitcoin’s value. MicroStrategy has been a major institutional investor in Bitcoin, holding over 100,000 BTC and continuously increasing its holdings despite market fluctuations. Strategic Parallels Long-Term Investment: Both El Salvador and MicroStrategy adopt a long-term investment approach, emphasizing Bitcoin’s potential to serve as a store of value and hedge against inflation. Institutional Support: The involvement of prominent figures like Michael Saylor and Max Keiser adds credibility to Bitcoin’s adoption, attracting more institutional investors to the space. Infrastructure Development: Investments in infrastructure, such as Bitcoin ATMs and mining operations, support the broader ecosystem, enhancing Bitcoin’s utility and accessibility. Regulatory Framework and Government Support El Salvador’s proactive regulatory stance has been instrumental in fostering a conducive environment for Bitcoin adoption. The government has introduced several measures to support the integration of Bitcoin into the national economy: Bitcoin Wallet Integration The El Salvador government launched the Chivo wallet , a digital wallet designed to facilitate Bitcoin transactions for residents. This initiative aims to streamline the use of Bitcoin for everyday transactions, including bill payments and remittances. Tax Incentives To encourage Bitcoin investments, El Salvador offers tax incentives and exemptions for businesses and individuals engaging in cryptocurrency activities. These incentives aim to attract foreign investment and stimulate economic growth. Public Education and Awareness The government has undertaken extensive public education campaigns to increase awareness about Bitcoin, its benefits, and how to use it safely. These initiatives are crucial for ensuring that the population understands and embraces digital currencies. Potential Benefits of Bitcoin Regulation Job Creation and Economic Diversification The integration of Bitcoin into El Salvador’s economy can lead to the creation of new job opportunities in various sectors, including blockchain development, cybersecurity, financial services, and digital marketing. Diversifying the economy beyond traditional industries can enhance resilience and reduce dependency on oil exports. Enhanced Financial Services Bitcoin can provide more efficient and secure financial services, particularly for the unbanked and underbanked populations. Access to digital wallets and decentralized financial products can empower individuals with greater control over their finances. Attraction of Foreign Investments A favorable regulatory environment and ambitious Bitcoin investment targets can attract foreign investors looking to participate in El Salvador’s digital economy. This influx of capital can drive technological advancements and infrastructure development, further boosting the nation’s economic prospects. Mitigation of Sanctions Impact Bitcoin offers a means to bypass traditional financial channels that are often targeted by international sanctions. By leveraging digital assets, El Salvador can mitigate the adverse effects of sanctions, facilitating smoother international trade and financial transactions. Challenges and Considerations Market Volatility Bitcoin’s inherent volatility poses significant risks. While the potential for high returns is attractive, price fluctuations can lead to substantial losses. El Salvador must implement risk management strategies to navigate this volatility effectively. Regulatory Compliance and Security Ensuring robust regulatory compliance and cybersecurity measures is critical for maintaining the integrity of Bitcoin transactions and safeguarding the nation’s digital assets. The Central Bank of Iran’s role in overseeing digital assets must be complemented by advanced security protocols to prevent hacking and fraud. Public Trust and Adoption Building and maintaining public trust is essential for the successful adoption of Bitcoin. Continuous education and transparent communication are necessary to ensure that the population understands the benefits and risks associated with digital currencies. Infrastructure Development Developing the necessary infrastructure to support widespread Bitcoin adoption, such as Bitcoin ATMs, reliable internet connectivity, and robust digital wallet systems, is crucial. These elements are foundational for enabling seamless and secure transactions. Comparative Analysis: El Salvador vs. Other Crypto-Adopting Nations Switzerland’s Crypto Valley Switzerland has established itself as a global hub for cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation, particularly in the region known as Crypto Valley in Zug. The Swiss government offers a favorable regulatory environment, tax incentives, and robust infrastructure to support crypto businesses. Key Takeaways for El Salvador: Regulatory Clarity: Clear and supportive regulations can attract a wide range of crypto businesses and investors. Infrastructure Investment: Investing in advanced infrastructure is essential for fostering a thriving crypto ecosystem.

They argue that Bitcoin can serve as a tool for economic empowerment and geopolitical maneuvering, providing the nation with greater financial autonomy and resilience. Case Studies: Successful Bitcoin Integration El Salvador’s Initial Bitcoin Adoption El Salvador’s initial adoption of Bitcoin was met with mixed reactions, but it laid the groundwork for integrating digital assets into the national economy. The establishment of the Chivo wallet and the launch of Bitcoin ATMs were critical steps in facilitating widespread Bitcoin usage.

While the segment discussed Ripple’s legal challenges and the crypto industry’s growing political influence, CEO Brad Garlinghouse and several community members expressed frustration with the way the story was presented. After the episode aired, Garlinghouse took to X to share his concerns. He emphasized that the interview , which lasted over 90 minutes, failed to include a significant legal development: a federal judge ruled in July that XRP ( XRP ) is not a security when sold on public exchanges.

Garlinghouse accused the program of omitting important context that could have provided a more balanced view of Ripple’s case. He also criticized Stark’s broader dismissal of crypto’s utility, comparing it to early skepticism about the internet. He noted that Ripple is already facilitating billions of dollars in cross-border transactions for institutional clients using XRP, all under compliance with know-your-customer regulations.

Ripple’s contributions, along with those from other crypto firms, have influenced key elections and legislative initiatives. The bipartisan FIT21 bill, which seeks to establish a clearer regulatory framework for crypto, is a step toward addressing the regulatory uncertainties faced by companies like Ripple.

37418712,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108283,1733738700,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Coinbase CEO Urges Senate to Reject Re-Nomination of Anti-Crypto SEC Commissioner,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/coinbase-ceo-opposes-sec-commissioner-renomination/,"In a bold and highly publicized move, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong has publicly urged the U.S. Senate Banking Committee (SBC) to reject the re-nomination of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw . Armstrong’s outspoken criticism centers on Crenshaw’s perceived anti-crypto stance, particularly her efforts to block Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs and her alignment with policies deemed unfavorable to the burgeoning cryptocurrency industry. This development underscores the ongoing tensions between traditional financial regulators and the rapidly evolving crypto market, highlighting the critical role of leadership within regulatory bodies in shaping the future of digital assets. The Clash Between Coinbase and SEC Leadership Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase, one of the largest and most influential cryptocurrency exchanges globally, has taken a firm stand against Caroline Crenshaw’s re-nomination to the SEC. On his social media platform, X (formerly known as Twitter), Armstrong articulated his concerns about Crenshaw’s effectiveness in her role and her impact on the crypto industry. He criticized her for what he perceives as a failure to support the growth and integration of cryptocurrencies into mainstream financial systems. Criticism of Crenshaw’s Anti-Crypto Actions Armstrong’s primary contention lies in Crenshaw’s attempts to block the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs. ETFs, or Exchange-Traded Funds, are investment funds traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. A Bitcoin spot ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin without having to directly purchase and manage the cryptocurrency, making it more accessible to a broader range of investors. Crenshaw’s opposition to such products has been a point of contention, as many in the crypto community view ETFs as a critical step towards legitimizing and mainstreaming Bitcoin and other digital assets. Armstrong went further to assert that Crenshaw is “worse than SEC Chair Gary Gensler” on certain issues. Gary Gensler, known for his stringent regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies, has been a polarizing figure in the crypto world. By comparing Crenshaw unfavorably to Gensler, Armstrong is emphasizing his belief that Crenshaw’s regulatory stance is detrimental to the growth and innovation within the crypto sector. The Importance of Leadership in Regulatory Bodies The leadership within regulatory bodies like the SEC plays a pivotal role in shaping the landscape of financial markets, including the cryptocurrency sector. Commissioners and chairpersons set the tone for regulatory policies, enforcement priorities, and the overall approach towards emerging financial technologies. Armstrong’s call for rejecting Crenshaw’s re-nomination highlights the significant influence that executive leadership can have on the trajectory of the crypto industry. The SEC’s Stance on Cryptocurrency Regulation Caroline Crenshaw, as a commissioner of the SEC, has been at the forefront of the agency’s regulatory efforts concerning cryptocurrencies. Her approach has been characterized by a focus on investor protection, market integrity, and the prevention of fraudulent activities within the crypto space. While these are critical objectives, Crenshaw’s methods and decisions have been perceived by some, including Armstrong, as overly restrictive and hindering innovation. Blocking Bitcoin Spot ETFs One of the most notable actions taken by Crenshaw has been her opposition to the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs. Despite multiple attempts by various financial institutions to gain SEC approval for such products, Crenshaw has remained a vocal opponent. Her stance is grounded in concerns about market manipulation, liquidity, and the overall stability of the crypto markets. However, critics argue that her refusal to approve Bitcoin spot ETFs stifles investor access and slows the integration of cryptocurrencies into traditional financial portfolios. Aligning with SEC Chair Gary Gensler Crenshaw is often seen as a close ally of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has taken a stringent regulatory approach to cryptocurrencies. Gensler has advocated for comprehensive oversight of the crypto industry, emphasizing the need for clear regulations to protect investors and maintain market integrity. While their alignment ensures a unified front within the SEC, it also means that the regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies remains stringent, potentially limiting the industry’s growth and innovation. Impact on the Cryptocurrency Industry Armstrong’s public call for rejecting Crenshaw’s re-nomination is not merely a personal vendetta but reflects broader frustrations within the crypto community regarding regulatory approaches. The implications of such regulatory stances are far-reaching, affecting everything from investment strategies to technological innovation within the crypto space. Investor Confidence and Market Growth Regulatory clarity and supportive policies are essential for fostering investor confidence in the cryptocurrency market. When leaders like Crenshaw block the introduction of financial products like Bitcoin spot ETFs, it can create uncertainty and hesitation among investors. This, in turn, can slow down market growth and the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Armstrong argues that Crenshaw’s actions are counterproductive, as they prevent the crypto industry from reaching its full potential. By advocating for the rejection of Crenshaw’s re-nomination, Armstrong is essentially calling for a more balanced regulatory approach that supports innovation while ensuring investor protection. Innovation and Technological Advancement Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology represent significant technological advancements with the potential to revolutionize various sectors, including finance, supply chain management, and more. Overly restrictive regulations can hinder the development and deployment of these technologies, limiting their benefits and delaying their integration into everyday use. The SEC’s current approach, as championed by Crenshaw, emphasizes caution and oversight. While this is necessary to prevent fraud and protect investors, it must be balanced with efforts to support technological innovation and market growth. Armstrong’s critique suggests that the SEC, under Crenshaw’s influence, may be tipping too far towards restriction at the expense of fostering a vibrant and innovative crypto ecosystem. The Senate Banking Committee’s Role The Senate Banking Committee (SBC) plays a crucial role in the confirmation process of SEC commissioners. Their decisions directly impact the leadership and direction of the SEC. Armstrong’s public statement serves as a call to action for the SBC to consider the broader implications of Crenshaw’s re-nomination on the cryptocurrency industry and the overall financial market. Evaluating Crenshaw’s Performance As the SBC reviews Crenshaw’s re-nomination, Armstrong’s critique adds another layer of scrutiny to her performance and impact on the crypto industry. The committee must weigh Crenshaw’s contributions to investor protection and market integrity against the potential drawbacks of her restrictive stance on crypto innovation. Balancing Regulatory Oversight and Innovation The SBC’s decision will reflect its stance on balancing regulatory oversight with the need to support innovation in emerging financial technologies. A decision to reject Crenshaw’s re-nomination could signal a shift towards a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment, potentially paving the way for more supportive policies and products like Bitcoin spot ETFs. The Crypto Community’s Watchful Eye Armstrong stressed that the Senate Banking Committee should remember that “the crypto community is watching closely.” This statement underscores the high stakes involved in Crenshaw’s re-nomination and the broader regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies. The crypto community, comprising investors, developers, and enthusiasts, is highly engaged and sensitive to regulatory changes that could impact the industry’s future. Community Expectations The crypto community expects regulators to adopt policies that support growth, innovation, and investor protection. They seek a regulatory framework that provides clarity and reduces uncertainty, enabling businesses and investors to operate with confidence. Crenshaw’s current approach is perceived by some in the community as a barrier to these goals, prompting calls for a more balanced and supportive regulatory stance. Potential for Regulatory Reform Armstrong’s push against Crenshaw’s re-nomination may spark broader discussions about the direction of cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. It could lead to increased advocacy for regulatory reforms that better accommodate the unique characteristics of digital assets while maintaining necessary safeguards. Broader Implications for the SEC and Financial Regulation The controversy surrounding Crenshaw’s re-nomination extends beyond the crypto industry, reflecting broader debates about the role of the SEC in regulating emerging financial technologies. The SEC’s Evolving Mandate As financial markets evolve with the advent of cryptocurrencies, the SEC’s mandate must adapt to address new challenges and opportunities. Commissioners like Crenshaw are at the forefront of this evolution, tasked with balancing the enforcement of existing laws with the need to accommodate innovative financial products and technologies. Influence of Industry Leaders Industry leaders like Armstrong play a significant role in shaping regulatory discourse. Their insights and critiques can influence public opinion and, by extension, regulatory decisions. Armstrong’s public stance against Crenshaw’s re-nomination highlights the increasing influence that crypto industry leaders are exerting on regulatory processes. Future of Cryptocurrency Regulation The outcome of Crenshaw’s re-nomination will have lasting implications for the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the U.S. A rejection could open the door for commissioners with more crypto-friendly views, potentially leading to a more supportive regulatory environment. Conversely, approval of Crenshaw would reinforce the current stringent approach, maintaining the status quo of heavy regulatory oversight. Conclusion The Coinbase CEO’s opposition to the re-nomination of SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw marks a critical juncture in the ongoing dialogue between the cryptocurrency industry and regulatory authorities. Armstrong’s public call to action emphasizes the need for a balanced regulatory approach that fosters innovation while ensuring market integrity and investor protection. As the Senate Banking Committee deliberates on Crenshaw’s re-nomination, the crypto community and the broader financial market are keenly watching, aware that the decision will significantly impact the future trajectory of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States. This clash between industry leaders and regulators underscores the broader challenges and opportunities inherent in integrating disruptive technologies into established financial systems. The outcome of this debate will not only shape the regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies but also set a precedent for how emerging financial technologies are governed in the future. As the crypto industry continues to grow and evolve, the importance of effective and forward-thinking regulation becomes ever more paramount in ensuring its sustainable and inclusive development.

Mitigating the Impact of Sanctions Digital assets offer a means to bypass traditional financial channels that are often targeted by international sanctions. By regulating cryptocurrencies, Iran can develop alternative mechanisms for conducting international trade and financial transactions, thereby reducing the adverse effects of sanctions on its economy. Challenges and Considerations While the regulatory shift presents numerous opportunities, it also entails several challenges that Iran must address to ensure the successful integration of cryptocurrencies into its financial system. 1. Regulatory Compliance and Enforcement Establishing effective regulatory frameworks requires meticulous planning and execution. Iran must ensure that its regulations are comprehensive, clear, and adaptable to the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. Additionally, robust enforcement mechanisms are essential to prevent illicit activities and maintain market integrity. 2. Technological Infrastructure Developing the necessary technological infrastructure to support cryptocurrency regulation is critical. This includes advanced blockchain analytics tools, secure digital wallets, and reliable exchange platforms. Investing in cutting-edge technology will enable the central bank and other financial institutions to manage and oversee digital assets efficiently. 3. Public Awareness and Education Educating the public about the benefits and risks associated with cryptocurrencies is vital for fostering informed participation. Iran must undertake extensive awareness campaigns to inform citizens about safe investment practices, regulatory compliance, and the potential impact of digital assets on the economy. 4. Balancing Innovation with Security Encouraging innovation in the crypto space while ensuring robust security measures is a delicate balance. Iran must implement stringent cybersecurity protocols to protect against hacking, fraud, and other cyber threats that could undermine the stability of the crypto market. Comparative Analysis: Iran’s Approach vs. Global Trends Iran’s regulatory shift can be contextualized within broader global trends towards cryptocurrency regulation. Countries worldwide are grappling with the challenge of integrating digital assets into their economies while addressing associated risks.

Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Pepe MAGA could become the next viral memecoin. Pepe MAGA launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Pepe MAGA on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask, or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Pepe MAGA by entering its contract address – C3zan7DDUAxZDSLnSxpptmyARsvGAbah4KWQB5QokoFM – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin) from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance, and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE), and DogWifHat (WIF), trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE, and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPEMAGA. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2024-12-09 10:06:33
37418715,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108278,1733738824,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,USDT Trades at Kimchi Discount on Upbit Amid Rising USD/KRW Rates,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usdt-trades-kimchi-discount-upbit-usd-krw-rates/,"In the dynamic landscape of cryptocurrency trading, USDT trades at Kimchi discount on Upbit amid rising USD/KRW rates, signaling significant shifts in the South Korean crypto market. As of 11:08 KST on December 9, the USD/KRW forex currency pair is trading at 1,435.40 KRW. In stark contrast, on the South Korean crypto exchange Upbit, the USDT/KRW pair is trading at 1,409 KRW, reflecting a “Kimchi discount.” This phenomenon indicates that USDT is trading cheaper on South Korean exchanges compared to the official forex rate, presenting both opportunities and challenges for investors and the broader crypto ecosystem in South Korea. Understanding the Kimchi Discount The term “Kimchi discount” refers to the premium or discount applied to cryptocurrency prices on South Korean exchanges relative to global or official forex rates. In this context, the discount implies that USDT (Tether) is available at a lower price on Upbit compared to its value when converted through the official USD/KRW exchange rate. Factors Contributing to the Kimchi Discount Several factors contribute to the emergence of the Kimchi discount: Regulatory Environment: South Korea has stringent regulations governing cryptocurrency transactions. Compliance costs and regulatory scrutiny can lead to price discrepancies between local exchanges and international markets. Market Demand and Supply: High demand for USDT within South Korea, coupled with limited supply on local exchanges, can create price differentials. Investors seeking stability amid market volatility may prefer USDT, driving its price up locally. Capital Controls: South Korea enforces capital controls to manage the flow of money in and out of the country. These controls can limit the arbitrage opportunities that typically help align prices across different markets. Exchange Liquidity: The liquidity of USDT on Upbit compared to other global exchanges affects its pricing. Lower liquidity can result in higher volatility and price discrepancies. Impact of Rising USD/KRW Rates The rise in USD/KRW rates plays a pivotal role in the Kimchi discount phenomenon. As the Korean won depreciates against the U.S. dollar, the cost of holding and trading USD-denominated assets like USDT becomes more expensive for South Korean investors. This depreciation can lead to increased demand for USDT as a hedge against currency volatility, thereby influencing its trading price on local exchanges. Economic Implications Inflation and Purchasing Power: A rising USD/KRW rate can erode the purchasing power of the Korean won, leading investors to seek stable assets like USDT. This behavior can amplify the Kimchi discount as more capital flows into USDT, increasing its local price. Foreign Investment: The differential in USDT pricing can attract foreign investors looking to exploit arbitrage opportunities. However, capital controls may limit their ability to take full advantage, sustaining the price disparity. Monetary Policy: The South Korean government and the Bank of Korea may adjust monetary policies in response to significant shifts in forex rates and crypto market dynamics, potentially influencing future price trends. Investor Perspectives Opportunities Arbitrage Opportunities: Savvy investors may exploit the Kimchi discount by buying USDT on Upbit at a lower price and selling it on global exchanges at a higher rate, profiting from the price differential. Hedging Against Currency Risk: Investors seeking to protect their assets from currency depreciation can use USDT as a stable store of value, especially in a volatile forex environment. Increased Liquidity: The presence of a Kimchi discount can enhance liquidity on South Korean exchanges, making it easier for investors to enter and exit positions without significantly impacting the market. Challenges Regulatory Risks: The South Korean government may impose stricter regulations to address price discrepancies and prevent potential market manipulation, posing risks to investors engaged in arbitrage or large-scale USDT purchases. Market Volatility: Significant price differences can lead to increased market volatility, affecting the stability of investments and potentially leading to rapid price swings. Liquidity Constraints: While the Kimchi discount can enhance liquidity, it may also create liquidity constraints if too many investors attempt to exploit the discount simultaneously, leading to potential price collapses or freezes. Strategic Responses from Exchanges Upbit’s Position As one of South Korea’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, Upbit plays a crucial role in the local crypto market dynamics. To manage the Kimchi discount and maintain market stability, Upbit may adopt several strategies: Enhanced Liquidity Management: By increasing the liquidity of USDT on its platform, Upbit can help narrow the price gap between local and global markets. Regulatory Compliance: Upbit must ensure strict adherence to South Korean regulations to avoid legal repercussions and maintain investor trust. This includes implementing robust KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) protocols. Market Surveillance: Implementing advanced market surveillance systems can help detect and prevent fraudulent activities, ensuring a fair trading environment for all participants. Other South Korean Exchanges Competitors of Upbit in the South Korean market may also take steps to address the Kimchi discount, such as: Competitive Pricing: Offering competitive pricing for USDT can attract more investors to their platforms, increasing overall market liquidity. Innovative Financial Products: Introducing new financial products like USDT-based derivatives or lending services can provide additional avenues for investors, potentially mitigating the impact of the Kimchi discount. Collaborations and Partnerships: Forming strategic partnerships with global exchanges or financial institutions can enhance cross-border trading capabilities and reduce price discrepancies. Regulatory Responses and Policy Implications Government Oversight The South Korean government is likely to intensify its oversight of cryptocurrency markets in response to the Kimchi discount phenomenon. Key regulatory measures may include: Enhanced Reporting Requirements: Implementing stricter reporting standards for cryptocurrency transactions can improve transparency and reduce the likelihood of price manipulation. Taxation Policies: Revising taxation policies on cryptocurrency gains can influence investor behavior and potentially address price disparities. Capital Control Adjustments: Adjusting capital controls to manage the flow of foreign investment into the crypto market can help stabilize local exchange rates and reduce the Kimchi discount. Policy Development The government may develop new policies aimed at harmonizing local and global cryptocurrency prices, such as: Price Stabilization Mechanisms: Introducing mechanisms to stabilize cryptocurrency prices on local exchanges, potentially through reserve funds or pegging strategies. Incentives for Global Integration: Offering incentives for South Korean exchanges to integrate more closely with global markets can reduce price gaps and enhance market efficiency. Educational Campaigns: Promoting investor education on cryptocurrency risks and benefits can lead to more informed investment decisions, contributing to market stability. Technological Innovations Addressing Price Discrepancies Blockchain Analytics Advanced blockchain analytics tools can help identify and address the causes of the Kimchi discount by providing real-time insights into trading patterns, liquidity flows, and market sentiment. These tools enable exchanges and regulators to monitor market activities more effectively, ensuring fair pricing and preventing manipulation. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning AI and machine learning algorithms can predict price trends and detect anomalies in trading behavior, allowing exchanges to respond proactively to potential issues. By leveraging these technologies, Upbit and other exchanges can enhance their market surveillance capabilities and maintain price integrity. Automated Trading Systems Implementing automated trading systems can help manage liquidity and reduce price volatility. These systems can execute trades based on predefined criteria, ensuring that USDT prices remain consistent across different trading platforms and minimizing the impact of external factors like rising USD/KRW rates. Comparative Analysis: Kimchi Discount vs. Global Market Trends Regional Price Disparities Price discrepancies like the Kimchi discount are not unique to South Korea. Similar phenomena have been observed in other regions where local regulatory environments, market demand, and capital flows create price gaps between local and global markets. Comparing South Korea’s situation with other markets can provide valuable insights into managing and mitigating such discrepancies. Global Arbitrage Opportunities Arbitrage opportunities exist when price differences between markets can be exploited for profit. While the Kimchi discount presents such opportunities, factors like capital controls, transaction fees, and regulatory constraints can limit the extent to which arbitrage is feasible. Understanding these limitations is crucial for investors looking to capitalize on price differences. Market Integration Efforts Efforts to integrate local and global markets can reduce price disparities and enhance market efficiency. International collaborations between exchanges, standardized regulatory frameworks, and improved cross-border trading infrastructure are essential for achieving greater market integration and minimizing phenomena like the Kimchi discount. Investor Strategies Amid the Kimchi Discount Diversification Investors can mitigate risks associated with the Kimchi discount by diversifying their portfolios across different asset classes and geographic regions. Diversification reduces exposure to local market fluctuations and enhances overall portfolio resilience. Hedging Strategies Implementing hedging strategies, such as using derivatives or holding multiple stablecoins, can protect against adverse price movements. Hedging allows investors to manage risk and stabilize returns, even in volatile market conditions. Long-Term Investment Perspective Adopting a long-term investment perspective can help investors navigate short-term price discrepancies like the Kimchi discount. Focusing on the fundamental value of assets and maintaining a disciplined investment approach can yield substantial returns over time, despite temporary market inefficiencies. Case Studies: Kimchi Discount in Action Example 1: Arbitrage Opportunity An investor notices that USDT is trading at a 2% discount on Upbit compared to the official USD/KRW rate. By purchasing USDT on Upbit and selling it on a global exchange where the price is higher, the investor can capitalize on the price differential. However, the feasibility of this strategy depends on factors like transaction fees, transfer times, and regulatory restrictions. Example 2: Institutional Investment A South Korean financial institution anticipates that the Kimchi discount will persist due to ongoing capital controls and regulatory factors. To leverage this, the institution decides to increase its holdings of USDT on local exchanges, expecting that the discount will provide higher returns when the market normalizes or regulatory changes reduce the price gap. Example 3: Retail Investor Approach A retail investor aims to use the Kimchi discount as a hedge against currency depreciation. By allocating a portion of their portfolio to USDT on Upbit, the investor can protect their assets from the declining value of the Korean won, ensuring greater financial stability amidst rising USD/KRW rates. Future Outlook: Sustaining the Kimchi Discount Potential for Price Normalization The Kimchi discount may normalize as regulatory measures are implemented and market dynamics stabilize. Increased transparency, improved liquidity, and enhanced regulatory frameworks can reduce price discrepancies, aligning local and global USDT prices more closely. Long-Term Market Trends Long-term trends, such as the continued adoption of cryptocurrencies and the evolution of financial markets, will influence the sustainability of the Kimchi discount. As the crypto market matures and becomes more integrated globally, price disparities are likely to diminish, fostering a more efficient and unified trading environment. Technological Advancements Advancements in trading technologies and financial infrastructure will play a crucial role in managing and mitigating price discrepancies. Innovations such as decentralized exchanges, blockchain-based liquidity pools, and real-time market monitoring tools can enhance market efficiency and reduce the likelihood of sustained price gaps. Policy Recommendations for Mitigating the Kimchi Discount Enhancing Regulatory Coordination South Korea can enhance regulatory coordination with global financial authorities to align cryptocurrency regulations and reduce price discrepancies. International cooperation and standardized regulatory frameworks can facilitate smoother cross-border trading and minimize arbitrage opportunities. Promoting Market Transparency Promoting greater transparency in cryptocurrency trading can help reduce price discrepancies. Requiring exchanges to disclose comprehensive trading data, liquidity metrics, and market sentiment indicators can provide investors with the information needed to make informed decisions and reduce the likelihood of price manipulation. Supporting Financial Innovation Encouraging financial innovation through supportive policies and incentives can enhance market efficiency and reduce price gaps. By fostering the development of advanced trading platforms, blockchain technologies, and financial instruments, South Korea can create a more robust and integrated crypto market. Implementing Tax Incentives Implementing tax incentives for cryptocurrency investments can attract more investors to the local market, increasing liquidity and reducing price discrepancies. Tax benefits can encourage both domestic and foreign investors to engage in USDT trading on South Korean exchanges, promoting market stability and alignment with global prices. Lessons Learned from the Kimchi Discount Importance of Regulatory Adaptability The emergence of the Kimchi discount highlights the importance of regulatory adaptability in the rapidly evolving cryptocurrency market. Policymakers must remain agile, adjusting regulations to address new market phenomena and ensure that the financial system remains stable and efficient. Balancing Innovation and Stability Balancing financial innovation with market stability is crucial for managing price discrepancies like the Kimchi discount. Encouraging technological advancements and investment while implementing measures to prevent market manipulation and excessive volatility can foster a healthy and sustainable crypto ecosystem. Investor Education and Awareness Educating investors about market dynamics, regulatory environments, and risk management strategies is essential for navigating phenomena like the Kimchi discount. Informed investors are better equipped to make strategic decisions, reducing the impact of price discrepancies on their portfolios and contributing to overall market stability. Conclusion The USDT trades at Kimchi discount on Upbit amid rising USD/KRW rates is a noteworthy development in South Korea’s cryptocurrency market. This price discrepancy, driven by regulatory factors, market demand, and currency fluctuations, presents both opportunities and challenges for investors and financial institutions. As South Korea navigates this complex landscape, the balance between regulatory oversight, market innovation, and investor protection will be crucial in shaping the future of the local crypto market. Addressing the Kimchi discount requires a multifaceted approach, including enhancing regulatory coordination, promoting market transparency, and supporting financial innovation. By implementing strategic policies and leveraging technological advancements, South Korea can mitigate price discrepancies, foster a more efficient and integrated crypto market, and position itself as a leading financial hub in the region. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, phenomena like the Kimchi discount will serve as valuable case studies for other markets grappling with similar challenges.

This move, slated to occur during the last regular session of the National Assembly for this year, underscores the DPK’s commitment to fostering a more investment-friendly environment and aligning with its economic reform agenda. Overview of the DPK’s Capital Gains Tax Abolition Plan The abolition of capital gains tax on investments represents a pivotal change in South Korea’s fiscal policy. Capital gains tax, which is levied on the profit from the sale of assets or investments, has long been a subject of debate among policymakers, investors, and the general public. By proposing to eliminate this tax, the DPK aims to reduce the tax burden on investors, thereby incentivizing more active participation in the financial markets. According to News Tomato, a DPK official confirmed that the party intends to follow through on its previous decisions regarding this policy change. The official emphasized that the abolition of capital gains tax is a cornerstone of the DPK’s economic strategy to enhance investment opportunities and drive economic growth. Legislative Process and Timeline The December 10 session marks the culmination of months of deliberation and negotiation within the National Assembly. The DPK has been actively working to build consensus among lawmakers to ensure the successful passage of the capital gains tax abolition bill. This legislative effort is part of the DPK’s broader agenda to implement comprehensive financial reforms aimed at modernizing South Korea’s economic landscape. Key Steps in the Legislative Process Drafting the Bill: The initial step involved drafting the legislation, which outlines the specific provisions for abolishing capital gains tax on various types of investments, including stocks, bonds, and real estate. Committee Review: The bill underwent rigorous scrutiny by relevant parliamentary committees, including the Finance Committee and the Judiciary Committee, to assess its feasibility, economic impact, and legal implications. Public Consultations: The DPK conducted public consultations to gather feedback from stakeholders, including investors, financial experts, and the general populace. This step ensured that the bill addresses the concerns and needs of all affected parties. Debates and Amendments: Lawmakers engaged in debates to discuss the merits and potential drawbacks of the proposed abolition. Amendments were proposed and incorporated to refine the bill and address any identified issues. Final Voting: The bill is now poised for final voting during the December 10 session, where it will be subject to approval by the majority of the National Assembly members. Statements from DPK Officials A DPK official, speaking to News Tomato, stated, “Abolishing capital gains tax on investments is essential for creating a more vibrant and dynamic investment environment in South Korea. This policy will not only alleviate the financial burden on investors but also attract significant foreign investments, contributing to our nation’s economic growth.” Furthermore, the official highlighted that this move aligns with the DPK’s commitment to economic reform and its broader vision of positioning South Korea as a leading global economy with robust financial markets. Support from Financial Leaders The DPK’s proposal has garnered support from various financial leaders and institutions, who view the abolition of capital gains tax as a positive step towards enhancing the competitiveness of South Korea’s financial markets. Lee Bok-hyun’s Endorsement In a related development, Lee Bok-hyun, the Governor of the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), has expressed strong support for the abolition of capital gains tax. According to Newsis, Lee emphasized his commitment to consistently advancing major policies, including the capital market advancement plan and the elimination of capital gains tax on financial investments. Lee stated, “Eliminating capital gains tax on investments is a strategic move to strengthen our capital markets. It will encourage more investments, promote financial innovation, and ultimately lead to a more resilient and prosperous economy.” Implications for Investors and the Financial Market The planned abolition of capital gains tax on investments is poised to have far-reaching implications for both individual investors and the broader financial market in South Korea. Increased Investment Activity By removing the tax on capital gains, investors are likely to experience higher returns on their investments, which could lead to increased investment activity across various asset classes. This, in turn, may result in greater liquidity and depth in the financial markets, fostering a more robust investment environment. Attraction of Foreign Investments The elimination of capital gains tax can make South Korea a more attractive destination for foreign investors seeking favorable tax conditions. This influx of foreign capital could spur economic growth, create jobs, and enhance the overall competitiveness of South Korea’s financial markets on the global stage. Enhanced Portfolio Diversification Investors may find it more appealing to diversify their portfolios across different asset classes without the burden of capital gains tax, thereby optimizing their investment strategies and risk management practices. Economic Growth and Financial Stability The DPK’s initiative to abolish capital gains tax on investments is expected to contribute significantly to South Korea’s economic growth and financial stability. Stimulating Economic Growth Increased investment activity can lead to higher capital formation, which is essential for funding business expansions, innovation, and infrastructure projects. This, in turn, can drive economic growth and improve the overall standard of living. Promoting Financial Stability By encouraging a more active and diversified investment landscape, the abolition of capital gains tax can contribute to greater financial stability. A well-functioning financial market can better absorb shocks, reduce systemic risks, and support sustainable economic development. Potential Challenges and Considerations While the abolition of capital gains tax presents numerous benefits, it also comes with potential challenges that need to be carefully addressed to ensure its successful implementation. Revenue Implications for the Government Capital gains tax revenue constitutes a significant portion of the government’s income. Abolishing this tax could lead to a shortfall in revenue, necessitating alternative measures to offset the loss. The government may need to explore other tax reforms or budgetary adjustments to maintain fiscal balance. Market Speculation and Volatility The removal of capital gains tax might lead to increased speculation in the financial markets, potentially resulting in heightened volatility. Policymakers must implement measures to mitigate excessive speculation and ensure that investment activities remain aligned with long-term economic goals. Equity and Fairness Concerns Critics may argue that abolishing capital gains tax disproportionately benefits high-income individuals who are more likely to engage in investment activities. To address concerns of equity and fairness, the DPK may need to consider complementary policies that promote inclusive growth and ensure that the benefits of tax abolition are widely shared across different segments of society. Comparative Analysis: Capital Gains Tax Policies in Other Countries To contextualize South Korea’s proposed abolition of capital gains tax on investments, it is useful to examine how other countries approach this tax. United States In the United States, capital gains tax rates vary based on the holding period and the investor’s income level. Long-term capital gains, derived from assets held for more than a year, are taxed at preferential rates compared to short-term gains. This structure incentivizes long-term investment and portfolio diversification. United Kingdom The United Kingdom imposes capital gains tax on profits from the sale of assets, including stocks, real estate, and other investments. However, there are annual exemptions and reliefs that reduce the effective tax burden on investors. Singapore Singapore does not impose capital gains tax, making it an attractive destination for investors seeking favorable tax conditions. This policy has contributed to the growth of Singapore’s financial markets and its reputation as a global financial hub. Implications for South Korea By abolishing capital gains tax, South Korea would align itself more closely with jurisdictions like Singapore, potentially enhancing its attractiveness to both domestic and foreign investors. However, it would also need to carefully manage the fiscal implications and ensure that the policy supports sustainable economic growth. Stakeholder Reactions and Public Opinion The DPK’s proposal to abolish capital gains tax on investments has elicited a range of reactions from different stakeholders, including investors, financial institutions, and the general public. Investor Sentiment Investors have generally responded positively to the announcement, viewing it as a favorable development that can enhance their returns and investment opportunities. Both individual and institutional investors anticipate that the abolition of capital gains tax will lead to increased investment activity and higher returns on their portfolios. Financial Institutions Financial institutions, including banks, asset management firms, and brokerage houses, have expressed support for the policy change. They recognize that a more attractive tax environment can lead to increased client engagement, higher asset flows, and greater profitability. Public Opinion Public opinion on the abolition of capital gains tax is mixed. While many see it as a boon for investors and the economy, others are concerned about the potential loss of government revenue and the implications for fiscal sustainability. The DPK has been proactive in communicating the long-term benefits of the policy while addressing concerns related to equity and revenue. Political Reactions The DPK’s proposal has been met with both support and opposition from other political parties. Proponents argue that the policy will drive economic growth and financial innovation, while opponents raise concerns about fiscal implications and equity. The success of the proposal will depend on the DPK’s ability to build a broad coalition of support within the National Assembly. Strategic Implications for South Korea’s Economy The abolition of capital gains tax on investments is more than just a tax policy change; it represents a strategic move to position South Korea as a leading financial center in Asia. Enhancing Competitiveness By creating a more favorable tax environment, South Korea can enhance its competitiveness relative to other regional financial hubs. This can attract multinational corporations, financial institutions, and high-net-worth individuals seeking advantageous investment conditions. Encouraging Innovation and Entrepreneurship Lowering the tax burden on investments can free up capital for entrepreneurs and startups, fostering innovation and economic dynamism. This can lead to the creation of new businesses, technologies, and industries that contribute to sustained economic growth. Strengthening the Financial Sector Abolishing capital gains tax can bolster the financial sector by increasing the flow of capital into financial markets. This can lead to greater liquidity, more robust market infrastructure, and enhanced financial services, benefiting both investors and the broader economy. Potential Economic Scenarios Post-Implementation The successful abolition of capital gains tax on investments could lead to various economic scenarios, each with its own set of implications. Scenario 1: Robust Economic Growth In this optimistic scenario, the policy leads to a surge in investment activity, driving economic growth and job creation. Increased capital flows into the financial markets can stimulate innovation, infrastructure development, and overall economic prosperity. Scenario 2: Moderate Growth with Fiscal Adjustments In a more balanced outcome, the abolition of capital gains tax contributes to steady economic growth while the government implements fiscal adjustments to compensate for the loss of tax revenue. This could involve introducing new taxes, cutting expenditures, or enhancing economic efficiencies to maintain fiscal balance. Scenario 3: Economic Challenges and Policy Revisions If the abolition of capital gains tax results in unforeseen economic challenges, such as excessive market speculation or significant revenue shortfalls, the government may need to revisit and revise the policy. This could involve reintroducing certain taxes, implementing regulatory measures, or enhancing fiscal policies to mitigate adverse effects. Comparative Policy Analysis: Pros and Cons Analyzing the potential benefits and drawbacks of abolishing capital gains tax on investments can provide a clearer understanding of the policy’s impact. Pros Increased Investment Activity: Lowering the tax burden encourages more individuals and institutions to invest, leading to higher capital flows into the financial markets. Economic Growth: Enhanced investment can drive economic growth, create jobs, and foster innovation and entrepreneurship. Attraction of Foreign Investments: A favorable tax environment can attract foreign capital, boosting South Korea’s position as a global financial hub. Investor Confidence: The policy signals government support for the financial sector, enhancing investor confidence and trust in the market. Cons Revenue Loss: Abolishing capital gains tax could lead to a significant loss of government revenue, necessitating alternative measures to maintain fiscal balance. Market Speculation: Lower taxes on investments might encourage speculative trading, potentially increasing market volatility and risks. Equity Concerns: The policy may disproportionately benefit high-income individuals who are more likely to engage in investment activities, raising concerns about income inequality and fairness. Regulatory Challenges: Managing increased investment activity and ensuring market stability may require enhanced regulatory oversight and measures to prevent financial misconduct. Lessons Learned from Other Jurisdictions Examining the experiences of other countries that have implemented similar policies can offer valuable insights into the potential outcomes and best practices for South Korea. Singapore’s No Capital Gains Tax Policy Singapore does not impose capital gains tax, making it an attractive destination for investors. This policy has contributed to the growth of Singapore’s financial markets and its reputation as a global financial hub. However, Singapore balances this with other forms of taxation and robust regulatory frameworks to maintain fiscal stability and market integrity. Switzerland’s Financial Policies Switzerland offers favorable tax conditions for investors, including low or zero capital gains tax on certain investments. This has helped establish Switzerland as a leading financial center. The country’s success is attributed to its comprehensive regulatory environment, political stability, and strong financial institutions. Lessons for South Korea South Korea can draw lessons from these jurisdictions by ensuring that the abolition of capital gains tax is complemented by robust regulatory measures, diversified revenue streams, and policies that promote inclusive growth. Additionally, proactive communication and stakeholder engagement are crucial to address concerns and build broad-based support for the policy. Technological Integration and Financial Innovation The DPK’s policy initiative aligns with broader trends in technological integration and financial innovation, positioning South Korea at the forefront of modern financial practices. Fintech and Investment Platforms The rise of financial technology (fintech) has revolutionized investment platforms, making them more accessible and user-friendly. By abolishing capital gains tax, South Korea can further stimulate the growth of fintech solutions that facilitate seamless and efficient investment experiences for users. Blockchain and Digital Assets Blockchain technology and digital assets are transforming the financial landscape. Enhanced investment policies can encourage the adoption of blockchain-based financial instruments and digital assets, fostering innovation and expanding the range of investment options available to investors. Data Analytics and AI in Investments Advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) are increasingly being used to optimize investment strategies and enhance risk management. By promoting a more investment-friendly environment, South Korea can attract investments in these cutting-edge technologies, driving further advancements in the financial sector. Strategic Recommendations for Implementation To ensure the successful implementation of the capital gains tax abolition, the DPK should consider the following strategic recommendations: Comprehensive Impact Assessment Conduct a thorough impact assessment to evaluate the potential economic, fiscal, and social implications of abolishing capital gains tax. This assessment should inform the development of complementary policies and measures to mitigate any adverse effects. Stakeholder Engagement Engage with key stakeholders, including investors, financial institutions, policymakers, and the general public, to gather feedback and build consensus around the policy change. Transparent communication and collaboration can help address concerns and ensure broad-based support. Fiscal Planning and Revenue Management Develop a robust fiscal plan to address the loss of tax revenue resulting from the abolition. This could involve identifying alternative revenue streams, implementing cost-saving measures, or introducing targeted taxes to compensate for the deficit. Strengthening Regulatory Frameworks Enhance regulatory frameworks to manage increased investment activity and prevent market misconduct. This includes implementing measures to curb excessive speculation, ensure market transparency, and protect investor interests. Monitoring and Evaluation Establish mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the policy’s impact. Regular assessments can help identify any emerging challenges and enable timely adjustments to the policy as needed. Conclusion The abolition of capital gains tax on investments by South Korea’s main opposition party, the Democratic Party of Korea (DPK), represents a transformative shift in the nation’s fiscal and economic policy. Scheduled for the December 10 session of the National Assembly, this initiative aims to foster a more investment-friendly environment, stimulate economic growth, and enhance South Korea’s competitiveness on the global financial stage. While the policy offers numerous benefits, including increased investment activity, attraction of foreign capital, and economic growth, it also presents challenges such as potential revenue loss, market speculation, and equity concerns. To navigate these complexities, the DPK must implement complementary measures, engage with stakeholders, and ensure robust regulatory frameworks to support sustainable and inclusive economic development. As South Korea moves forward with this significant policy change, the balance between fostering investment and maintaining fiscal and market stability will be crucial. The successful abolition of capital gains tax on investments has the potential to propel South Korea’s financial markets to new heights, positioning the nation as a leading hub for investment and innovation in the years to come.

37418824,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=108269,1733739086,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Polish Authorities Arrest Former WEX CEO Dmitry V. on U.S. Extradition Request,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/polish-arrests-former-wex-ceo-dmitry-v/,"In a landmark case within the cryptocurrency industry, Polish authorities have arrested Dmitry V., the former CEO of the Russia-based crypto exchange WEX , following an extradition request from the U.S. Department of Justice. This arrest underscores the escalating efforts by international law enforcement to clamp down on financial crimes in the digital currency space, particularly those involving fraudulent activities and money laundering. The Arrest of Dmitry V.: A Detailed Overview On December 9, 2024, central Warsaw witnessed the apprehension of Dmitry V., a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency exchange sector. Dmitry V. previously led WEX, the successor to the infamous BTC-e Exchange, which collapsed in 2018 amid allegations of extensive fraud and money laundering. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has been actively pursuing Dmitry V. for his alleged involvement in these illicit activities, and his recent arrest by Polish authorities marks a significant advancement towards his extradition and subsequent prosecution. Background of WEX and BTC-e Exchange To fully comprehend the significance of this arrest, it is essential to explore the histories of WEX and its predecessor, BTC-e Exchange. BTC-e was established as a cryptocurrency exchange platform that quickly gained traction due to its user-friendly interface and a wide array of supported digital currencies. However, beneath its legitimate operations, BTC-e was entangled in numerous controversies. In 2017, U.S. authorities charged BTC-e and Dmitry V. with facilitating substantial money laundering activities, including handling proceeds from the notorious Mt. Gox heist and other cybercrimes. The exchange was accused of laundering billions of dollars in illicit funds, making it a prime target for international law enforcement agencies. Following the collapse of BTC-e in 2018, WEX emerged as its successor, inheriting not only the user base but also the legal troubles associated with its predecessor. Despite efforts to rebrand and restructure, WEX continued to face scrutiny over its financial practices, ultimately leading to the current extradition request from the U.S. Legal Proceedings and Extradition Process The extradition process is often intricate, involving multiple legal steps and international cooperation. In Dmitry V.’s case, the U.S. Department of Justice has been diligently seeking his extradition to face charges related to fraud and money laundering. The arrest in Poland signifies that the necessary legal frameworks and agreements between the U.S. and Poland have been activated to facilitate this process. Poland, as a member of the European Union, adheres to stringent extradition treaties that ensure the efficient transfer of individuals accused of serious crimes to the requesting countries. The extradition request likely involved comprehensive legal documentation outlining the charges, evidence, and the necessity of Dmitry V.’s presence in the U.S. legal system. Implications for the Cryptocurrency Industry The arrest of a former CEO of a major crypto exchange on such serious charges has profound implications for the cryptocurrency industry. It highlights the increasing attention regulatory bodies are placing on digital currencies and the platforms that facilitate their trading. As cryptocurrencies continue to gain mainstream acceptance, the necessity for robust regulatory frameworks becomes paramount to prevent misuse and ensure the integrity of financial systems. Enhanced Regulatory Scrutiny This case exemplifies the tightening regulatory environment surrounding crypto exchanges. Authorities are now more vigilant in monitoring these platforms to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities. Exchanges are likely to face more stringent compliance requirements, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols. Impact on Crypto Exchange Operations Crypto exchanges may need to reassess their operational frameworks to align with evolving regulations. This could involve implementing more transparent financial practices, enhancing security measures, and ensuring that all transactions comply with international laws. Investor Confidence While regulatory actions might initially cause apprehension among investors, they ultimately contribute to building trust in the cryptocurrency market. Knowing that there are active measures to combat fraud and protect investments can enhance investor confidence in the long term. The Role of International Cooperation in Combating Financial Crimes The successful arrest and potential extradition of Dmitry V. highlight the critical role of international cooperation in tackling financial crimes within the cryptocurrency sector. As digital currencies transcend national borders, so do the challenges associated with regulating and overseeing them. Collaborative efforts between countries are essential to ensure that perpetrators cannot easily evade justice by exploiting jurisdictional loopholes. Information Sharing Effective information sharing between international law enforcement agencies is vital. In Dmitry V.’s case, the cooperation between the U.S. Department of Justice and Polish authorities enabled the swift execution of the arrest. Unified Legal Standards Harmonizing legal standards across countries can streamline the extradition process and ensure that there is a consistent approach to handling financial crimes related to cryptocurrencies. Joint Investigations Collaborative investigations allow for the pooling of resources and expertise, making it easier to trace complex financial transactions and gather the necessary evidence to prosecute high-profile individuals involved in fraud and money laundering. Potential Outcomes and Future Developments As Dmitry V. awaits extradition, several potential outcomes and future developments could shape the landscape of the cryptocurrency industry: Extradition and Prosecution If extradited, Dmitry V. will face trial in the U.S., where he could be convicted on charges of fraud and money laundering. A conviction could result in a lengthy prison sentence, serving as a deterrent to others in the industry. Precedent for Future Cases This case may set a legal precedent for how similar cases are handled in the future. It signals to crypto executives that international law enforcement is serious about prosecuting financial crimes, potentially leading to greater compliance and ethical standards within the industry. Regulatory Enhancements In response to high-profile cases like this, regulatory bodies may introduce more comprehensive regulations to oversee cryptocurrency exchanges, ensuring greater transparency and accountability. Market Reaction The cryptocurrency market may experience fluctuations in response to such arrests, with investors reacting to the heightened regulatory environment. However, over time, these measures are likely to contribute to a more stable and trustworthy market. Dmitry V.’s Legal Defense and Responses While the arrest marks a significant development, Dmitry V. and his legal team are expected to mount a robust defense against the extradition request. Potential defenses may include challenging the legality of the extradition process, questioning the sufficiency of the evidence, or asserting that the charges are politically motivated. Legal Arguments Dmitry V. may argue that his rights under Polish and international law are being infringed upon, or that the U.S. lacks jurisdiction over certain aspects of his alleged activities. Public Statements Public statements and press releases from Dmitry V. and his associates may attempt to sway public opinion or cast doubt on the legitimacy of the charges. The legal battle is likely to be closely watched by both the crypto community and the general public. Impact on Reputation Regardless of the legal outcome, the arrest has undoubtedly impacted Dmitry V.’s reputation and that of WEX. The association with fraud and money laundering charges can have long-term consequences for his career and any future ventures he may undertake. The Broader Context of Crypto Regulation The arrest of Dmitry V. is part of a broader trend of increased regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency sector. Governments and regulatory bodies around the world are grappling with how to effectively oversee and regulate digital currencies to prevent misuse while fostering innovation. Global Regulatory Landscape Different countries are adopting varying approaches to crypto regulation. Some, like the United States, are moving towards more stringent oversight, while others may adopt more lenient or innovative regulatory frameworks to attract crypto businesses. Technological Advancements Advancements in blockchain technology and digital security are both a boon and a challenge for regulators. While blockchain offers transparency and traceability, it also presents new avenues for financial crimes that require sophisticated monitoring and enforcement strategies. Industry Adaptation Crypto exchanges and other industry players are adapting by enhancing their compliance measures, investing in security technologies, and engaging with regulators to shape favorable regulatory environments. The Future of WEX and Its Users With the arrest of its former CEO, WEX faces an uncertain future. The company may undergo significant restructuring to address the legal challenges and restore trust among its user base. Key considerations include: Operational Overhaul WEX might implement comprehensive changes to its operational practices, including enhanced KYC and AML protocols, to comply with regulatory requirements and prevent future legal issues. User Confidence Maintaining and rebuilding user confidence will be crucial. Transparent communication about the steps being taken to ensure the platform’s integrity can help retain and attract users. Potential Acquisition or Merger In some cases, exchanges facing legal and reputational challenges may seek acquisition or merger opportunities to stabilize their operations and leverage the strengths of a more established entity. Expert Opinions on the Arrest Industry experts have weighed in on the arrest of Dmitry V., offering insights into its implications for the cryptocurrency sector: Regulatory Experts Regulators view the arrest as a necessary step to enforce compliance and deter financial crimes. They emphasize the importance of international cooperation in achieving these goals. Crypto Analysts Crypto analysts suggest that while such arrests may cause short-term market volatility, they ultimately contribute to a healthier and more regulated market environment, fostering long-term growth and stability. Legal Scholars Legal scholars highlight the complexities involved in extradition cases, especially those involving digital assets and international jurisdictions. They stress the need for clear legal frameworks to address these emerging challenges. Historical Context: WEX and Its Predecessor BTC-e To fully grasp the significance of Dmitry V.’s arrest, it’s essential to revisit the history of WEX and BTC-e, two platforms that have been at the center of major crypto controversies. BTC-e Exchange BTC-e was founded in 2011 and quickly became one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. However, it became infamous for facilitating the laundering of funds from various cybercrimes, including the Mt. Gox hack, which saw the theft of approximately 850,000 Bitcoins. In 2017, the U.S. DOJ charged Dmitry V. and other executives with operating a vast money laundering operation through BTC-e. The exchange was subsequently shut down, and efforts to track down its key figures intensified. Transition to WEX Following BTC-e’s collapse, Dmitry V. launched WEX as its successor, aiming to continue serving the same user base while distancing the platform from the legal issues of its predecessor. Despite rebranding efforts, WEX struggled to escape the shadow of BTC-e’s notorious past. WEX faced multiple legal challenges and regulatory scrutiny, culminating in the current extradition request and the arrest of Dmitry V. The transition from BTC-e to WEX highlights the difficulties in reestablishing trust and legality in the aftermath of significant financial scandals. The Impact on Crypto Exchange Regulations The arrest of Dmitry V. has broader implications for how crypto exchanges are regulated globally. It serves as a case study for the necessary measures exchanges must implement to operate within legal boundaries. Enhanced Compliance Requirements Exchanges are now required to adhere to stricter compliance standards, including comprehensive KYC and AML procedures, regular audits, and transparent reporting mechanisms. Licensing and Accreditation Many jurisdictions are introducing licensing requirements for crypto exchanges, ensuring that only entities meeting specific standards can operate legally. This move aims to weed out fraudulent and non-compliant platforms from the market. Consumer Protection Measures Regulators are placing greater emphasis on consumer protection, ensuring that users’ funds are secure and that they are informed about the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading. Lessons Learned and Best Practices The arrest of Dmitry V. provides valuable lessons for the cryptocurrency industry, emphasizing the importance of transparency, compliance, and ethical management. Transparency Crypto exchanges must maintain transparency in their operations, providing clear information about their financial practices, ownership structures, and compliance measures. Proactive Compliance Adopting proactive compliance strategies can help exchanges stay ahead of regulatory changes and avoid legal pitfalls. Regular training, audits, and updates to compliance protocols are essential. Ethical Leadership Strong, ethical leadership is crucial in fostering a culture of integrity within crypto organizations. Leaders must prioritize legal and ethical standards to ensure long-term success and trustworthiness. The Role of Technology in Preventing Financial Crimes Advancements in technology play a pivotal role in preventing financial crimes within the cryptocurrency sector. From blockchain analytics to artificial intelligence, various tools are being leveraged to enhance security and compliance. Blockchain Analytics Blockchain analytics tools enable the tracing of transactions across the blockchain, helping identify suspicious activities and linking them to illicit sources. These tools are invaluable for regulatory compliance and forensic investigations. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning AI and machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of transaction data to detect patterns indicative of fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes. These technologies enhance the ability of exchanges and regulators to identify and respond to threats in real-time. Enhanced Security Protocols Implementing advanced security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, and secure storage solutions, can protect user funds and sensitive information from cyber threats and unauthorized access. Community and Industry Response The crypto community and industry stakeholders have responded to the arrest of Dmitry V. with a mix of concern and support for increased regulation. Community Reactions Users and investors express concerns over the stability and legality of crypto exchanges. However, many also recognize the necessity of such regulatory actions to ensure the long-term viability of the industry. Industry Initiatives Crypto exchanges and related businesses are taking steps to improve their compliance frameworks and engage with regulators to shape favorable policies. Industry groups are advocating for balanced regulations that protect consumers without stifling innovation. Educational Efforts There is a growing emphasis on educating users about the importance of choosing regulated and reputable exchanges. Enhanced user awareness can lead to more informed decisions and safer investment practices. Conclusion The Polish arrests former WEX CEO Dmitry V. by Polish authorities on a U.S. extradition request marks a watershed moment in the cryptocurrency industry’s ongoing battle against financial crimes. This development not only underscores the critical need for robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation but also serves as a cautionary tale for crypto executives and exchanges worldwide. As the cryptocurrency market continues to evolve, the balance between innovation and regulation will remain paramount. Ensuring that digital currencies operate within legal boundaries is essential for fostering trust, protecting investors, and promoting sustainable growth in the industry.
