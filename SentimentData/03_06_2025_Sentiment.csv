Thanks to a series of powerful updates and exciting new features, its token price has surged an astonishing 440% in just one month. But what’s next for ZBCN? Is Zebec Network a good investment? Find out in our Zebec Network price prediction. Table of Contents What is Zebec Network? Zebec Network coin price prediction: general outlook Zebec Network price prediction 2025 Zebec Network price prediction 2030 What is Zebec Network? Zebec Network started out in 2021 as Zebec Protocol on the Solana blockchain. It’s a decentralized platform that makes real-time, continuous payments easy and seamless. In March 2024, the project rebranded to Zebec Network and launched the ZBCN token, after a 1:10 token split to make the network more accessible and useful. The platform provides a bunch of handy financial tools like automated payroll, crypto investing through dollar-cost averaging, and connects with DeFi protocols. The native token, ZBCN, is used for governance, staking, and covering transaction fees within the network. What can we expect from Zebec Network ( ZBCN )? Let’s turn to the Zebec Network price prediction. Zebec Network coin price prediction: general outlook In May 2025, Zebec Network’s token experienced a sharp price surge, driven by its acquisition of Science Card , a UK-based university card platform that expanded its financial services into the education sector. The token’s rally was also fueled by Zebec receiving backing from Uphold and news of a potential collaboration with Ripple — all of which boosted investor confidence and signaled strong strategic momentum. Just in the past week, the price of ZBCN rose approximately 127%, reaching a new all-time high of about $0.0071 on May 29. As of June 02, the price had pulled back about 15% from its ATH and is trading at 0.0059454. ZBCN 1-month chart, May 2025 | Source: crypto.news In the coming months, Zebec’s price could stay quite volatile. Its expansion with Science Card and a possible Ripple partnership all boost its growth potential. If Zebec keeps delivering good news, the price might climb higher. But like any crypto, market swings and competition can affect the price too.

Zebec Network price prediction 2025 According to CoinCodex’s ZBCN price prediction, the token could face a short-term decline of over 20%, potentially dropping to $0.005639 by June 28, 2025. The platform’s broader Zebec Network price forecast suggests the token could trade between $0.005285 and $0.016996 over the course of the year. As of May 30, 2025, the Zebec Network price prediction remains optimistic, with 22 technical indicators signaling a bullish trend, while only 4 suggest bearish momentum. According to DigitalCoinPrice’s ZBCN price prediction for 2025, the token’s value could break its recent all-time high and range between $0.0123 and $0.0134 in the near future. Wallet Investor , however, offers a much more bearish projection for ZBCN, forecasting that the token might reach a maximum of only $0.00589 by late 2025. Will Zebec Network go up or down in five years? Zebec Network price prediction 2030 According to CoinCodex’s expectations, ZBCN is projected to trade between $0.009 and $0.0296 by 2030. Wallet Investor’s predictions also indicate a positive trend, estimating that the token could reach a maximum of $0.0219 by late May 2030. DigitalCoinPrice forecasts an even higher range, with ZBCN’s value expected to trade between $0.029 and $0.0336, with a likely average of around $0.0333 by year-end. Should you invest in Zebec Network? ZBCN has some solid growth drivers, including new partnerships and a recent big token rally. While short-term price dips are possible, long-term outlooks from analytical sources remain mostly positive. There’s good potential for growth, but as with any crypto, market ups and downs are something to keep in mind. In summary, Zebec shows real promise, but it’s wise to watch how key developments play out before making an investment decision.

If the bill clears those potential obstacles and passes this week, it'll mark the first time a major piece of crypto legislation has cleared the Senate. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is the Senate's much-revised effort to regulate the issuers of stablecoins — the steady tokens generally based on the value of a U.S. dollar, such as Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC. The bill already cleared the Senate Banking Committee and an earlier floor-vote test with major bipartisan support , though many Democratic critics tied the effort to concerns over President Donald Trump's personal crypto business interests . ""As the bill continues through the amendment process, we respectfully urge lawmakers to remain committed to its central goal: providing a targeted and comprehensive approach to stablecoin oversight,"" some of the top Washington lobbying groups said in a joint statement on Monday, signed by the leaders of the Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, DeFi Education Fund and the Digital Chamber. This marks a first policy engagement from new Blockchain Association CEO Summer Mersinger, who just left her commissioner post at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday. Senate Majority Leader John Thune had said he'd throw open the final debate on the GENIUS Act open to amendments, and more than 50 of them were delivered. As often happens to legislation with momentum, lawmakers have latched onto the bill in hopes of letting their unrelated efforts ride its coattails to victory. In this case, the senators behind the Credit Card Competition Act that aims to force more competition between card issuers filed to add that as an amendment to the stablecoin legislation. Policy analysts such as Ian Katz at Capital Alpha Partners give the credit-card initiative very low odds of getting signed into law — 10-15%, Katz said in a Monday research note. His firm had a more optimistic outlook for the GENIUS Act, putting it at ""a 60-65% chance of becoming law this year."" While approval in this chamber of Congress represents the most difficult of all the hurdles faced by the legislation, it would still need approval in the House of Representatives, which may have its own ideas on how to approach stablecoins.

Joe Lubin, a name synonymous with the very foundation of Ethereum, is stepping into the institutional investment arena in a big way. This isn’t just another crypto fund; it’s an Ethereum Investment firm spearheaded by one of the network’s key architects, and its inspiration comes from an unlikely source: Bitcoin maximalist Michael Saylor. The Spark: A Conversation with Michael Saylor According to recent reports, Joe Lubin , the CEO of Consensys and a pivotal figure in the creation of Ethereum, revealed he quietly launched a dedicated Ethereum Investment firm about six months ago. What prompted this strategic move? Lubin himself points to a revealing conversation he had with Michael Saylor, the outspoken founder of MicroStrategy. For years, Michael Saylor has been a leading voice in the institutional adoption of Bitcoin, turning MicroStrategy into a corporate vehicle for accumulating vast amounts of BTC, often utilizing leverage. Saylor’s conviction and aggressive strategy for Bitcoin clearly resonated with Lubin, sparking an idea that would eventually lead to his own investment vehicle, albeit focused squarely on Ethereum. Lubin acknowledged Saylor’s approach as an inspiration but also highlighted a key difference in his own firm’s strategy: while he seeks to raise substantial capital to acquire more Ethereum, he intends to do so while avoiding excessive leverage. This nuance is critical and suggests a focus on sustainable, long-term growth rather than high-risk speculation. Understanding the Inspiration: Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy To fully appreciate Lubin’s inspiration, it’s helpful to understand the strategy employed by Michael Saylor at MicroStrategy. Saylor transformed his software company into a de facto Bitcoin treasury, using corporate cash flow and significant debt financing (leverage) to purchase billions of dollars worth of BTC. His core thesis is that Bitcoin is the superior store of value and that accumulating it aggressively is the best long-term strategy for the company and its shareholders. Key aspects of Saylor’s approach include: Aggressive Accumulation: Consistently buying Bitcoin, often during market dips. Utilizing Leverage: Taking on debt to fund Bitcoin purchases, amplifying potential gains (and risks). Long-Term HODLing: A strong conviction in Bitcoin’s future value, with no intention to sell in the short or medium term. Public Advocacy: Becoming a vocal proponent for Bitcoin’s adoption by corporations and institutions. This strategy, while highly successful during bull markets, also carries significant risks, particularly related to the leveraged positions. Market downturns can put pressure on these positions, though MicroStrategy has navigated these challenges so far. Lubin’s Vision: A Focused Ethereum Investment Firm Inspired by the scale and conviction of Saylor’s institutional push into crypto, Joe Lubin is now applying a similar institutional focus, but with Ethereum as the sole target asset. The new Crypto Investment Firm aims to attract capital specifically for accumulating ETH. Why Ethereum? Lubin’s long-standing belief in the network’s potential is well-known. Ethereum is not just a digital store of value; it’s the backbone of a vast decentralized ecosystem encompassing DeFi, NFTs, decentralized applications (dApps), and now, with the Merge and subsequent upgrades, a sustainable, yield-bearing asset through staking. For institutional investors looking beyond just a store of value, Ethereum offers a compelling mix of technological innovation and economic activity. Lubin’s strategy, as revealed so far, centers on: Capital Raising: Actively seeking funds from investors, likely institutions and high-net-worth individuals. Direct ETH Purchases: Using the raised capital to buy Ethereum on the market. Avoiding Excessive Leverage: A cautious approach to debt compared to Saylor’s method, prioritizing capital preservation alongside growth. Focus on Ethereum: A singular focus on ETH, believing in its unique position and future trajectory in the digital economy. Comparing Strategies: Saylor’s BTC vs. Lubin’s ETH While the inspiration is clear, the differences in strategy are notable. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Michael Saylor (MicroStrategy) Joe Lubin (New Firm) Target Asset Bitcoin (BTC) Ethereum (ETH) Primary Goal Corporate Treasury / Store of Value Investment Firm / Capital Growth Use of Leverage Significant Avoids Excessive Leverage Funding Source Corporate Cash Flow, Debt Financing Raising External Capital Inspiration Bitcoin as Digital Gold Saylor’s Institutional Push, Ethereum Ecosystem Lubin’s approach appears designed to be more palatable to traditional institutional investors who might be wary of the risks associated with high leverage, even while being attracted to the growth potential of digital assets like Ethereum. It signals a maturation in how crypto investments are being structured for larger pools of capital. What Does This Mean for Institutional Ethereum Investment? The launch of a dedicated Crypto Investment Firm by a figure as prominent as Joe Lubin focused solely on Ethereum is highly significant for several reasons: Institutional Validation: It sends a strong signal to traditional finance that Ethereum is a serious asset class worthy of dedicated investment vehicles. Potential Capital Inflow: A firm actively raising capital specifically for ETH could lead to substantial new money entering the Ethereum ecosystem. Focus on ETH’s Unique Value: Unlike general crypto funds or Bitcoin-only strategies, this firm is positioned to highlight and capitalize on Ethereum’s specific strengths, such as its role in DeFi, NFTs, and staking yields. Benchmark for ETH Funds: It could serve as a high-profile example for other fund managers considering launching Ethereum-specific strategies. Coming from the head of Consensys , a leading Ethereum software company building critical infrastructure for developers and enterprises, this move further bridges the gap between the core development of the network and the financial mechanisms needed for institutional participation. Challenges and Opportunities Ahead While the prospects for institutional Ethereum Investment are promising, the new firm will undoubtedly face challenges: Market Volatility: Crypto markets are notoriously volatile, which can impact fund performance and investor confidence. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and investment firms is still evolving globally. Competition: While focused on ETH, the firm competes for institutional capital with traditional asset classes and other crypto investment products (like Bitcoin ETFs). Educating Investors: Explaining Ethereum’s complexities (PoS, staking, gas fees, upgrades) to traditional investors requires significant effort. However, the opportunities are equally compelling. As the Ethereum ecosystem continues to grow and mature, offering more predictable yields through staking and clearer regulatory frameworks emerge, the appeal for institutional capital is likely to increase. A dedicated firm with deep ties to the ecosystem, led by Joe Lubin , is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. Actionable Insights for the Reader For those following the crypto market, Lubin’s new venture offers valuable insights: Institutional Interest is Diversifying: While Bitcoin led the charge, institutional focus is clearly expanding to include Ethereum, recognizing its unique utility and economic activity. Understand Different Strategies: Note the contrast between high-leverage strategies (like Saylor’s) and capital-raising, lower-leverage approaches (like Lubin’s proposed method). Risk tolerance varies greatly. Monitor Capital Flows: Keep an eye on reports about institutional capital raising and deployment into Ethereum. This can be a significant market driver. Ethereum’s Ecosystem Matters: The success of this firm is tied not just to ETH price but also to the continued health and growth of the decentralized applications and protocols built on Ethereum. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum Investment The launch of a dedicated Ethereum Investment firm by Joe Lubin, a co-founder of the network and head of Consensys , marks a pivotal moment. Inspired by the institutional conviction demonstrated by Michael Saylor with Bitcoin, Lubin is now channeling that energy into Ethereum, but with a potentially more conservative, capital-raising approach that avoids excessive leverage. This move underscores the growing maturity of the Ethereum ecosystem and its increasing appeal to institutional capital. It signals a future where dedicated investment vehicles play a crucial role in bringing significant resources into the network, potentially driving further adoption and development. As this new firm seeks to raise capital, the crypto world will be watching to see how this strategic push shapes the landscape of institutional Crypto Investment Firm activity around Ethereum.

While Cardano remains an established player, its stumble has opened the door for newer competitors like Ruvi AI, which is rapidly gaining traction. With its dynamic presale performance and promising utility, Ruvi AI is increasingly being considered a viable contender in the race toward a $1 token valuation. Here’s why Ruvi AI has captured attention and may be an exciting alternative investment option. Cardano’s struggle and investor diversification Cardano’s weekly dip is a stark reminder of the crypto market’s volatility. While the project has a strong reputation for innovation and scalability, its price performance can sometimes lag behind investor expectations. This dip has encouraged many to explore alternatives that combine robust technology with the potential for faster returns. Enter Ruvi AI, a project that has already raised over $1.5 million in its ongoing presale and sold approximately 135 million tokens. Comparisons between the two have started to emerge, but Ruvi AI’s fresh approach to blockchain and its integration with artificial intelligence set it apart. Ruvi AI’s early momentum Ruvi AI’s presale is currently in Phase 2, which has been met with significant enthusiasm: Over 1,400 holders have already joined the project. A 33% price increase is set to occur after Phase 2, offering early investors a major advantage. Nearly 135 million tokens have been sold, reflecting robust demand and market confidence. This rapid growth showcases Ruvi AI’s ability to capture attention and position itself as a strong competitor in the $1 valuation race.

These applications ensure that Ruvi AI is not just another speculative investment but a project with clear utility and scalability, much like the foundations that made Cardano a success. Maximize returns through VIP investment tiers Another compelling aspect of Ruvi AI’s offering is its VIP investment tiers, which provide lucrative bonuses for early backers: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. These tiers allow investors with varying budgets to participate in Ruvi AI’s growth while maximizing their returns as the token value rises.

Its presale success, innovation-driven applications, and strategic partnerships give it an edge in a competitive market. Ruvi AI’s target price of $1 per token by Q4 2025 outlines a clear roadmap for investors seeking massive growth. For those looking to move beyond established players, Ruvi AI appears to be a compelling choice. Final thoughts Cardano’s dip has reignited debates about its growth prospects, but it has also opened the door for emerging competitors like Ruvi AI. By addressing real-world issues and leveraging innovative technology, Ruvi AI offers an exciting opportunity for investors seeking high-impact results in a shorter timeframe. With its growing community, impressive presale success, and forward-thinking approach, Ruvi AI may not only join the race to a $1 valuation but could potentially outpace traditional contenders.

However, the crypto space is evolving, and a new emphasis on utility is propelling projects like Ruvi AI into the spotlight. With analysts predicting a $1 valuation for Ruvi AI by 2026, the question on many investors’ minds is whether this AI-powered token could outperform Shiba Inu in delivering exceptional returns. Ruvi AI’s $1 Valuation Target Ruvi AI’s presale success has been nothing short of remarkable, laying the foundation for its ambitious $1 target by Q4 2025 or early 2026. Currently in Phase 2 of its presale, the project has: Raised over $1.5 million from enthusiastic investors. Sold nearly 135 million tokens , reflecting growing community support. Planned a 33% price increase after Phase 2 , further incentivizing early participation. Unlike Shiba Inu, whose value stemmed largely from hype, Ruvi AI differentiates itself by leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. Its innovative approach could make the $1 prediction more than just optimism, offering tangible growth opportunities for investors. Real-World Applications Drive Ruvi AI’s Value Shiba Inu was the quintessential meme token, thriving on social media buzz but lacking substantial use cases. Ruvi AI, by contrast, underpins its valuation with practical utility in sectors poised for disruption: Healthcare: Employing AI to enhance diagnostics, streamline operations, and improve patient outcomes. Logistics: Transforming supply chain operations by optimizing workflow and reducing inefficiencies, saving time and money. Finance: Redefining digital payments and fraud prevention systems to create safer, smarter solutions. These operations tie Ruvi AI’s growth directly to industry needs, ensuring its value evolves with real-world adoption rather than speculative trends. Comparative Return Potential Shiba Inu famously turned modest investments into life-changing gains, particularly for early adopters who bought before its historic spikes. However, the once-hyped token now faces challenges tied to limited utility and market saturation. Ruvi AI, on the other hand, appears to offer superior growth potential within a much shorter timeframe. With tokens currently priced at just $0.07 during Phase 2, its presale bonuses and achievable $1 target offer a pathway to significant returns: Over 13,000% Growth Potential: A $1 valuation by 2026 equates to life-changing returns for early backers. 33% Immediate Gains: Phase 2 investors will benefit from a guaranteed price increase once this stage concludes. Utility-Driven Demand: Real-world applications ensure Ruvi AI’s value will likely endure beyond speculative cycles. VIP Investment Tiers Maximize Reward Potential One of the most appealing aspects of Ruvi AI’s presale is its VIP-tier investment system , which ensures added benefits for early participants. Here’s a detailed breakdown: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Total tokens acquired: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $4,900. Value at $1 per token: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Total tokens acquired: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token: $15,680. Value at $1 per token: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Total tokens acquired: 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07 per token: $89,600. Value at $1 per token: $1,280,000. Such attractive returns affirm that Ruvi AI is designed to reward early adopters generously, regardless of their initial investment level. Strategic Partnerships Bolster Ruvi AI’s Growth To further solidify its position, Ruvi AI has partnered with the WEEX Exchange , enhancing the accessibility of its token. By providing reliable and scalable entry points for global investors, this collaboration adds another layer of confidence to Ruvi AI’s ecosystem. Why Ruvi AI Could Outperform Shiba Inu If Shiba Inu proved anything, it’s that explosive returns are possible even in speculative markets. Ruvi AI takes this to the next level by combining utility-focused offerings with rapid growth opportunities. Here’s why it stands out: Faster Growth Timeline: Shiba Inu’s biggest gains came after a prolonged build-up. Ruvi AI is delivering comparable returns within a tighter timeframe. Real-World Use Cases: By targeting multi-billion-dollar sectors like healthcare and logistics, Ruvi AI’s value stands on sustainable ground. Early Investment Perks: The current presale phase allows investors to capitalize on VIP benefits while prices remain low. Strong Vision: With an end goal of reaching $1 per token by 2026 and scalable tech, Ruvi AI is built for long-term relevance. Final Thoughts While Shiba Inu brought immense excitement to the crypto landscape, its hype-first model may limit its staying power. Ruvi AI , with its emphasis on innovation , real-world utility , and investor rewards , presents a more compelling case for those seeking high returns in a shorter timeframe. For investors who missed Shiba Inu’s early days, Ruvi AI offers a second chance to profit from a truly disruptive technology. Don’t miss the opportunity to be part of a project that could redefine industries and deliver unparalleled rewards.

45434041,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=763416,1748905219,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/45434041.jpeg,Wave Count Analysis Reveals The XRP Price Trigger Point For Take-Off,https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-trigger-point-for-take-off/,"The XRP price may be on the verge of a significant breakout, according to a new wave count analysis combining the Elliott Wave Theory and the Wyckoff reaccumulation principles. After months of sideways trading and corrective movement, analysts have pinpointed a critical price level that could serve as a trigger point for XRP’s next leg higher. XRP Price Primed For Major Lift-Off From This Level A new analysis published by crypto analyst the ‘Charting Prodigy’ on X (formerly Twitter) suggests that the XRP price is following a clear Elliott Wave structure that began forming after the April lows this year. The price has completed Wave 1 of a new impulse cycle, followed by a WXY corrective Wave 2. Related Reading: XRP Price Risks Crash Below $2 As Correction Takes Hold, Here’s Why Recent price action also indicates that XRP is now entering sub-wave 3 of Macro Wave 5, which is typically the most powerful and extended wave in the cycle. The standout detail of Charting Prodigy’s analysis is the identified trigger level at $2.56. According to the expert’s analysis, a confirmed breakout above this critical trigger point could signal the start of a rapid markup phase, potentially propelling XRP toward the $2.9 to $3.4 range. The significance of this bullish target is supported by not only the Elliott Wave analysis but also the Wyckoff reaccumulation, Fibonacci extension targets, and the emergence of a bullish divergence forming on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD). Notably, the analyst points to a classic Wyckoff accumulation structure taking shape on the XRP price chart. He identified key phases such as Preliminary Support (PSY), Automatic Rally (AR), and Secondary Test (ST). The structure also included a “spring” phase and, most recently, a Last Point of Support (LPS). The emergence of these Wyckoff elements suggests that XRP has completed its reaccumulation and has entered the aforementioned markup phase, where price tends to go parabolic. The combination of these technical indicators and chart patterns also indicates that $2.65 is the level to watch as XRP makes its way up to price levels close to its former ATH. XRP Set For Double-Digit Target In 2 Weeks According to a new chart analysis by crypto analyst Egrag Crypto, XRP may be on the verge of a historic breakout. Presenting a 2-week price chart, the analyst highlights a macro bullish formation that could push XRP into double-digit territory—targeting $10, $18, $27, and even a whopping $55 in the months ahead. Related Reading: XRP Holds Midline Support That Has Led To Breakout In The Past, Why $2.9 Could Be Next Egrag Crypto’s chart draws attention to a long-standing macro ascending channel that XRP has respected since 2016. Past breakouts from similar setups have historically delivered exponential gains for the cryptocurrency. The key trigger, according to the analysis, is a decisive move above the 21-week timeframe. This same signal preceded XRP’s explosive rally in 2017 when it surged from under 1 cent to an all-time high of $3.84. Notably, the analysis emphasizes the importance of remaining within this macro ascending channel, indicating that as long as the lower trendline holds and the 21 EMA is breached, XRP’s bullish case remains intact.

At the same time, the XRP price action is stabilizing above key support levels, hinting at a potential move higher. While both assets are attracting technical traders, a different kind of momentum is forming around Web3 ai . This new AI-powered crypto project is currently in stage 7 of its presale, with $WAI priced at $0.000402. With a confirmed listing price of $0.005242, it presents a projected return of 1303.95%. Backed by over $6.8 million in raised funds and a full suite of AI tools set to launch post-listing, Web3 ai is catching the eye of investors looking for more than just charts, it’s offering real utility. Chainlink (LINK) Builds Strength with Technical Setup for Potential Breakout After an extended consolidation period, Chainlink (LINK) appears to be gaining traction. The asset is forming a symmetrical triangle pattern, typically a sign that a sharp price move is coming. If LINK can push past the upper boundary of the triangle, analysts expect a move toward the $20 mark. Momentum indicators are trending upward. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is rising, showing growing buyer activity. Accumulation at current levels suggests that larger holders may be positioning ahead of a potential breakout. Meanwhile, development on the Chainlink protocol continues at a steady pace. As overall market volatility returns, traders are revisiting LINK due to its strong fundamentals and real-world data applications. For many, the Chainlink (LINK) market outlook suggests it’s trading below value compared to other assets in the same category. XRP Maintains Support at $0.52 as Traders Watch for Upside The XRP price action is showing signs of stability as it continues to hold above the $0.52 support level. This area, which has historically acted as a launching point for rallies, is once again drawing interest. If XRP can move above resistance at $0.55, analysts are setting short-term targets around $0.60. Technical indicators back this view. RSI remains close to neutral, giving the token room to rise if buyers step in. Price action has also tightened, which often leads to a breakout once momentum returns. With on-chain data showing increased activity and positive sentiment returning after regulatory uncertainty, XRP could be preparing for a stronger move. Holding this zone makes it one to watch in the weeks ahead. Web3 ai’s $WAI Token Offers Traders a Unified AI Toolkit, & Early Access Web3 ai is quickly resonating with traders who are fed up with switching between multiple platforms just to keep up. Right now, most active crypto users rely on a mix of tools, one for tracking yields, another for managing risk, a separate one for scam alerts, and yet another for executing trades. It’s inefficient and often leads to missed opportunities or costly mistakes. Web3 ai tackles this problem head-on with a unified AI-powered platform that brings everything under one roof. Backed by the $WAI token, it delivers real-time alerts, automated trade execution, portfolio scans, and smart risk rebalancing, all designed to cut through the clutter and help traders make smarter, faster decisions. These features aren’t in development, they’re scheduled to go live immediately after the token lists. That means presale participants aren’t just betting on future potential, they’re securing early access to a fully operational trading ecosystem. Currently in stage 7, $WAI is priced at $0.000402, with a set listing price of $0.005242. That offers early buyers a projected return of 1303.95%. With over $6.8 million raised and momentum building, Web3 ai isn’t just another altcoin, it’s shaping up to be a critical upgrade for navigating today’s fast-moving crypto market. Wrapping Up The Chainlink (LINK) market outlook and XRP price action show potential for gains, but Web3 ai is approaching the market differently. Instead of focusing on short-term volatility, it’s delivering tools aimed at long-term trading efficiency. With features like arbitrage scanners, automated insights, and decision-ready alerts, the project offers practical value for both beginners and professionals. At $0.000402 in stage 7, with a locked listing price of $0.005242, $WAI delivers a built-in return potential of 1303.95%. Unlike many new tokens that focus on hype, Web3 ai is ready with a working product. Once live, these tools will provide immediate benefits for users. In 2025, tokens offering usability and solving actual market pain points could lead the way. Web3 ai is building exactly for that reality, making it a project that might not just perform well, but outperform much of the competition.

According to reports, some key Trade Agreements are anticipated to be finalized or see substantial breakthroughs before the critical date of July 9th. This development signals potential shifts in global economic dynamics and warrants a closer look at what it could mean for various sectors, including the broader financial landscape. Why is July 9th a Key Date for Trade Agreements? The specific context around the July 9th deadline wasn’t detailed in the initial report, but deadlines in trade negotiations often correlate with specific events, legislative calendars, or negotiation rounds. Reaching agreements by a set date can accelerate implementation and provide certainty to businesses and markets. For the US Treasury , finalizing trade terms is crucial as it directly impacts customs revenue, international capital flows, and overall economic stability. The push towards this deadline suggests a concerted effort to lock in terms on specific deals, potentially with key trading partners. Understanding the types of agreements potentially being discussed is important. These could range from bilateral deals focusing on specific trade barriers or sectors to multilateral discussions aimed at broader frameworks. The nature and scope of these agreements will significantly influence their impact on global commerce and investment. How Do Trade Agreements Influence Financial Policy and Stability? Trade agreements are not just about goods crossing borders; they have profound implications for Financial Policy and overall economic health. Here’s how: Currency Stability: Trade balances influence currency exchange rates. Agreements can include provisions related to currency practices. Investment Flows: Treaties often include protections and rules for foreign investment, impacting capital mobility. Market Access: Reduced tariffs and non-tariff barriers open up new markets for businesses, potentially boosting corporate earnings and economic growth. Regulatory Alignment: Agreements can push for harmonization or recognition of standards and regulations, reducing compliance costs. Risk Assessment: Predictable trade relationships reduce geopolitical and economic uncertainty, contributing to Financial Stability . The US Treasury plays a vital role in these negotiations, advising on the financial implications, potential economic impacts, and ensuring that agreements align with domestic financial regulations and goals. Success in reaching these agreements by July 9th could be viewed positively by markets, signaling effective diplomacy and a clearer path for international trade. What Does This Mean for the Economic Outlook? Positive developments in Trade Agreements can significantly shape the Economic Outlook . Here are some potential effects: Boost to Exports/Imports: Easier trade can lead to increased volumes, benefiting industries involved in international commerce. Supply Chain Optimization: Clearer rules can help businesses optimize their global supply chains. Inflationary/Deflationary Pressures: Changes in import costs due to tariffs or trade barriers can impact consumer prices. Agreements aimed at reducing barriers could ease inflationary pressures. Investor Confidence: Certainty in trade relations typically boosts business and investor confidence, encouraging investment and expansion. Conversely, failure to reach agreements by the deadline, or reaching unfavorable terms, could introduce uncertainty and potentially dampen the positive economic outlook. The market reaction will likely depend on the specifics of the agreements and the perceived success of the negotiations. Considering the Broader Global Policy Context These anticipated Trade Agreements are part of a larger picture of Global Policy shifts. Nations are constantly renegotiating terms, forming new alliances, and adapting to changing geopolitical and economic realities. The US Treasury’s involvement underscores the financial dimension of these global interactions. Decisions made now will set precedents and frameworks for future international economic cooperation. For observers of the financial world, including those in the cryptocurrency space, monitoring these traditional economic indicators and policy shifts is crucial. While cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, their value and adoption are influenced by macroeconomic factors, regulatory environments, and overall market sentiment, all of which can be impacted by major trade and financial policies. Actionable Insights and Looking Ahead For market participants and those interested in the intersection of policy and finance, the period leading up to and following July 9th will be critical. Here are some actionable insights: Monitor Official Announcements: Keep a close watch on statements from the US Treasury and other involved government bodies regarding the progress and specifics of the trade talks. Assess Industry Impact: Consider how potential agreements might affect specific sectors – agriculture, technology, manufacturing, etc. – and the companies within them. Evaluate Currency Movements: Trade news often impacts foreign exchange markets. Observe Market Sentiment: Watch how major stock indices and other financial assets react to news regarding the negotiations. Stay Informed on Global Policy: Understand that these trade talks are part of broader international relations and economic strategies. While the direct impact on cryptocurrencies might not be immediately obvious from a trade agreement announcement, shifts in global economic stability, investor confidence, and regulatory approaches stemming from such policies can create ripple effects throughout the entire financial ecosystem. A more stable and predictable global trade environment, facilitated by successful agreements, could potentially foster a more favorable climate for investment across various asset classes, including digital assets. Conclusion: A Deadline Worth Watching The statement from the US Treasury Deputy Secretary regarding expected Trade Agreements by July 9th highlights an important upcoming milestone in international economic relations. These developments are central to the US’s Financial Policy and have significant implications for the global Economic Outlook . While the specifics remain to be seen, the push towards this deadline underscores the importance placed on these negotiations. Monitoring the outcomes will provide valuable insights into the direction of Global Policy and its potential effects on markets worldwide. It’s a reminder that the traditional financial world and the emerging digital asset space are increasingly interconnected, with macroeconomic and policy decisions in one realm often influencing the other.

Data confirms that shipping volumes have plunged to their lowest level in over a year, signaling deeper trade disruptions. This downturn has historically acted as a bellwether for risk-off sentiment in digital assets, with many market participants bracing for potential liquidity squeezes. Such macroeconomic shifts often amplify the need for resilient digital assets that can offer not just speculative appeal but actual utility and consistency. In this climate, attention is rapidly shifting toward coins that demonstrate structural strength and consistent growth. One such standout in this shifting tide is Qubetics ($TICS), whose presale trajectory and real-world applications are proving attractive amid uncertain global indicators. Qubetics steps up at a time when the crypto sector is hungry for solutions that aren’t just theoretical. By delivering a truly functional ecosystem built on cross-chain compatibility, Qubetics sets itself apart from legacy projects that struggled with scalability and real-world integration. Its core application—a non-custodial multi-chain wallet—offers a streamlined experience across major blockchains. Meanwhile, Chainlink is treading carefully as it flirts with a crucial price floor that could trigger a drop to $8, and SUI is navigating a recovery narrative after its community greenlit a $162 million recovery plan. These recent developments within the crypto ecosystem reflect a wider demand for long-term stability, making these three contenders the best cryptos to join for long term. Qubetics Is Rebuilding Crypto Utility with Real Application-First Infrastructure Qubetics ($TICS) proves to be a solution-first platform, addressing some of the most persistent challenges in digital finance. At the heart of its offering is the Qubetics Wallet, a non-custodial, multi-chain infrastructure that allows both individuals and enterprises to operate seamlessly across blockchain networks. Built with real-world usage in mind, the Qubetics Wallet includes compatibility with mainstream platforms such as Apple Pay and Google Pay and supports virtual debit card functionality. This means a digital content creator in Canada can receive $TICS for freelance services and spend it instantly via a virtual card, while a business in Singapore can conduct cross-border transactions without relying on third-party conversion services. By consolidating multiple blockchain functionalities into a single, user-friendly environment, Qubetics creates a bridge between crypto-native operations and traditional finance mechanisms—making it a standout among the best cryptos to join for long term. Additionally, the Qubetics Wallet features a live fiat conversion mechanism. It allows users to convert $TICS into stablecoins like USDT or USDC instantly during a transaction, insulating both users and merchants from crypto price volatility. This real-time mechanism is already integrated, which gives users more flexibility in how they use their holdings. It’s not just about speculation anymore—it’s about usability. With its structured framework and scalable application suite, Qubetics delivers meaningful impact to both individual users and businesses, reducing friction in cross-border transactions and giving token holders complete flexibility and security over their assets. Why Qubetics Stage 37 Stands Out Among the Best Cryptos to Join for Long Term The Qubetics presale is currently in its 37th stage, offering $TICS tokens at a price of $0.3370. So far, the platform has raised over $17.6 million, with more than 514 million $TICS tokens sold and over 27,400 holders onboard. What sets the Qubetics presale apart is its structured progression—each stage lasts precisely seven days and ends every Sunday at 12:00 AM, with the token price increasing by 10% at the beginning of the next stage. This schedule not only rewards early participation but also builds natural pricing momentum for those looking to enter the market early. At the current stage, the token presents one of the most structured and transparent entries for community members seeking access to a high-utility coin. As it stands, this ongoing initiative continues to reinforce Qubetics as a leading candidate in the best crypto presale segment. For participants evaluating ROI potential, the projections are compelling. An investment of $2,000 at the current $TICS price would purchase around 5,940 tokens. If the token hits $1 post-presale, the return would be approximately $5,940—an ROI of 196.65%. If it reaches $5, the return jumps to $29,700, representing 1,383.25% ROI. A $10 valuation after the mainnet launch would translate into a return of $59,400 or a 2,866.51% ROI, and at $15, it reaches a massive $89,100—an ROI of 4,349.76%. The Qubetics mainnet is scheduled for Q2 2025, which provides a clear, near-term milestone for early buyers. This combination of structured growth, tangible application, and aggressive ROI scenarios secures its position within the best cryptos to join for long term and highlights the strength of the Qubetics presale as the best crypto presale currently available. Chainlink Dips Toward Make-or-Break Territory as Support Wavers Chainlink (LINK) is encountering serious price pressure as it approaches a critical support level of $12.30. Analysts warn that a breach of this floor could drag LINK’s value down to $8—a substantial decline from its recent high of $14.01. This bearish projection comes amid a broader market slowdown and suggests caution is warranted for those holding or considering LINK in the near term. The token’s behavior around this key support level could determine its trajectory in the upcoming weeks, especially if sell-offs continue and market confidence dips. Despite the short-term risks, Chainlink continues to evolve technically. The latest iteration of its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP v1.6) now supports non-EVM blockchains, beginning with Solana. This move marks a major step in expanding LINK’s reach into new blockchain ecosystems. Furthermore, Coinbase has integrated Chainlink’s proof-of-reserve technology to verify $4.6 billion worth of cbBTC holdings, boosting transparency and trust in crypto-backed assets. These updates reflect LINK’s ambition to expand its utility base and retain relevance even as market volatility looms. While price concerns remain, the development side of Chainlink is undeniably active. SUI Holds Strong Amid $223M Exploit Fallout and Major Governance Decision SUI’s blockchain network recently faced an immense stress test following the $223 million Cetus exploit. Rather than spiraling, the token maintained critical support at the $3.40 mark. This price resilience signals strong community backing and belief in the project’s fundamentals. One major boost came from an on-chain governance vote, where over 90% of validators supported a $162 million recovery plan to return frozen assets to impacted users. This rapid, transparent response helped stabilize sentiment and protected the platform’s integrity. On the technical side, SUI is signaling possible bullish momentum. A golden crossover has formed as the 50-day EMA moved above the 200-day EMA—typically a strong indicator of upward potential. SUI’s open interest also climbed to $1.77 billion, showing increasing futures market confidence and renewed trading activity. While the Cetus event could have been catastrophic, the combination of smart governance and technical strength has kept SUI in a favorable position. These developments reinforce SUI’s place among the best cryptos to join for long term. Broader Market Pressure Makes Resilient Cryptos More Appealing With global trade under stress, notably from the massive drop in China-to-U.S. shipping volumes, sentiment across crypto markets has been impacted. Traders are growing cautious, as shipping slowdowns often precede broader economic turbulence. Such macro events highlight which crypto projects are built to endure and which rely too heavily on speculative capital. Chainlink’s price pressures, SUI’s crisis response, and Qubetics’ steady growth path all reflect different types of resilience in today’s market. Qubetics, currently in its presale phase, offers a distinct edge in this environment. Its pricing model ensures consistent value growth through weekly 10% increases, giving early adopters a clear runway to accumulate ahead of the Q2 2025 mainnet launch. Unlike publicly traded tokens exposed to market mood swings, Qubetics maintains stability during presale—making it one of the few options showing reliable progression in a climate that demands it. As economic signals continue flashing yellow, coins like Qubetics, Chainlink, and SUI demonstrate why strategic entry points matter now more than ever. Why These Three Cryptos Deserve a Closer Look Right Now In a climate marked by trade slumps, price volatility, and community resilience, Qubetics, Chainlink, and SUI each show unique strengths. Qubetics stands out through its real-world utility, strategic presale mechanics, and scalable wallet solutions. Chainlink continues pushing interoperability boundaries while SUI shows admirable community strength after a major exploit. All three projects are weathering current conditions while preparing for longer-term relevance. For those evaluating where to allocate attention and capital in 2025, these three remain among the best cryptos to join for long term. This might also be the ideal moment to join this best crypto presale and explore long-term holdings with depth, functionality, and strong foundations.

Today, major U.S. indices began the trading session on a lower note, a movement that often sends ripples across global financial markets, including the dynamic Crypto Market . Understanding these traditional market shifts is crucial for navigating the interconnected world of finance. Decoding the Initial US Stock Market Dip At the start of trading, key U.S. indices showed declines: S&P 500: Down 0.25% Nasdaq Composite: Down 0.33% Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 0.16% While these percentages might seem small, they represent the collective action of millions of trades within minutes of the Market Open . The Nasdaq Decline , though modest initially, is often watched closely by tech investors, and its performance can sometimes signal broader trends impacting growth-oriented assets, a category that includes many cryptocurrencies. Why Does the US Stock Market Matter to the Crypto Market? The relationship between the US Stock Market and the Crypto Market has evolved. Historically, crypto often traded independently. However, as digital assets gain mainstream adoption and institutional interest, their correlation with traditional risk-on assets, like technology stocks found in the Nasdaq, has increased. Here’s why this connection is relevant: Investor Sentiment: Shifts in Investor Sentiment in traditional markets can spill over into crypto. If investors are feeling cautious about the economy or specific sectors, they may reduce exposure to riskier assets across the board. Liquidity Flows: Large institutional investors often hold positions in both stocks and crypto. Decisions to reallocate capital or raise cash in one market can influence the other. Macroeconomic Factors: Both markets react to major economic news, such as inflation data, interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve, and geopolitical events. A factor causing stocks to dip is likely being considered by crypto investors too. What Drives the Nasdaq Decline and Broader Market Weakness? Pinpointing the exact cause of a specific day’s dip at the Market Open is complex, but it’s usually a reaction to a combination of factors: Potential Factor Impact on Stocks Relevance to Crypto Inflation Concerns Can lead to expectations of higher interest rates, potentially hurting growth stocks. Higher rates can make traditional investments more attractive relative to risk assets like crypto. Interest Rate Outlook Markets react strongly to signals from the Federal Reserve regarding monetary policy. Monetary tightening can reduce overall market liquidity, impacting crypto valuations. Corporate Earnings Reports Weak earnings from major companies can signal economic slowdowns. Poor performance in the tech sector (often linked to Nasdaq) can mirror or influence sentiment towards crypto. Geopolitical Events Global instability can increase market uncertainty and drive investors to safer assets. Crypto’s reaction varies; sometimes seen as a hedge, other times follows risk-off moves. Today’s specific dip could be a reaction to overnight news, pre-market data, or simply a continuation of recent trends influenced by these larger economic forces. The Nasdaq Decline is often sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations due to its heavy weighting in technology stocks. How is Investor Sentiment Shifting? The lower open suggests a degree of caution among market participants right from the start of the trading day. This cautious Investor Sentiment is a key indicator that traders in the Crypto Market monitor closely. When traditional investors are hesitant, it can limit upward potential or even trigger sell-offs in correlated assets like Bitcoin and altcoins. Conversely, positive sentiment returning to stocks can provide tailwinds for crypto. Navigating the Market Open Dip: Actionable Insights For those focused on the Crypto Market , the lower Market Open in U.S. stocks offers a moment for reflection: Observe Correlation: Watch how Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other major cryptocurrencies react in the hours following the stock market open. Is the correlation holding? Is crypto showing resilience or weakness? Monitor Macro News: Keep an eye on the economic calendar. Any significant data releases or central bank commentary later in the day could further influence both markets. Assess Risk Tolerance: A dip in traditional markets serves as a reminder of broader market risks. Re-evaluate your portfolio’s exposure and ensure it aligns with your risk tolerance, especially in volatile assets like crypto. Look for Divergence: While correlation exists, periods of divergence can occur. If crypto holds strong or even rallies while stocks dip, it could signal unique strength within the digital asset space. Conclusion: A Signal of Caution Today’s lower Market Open for the US Stock Market , highlighted by the initial Nasdaq Decline , serves as a clear signal of cautious Investor Sentiment . While not a direct determinant of crypto prices, the performance of major indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow provides crucial context for the broader financial environment. Crypto market participants should remain vigilant, observing how these traditional market movements might influence liquidity and sentiment in the digital asset space throughout the trading day. Staying informed about macro trends is more important than ever in today’s interconnected financial landscape.

The Russian newspaper Izvestia reported that documents unveiled in court this month confirmed law enforcement officers have frozen and seized coins from Pavlov’s crypto wallets . Hydra Darknet Server Operator ‘Was Paid in Crypto’ Pavlov testified that he received the cryptoassets in the form of “a salary and bonuses” in return for maintaining Hydra servers. A criminal ring paid Pavlov “about 15 million rubles ($189,277) a year” in crypto for his services, prosecution officials explained. The accused said that he did not sell his coins for cash. Instead, he held on to the crypto, hoping that its price would continue to grow. Hydra operators also paid Pavlov cash to cover maintenance costs, prosecution officials added. A branch of the Moscow District Court jailed 16 people for orchestrating Hydra in December last year. The operation’s mastermind Stanislav Moiseev was jailed for life after the court heard that the portal facilitated over $5 billion in crypto transactions . Prosecutors said that Russian experts agreed with Chainalysis estimates about the size of the firm’s crypto turnover. Stanislav Moiseev, the mastermind behind the notorious online black market Hydra, has been handed a life sentence by a Russian court. #Hydra #Crypto https://t.co/9uuAfft63K — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) December 4, 2024 ‘Couriers Brought Pavlov Bags of Cash’ Moiseev and others handed Pavlov money to rent and maintain servers at the German company Hetzner, prosecutors explained. These costs alone amounted to 1.5-2 million rubles ($18,928-$25,239) per month. Hydra managers “periodically” sent Pavlov couriers with bagfuls of cash, prosecutors added. Hydra’s annual turnover at the time of closure was $1.7 billion, a Rosfinmonitoring employee testified at Pavlov’s trial. The staffer estimated that the platform took cuts of 2% to 5% from crypto transactions made on Hydra. Rosfinmonitoring (officially the Russian Federal Financial Monitoring Service) is the nation’s top anti-money laundering agency. Another expert testified that that the “net profit of Hydra’s co-founders alone,” taking into account-related services, amounted to “about 100 billion rubles ($1.3 billion) a year.” Last month, Chainalysis reported that while there was a 15% decline in global crypto sales across darknet markets in 2024, Russian sites bucked the trend. The latter saw a 68% rise in crypto sales , the firm said.

Recent reports indicate that major record labels are engaging in crucial discussions with leading AI music generation companies, Udio and Suno. These talks could set a significant precedent for how artists and copyright holders are compensated in the age of generative AI. Why are Major Record Labels Talking to Udio and Suno? According to recent reports, Universal Music Group (UMG), Warner Music Group (WMG), and Sony Music Entertainment are actively pursuing licensing agreements with AI startups Udio and Suno . These discussions are happening against a backdrop of legal challenges, as the labels previously filed copyright infringement lawsuits against both companies. The core of these negotiations revolves around establishing a formal framework for licensing the vast catalogs of music owned by the labels. This framework aims to define how AI companies can legally use existing copyrighted music for training their models and, crucially, how artists and rights holders will be compensated when AI generates new music based on these models. What Do Udio and Suno Do? Udio and Suno are at the forefront of generative AI music technology. They provide platforms where users can simply enter text prompts describing a desired sound or song, such as “a jazzy tune about future technology” or “an upbeat pop track with female vocals.” The AI then processes these prompts and generates an audio recording. This technology has exploded in popularity, making music creation accessible but also raising complex questions about copyright and originality. Key Points of Negotiation The talks between the major record labels and the AI firms involve several critical aspects: Licensing Terms: Defining the scope and terms under which Udio and Suno can use copyrighted music. Compensation Model: Determining how artists and labels will be paid, potentially through royalties or other revenue-sharing models. Equity Stakes: Reports suggest the labels are pushing to receive small equity stakes in both Udio and Suno , giving them a vested interest in the AI companies’ success. Control vs. Flexibility: Labels seek more control over how their work is used and protected, while AI firms want flexibility to innovate and experiment with their technology. These discussions represent a potential shift from confrontation (lawsuits) to collaboration (licensing). A successful agreement could avoid lengthy and costly legal battles, providing a clearer path forward for both the traditional music industry and the burgeoning AI music sector. The Broader Implications for Music Licensing These negotiations between major record labels and platforms like Udio and Suno are being watched closely across the entire music industry and other creative fields. The outcome could set a precedent for how AI companies interact with copyright holders globally. It highlights the urgent need for new models of music licensing that account for the unique capabilities and challenges presented by generative AI. For the crypto community, this mirrors the ongoing discussions around digital ownership, royalties, and smart contracts in decentralized ecosystems. Finding a balance that allows AI innovation to flourish while ensuring fair compensation for artists is paramount. These talks are a significant step towards establishing that balance, potentially creating a new paradigm for music licensing in the digital age powered by artificial intelligence. The future of music creation and distribution is undoubtedly being shaped by AI. Agreements like the ones being discussed with Udio and Suno will play a crucial role in determining how that future unfolds for artists, labels, and listeners alike.

Over a recent five-week period, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have witnessed an astonishing influx of capital, drawing in over $9 billion. At the same time, traditional safe-haven assets held in Gold ETFs have experienced substantial outflows, exceeding $2.8 billion. This divergence, highlighted by data from Unfolded, suggests a potential reallocation of capital as investors increasingly look towards digital assets like Bitcoin. The Rise of Spot Bitcoin ETF Inflows Since their launch in the United United States, Spot Bitcoin ETFs have quickly become a popular investment vehicle. They offer investors a regulated and accessible way to gain exposure to the price movements of Bitcoin without directly holding the cryptocurrency. The $9 billion in inflows over just five weeks is a clear indicator of strong demand, primarily from institutional investors and traditional finance players who were previously hesitant or unable to invest directly in crypto markets. Several factors are contributing to this surge: Accessibility: ETFs trade on major stock exchanges, making them easy to buy and sell through standard brokerage accounts. Regulatory Clarity: The approval of these ETFs by the SEC provided a level of legitimacy and regulatory comfort for many investors. Institutional Interest: Large investment firms and wealth managers can now allocate client funds to Bitcoin more easily. Market Sentiment: A positive outlook on Bitcoin’s future potential and its narrative as a store of value is driving interest. This rapid accumulation of assets under management within Spot Bitcoin ETFs is a major development for the cryptocurrency industry, signaling growing mainstream acceptance. Gold ETF Outflows: A Fading Traditional Appeal? While Bitcoin ETFs are attracting billions, Gold ETFs are seeing the opposite trend. Outflows exceeding $2.8 billion in the same period indicate that some investors might be rotating out of gold positions. Gold has historically been considered a primary hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. However, recent market dynamics and the emergence of Bitcoin as a potential alternative store of value seem to be influencing investor decisions. Why might investors be moving away from gold? Possible reasons include: Search for Higher Yield/Growth: In a dynamic market, some investors may seek assets with higher potential growth than gold. Bitcoin’s ‘Digital Gold’ Narrative: Bitcoin’s characteristics, such as scarcity and resistance to censorship, resonate with some of the same principles that traditionally made gold attractive. Macroeconomic Factors: Changing expectations around inflation, interest rates, and economic growth could impact the appeal of traditional safe havens like gold. Performance Comparison: Bitcoin has significantly outperformed gold over various timeframes, which could lead investors to favor the digital asset. This trend of Gold ETF outflows alongside significant Bitcoin ETF inflows highlights a potential shift in how investors perceive and allocate assets for wealth preservation and growth. Bitcoin vs Gold: The Battle for ‘Digital Gold’ The comparison between Bitcoin vs Gold is not new, but the recent ETF flow data brings it sharply into focus. Bitcoin proponents argue that it possesses many of gold’s desirable characteristics while also offering unique advantages: Key Comparison Points: Scarcity: Bitcoin has a fixed supply of 21 million coins. Gold’s supply increases over time through mining. Portability & Divisibility: Bitcoin can be sent anywhere globally instantly and divided into tiny fractions (satoshis). Gold is physically cumbersome and difficult to divide. Verifiability: Bitcoin transactions are transparent on the blockchain. Verifying gold’s purity and authenticity can be complex. Resistance to Seizure/Censorship: With proper self-custody, Bitcoin is difficult for third parties to seize. Gold can be confiscated. Historical Performance: Bitcoin has shown much higher volatility but also significantly higher returns since its inception compared to gold. Market Structure: Gold has a long-established, deep market. Bitcoin’s market is newer and still evolving, especially with the introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs . While gold has millennia of history as a store of value, Bitcoin is rapidly building its track record in the digital age. The recent fund flows suggest that a growing number of investors are beginning to view Bitcoin as a legitimate alternative or complement to gold in their portfolios. Navigating Crypto Market Trends and What This Means These significant inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs are not just about Bitcoin; they are part of broader Crypto Market Trends . The success of these ETFs could pave the way for similar products tracking other cryptocurrencies, further integrating digital assets into traditional finance. For investors, this trend signifies: Increasing Legitimacy: The entry of major financial institutions via ETFs lends credibility to the crypto space. New Investment Avenues: Traditional investors now have easier ways to access the potential growth of digital assets. Market Maturation: The infrastructure around Bitcoin and crypto is becoming more robust. However, it’s crucial to remember that the crypto market remains volatile. While the inflows are positive, prices can still experience significant swings. Investors should approach the market with caution and conduct thorough research. Actionable Insights for Investors What should investors take away from this data? Assess Your Portfolio: Consider how digital assets like Bitcoin fit into your overall investment strategy and risk tolerance. Understand the Vehicles: If considering Bitcoin exposure, research the differences between buying Bitcoin directly, investing in Bitcoin futures ETFs, or using Spot Bitcoin ETFs . Each has different implications. Diversification: While Bitcoin offers potential benefits, diversification across different asset classes remains a core investment principle. Long-Term View: The ‘digital gold’ narrative often implies a long-term holding strategy, similar to how many investors approach gold. Stay Informed: Keep track of regulatory developments, market news, and ongoing Crypto Market Trends . The movement of capital from gold into Spot Bitcoin ETFs is a powerful signal. It reflects evolving investor perceptions and the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class in the digital age. Whether this trend continues long-term remains to be seen, but the initial data is compelling. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Gold? The data showing massive inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs and corresponding outflows from Gold ETFs over the past five weeks is more than just a statistic; it’s a narrative shift in real-time. It highlights the growing confidence among investors, particularly within traditional finance, in Bitcoin’s role as a potential store of value and a hedge in the modern economy. While gold has served this purpose for centuries, the digital characteristics of Bitcoin, coupled with the accessibility provided by new investment products, are clearly attracting significant capital. This trend underscores the increasing importance of digital assets within the global financial landscape and positions Bitcoin as a serious contender in the ongoing discussion about the future of ‘digital gold’.

The search engine company was accused of violating antitrust laws. There will be amendments to establishing a new board committee focused on risk oversight and compliance , which was previously overseen by Alphabet’s audit and compliance committee. This came after the initial agreement addressed so-called derivative lawsuits against top officials at Google’s parent company, Alphabet. They include CEO Sundar Pichai and co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page. This filing took place recently. US District Judge Rita Lin in San Francisco must still approve the agreement. Google agrees on a settlement with its shareholders in antitrust lawsuit The DOJ antitrust lawsuit against Google is pending, but the company has settled with its shareholders over the same allegations. Shareholders led by two Michigan pension funds had accused executives and directors at Google of dereliction of duties. According to them, this exposed the company to potential antitrust issues related to its search, Ad Tech, Android and app distribution businesses, and advertising technology. As part of the settlement, Alphabet plans to create a senior vice president-level committee to deal with regulatory and compliance issues and report directly to Pichai. Managers from Google’s product teams and internal compliance experts will also form the compliance committee. While it may have agreed to this settlement, Google maintains that it did nothing wrong. The Mountain View, California-based company claimed it has invested heavily in building strong compliance mechanisms. Google asserted that it was pleased to commit to avoid prolonged legal disputes . The shareholders’ attorneys revealed that the changes were rarely seen in shareholder derivative cases, representing a complete overhaul of Alphabet’s compliance efforts. Based on the attorneys’ argument, the changes have been made to a “deeply rooted culture change.” The changes must stay in effect for at least four years, and shareholders will not receive any payments. Patrick Coughlin wants to seek $80 million more on top of a $500 million settlement Patrick Coughlin, a shareholder lawyer, described the settlement in an interview as one of the largest ever made by a company to support compliance committees for regulations. Coughlin revealed they found that the board was not getting full reports of antitrust risks. “There were actions it could have taken and should have taken much earlier,” he added. The announcement of the settlement coincided with a hearing by US District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, who last August determined that Google broke federal antitrust laws to keep its search dominance. The shareholders’ lawyer intends to seek as much as $80 million for legal fees and expenses on top of a $500 million settlement. Neither the shareholders’ lawyers nor Google responded to requests for comment.

Priced at just $0.00000035 , this meme coin is turning heads with an 80% bonus that’s fueling investor excitement. As Sui (SUI) quietly gains momentum, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioning itself not just as a meme coin rival but as a breakout star ready to outshine both XRP and Sui (SUI) in the coming bull cycle. Here’s why the XRP price is stuck, and why FloppyPepe (FPPE) might flip the narrative. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Rockets Ahead: The Meme Coin That’s Leaving XRP And Sui (SUI) Behind As the XRP price struggles to break free from its price stagnation and Sui (SUI) quietly gains ground with steady growth, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is capturing attention with explosive momentum. Moreover, its Telegram and X communities have surged in activity, and its private presale raised nearly $1 million in under 24 hours, signaling massive demand and investor confidence, which sets it up to potentially outshine both XRP and Sui (SUI). What sets FloppyPepe (FPPE) apart is a powerful combination of strategy, substance, and growing hype. Backed by a SolidProof- audited smart contract and infused with AI-driven value, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is more than just another ordinary token. Priced at just $0.00000035 , and with an 80% bonus available for early adopters using the code FLOPPY80 , this meme coin is drawing in savvy investors and meme coin enthusiasts alike. Unlike XRP and Sui (SUI), FloppyPepe (FPPE) boasts a strong foundation, built under the direction of Matt Furie, giving it both cultural clout and credibility. With momentum on its side, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is positioning itself not just as a rising meme coin but as a serious rival ready to eclipse XRP and Sui (SUI) in the next bull run. Driving FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) rise is its unique economic engine known as Floppynomics , a purpose-built token model where every transaction: 1% Holder Rewards: With each trade, a portion is instantly redistributed to FloppyPepe (FPPE) holders. 1% Burn Mechanism: A fraction of every transaction is permanently burned, gradually reducing supply and boosting the token’s scarcity. 1% to Charity: FloppyPepe (FPPE) allocates a slice of every transaction to charitable initiatives, proving crypto can give back while it grows. What XRP Price Consolidation Means for Long-Term Holders An analyst has revealed that the XRP price remains stuck in a consolidation phase, despite substantial institutional backing. Currently priced at around $2.14, the XRP price has failed to reclaim upward momentum. The chart outlines a potential rebound from this area, but until a clear breakout occurs, the XRP price appears trapped in a cycle of indecision. A recovery remains possible for the XRP price if support holds, but weak upward movement has investors waiting for clearer signals. Sui’s (SUI) Bullish Blueprint: A Breakout Hinges On One Crucial Zone An analyst has identified a significant consolidation zone for Sui (SUI), currently trading at around $3.15, noting that the price action is repeatedly testing a well-defined support block. Despite recent downward pressure, Sui (SUI) has shown resilience around this level. The chart highlights this support zone in grey, acting as a cushion during the ongoing corrective structure. The analyst’s projection envisions a bullish recovery scenario should the support hold firm, with a possible rally toward higher resistance levels. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Takes Flight: How AI And Memes Are Powering The Next Big Crypto Surge At the heart of FloppyPepe (FPPE) is the Meme-o-Matic , an AI-powered Telegram agent that turns simple text or images into viral content within seconds. Moreover, FloppyX , a dynamic video bot framework, is designed to generate engaging visuals and interact with users. Supporting the entire experience is FloppyAI , which delivers sharp market insights and handles complex questions. Priced at just $0.00000035 , this meme coin is capturing the crypto world’s attention with an 80% early adopter bonus available using the code FLOPPY80 . Influencers are driving hype, communities are rallying, and momentum is surging across platforms.

This mix of low entry, strong community, and upcoming exchange support makes it one of the most compelling options before the presale ends. 2. Arbitrum: Signs of Rebound Despite Pressure Currently priced at $0.3425, Arbitrum has dropped 0.89% in the last 24 hours. Its price is swinging between $0.3692 and $0.4234, pointing to short-term pressure. Still, some analysts see a bounce coming, possibly pushing ARB toward the $0.475–$0.50 range if Ethereum sentiment strengthens. As one of the best cryptos today for layer-2 solutions, Arbitrum’s path depends heavily on Ethereum’s next upgrade. Pectra could improve L2 flow, but ARB needs a unique trigger to regain attention. Forecasts point to a 28% upside this month, but near-term moves may remain shaky. It’s worth watching for anyone aiming to enter lower and hold for recovery. 3. Uniswap: Dip and Upgrade May Drive Gains Uniswap is currently at $6.17 after slipping 0.70% in 24 hours. The price is bouncing between $6.43 and $7.16, though predictions call for a climb to $8.01 by June and possibly $12.42 by August. That 113% possible rise is attracting new interest. As one of the best cryptos today in DeFi, UNI’s upcoming V4 upgrade is a major point to watch. It’s expected to improve protocol design and give liquidity providers more tools. That could help drive real usage, not just a temporary rally. While it’s not flashy like meme coins, UNI’s slow and steady development could pay off for those targeting Q3 returns. 4. Dogecoin: Stability with Potential for a Push Dogecoin is now priced at $0.1931, slightly up by 1.67% in 24 hours, with recent moves between $0.2045 and $0.2259. Traders are eyeing the $0.253 mark, which could signal a breakout if passed. If DOGE crosses that level, it could aim for $0.275 to $0.30 in June. DOGE still holds its place among the best cryptos today because of its social strength and name power. The coin also gets support from FioBit’s AI cloud mining tools, which are making it easier for users to join in. Plus, talk of a 21Shares Spot Dogecoin ETF could introduce more exposure. If the ETF happens, it could change DOGE’s market position fast. BlockDAG Stands Out with Low Price and High Delivery While DOGE, UNI, and ARB each offer something for different types of buyers, BlockDAG is checking every box. With over $282 million raised, a price frozen at $0.0018, and more than 21.8 billion coins sold, it’s delivering in real time. Its tech is active, the mobile app has scale, and the GO LIVE reveal set for June 13 only adds to the appeal. Among the best cryptos today , BlockDAG isn’t waiting on upgrades or future events to prove its value. It’s already pushing forward, and the time to act is now before this presale window closes.

Long-Term Holders Exit While Retail Buyers Rush In,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-warning-signs-long-term-holders-exit-while-retail-buyers-rush-in/,"As Bitcoin (BTC) retreats from its recent all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 – currently trading in the mid-$100,000 range – emerging on-chain data signals that the cryptocurrency’s strong momentum over the past month may be waning. Deeper Correction Ahead For Bitcoin? According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by contributor Amr Taha, the Bitcoin market is undergoing several notable on-chain shifts. These include significant stablecoin outflows from Binance, a decline in long-term holder (LTH) participation, and diverging accumulation patterns among wallet cohorts. Related Reading: Bitcoin Eyeing $112,000 After Bullish Double Bottom Breakout, Analyst Says One of the most striking indicators is the net outflow of over $1 billion in stablecoins from Binance. This suggests traders are moving funds off the exchange and into private wallets, typically a sign of reduced risk appetite or diminished intent to buy crypto in the near term. Such large-scale stablecoin withdrawals often indicate declining buying power and can precede a loss of market momentum or a shift toward profit-taking and caution. If the trend continues, BTC may slip further, potentially losing the psychologically important $100,000 level. In parallel, long-term holders (LTH) have also pulled back. The Net Position Realized Cap for LTHs plummeted from $28 billion to just $2 billion by the end of May 2025 – signaling that these investors are no longer increasing their exposure despite the recent price surge. Further, 60-day wallet behavior trends point to a divergence in market sentiment. Large holders with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC have been gradually offloading their positions, while smaller retail cohorts holding 100 to 1,000 BTC have been aggressively accumulating, buying into the rally. Taha remarked: The combination of heavy stablecoin withdrawals, reduced LTH accumulation, and shifting cohort behaviors signals a market in transition. Whether this sets the stage for a cooling-off period, a healthy consolidation, or renewed momentum will depend on how new capital re-enters the system and whether retail buyers can sustain the current rally without institutional reinforcement. All Hope Is Not Lost While the aforementioned data points hint toward a potential looming price correction for the apex digital asset, other on-chain data shows that BTC is likely to continue its upward trajectory, potentially to new ATHs. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surges With Low Retail Interest – Is A Second Wave Coming? CryptoQuant contributor Crypto Dan recently highlighted that the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss (NRPL) metric supports a continued upward trajectory, noting that current profit-taking levels are modest compared to previous cycle peaks. Additionally, BTC outflows from centralized exchanges are increasing, with a recent 7,883 BTC withdrawal from Coinbase. This could point to renewed institutional interest and accumulation in anticipation of another upward move. At press time, BTC trades at $103,854, down 0.2% in the past 24 hours.

In a new interview with Tucker Carlson, Johnson says that there may be a time when those living on social benefits will be left out to dry if the government can no longer afford to fund its extensive welfare state while also running massive deficits. Says Johnson, “If you’re living on different transfer payments or different types of welfare benefits, you may not get those. You can’t borrow more money, so you’re going to have to take what money we spend on other government programs, and we’ll have to service our debt. You have to pay it off, unless we want to go into full default… Which means you’ll never float more debt, so other than print more money, which creates even more hyperinflation… We will lose our position as the world’s reserve currency, and we’ll lose our ability to print dollars that people accept. It’s a marvelous thing that we just print dollars, we can send them overseas, people will produce products and ship them over here, high-quality products at a pretty low cost. That’s one of the reasons we’ve been able to keep inflation in check, producing all these massive deficits over the last couple of decades, because we do import a lot of products. We’ve got billions of people that are either un or under-employed around the world, we provide the capital, they produce the factories, they produce the goods, we just give them paper. It’s fiat currency, we print it, we keep printing it, and it’s been working out pretty well.

A significant step in this evolution was recently announced by Frankfurt-based 21X Exchange , which has integrated Circle’s USDC stablecoin as a core settlement currency for its platform. This move is set to streamline the process for institutional investors looking to trade Tokenized Securities , marking a key development in the convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset space. What are Tokenized Securities and Why Do They Matter? Before diving into the specifics of the 21X integration, let’s quickly recap what Tokenized Securities are. Essentially, they are digital representations of traditional assets like stocks, bonds, real estate, or funds, issued and managed on a blockchain. This process, known as tokenization, brings several potential advantages: Increased Liquidity: Tokenization can make traditionally illiquid assets (like real estate) more easily tradable by breaking them into smaller, digital units. Faster Settlement: Blockchain-based settlement can potentially reduce the multi-day settlement cycles common in traditional markets to minutes or even seconds. Greater Accessibility: Depending on the asset and platform, tokenization can lower barriers to entry for certain investments. Transparency and Auditability: Transactions recorded on a blockchain are typically immutable and verifiable. For Institutional Investors , these benefits are particularly compelling. They are constantly seeking efficiency, speed, and new avenues for capital deployment, all while navigating complex regulatory environments. USDC: The Stablecoin Powering Digital Asset Settlement Circle’s USDC is one of the most widely used and regulated stablecoins in the digital asset ecosystem. Pegged 1:1 with the US dollar, USDC provides stability in value, making it an ideal candidate for the settlement layer in digital asset transactions. Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies, its price is designed to remain constant, mitigating market risk during the settlement period. The integration of a stablecoin like USDC addresses a critical need in the digital asset market: a reliable, digital medium of exchange that can move just as quickly as the tokenized asset itself. Traditional settlement often involves complex processes involving custodians, clearing houses, and banks, leading to delays and increased counterparty risk. By using USDC, 21X is enabling what’s known as ‘delivery vs. payment’ (DvP) on-chain, where the tokenized security and the payment (USDC) are exchanged near-simultaneously on the blockchain. 21X Exchange: Building a MiCA-Compliant Hub for Institutional Crypto The 21X Exchange positions itself as a platform specifically designed for the issuance and trading of Tokenized Securities for institutional clients. Based in Frankfurt, a major European financial hub, 21X is keenly focused on regulatory compliance, particularly with the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation. MiCA aims to provide a clear legal framework for crypto-assets, stablecoins, and related service providers within the EU, which is crucial for attracting risk-averse institutional capital. The integration of USDC is a strategic move that aligns perfectly with 21X’s goals: Regulatory Alignment: While MiCA is still being fully implemented, stablecoins like USDC are being scrutinized and integrated into the framework. Using a well-established stablecoin helps 21X navigate these evolving regulations. Attracting Institutional Investors: Institutions require reliable, efficient, and compliant settlement mechanisms. USDC provides a widely accepted and understood digital dollar for this purpose. Creating a Multi-Currency Environment: The platform aims to support settlement in various currencies, and starting with a major digital dollar like USDC is a foundational step. This focus on compliance and institutional needs differentiates 21X and is key to unlocking the potential of Institutional Crypto adoption in Europe. Accelerating Digital Asset Settlement: The Mechanics The core benefit of 21X integrating USDC lies in the acceleration of Digital Asset Settlement . Traditionally, settling a securities trade can take T+2 days (trade date plus two business days). This delay introduces risk and ties up capital. With tokenized securities and stablecoin settlement on a blockchain, the process can be significantly faster. On the 21X platform, when an institutional investor trades a tokenized stock or bond, the exchange of the tokenized asset for USDC can happen almost instantaneously on the distributed ledger. This ‘wallet-based settlement’ means the assets and the payment move directly between participants’ regulated digital wallets, reducing reliance on intermediaries and speeding up the finality of the transaction. Let’s look at a simplified comparison: Feature Traditional Securities Settlement Tokenized Securities Settlement (with USDC) Settlement Time T+2 Business Days (or longer) Minutes to Hours (near real-time) Intermediaries Numerous (brokers, clearing houses, custodians, banks) Fewer (Exchange, regulated wallet providers) Settlement Asset Central Bank Money / Commercial Bank Money Stablecoin (e.g., USDC) Risk Counterparty risk during settlement period Smart contract risk, platform risk, regulatory clarity risk Complexity High Potentially lower for participants, requires digital infrastructure This efficiency gain is not just theoretical; it translates into real-world benefits like reduced capital requirements (less need to pre-fund positions), lower operational costs, and the ability to recycle capital faster. Benefits for Institutional Investors For the target audience of Institutional Investors , the 21X-USDC integration offers several compelling advantages: Enhanced Capital Efficiency: Faster settlement frees up capital quicker, allowing for more active trading strategies. Reduced Operational Overhead: Streamlined processes can lead to lower back-office costs. Access to New Markets/Assets: Tokenization can open up investment opportunities in assets previously difficult to access or trade efficiently. Regulatory Certainty (Emerging): Operating within a framework aiming for MiCA compliance provides a level of legal clarity essential for institutions. Potential for 24/7 Trading: While not fully realized in all markets yet, blockchain settlement enables the possibility of trading outside traditional market hours. This development is a clear signal that the digital asset infrastructure is maturing to meet the stringent requirements of institutional players. Challenges and the Path Forward While the integration of USDC by 21X is a significant positive step, the path to widespread institutional adoption of Tokenized Securities and Digital Asset Settlement isn’t without its challenges: Regulatory Harmonization: While MiCA is key, global regulatory frameworks for tokenized securities and stablecoins are still evolving and need harmonization. Scalability and Interoperability: Ensuring the underlying blockchain technology can handle institutional volumes and interoperate with existing financial infrastructure is crucial. Custody Solutions: Institutions require robust, regulated custody solutions for their digital assets and stablecoins. Market Liquidity: Building sufficient liquidity in tokenized markets takes time and requires broad participation. Education and Adoption: Overcoming inertia and educating traditional finance professionals about the benefits and mechanics of digital assets is an ongoing process. Despite these hurdles, the trend is clear. Platforms like 21X, by integrating established digital currencies like USDC and focusing on compliance, are actively building the bridges needed for traditional finance to comfortably step into the digital asset future. Actionable Insights for the Market What does this development mean for different market participants? For Institutions: It’s time to seriously evaluate platforms offering regulated trading and efficient Digital Asset Settlement using stablecoins. Explore pilot programs and understand the operational changes required. For Exchanges and Market Infrastructure Providers: Focus on building compliant, scalable, and interoperable platforms. Stablecoin integration is becoming essential. For Stablecoin Issuers (like Circle): Continue working closely with regulators and financial institutions to ensure stablecoins meet the requirements for widespread financial market use. For Regulators: Continue developing clear and consistent frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring market integrity and investor protection. The integration of USDC by 21X is more than just a technical update; it’s a tangible example of how the infrastructure for institutional-grade Tokenized Securities trading is being built, piece by piece. Conclusion: A Step Towards a More Efficient Financial Future The decision by 21X Exchange to integrate USDC for the settlement of Tokenized Securities is a significant milestone. It addresses a core need for Institutional Investors by providing a faster, more efficient, and potentially less risky method for settling trades in the burgeoning digital asset market. By aligning with the principles of MiCA and leveraging a widely trusted stablecoin, 21X is positioning itself at the forefront of building the next generation of financial market infrastructure. This move underscores the growing importance of stablecoins in enabling real-world financial applications on the blockchain and brings us closer to a future where Digital Asset Settlement is the norm, not the exception.

The transfer is a part of Tether and Bitfinex’s venture into Twenty One Capital, the new Bitcoin treasury company. Ardoino, who also serves as CTO of Bitfinex, explained on X (formerly Twitter) that the funds were sent as part of a “pre-funding” phase tied to the company’s launch and equity raise. The Bitcoin was moved to a wallet linked to Twenty One Capital’s public treasury, signaling that both Tether and Bitfinex are endorsing the venture and committing substantial assets to back it. The 25,812 BTC is now publicly seen on the blockchain explorers. Bitcoin was trading close to $105,000 at the time of the transfer. That puts the total value of the transaction at nearly $2.7 billion. Twenty One Capital plans to stockpile Bitcoin Twenty One Capital is run by Jack Mallers, who founded Strike and is the chief executive of Zap. Last month, he introduced the company, framing it as a daring gambit straddling Bitcoin and traditional capital markets. It aims to amass one of the largest Bitcoin treasuries on the planet. Twenty One also plans to hold as much as 42,000 BTC, which would put it among the largest corporate Bitcoin holders in the world, Mallers said. It is a strategy inspired by Saylors’s Strategy, which became a market leader by taking on corporate debt to buy Bitcoin. Mallers said that Twenty One Capital would indeed take a similar approach. Including equity and convertible notes, the company has already raised $685 million. Tether, Bitfinex, and SoftBank are among the backers in this round. Mallers added that the company will sell $100 million in new convertible notes. The proceeds from the sale will go toward buying even more Bitcoin. The company has pledged to provide wallet addresses for the Bitcoin it will buy because of this offering — once again, transparency reigns. Twenty One Capital will go public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Cantor Equity Partners (CEP). Upon the deal’s close, the combined company will trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol “XXI.” The deal’s value is based on the average price of Bitcoin at $84,863.57 during the funding round, according to the announcement, and pegs Twenty One Capital at $3.6 billion. CEP’s shares soared after the announcement. On Monday, it gained 7%, to $43, and reached a spike of $59.75 soon after. This is a testament to investor enthusiasm around the Bitcoin treasury model. Twenty One Capital is making a name for itself as a serious Bitcoin-native company — with traditional financial muscle behind it. Backing the venture alongside Cantor Fitzgerald is Wall Street powerhouse SoftBank, which offers both tech and finance credibility. Twenty One Capital shares wallets to boost confidence Transparency is what sets Twenty One Capital apart. Jack Mallers shared a public Bitcoin wallet address containing 4,812 BTC as the company’s initial proof of reserves. Additional wallet addresses will be published soon, he said— including those associated with Tether, Bitfinex, and one with Tether on behalf of SoftBank. This shift toward public wallets is meant to instill more confidence in investors. In an area where many other people in Bitcoin have been criticized for lack of transparency, Mallers wants Twenty One Capital to be completely auditable as long as people can access the blockchain. This style is more fashionable than it once was within the cryptosphere, given high-profile fiascos like FTX, as proof-of-reserves, once again, grew more popular. By disclosing its wallets and reserve strategy to the public, Twenty One Capital attempts to demonstrate that companies holding Bitcoin treasuries can be transparent and answerable to the public trust.

This isn’t just another token; it’s the omnichain token version of their popular gold-backed asset, XAUt (also known as Tether Gold ). This development marks a pivotal step towards creating a more interconnected and liquid digital asset ecosystem. What is Tether XAUt and Why Does Omnichain Matter? Before diving into XAUt0, let’s quickly recap Tether Gold , or XAUt. Launched by TG Commodities Limited, XAUt is designed to provide investors with exposure to the price of physical gold while offering the benefits of digital assets, such as divisibility, ease of transfer, and liquidity on exchanges. Each XAUt token represents ownership of one fine troy ounce of physical gold, held in secure vaults in Switzerland. Owning XAUt means owning a direct, verifiable claim to physical gold, without the complexities of storing or transporting the metal yourself. Historically, tokens like XAUt existed on specific blockchains, primarily Ethereum and TRON. While this offered significant advantages over traditional gold ownership, it also created silos. Moving XAUt from Ethereum to TRON, for example, required complex bridging mechanisms, wrapped tokens, or trading on exchanges, introducing friction, costs, and potential security risks. This is where the concept of an omnichain token becomes revolutionary. An omnichain token is designed to exist and move natively across multiple blockchains without needing wrapped versions or intermediaries. Think of it like having a single digital passport that works in any country, rather than needing a different visa for each one. This seamless interoperability is crucial for enhancing liquidity and usability in a multi-chain world. LayerZero and the OFT Standard: The Engine Behind XAUt0 The magic enabling XAUt0’s omnichain capability comes courtesy of LayerZero . LayerZero is an interoperability protocol designed to connect various blockchains, allowing for the secure and efficient transfer of messages and assets between them. It achieves this through a novel architecture involving on-chain endpoints, relayers, and oracles. XAUt0 is specifically built using LayerZero’s Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) standard. The OFT standard is a simple, yet powerful, implementation that allows developers to create tokens that can be sent natively across any chain connected by LayerZero. Instead of wrapping tokens or using complex bridges, OFT tokens leverage LayerZero’s messaging layer to burn tokens on the source chain and mint equivalent tokens on the destination chain. This process is designed to be more secure and capital-efficient than traditional bridging methods. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how LayerZero OFT works for XAUt0: A user wants to send XAUt0 from Chain A to Chain B. They initiate a transfer on Chain A’s XAUt0 contract. The Chain A contract locks or burns the specified amount of XAUt0. LayerZero’s protocol securely passes a message about this transaction to Chain B. The Chain B XAUt0 contract verifies the message and mints the corresponding amount of XAUt0 for the user on Chain B. The user now has native XAUt0 on Chain B, ready to be used within that ecosystem. This eliminates the need for liquidity pools on every chain pair, reducing complexity and potential slippage for users. The TON Network: A Strategic First Deployment The announcement highlighted that the initial deployment of XAUt0 will be on The Open Network (TON) . TON is a fast, scalable blockchain originally developed by Telegram. It has been gaining traction recently, particularly with its focus on integrating with the Telegram messaging app, potentially exposing it to a massive user base. Deploying XAUt0 on the TON Network is a strategic move for several reasons: Growing Ecosystem: TON’s ecosystem is expanding rapidly, offering new potential use cases and platforms for XAUt0. User Base: Potential integration points with Telegram could bring tokenized gold to a vast, non-crypto-native audience. Performance: TON is designed for high transaction throughput and low costs, making it suitable for frequent transfers and interactions with XAUt0. Expanding Reach: While XAUt was already on major chains like Ethereum and TRON, adding TON further broadens its accessibility. This initial deployment on the TON Network is likely just the beginning, as the omnichain nature of XAUt0 means it can potentially be deployed on any blockchain supported by LayerZero in the future, significantly increasing its reach and utility. Benefits and Opportunities: Why XAUt0 is a Game Changer The launch of XAUt0 offers substantial benefits for various market participants: For Institutional Investors: Enhanced Liquidity: Seamless movement across chains aggregates liquidity, making larger trades easier without significant price impact. Simplified Arbitrage: Easier transfer enables faster and more efficient arbitrage opportunities between markets on different chains. Access to Diverse DeFi Ecosystems: Institutions can now potentially utilize their gold-backed assets within DeFi protocols on various chains, unlocking new yield opportunities or collateral options. Reduced Operational Overhead: Eliminates the need to manage complex multi-chain infrastructure or rely on third-party bridges. For Web3 Users and Retail Investors: Greater Accessibility: Users on the TON Network (and potentially other future chains) can now easily access and hold Tether Gold without needing to bridge from Ethereum or TRON. Lower Costs and Friction: Sending XAUt0 across chains using LayerZero is typically more cost-effective and faster than traditional bridging methods. Increased Utility: XAUt0 can be used more freely within decentralized applications (dApps) across different chains, whether for trading, lending, borrowing, or payments. True Asset Ownership: Maintains the direct claim to physical gold while gaining unprecedented digital flexibility. This evolution of Tether XAUt into an omnichain token addresses a critical pain point in the multi-chain crypto landscape, paving the way for more fluid and integrated digital asset markets. Challenges and Considerations for XAUt0 Adoption While the potential is significant, there are also challenges and factors to consider for the widespread adoption of XAUt0: LayerZero Security: The security of the omnichain functionality relies heavily on the robustness of the LayerZero protocol. While designed with security in mind, any vulnerability in the underlying interoperability layer could impact XAUt0 transfers. Ecosystem Adoption: The success of XAUt0 on new chains like the TON Network depends on the willingness of wallets, exchanges, and dApps within those ecosystems to integrate and support the new token standard. Regulatory Clarity: The regulatory landscape for stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets is still evolving globally. Clarity and acceptance from regulators will be crucial for long-term institutional adoption. Competition: While XAUt is a leading gold token, other projects also offer tokenized gold. XAUt0’s omnichain capability provides a competitive edge, but market share will still depend on liquidity, trust, and ease of use. Addressing these points will be key to ensuring XAUt0 reaches its full potential as a truly liquid and accessible digital gold asset across the entire Web3 space. Actionable Insights for Potential XAUt0 Users If you’re interested in potentially utilizing XAUt0, here are a few actionable steps and insights: Monitor TON Ecosystem: Keep an eye on exchanges, wallets, and DeFi protocols building on the TON Network that announce support for XAUt0. Understand LayerZero: Familiarize yourself with how LayerZero transfers work and the associated fees (if any) for moving XAUt0 between chains. Verify Support: Always double-check that a platform explicitly supports the XAUt0 (OFT) standard before attempting a transfer. Sending to an unsupported address or contract could result in loss of funds. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from Tether and LayerZero regarding future chain deployments and integrations for XAUt0. Consider Your Strategy: Determine how tokenized gold fits into your investment or usage strategy. XAUt0’s omnichain nature offers flexibility, but it’s still subject to gold price volatility and crypto market risks. Conclusion: A Golden Future for Interoperability The launch of XAUt0 is more than just a token release; it represents a significant step forward in the journey towards a truly interoperable blockchain ecosystem. By leveraging LayerZero ‘s technology to make Tether Gold an omnichain token , Tether is unlocking new levels of liquidity and accessibility for a valuable real-world asset within the digital realm. The initial deployment on the TON Network is a strategic starting point, promising to bring tokenized gold to a wider audience. While challenges remain, the benefits for both institutional and retail users are clear, positioning XAUt0 as a potentially vital component in the future of decentralized finance and asset tokenization across multiple chains. This golden leap towards seamless interoperability is certainly one to watch.

Recently, the Ethereum (ETH) network and its native token have shown remarkable resilience. Despite facing significant headwinds from broader market volatility and prevailing macroeconomic pressures, the ETH price has managed to defend a crucial level, holding firmly above the $2,500 support. Understanding Ethereum’s Resilience in the Current Crypto Market The overall crypto market has been a rollercoaster, influenced by factors ranging from regulatory news to global economic indicators. Yet, Ethereum has demonstrated a notable ability to absorb selling pressure around the $2,500 mark. This level appears to be acting as a solid foundation for the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Data points highlight this strength: A recent dip saw ETH trade as low as $2,472. Crucially, the price quickly rebounded, climbing back towards $2,548. This swift recovery indicates robust buying interest emerged as the price approached the $2,500-$2,488 zone. This pattern suggests that many market participants view prices below $2,500 as attractive entry or accumulation points, contributing to the formation of strong ETH support . What’s Fueling ETH Support? Exploring Key Factors Several elements appear to be contributing to Ethereum’s ability to maintain its footing despite the challenging environment of crypto volatility : 1. Strong Demand Zones: As noted, the area around $2,488 has shown significant demand. This isn’t just random buying; it likely represents strategic positioning by investors who believe in Ethereum’s long-term value proposition or are trading based on technical indicators identifying this as a support level. 2. Steady ETF Inflows: While the focus has often been on Bitcoin ETFs, institutional interest in Ethereum is also growing. Reports of steady inflows into Ether-linked investment products signal continued institutional accumulation or exposure, providing consistent buying pressure that helps offset sell-offs. 3. Network Fundamentals: Beyond price action, the Ethereum network continues to evolve. Developments related to scalability (like Layer 2 solutions) and future upgrades contribute to the network’s utility and long-term potential, reinforcing investor confidence even during periods of price uncertainty. 4. Market Structure: Holding a key psychological and technical level like $2,500 is significant. It can act as a self-fulfilling prophecy to some extent, with traders placing buy orders around this level, thereby reinforcing its strength as support. Navigating Resistance: What’s Capping the ETH Price? While support is holding, the path upwards isn’t without its hurdles. The CoinDesk report highlights resistance near $2,550. This suggests that as the ETH price approaches this level, selling pressure increases, potentially from traders taking profits or those who bought at higher prices looking to exit their positions. Breaking convincingly above resistance levels like $2,550 would be the next technical challenge for Ethereum. A sustained move above this point could signal a potential shift in momentum, opening the door for further price appreciation. Investor Interest Remains High: A Sign of Confidence? Despite the ongoing crypto volatility and macroeconomic uncertainties that have impacted the broader crypto market , investor interest in Ethereum remains strong. This is a crucial factor. High investor interest indicates underlying belief in the asset’s future, which can provide a buffer against sharp downturns and fuel recoveries. What does strong investor interest look like? Continued participation in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) on Ethereum. Activity in the NFT space, largely built on Ethereum. Accumulation by whales (large holders) during price dips. Positive sentiment reflected in social media and news analysis. This persistent interest is a testament to Ethereum’s ecosystem and its perceived long-term value, reinforcing the strength of the ETH support levels. Actionable Insights: What Should You Watch For? For those following Ethereum, here are a few things to keep an eye on: The $2,500 Level: Continued defense of this support is key. A sustained break below it could signal further downside risk. The $2,550 Resistance: A breakout above this level, particularly on high volume, could indicate bullish momentum is building. Macroeconomic Factors: Global economic news, interest rate decisions, and inflation data continue to influence the entire crypto market , including the ETH price . ETF Flow Data: Monitor reports on inflows/outflows from Ether investment products as they provide insight into institutional sentiment. Network Development: Updates on scalability and efficiency improvements can impact long-term outlook and investor confidence in Ethereum. Conclusion: Ethereum’s Steadfast Performance In a market defined by rapid shifts and external pressures, Ethereum’s ability to hold the $2,500 support level is a significant indicator of its underlying strength and the conviction of its investors. Supported by consistent demand at key levels and bolstered by steady institutional interest via ETFs, ETH is demonstrating remarkable resilience. While resistance levels pose immediate challenges to upward movement, the strong foundation being built around the $2.5K mark suggests that Ethereum remains a key player capable of weathering periods of intense crypto volatility . Its performance continues to be a focal point for participants across the entire crypto market .

During crucial Ukraine Peace Talks held in Istanbul, Russia put forward a specific proposal that, while limited, signals potential shifts in the dynamics of the conflict. This move, and the broader context of the Russia Ukraine War , carries substantial weight for global stability and market sentiment. Understanding the Latest Development in Ukraine Peace Talks The core of the recent news revolves around a proposal made by Russia during the Istanbul negotiations. This wasn’t a broad, sweeping peace plan, but a focused, limited suggestion: Limited Ceasefire: Russia proposed a temporary ceasefire, specifically limited to a duration of 2 to 3 days. Targeted Areas: This proposed pause in fighting was not intended for all frontlines, but rather for certain specific areas. Humanitarian Aim: The stated purpose of this short ceasefire was to allow for the recovery of dead soldiers. Peace Memorandum: Alongside the ceasefire proposal, Russia also reportedly submitted a two-part peace memorandum during these Ukraine Peace Talks , outlining their broader positions or suggestions for a resolution. While seemingly small in scope, any talk of a ceasefire, even a brief one for humanitarian purposes, is notable in the context of a prolonged and intense conflict. How Does the Russia Ukraine War Influence Global Stability? The ongoing Russia Ukraine War has had far-reaching consequences extending well beyond the immediate region. It has fundamentally altered the geopolitical landscape, impacting international relations, energy markets, supply chains, and defense spending worldwide. The conflict has: Increased tensions between major global powers. Triggered significant sanctions against Russia by a coalition of nations. Caused volatility in commodity markets, particularly oil and gas. Disrupted global food supplies due to impacts on agricultural exports from both countries. Led to a refugee crisis, displacing millions of Ukrainians. These cascading effects underscore why developments in the Russia Ukraine War are not just regional news but have a profound influence on the global order and economic environment. What is the Geopolitical Impact of Such Proposals? A proposal like a limited ceasefire, even if not fully accepted or implemented, has significant Geopolitical Impact . It can be interpreted in several ways: Signal of Intent: It might signal a willingness, however slight, from one side to engage in de-escalation or address specific humanitarian concerns. Negotiation Tactic: It could also be a tactic within broader negotiations to gain leverage or influence perceptions. Testing the Waters: A limited proposal might be a way to test the possibility of implementing short-term agreements before committing to longer ceasefires or peace terms. International Pressure Response: The proposal could be a response to international pressure for humanitarian corridors or pauses in fighting. Understanding the true Geopolitical Impact requires careful analysis of the context, the specific language used, and the reactions from all parties involved and the international community. It highlights the complex diplomatic dance occurring alongside the military conflict. Exploring the Link Between Geopolitics and Global Market Stability Geopolitical events are a primary driver of Global Market Stability (or instability). Major conflicts or significant diplomatic shifts introduce uncertainty, which markets typically dislike. Here’s how they connect: Risk Assessment: Investors evaluate geopolitical risks when making decisions. Increased risk often leads to a flight to safety, favoring assets like government bonds or gold, and potentially causing sell-offs in riskier assets like stocks. Economic Fundamentals: Geopolitical events can directly impact economic fundamentals through sanctions, trade disruptions, or changes in resource prices. Sentiment: News flow related to conflicts heavily influences market sentiment, leading to rapid price swings based on optimism (from de-escalation talks) or pessimism (from renewed fighting). The proposed ceasefire, however limited, is the kind of news that analysts watch closely for its potential to influence sentiment and, consequently, Global Market Stability . Analyzing the Crypto Market Volatility in This Context The cryptocurrency market, known for its inherent volatility, is not immune to global macroeconomic and geopolitical forces. In fact, its relative youth and sensitivity mean it can sometimes react even more sharply than traditional markets to major global events. Understanding Crypto Market Volatility in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war involves several factors: Risk-On/Risk-Off Sentiment: Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and altcoins, are often treated as risk-on assets. When geopolitical tensions rise and investors become risk-averse, crypto markets can see sell-offs. Conversely, signals of de-escalation or increased Global Market Stability can improve sentiment towards crypto. Inflation Hedges vs. Risk Assets: While some view Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, the conflict has shown it also trades significantly as a risk asset, correlating with tech stocks and other growth assets. Sanctions and Capital Flight: The conflict and subsequent sanctions have also led to discussions about cryptocurrencies potentially being used for capital flight or sanctions evasion, adding another layer of complexity and regulatory scrutiny that can impact market sentiment and Crypto Market Volatility . Macro Environment: The war’s impact on inflation, interest rates, and global economic growth prospects all feed into the macro environment that heavily influences crypto prices. Therefore, news like a proposed ceasefire, even a limited one, is watched by crypto traders and investors for signals that could affect overall market sentiment and contribute to Crypto Market Volatility . Key Takeaways and What to Watch For This limited ceasefire proposal during the Ukraine Peace Talks offers several points to consider: Humanitarian Focus: The immediate stated goal is humanitarian – recovering the dead. This highlights the severe human cost of the conflict. Signal, Not Solution: It’s a small step in complex negotiations, not a resolution to the war itself. Trust and implementation remain major challenges. Market Sensitivity: Global markets, including crypto, remain highly sensitive to news from the conflict. Any signal of de-escalation or escalation can trigger rapid price movements. Continued Uncertainty: Despite talks, the overall situation remains highly uncertain, contributing to ongoing Global Market Stability concerns and potential Crypto Market Volatility . For those monitoring the markets, especially the crypto space, staying informed about these geopolitical developments is crucial. While the direct link between a 2-3 day ceasefire proposal and the price of Bitcoin might not be immediately obvious, it’s part of the larger tapestry of global events that shape investor psychology and capital flows. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty The proposal for a limited 2–3 day ceasefire during the recent Ukraine Peace Talks in Istanbul is a poignant reminder of the human impact of the Russia Ukraine War and the complex diplomatic efforts happening behind the scenes. While not a breakthrough for peace, it’s a development that contributes to the overall geopolitical narrative. This narrative, in turn, plays a significant role in shaping Global Market Stability and influencing the unpredictable tides of Crypto Market Volatility . As events unfold, the interplay between geopolitics and financial markets remains a critical area for anyone navigating the current economic landscape.

That’s the kind of life-changing upside investors in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are currently positioned to capture. The math is simple. A $1,000 investment today buys roughly 33,333 MUTM tokens. When the price hits $1, that stake will be worth $33,333. The real question isn’t whether the number sounds exciting. The real question is: what fundamental drivers are in place to make this possible? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just another DeFi token with a whitepaper full of promises. It’s already executing on a solid roadmap, delivering working financial models, and attracting real capital. With over $9.72 million raised so far and more than 11,450 holders, this is a project in motion. The core drivers of growth are already visible—earning mechanisms, a powerful token utility model, audited security, and a market-ready lending platform. Lending, Borrowing, and Passive Income Are Just the Beginning Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers two core ways to earn—Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending. In the P2C model, you can deposit assets like ETH, BNB, or AVAX into a shared liquidity pool and earn interest that adapts with market demand. The higher the usage of the pool, the higher the APY. And unlike idle staking elsewhere, this interest comes from real borrower demand within the DeFi space. In the P2P model, you lend directly to other users and set your own terms. This allows you to earn more with flexible rates and even offer loans for tokens like PEPE, DOGE, or SHIB—assets usually ignored by centralized platforms. With such direct and customizable lending options, the earning potential becomes enormous for users willing to engage more actively. When you deposit your tokens into the platform, you receive mtTokens—dynamic digital receipts that grow in value as interest accumulates. These are more than just tracking tools. By staking mtTokens in Mutuum’s safety module, users earn regular dividends distributed in MUTM, funded by a portion of the protocol’s revenue. That’s how Mutuum Finance (MUTM) rewards long-term holders—through direct, recurring value. A CertiK Audit Removes the Doubt Security is the foundation of trust in DeFi, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has already cleared this critical milestone. The project recently completed an audit by CertiK, the most respected name in blockchain code security. The Token Scan Score came in at 70.00, and the review included both manual and automated techniques to catch vulnerabilities before launch. This gives large investors and institutions the green light to enter with confidence. Many high-profile DeFi projects have collapsed due to unaudited contracts. With this step completed, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) eliminates one of the biggest threats to early adoption and market expansion. Execution: The Upcoming Beta Launch Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is not just a concept anymore—it’s preparing to go live. According to the roadmap, the beta version of the platform is scheduled to launch by the time the token becomes publicly tradable. This is a rare show of readiness in a space where many projects delay functionality until months after listing. By launching early, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will immediately begin generating lending volume, pool usage, and real returns for participants. With features that directly support the token’s value through staking, dividends, and lending utility, the stage is set for rapid growth from day one. Proof from the Past: ETH and BNB Skeptics of 33x returns often ignore how many times it’s already happened in crypto. Ethereum (ETH) traded below $1 for years. Binance Coin (BNB) launched at pennies and reached over $600. What these projects had in common was utility, community, and precise execution of a roadmap. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) already has those components in place. A working financial model, an upcoming platform, audited contracts, and a growing user base—all aligned in a sector that’s only getting bigger. The DeFi space is expected to expand dramatically in the coming years, and projects with actual user-facing products like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are in prime position to capture that growth. Presale Momentum Signals Early Success Phase 5 of the presale is currently priced at $0.03, up 200% from the Phase 1 price of $0.01. Investors who entered early have already tripled their money, and new buyers are still stepping in while the entry point remains attractive. As each phase progresses, the price increases, and the upside tightens. Waiting for later phases means spending more for fewer tokens—and missing out on the high-return window that early supporters are already enjoying. With only a few presale rounds left before the token hits public markets, this is the best moment to secure a large position ahead of the inevitable supply-demand crunch that follows a successful platform launch.

While earlier speculation suggested a call today, sources citing CNBC, including economic news account Walter Bloomberg, indicate the discussion is expected “very soon” this week. The Anticipated Trump Xi Call : What’s on the Agenda? The prospect of a direct line between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies always garners significant attention. This particular Trump Xi Call comes amidst ongoing complex dynamics between the United States and China, encompassing trade, technology, and various geopolitical flashpoints. The agenda for such a high-level discussion is likely multifaceted, potentially touching upon: Progress or lack thereof in trade negotiations or existing agreements. Specific economic policies impacting bilateral relations. Broader strategic concerns and global stability issues. Preparation for potential future in-person meetings or summits. Understanding the context of previous interactions is crucial. These calls often serve as temperature checks for the relationship and signals to the global community about the direction of future policy or negotiations. Understanding the History: US China Trade Relations Under Scrutiny The relationship between the United States and China, particularly concerning trade, has been a defining feature of recent global economics. Under President Trump, this relationship saw significant friction, marked by tariffs, trade barriers, and accusations of unfair practices. The so-called “trade war” initiated during this period had tangible effects on supply chains, commodity prices, and corporate earnings worldwide. Here’s a brief look at key aspects of the US China Trade dynamic: Period Key Characteristics Impact on Trade Pre-Trade War Growing interdependence, significant trade imbalance favoring China. High volume of goods exchange, integrated supply chains. Trade War (Trump Admin) Imposition of tit-for-tat tariffs, negotiations, “Phase One” deal. Increased costs, disrupted supply chains, reduced trade volume in some sectors. Post-Trump Admin Continued review of policies, some tariffs remain, focus on specific technologies. Ongoing uncertainty, companies reassessing reliance on China. Any conversation between the leaders is inherently linked to this history and the potential for shifts in policy, even if immediate outcomes aren’t announced. Why Does This Call Matter? Potential Global Market Impact Major geopolitical events and communications between powerful leaders like Trump and Xi invariably send ripples through financial markets. The potential Global Market Impact stems from the uncertainty or certainty such discussions can create regarding future trade policies, economic stability, and international cooperation. Stock Markets: News of positive dialogue can boost investor confidence, particularly for companies with significant exposure to either the US or Chinese market. Conversely, signs of tension can lead to sell-offs. Commodities: Prices of raw materials like soybeans, oil, and metals are often sensitive to US-China relations, as both countries are major consumers and producers. Currencies: The US Dollar and Chinese Yuan can experience volatility based on expectations about trade balances and economic health. Investor Sentiment: Overall market mood is heavily influenced by the perceived stability of the US-China relationship, which is a cornerstone of the global economic order. Market participants will be listening closely for any readouts or commentary following the call to gauge the sentiment and potential implications for various asset classes. Tracking Key Economic News for Market Signals Staying informed about crucial Economic News like the anticipated Trump-Xi call is vital for anyone involved in financial markets, including cryptocurrency investors. While crypto markets often operate on their own unique drivers, they are not entirely decoupled from the broader macroeconomic and geopolitical landscape. Key takeaways from tracking this type of news include: Risk Appetite: Geopolitical stability tends to increase investor risk appetite, potentially favoring growth assets like stocks and sometimes cryptocurrencies. Instability can lead to a flight to safety, potentially boosting assets like gold or government bonds, while impact on crypto can be mixed (sometimes seen as a hedge, sometimes selling off with other risk assets). Policy Clues: Discussions between leaders can hint at future fiscal or monetary policies, which have direct implications for inflation, interest rates, and liquidity – all factors influencing crypto valuations. Market Volatility: Uncertainty surrounding high-stakes political discussions can increase market volatility, creating both risks and opportunities. Sources like CNBC, as cited in the initial report, are primary channels for breaking Economic News that can move markets. Navigating Markets Amidst Geopolitical Tensions : What Crypto Investors Should Consider The ongoing Geopolitical Tensions between major global powers, exemplified by the complex US-China relationship, add another layer of consideration for investors. While Bitcoin was conceived partly as a response to traditional financial system vulnerabilities and centralized control, its price is undeniably influenced by global macroeconomic forces and sentiment. How do Geopolitical Tensions potentially affect the crypto market? Safe Haven Narrative: Some argue that Bitcoin acts as a digital store of value, similar to gold, that can perform well during times of geopolitical uncertainty or currency devaluation. However, this narrative is still debated and not consistently proven during all crises. Correlation with Risk Assets: At times, the crypto market, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, has shown correlation with tech stocks and other risk-on assets. Therefore, if geopolitical news negatively impacts stock markets, crypto might follow suit. Regulatory Environment: Geopolitical competition can sometimes spill over into regulatory actions against crypto, as nations view it through the lens of financial stability or control. Capital Flows: Increased tension or instability in one region might theoretically drive capital towards more stable or decentralized assets, potentially including crypto, though this is difficult to track directly. For crypto investors, it’s less about predicting the exact outcome of a single call and more about understanding the broader context of Geopolitical Tensions and how they contribute to overall market sentiment and volatility. Diversification and a long-term perspective often remain prudent strategies. Summary: Watching for Signals The anticipated call between President Trump and President Xi Jinping is a significant piece of upcoming Economic News . While the specific timing isn’t set for today, the expectation for it to happen “very soon” keeps markets on alert. Given the history of US China Trade relations and the potential for wide-ranging Global Market Impact , investors across all asset classes, including cryptocurrency, should watch for details emerging from this high-level communication. It serves as a reminder that even assets like Bitcoin are not entirely immune to the effects of major Geopolitical Tensions and the signals sent by the world’s most powerful leaders. The call’s outcome, or even lack thereof, will contribute to the complex web of factors influencing global financial sentiment in the days ahead.

Solana Has Seen A TD Sequential Buy Signal On The 12-Hour Timeframe In a new post on X, analyst Ali Martinez has talked about a signal that has appeared on the 12-hour price chart of Solana. The signal in question is based on the Tom Demark (TD) Sequential, a technical analysis (TA) indicator commonly used to identify potential reversal points in an asset’s value. The indicator involves two phases: setup and countdown. During the first of these, the setup, candles of the same color are counted up to nine. These nine candles don’t necessarily have to be consecutive. Once they are in, the TD Sequential flashes a reversal signal for the asset. Related Reading: Crypto Bulls See $644M Bloodbath As Bitcoin Dips Below $105,000 Naturally, if the candles were green (that is, an uptrend led into the signal), then the indicator suggests a bearish turnaround in the price. Similarly, red candles result in a bullish signal. As soon as the setup is complete, the second phase, the countdown, begins. This phase works in much the same way, except for the fact that candles here go on until thirteen. Following these thirteen candles, the asset could be considered to have arrived at another location of likely reversal. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the TD Sequential signal that the 12-hour price of Solana has recently formed: As is visible in the above graph, the 12-hour Solana price has recently completed a TD Sequential phase of the first type. Clearly, the nine candles involved in the pattern have been red ones, meaning that the indicator has just given a buy signal for the cryptocurrency. This signal has arrived after the asset has gone through a drawdown of more than 13% over the past week. It now remains to be seen whether it would be enough to help the coin find a bullish reversal or not. While this bullish pattern has formed in TA, on-chain data may hint at a different outcome for Solana. According to cryptocurrency transaction tracker service Whale Alert, a SOL whale has just made a massive inflow to the Binance platform. In total, the investor moved about 2.86 million tokens of the asset ($441 million) to the exchange with this transaction. Generally, holders transfer their coins to these central entities whenever they want to make use of one of the services that they provide, which can include selling.

Supporters say Bitcoin will reduce banking delays and high fees related to traditional financial institutions and, in turn, help Panama update its financial systems, attract more international shipping business , and give small shipping companies easier access to global trade. However, critics argue that because Bitcoin prices are highly volatile, the policy might expose Panama to new forms of regulatory pressure, financial risk, and geopolitical backlash from countries skeptical of crypto or fear its role in avoiding traditional finance systems. The central question facing Panama is this: Will Mizrachi’s Bitcoin plan improve global trade or risk the economy with a volatile, uncertain asset? Supporters say Bitcoin brings speed and global attention Supporters say using crypto allows smaller shipping companies without easy access to big banks to move goods faster and at lower cost by reducing slow banking steps. A Bitcoin-friendly policy could also attract tech companies, blockchain startups, and skilled workers to Panama, transforming the country into a hub for digital innovation and new economic growth. Similarly, Bitcoin, as a global currency, makes payments efficient for everyone involved in shipping because users avoid costly dollar exchanges or bank fees. Mizrachi sees Bitcoin not just as a payment method but as a powerful tool to grow Panama’s role in the world and keep the Panama Canal competitive in a digital economy where speed and technology matter more than ever. Critics warn Bitcoin could hurt Panama’s stability Critics warn that the canal could quickly face massive shortfalls in revenue if Bitcoin’s price crashes after payment is made because the coin’s value can rise or fall by thousands of dollars in a single day. They say canal tolls generate over a billion dollars each year to support key parts of Panama’s budget, and a short-term dip in value could throw off financial planning and force the government to scramble for backup funds. Bitcoin is also accepted in some countries and banned in a few nations, while other states still don’t know how to regulate it. Critics argue that Panama risks creating legal complications for shipping firms in certain countries and forcing them to choose between using the canal or staying compliant with their laws. Once enough countries face these choices, Panama could see a drop in canal traffic. Crypto payments depend on digital infrastructure that can be vulnerable to cyberattacks or human error, whereas high-value transactions involving giant cargo ships need secure systems to prevent fraud, theft, and hacking when dealing with high-value transactions. Critics warn that rushing into Bitcoin adoption could expose sensitive data or lose funds to malicious actors, and the consequences could ripple across the shipping industry. Finally, managing both traditional currency and Bitcoin systems in parallel calls for new technology, additional personnel training, more stringent internal controls, and clear policies for addressing mistakes or disputes. The Panama Canal is undergoing climate stress, water shortages, and competition among trade routes, so the flow of cryptocurrency could be a stretch for the system, and a few tiny mistakes could be very expensive. At the heart of the debate is one big question: can Panama afford to anchor its most valuable and reliable economic engine to the world’s most volatile and least regulated asset class? Critics argue that doing so could turn a stable source of revenue into a gamble and expose Panama to financial and political shocks it can’t control. The public and experts give mixed reactions Supporters in crypto communities quickly praised the idea as bold and forward-thinking because it shows that Panama is ready to lead rather than follow in the digital economy. They say it positions Panama ahead of countries still debating basic crypto regulation, and some even compare it to early internet policies that helped Estonia and Singapore become tech hubs. International headlines also highlight Panama’s potential to become the next global center for crypto innovation. Articles in blockchain news outlets and digital finance blogs portray Panama as a country willing to experiment while others hesitate during a time when many governments crack down on digital currencies rather than embrace them. However, Traditional financial institutions in Panama and abroad argue that allowing Bitcoin payments for canal tolls could increase money laundering (AML) risks because tracing crypto transactions can be complicated without strict oversight. They argue that the intersection of crypto and infrastructure payments would complicate cash flow management, auditing, and international payment system coordination and pose a greater threat to stability and security than innovation. The proposal has also triggered political controversy within Panama’s own government as several lawmakers and national officials accuse Mayor Mizrachi of overstepping his role. They argue that the mayor is pushing a risky financial agenda without proper input from economic advisors, central agencies, or national leaders. Some even accuse him of using the idea to build personal political clout rather than to serve the public interest. Panama faces big choice between innovation and risk Panama would be the first country to connect a major international trade route to cryptocurrency, leading ports, shipping companies, and governments to contemplate different uses for blockchain and digital assets in free-trade zones or bonded shipping hubs. However, the risks are just as real as the rewards because global watchdogs such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) or the International Monetary Fund (IMF) might raise concerns about transparency, compliance, or financial risk. Panama’s decision goes beyond Bitcoin and asks a bigger question: Can national governments integrate digital finance into their critical systems without breaking global trust? Can they modernize without introducing chaos? What happens in Panama could shape how other nations move forward, not just with Bitcoin but with the next generation of digital infrastructure in global trade.

However, a significant development has brought a wave of relief: FTX creditors are beginning to see funds returned, with some receiving distributions directly through the Kraken exchange . This marks a crucial step forward in the complex and often protracted crypto bankruptcy process. Understanding the FTX Repayment Process So Far The journey for FTX creditors has been anything but simple since the exchange filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. The sheer scale and complexity of the collapse, involving billions in lost customer funds and intricate legal battles, meant that recovery would be a long road. Initial steps involved securing remaining assets and navigating legal frameworks across multiple jurisdictions. While some smaller, initial distributions occurred earlier, the recent activity signals a more substantial phase of repayment. This second major round of payouts demonstrates tangible progress after months of legal proceedings and asset liquidation efforts by the FTX bankruptcy estate. What’s Happening with This Latest FTX Repayment Round? Recent reports confirm that FTX has initiated a significant distribution phase. According to information shared by Sunil Kavuri, a prominent activist representing FTX creditors , some individuals have successfully received funds directly deposited into their accounts on the Kraken exchange . Key details about this round include: Scale: Over $5 billion is reportedly being distributed in this phase. Form of Payment: Payouts are being made primarily in stablecoins, providing recipients with value that is less volatile than other cryptocurrencies. Eligibility: The distributions are targeted towards customers who held accounts on the FTX platform at the time of the November 2022 bankruptcy filing, as well as general unsecured creditors who had claims against the estate. Timing: Reports indicate this round began around May 30th, following earlier preparatory work by the estate. This distribution is a direct result of the extensive work undertaken by the bankruptcy administrators to recover assets, which has involved everything from selling off valuable crypto holdings to pursuing legal claims against related parties. Why Are Some FTX Creditors Receiving Funds Via Kraken Exchange? The mention of Kraken exchange as a distribution channel for some FTX creditors is particularly noteworthy. While the FTX estate manages the overall repayment process, utilizing established cryptocurrency exchanges like Kraken can offer several potential benefits: Infrastructure: Exchanges like Kraken possess the necessary infrastructure to handle large-scale cryptocurrency distributions securely and efficiently. KYC/AML Compliance: Existing users on Kraken have already completed Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks, potentially simplifying the identity verification process for receiving funds compared to setting up entirely new systems. User Familiarity: Many crypto users are already familiar with exchange interfaces, making it easier for them to access and manage their received funds. Reduced Complexity for Estate: Outsourcing the distribution mechanics for a segment of creditors to a third-party exchange can potentially reduce the administrative burden on the FTX estate. It’s important to note that not all FTX creditors may receive funds via Kraken. The method of distribution likely depends on various factors, including the creditor’s location, the nature of their claim, and potentially whether they already had an existing relationship with Kraken or were directed to set one up. The Role of Activist Creditors Like Sunil Kavuri The information about Kraken distributions was notably highlighted by Sunil Kavuri on social media platform X. Activist creditors play a significant role in large bankruptcy cases like this one. They often organize fellow creditors, share information, advocate for their interests with the bankruptcy estate and legal teams, and push for transparency and swifter resolution. Sunil Kavuri has been a vocal figure throughout the crypto bankruptcy proceedings, providing updates and insights from the perspective of those directly impacted. His sharing of the Kraken distribution detail underscores the importance of community information networks for FTX creditors navigating this complex situation. Challenges and the Road Ahead for FTX Recovery While this round of distributions is a positive sign, the overall FTX recovery process is far from over. Several challenges remain: Valuation Dates: A major point of contention has been the valuation date for crypto assets held on FTX. The estate’s proposal to value assets based on their price at the time of the bankruptcy filing (November 2022) means creditors receive a dollar amount based on those lower prices, rather than the significantly higher current market values for assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This has led to frustration among creditors. Remaining Assets: While billions have been recovered, the total amount owed is vast. The estate continues to work on recovering additional assets and resolving outstanding claims. Legal Battles: Ongoing legal disputes, including clawback actions against parties who withdrew funds shortly before the bankruptcy, continue to add complexity and potential delays. Administrative Costs: The bankruptcy process itself is incredibly expensive, with legal and administrative fees potentially reducing the final amount available for distribution to creditors. Despite these challenges, the successful distribution of over $5 billion represents substantial progress towards the full FTX recovery . The estate has indicated plans for further distributions as more assets are liquidated and legal issues are resolved. Actionable Insights for Affected FTX Creditors If you are an FTX creditor , what should you do now? Monitor Official Communications: Pay close attention to official communications from the FTX bankruptcy estate (via their designated claims agent, Kroll, or official court filings). This is the primary source of definitive information regarding your claim status and distribution method. Check Designated Accounts: If you received notification or believe you are eligible for this round, check the accounts specified by the estate. If Kraken is mentioned as a channel for your claim, log in to your Kraken account (or follow instructions provided by the estate if you need to set one up or verify details). Verify Claim Status: Ensure you understand the current status of your filed claim with the bankruptcy estate. Seek Clarification: If you have questions about your specific distribution or claim, contact the claims agent directly through their official channels. Be Wary of Scams: Unfortunately, bankruptcy situations attract scammers. Be extremely cautious of unsolicited messages or requests for personal information related to your FTX claim. Only trust information and instructions from official sources. Receiving funds through a platform like Kraken exchange can streamline the process for some, but confirming the legitimacy and details through official channels is paramount. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope in the Crypto Bankruptcy Saga The distribution of over $5 billion to FTX creditors , including payouts facilitated by the Kraken exchange , is a significant and positive milestone. It demonstrates that despite the immense challenges of the crypto bankruptcy , tangible progress is being made towards compensating those who lost funds. While the journey to full FTX recovery continues and complexities remain, particularly regarding asset valuation, this latest development offers a much-needed glimmer of hope and validates the long wait for many affected individuals and institutions.

45438446,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=165281,1748913610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/45438446.jpeg,Norwegian Block Exchange: Historic First Public Bitcoin Treasury in Norway,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/norwegian-block-bitcoin-treasury/,"BitcoinWorld Norwegian Block Exchange: Historic First Public Bitcoin Treasury in Norway In a significant development for the European cryptocurrency landscape, the Norwegian Block Exchange (NBX) has reportedly become the first publicly traded company in Norway to hold Bitcoin as a treasury asset. This move signals a growing trend among corporations to integrate digital assets into their balance sheets, positioning NBX as a pioneer in the region’s evolving financial sector. What Exactly is a Bitcoin Treasury Company? The term “Bitcoin treasury company” refers to a publicly or privately held corporation that holds a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet as a primary treasury reserve asset, alongside or instead of traditional assets like cash, gold, or short-term government bonds. Companies like MicroStrategy, Tesla, and Square (now Block) have famously adopted this strategy in recent years. The core idea behind this approach is often multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: Viewing Bitcoin as a potential hedge against the devaluation of fiat currencies due to inflation. Store of Value: Believing Bitcoin can serve as a digital store of value, similar to digital gold. Balance Sheet Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset to the corporate balance sheet to potentially enhance overall portfolio performance. Signaling and Innovation: Demonstrating forward-thinking adoption of new technologies and potentially attracting investors interested in the digital asset space. For a company like Norwegian Block Exchange , which operates in the crypto space, holding Bitcoin on its balance sheet could also be seen as a natural extension of its business model and a demonstration of confidence in the asset it facilitates trading for. Why is NBX’s Move Significant for Norway Crypto? NBX becoming the first publicly traded company in Norway to adopt a Bitcoin treasury strategy is a notable event for several reasons: Firstly, it sets a precedent. As the first, NBX navigates the initial steps regarding accounting, regulatory considerations, and public perception within the Norwegian context. This could potentially pave the way for other Norwegian companies to consider similar strategies in the future, accelerating institutional adoption within the country. Secondly, it highlights the increasing legitimacy of Bitcoin as a corporate asset class, even in traditionally cautious financial environments. Norway has a robust financial system, and a publicly listed entity making this move sends a strong signal to the market. Finally, for NBX itself, it aligns its corporate treasury strategy with the very asset class it serves. This could enhance its appeal to investors who are bullish on Bitcoin and the future of digital finance, potentially attracting capital and increasing shareholder value. What are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for a Public Company Holding Bitcoin? Adopting a public company Bitcoin treasury strategy comes with its own set of potential upsides and risks: Potential Benefits: Potential for Appreciation: If the price of Bitcoin increases, the value of the company’s treasury holdings rises, positively impacting the balance sheet. Attracting Investment: May attract investors specifically interested in exposure to Bitcoin or companies embracing digital assets. Inflation Protection: Offers a potential hedge against the erosion of purchasing power of fiat currency reserves. Industry Alignment: For a crypto company like NBX, it reinforces its commitment and belief in the digital asset ecosystem. Potential Challenges: Volatility Risk: Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile. Significant price drops can negatively impact the company’s balance sheet and earnings reports, potentially affecting stock price. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for corporate crypto holdings is still evolving in many jurisdictions, including Europe. Accounting Complexity: Accounting rules for digital assets can be complex and vary by region, often requiring impairment charges if the asset’s market value drops below its purchase price, even if the company hasn’t sold it. Security Risks: Holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss. Public Perception: While some view it positively, others may see it as a speculative or risky move, potentially alienating some investors. For Norwegian Block Exchange , managing these challenges effectively will be crucial to the success of their Bitcoin treasury strategy. How Does NBX Compare to Other Public Companies with Bitcoin Treasuries? While NBX is the first in Norway, it joins a growing list of public companies globally that hold Bitcoin. The most prominent example is MicroStrategy, which holds tens of thousands of Bitcoins and has made acquiring Bitcoin a central part of its corporate strategy. Other notable examples include Tesla, Block (formerly Square), and Marathon Digital Holdings. Compared to these giants, NBX’s holdings are likely to be smaller in scale initially. However, its significance lies not just in the quantity of Bitcoin held, but in being the first publicly listed company in Norway to take this step. This makes NBX a trailblazer in the Nordic region’s institutional adoption of Bitcoin. What Does This Mean for the Future of Institutional Bitcoin Adoption? The decision by Norwegian Block Exchange reflects a broader global trend where institutions are increasingly exploring and adopting Bitcoin. This move in Norway adds another data point supporting the narrative of Bitcoin maturing as an asset class beyond individual investors. While challenges remain, including regulatory clarity and price volatility, each instance of a publicly traded company adding Bitcoin to its treasury contributes to normalizing digital asset ownership within traditional finance. This could potentially lead to increased liquidity, stability, and further innovation in the market. In Conclusion: A Landmark Moment for Norway’s Crypto Scene The news that Norwegian Block Exchange has become the first publicly traded Bitcoin treasury company in Norway is a landmark moment. It underscores the increasing acceptance of Bitcoin among established entities and positions Norway as a participant in the global trend of corporate digital asset adoption. While challenges exist, NBX’s pioneering step could influence other companies in the region and marks a significant milestone in the integration of cryptocurrency into traditional financial strategies.

NewGenIvf Group Limited (NASDAQ: NIVF) has just dropped news of a substantial $30 million strategic investment aimed squarely at Solana staking . This isn’t NewGen’s first rodeo in digital assets, but it’s a major step up, signaling a growing appetite for yield-generating opportunities within the blockchain ecosystem. What’s Behind NewGen’s Bold Solana Staking Play? NewGen’s announcement marks a significant commitment to the Solana network. The company plans to allocate a substantial $30 million towards staking the SOL token. Staking is a process where participants lock up their cryptocurrency to support the operations and security of a proof-of-stake blockchain network, like Solana. In return, they earn rewards, similar to earning interest in a traditional savings account, but often with potentially higher yields. This isn’t a small, speculative punt. The investment is being funded through credit facilities secured with ATW and White Lion, indicating a structured financial approach to entering the Solana staking market. It builds upon NewGen’s earlier, more modest $1 million foray into Bitcoin last year, demonstrating an escalating interest and confidence in digital assets. According to reports, the core driver behind this move is NewGen’s stated belief in the long-term growth trajectory of blockchain-based assets. This perspective is increasingly common among corporations and investment firms looking to diversify holdings and tap into emerging digital economies. Why Are Companies Making Institutional Crypto Investments? The trend of companies like NewGen making significant moves in the crypto space highlights the increasing legitimacy and potential seen in this asset class. What drives this shift towards institutional crypto ? Diversification: Cryptocurrencies can offer returns that are uncorrelated with traditional assets, providing a way to diversify portfolios. Potential for High Returns: While volatile, cryptocurrencies have shown the potential for significant growth, attracting investors seeking higher yields than traditional markets offer. Technological Belief: Many institutions recognize the transformative potential of blockchain technology across various industries, viewing investment in key assets as a way to gain exposure to this future growth. Inflation Hedge Narrative: For some assets like Bitcoin, the narrative of being a potential hedge against inflation appeals to investors concerned about the devaluation of fiat currencies. Yield Opportunities: Activities like staking, as NewGen is pursuing with Solana, offer ways to earn passive income on digital asset holdings. NewGen’s move is a clear example of this growing institutional crypto adoption, moving beyond just holding assets to actively participating in network mechanics like staking for yield. What Does This NewGen Investment Signal? The size and nature of this NewGen investment send several signals to the market: Confidence in Solana: A $30 million allocation is a strong vote of confidence in the Solana network’s technology, security, and future potential. It suggests NewGen sees Solana as a robust platform capable of supporting significant staked capital. Strategic Shift: Moving from a $1 million Bitcoin purchase to a $30 million Solana staking strategy indicates a shift towards exploring yield-generating opportunities within crypto, not just holding assets. Funding Mechanism: Utilizing credit facilities for the investment shows a level of financial engineering and strategic planning, treating the crypto allocation as a significant business decision rather than a simple treasury allocation. Broader Trend Confirmation: This investment reinforces the narrative that institutional interest in crypto is broadening beyond just Bitcoin to include other major altcoins and specific strategies like staking. This specific NewGen investment could potentially encourage other mid-sized firms to explore similar strategies, especially those looking for ways to generate yield from digital assets. Exploring the World of Crypto Investment and Staking NewGen’s move shines a spotlight on crypto investment strategies beyond simple buying and holding. Staking on proof-of-stake networks like Solana is one of the primary ways investors can earn rewards. How Solana Staking Works (Simply): Holders of SOL tokens can ‘delegate’ their tokens to validators who run the network. Validators process transactions and secure the network. In return for their service and the delegated stake, validators and stakers earn rewards (more SOL). The staked tokens remain in the staker’s wallet (though locked and unable to be spent or moved during the staking period), and the staker retains control. While staking offers potential yield, it’s important to understand the associated risks, such as potential price volatility of the underlying asset (Solana), ‘slashing’ penalties if the chosen validator misbehaves, and the lock-up period during which assets cannot be accessed. NewGen, by choosing staking, is actively participating in the network’s security and consensus mechanism, aligning their investment with the health and performance of the Solana blockchain itself. The Growing Appeal of Blockchain Investment Ultimately, NewGen’s decision is rooted in a belief in the long-term potential of blockchain investment . Beyond cryptocurrencies as speculative assets, blockchain technology is seen as foundational for future innovations in finance, supply chain, digital identity, and more. Companies investing in crypto assets, whether through direct purchases, staking, or other decentralized finance (DeFi) activities, are essentially making a bet on the continued development and adoption of this technology. The infrastructure being built on blockchains like Solana is enabling new types of applications and economies, which forward-thinking investors aim to be part of. This strategic move by NewGen underscores that blockchain investment is moving from the fringes to become a more mainstream consideration for corporate treasuries and investment portfolios, driven by the potential for both capital appreciation and yield generation. What Does This Mean for You? While a $30 million institutional investment is on a different scale than individual participation, it highlights key trends: Staking is Gaining Traction: Institutional interest validates staking as a viable yield strategy. Solana’s Profile Rises: Large investments boost confidence in the network. Research is Key: Whether you’re an institution or an individual, understanding the technology, risks, and potential rewards is crucial before making any crypto investment . NewGen’s significant commitment to Solana staking serves as a powerful indicator of the evolving landscape of corporate finance and investment, where digital assets and blockchain technology are increasingly playing a central role. In Summary: A Major Institutional Staking Play NewGenIvf Group Limited’s announcement of a $30 million strategic investment in Solana staking is a noteworthy development. Funded through credit facilities, this move significantly expands on their previous crypto exposure and signals a strong belief in the long-term growth potential of blockchain assets. It highlights the increasing trend of institutional crypto adoption, with companies exploring yield-generating strategies like staking. This substantial NewGen investment reinforces confidence in the Solana network and the broader prospects of blockchain investment , illustrating how traditional firms are finding innovative ways to engage with the digital asset space.

This highlights the tech companies trimming costs even as they invest dollars into artificial intelligence. A notice in Washington state revealed that more than 300 workers were informed yesterday that their positions had been eliminated. Tech companies layoff workers amid significant investments in AI The rise of AI has upended the tech job market, with companies doubling down on AI-related roles and deploying the technology to save money. Microsoft and other firms, such as Meta Platforms Inc., have pointed to AI-backed coding tools as a way to accelerate software development . Last week, Salesforce Inc. said using AI internally has allowed them to require fewer employees. Microsoft’s latest layoffs hit software engineers the hardest. This came after the job cuts that Microsoft Corp. announced on May 13 hit the people who built the company’s products. This was a sign that even software developers were at risk in the era of AI. In the tech firm’s home state of Washington, software engineering was the biggest single job category to be issued with layoff notices, accounting for more than 40% of the roughly 2,000 positions cut. Microsoft executives stated the reason behind the cuts. They said they wanted to limit spending due to large investments in the center’s construction. Tech firms prioritize hiring in strategic areas such as AI Aside from software engineers, many of those hardest hit at Microsoft were software project managers. Across the company, product management and technical program management roles accounted for almost 600 of the cuts in Washington, nearly 30% of the total. The job cuts also included some managers and employees working on AI projects, according to a source familiar with the situation. Reliable sources suggest that few customer-facing jobs, such as sales and marketing, were the most affected. Microsoft did not respond to requests for comment. Microsoft stated that the layoffs aimed to reduce layers of management. However, it remains unclear how much this restructuring was actually happening. Around 17% of the employees laid off in Washington were considered managers. At the end of 2023, the company had roughly the same percentage of managers across its workforce, based on a report submitted to the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. In addition to Microsoft, Salesforce Inc. planned to eliminate more than 1,000 jobs even though it hired AI-focused sales positions, including sales this year. CEO Marc Benioff said that the company also claimed to hire fewer engineers in 2025 due to using AI. Additionally, when Workday Inc. laid off staff in February, Chief Executive Officer Carl Eschenbach said hiring would continue in strategic areas such as AI. Contrary to the cut and hiring on strategic areas trend, for software engineers, AI tools that can write or analyze code are now taking over parts of software development that engineers used to do by typing on keyboards. In April, Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella mentioned that AI is responsible for writing up to 30% of the code in some projects.

Financial Analyst Reveals How It Stands Up To FPPE And TON,https://timestabloid.com/is-hyperliquid-still-the-top-pick-financial-analyst-reveals/,"Hyperliquid (HYPE) has held its ground among rising crypto picks, but fresh comparisons reveal it may not be the top contender anymore. With financial analysts now weighing its growth potential against FloppyPepe (FPPE) and Toncoin (TON), the spotlight is quickly shifting. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is quickly rising to the top of investor watchlists, and the hype is building for a good reason. Its presale just entered Stage 2 at only $0.00000035 , backed by a limited-time 80% bonus using code “ FLOPPY80 .” The momentum mirrors its early run, which sold out ahead of schedule, and with this stage moving even faster, savvy investors aren’t waiting around. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Surges Past Rivals, Emerging As Financial Analysts’ New Top Pick A growing number of financial analysts are rethinking their top crypto picks, with FloppyPepe (FPPE) now entering the spotlight, leaving Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Toncoin (TON) behind. It’s quickly proving to be the hidden top pick, gaining serious traction as early performance metrics unfold at lightning speed. Just entering its second stage, FloppyPepe (FPPE) has already raised nearly $250,000, following a Stage 1 sellout that brought in over $2 million ahead of schedule. Priced at $0.00000035 with an ongoing 80% bonus using code FLOPPY80 , this meme-driven gem is quickly separating itself from the pack. FloppyAI Gives Investors A Winning Edge As Financial Analysts Back Its Real-Time Market Power Its built-in AI engine, FloppyAI, is designed to analyze and respond to market trends in real-time, spotting shifts faster than the average trader. FloppyAI also scans community sentiment , wallet activity, and volume spikes to help users identify breakout zones early. Financial analysts say this kind of adaptive AI gives retail investors a serious edge, especially in fast-paced markets where timing is everything. These Financial analysts also point to FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) surging demand, an audited smart contract by SolidProof, and an income-generating staking model as clear signs it could outpace its rivals. Hyperliquid (HYPE) Drops Over 10%: Analysts Question Its Rank As Rivals Gains Ground Crypto influencer Altcoin Sherpa recently took to X (formerly Twitter), noting that anything under $30 for Hyperliquid (HYPE) is “a gift,” with his eyes firmly set on that range. Yet, according to CoinGecko, Hyperliquid (HYPE) has dropped over 10% in the last week, falling from $42 to about $32.87, a decline that’s stirring debate among analysts. Crypto analysts are now questioning whether Hyperliquid (HYPE) still holds up as a top altcoin pick. Financial analysts, meanwhile, say a new rival, FloppyPepe (FPPE), is rising fast, gaining serious attention as Hyperliquid (HYPE) loses pace in the market. Toncoin Under Scrutiny As Analysts Weigh Its Steep Decline And Recovery Potential Financial analysts are closely watching Toncoin (TON) as it faces growing pressure from rising presale star FloppyPepe (FPPE). Toncoin (TON) is priced at $3.25, far higher than the presale token’s $0.00000035 entry point. The Toncoin (TON) token has seen a 50% drop over the past year and a further 10% dip in the last 24 hours, raising concerns about its staying power. Crypto expert Captain Faibik, who boasts over 104K followers on X, recently tweeted that a “major trendline breakout” is now confirmed for Toncoin (TON). He added that the token is “looking promising” for a potential +60% bullish rally in June as market watchers weigh whether it can keep up with its rivals’ accelerating momentum. Why Financial Analysts Are Betting On FloppyPepe (FPPE) As The Next Big Meme Coin Tied to the Matt Furie token family, FloppyPepe (FPPE) carries a unique link to meme culture’s roots, but it’s not living in Pepe the Frog’s shadow. A financial analyst notes that it is carving its path with real utility and AI-driven tools, backed by a deflationary burn system designed to protect long-term value in volatile markets. Now entering its second presale stage, savvy investors are moving quickly to secure tokens at an ultra-low $0.00000035 , with a limited 80% bonus using code “ FLOPPY80” . Several financial analysts see this as the last opportunity before this meme coin’s breakout surge, making it a leading option that stands firm against Hyperliquid (HYPE) and Toncoin (TON).

Consensys, a leading force in Ethereum infrastructure, has just made a strategic move set to significantly impact how millions access decentralized applications (dApps) and digital assets. The company has acquired Web3Auth, a prominent provider of wallet infrastructure. This Consensys Web3Auth acquisition is specifically aimed at enhancing the user experience for MetaMask, the world’s most popular non-custodial crypto wallet. While the financial details of the deal weren’t disclosed, the potential implications for mainstream crypto adoption are immense. What Does the Consensys Web3Auth Acquisition Mean for Users? At its core, this acquisition is about making Web3 more accessible. MetaMask, despite its widespread use, still presents hurdles for newcomers. The need to securely store and manage a seed phrase is a significant barrier for many who are used to the simple login experiences of Web2 applications. Web3Auth specializes in providing intuitive, non-custodial authentication solutions, often leveraging familiar methods like social logins (Google, Facebook, etc.) or email, while still maintaining the user’s control over their private keys through advanced techniques like Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Integrating Web3Auth’s technology into MetaMask aims to simplify the initial setup process dramatically. Imagine being able to create a MetaMask wallet and access Web3 services without immediately being confronted with the daunting task of writing down and securing a 12 or 24-word seed phrase. This seamless entry point is crucial for attracting users beyond the crypto-native crowd. Why is MetaMask Onboarding So Crucial for Web3 Growth? MetaMask isn’t just a wallet; it’s often the primary gateway for users to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the broader Web3 space. It connects users to decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, DeFi protocols, and countless other dApps. However, the complexity of getting started is frequently cited as a major roadblock preventing wider adoption. The traditional MetaMask onboarding flow requires users to understand concepts like seed phrases, gas fees, and network selection right from the start. This steep learning curve can intimidate potential users and lead to errors, including lost funds due to mishandled seed phrases. By simplifying this initial step, Consensys can unlock a massive new wave of users who are interested in Web3’s potential but are put off by the technical hurdles. Here are some key benefits expected from integrating Web3Auth into MetaMask: Simplified Account Creation: Users may be able to create a wallet using social accounts or email, abstracting away the seed phrase for initial access (while still offering advanced options). Reduced Barrier to Entry: Lowering the technical complexity makes Web3 accessible to a much wider audience. Enhanced Security Options: Web3Auth’s MPC technology can distribute key management, potentially offering alternative security models beyond single-point-of-failure seed phrases. Improved User Experience: A smoother start leads to greater user retention and engagement with dApps. How Does Web3Auth Enhance the Web3 Wallet Experience? Web3Auth’s technology focuses on user-friendly key management. Instead of a single seed phrase, it often uses techniques like threshold cryptography or MPC to split a user’s private key into multiple shares. These shares can be managed in different locations – for example, one share secured by the user’s device, another by their social login provider, and perhaps a third by Web3Auth itself (though implementations vary). To reconstruct the key and sign transactions, a threshold number of shares are required. This means losing one share doesn’t necessarily mean losing access to the wallet, and it eliminates the single, easily compromisable seed phrase. This approach allows users to recover their wallets using familiar methods like two-factor authentication or device recovery, rather than needing the physical seed phrase written down. For a Web3 wallet aiming for mass adoption, this shift from crypto-native security concepts to more traditional, albeit decentralized, recovery methods is revolutionary. What’s Next for Ethereum News and Crypto Adoption? This acquisition is a strong signal that the focus in the Web3 space is increasingly shifting towards user experience and mass adoption. As infrastructure providers like Consensys invest in simplifying access, the path for new users to explore the vast potential of the Ethereum ecosystem becomes much clearer. We can expect future Ethereum news to highlight continued efforts to abstract away complexity, not just in wallets but across dApps as well. The goal is to reach a point where interacting with a dApp is as simple as using a traditional mobile app, without needing deep technical knowledge of the underlying blockchain. The Consensys Web3Auth acquisition is a significant step on this journey, potentially unlocking the next phase of growth for Web3 by making it genuinely user-friendly for everyone. In Conclusion: A Step Towards Seamless Web3 Consensys acquiring Web3Auth is more than just a business deal; it’s a strategic investment in the future of Web3 accessibility. By integrating Web3Auth’s innovative key management and onboarding solutions into MetaMask, Consensys is directly addressing one of the biggest barriers to entry for new users – the complexity of wallet setup and seed phrase management. This move promises to make MetaMask onboarding smoother, enhance the overall Web3 wallet experience, and accelerate crypto adoption by making the Ethereum ecosystem welcoming to millions more users.

The transaction , which was unveiled in June 2024, was finalized on May 2, 2025, and was 100% cash-financed . Bitstamp, headquartered in Luxembourg, has a significant international footprint and a sturdy client base. This purchase will be a major move in Robinhood’s ambition to expand its exposure in the worldwide crypto market. Bitstamp has a history of catering to institutional clients. It now serves over 5,000 institutional clients and some 50,000 retail customers. And it gets a lot of trading from its institutional base, a category Robinhood didn’t have until now. Through its acquisition of Bitstamp, Robinhood will soon have access to a reliable platform with more than a decade of experience, significant liquidity, and a proven security and compliance track record. Robinhood Crypto general manager Johann Kerbrat said the acquisition would enable the company to scale faster and expand its crypto offerings to more people in the US and globally. He told CNBC that Robinhood is not ruling out additional crypto acquisitions if they can help accelerate the company’s growth, adding that any opportunity to advance by 18 months or two years would be considered. The purchase also includes over 50 operational licenses and licenses-to-be in Europe, the UK, Asia, and the US, enabling Robinhood to do business in many new markets legally. Robinhood pushes into global markets Robinhood’s crypto business is largely limited in the United States. But Bitstamp is available in Luxembourg, the UK, Slovenia, Singapore, and the US. And just like that, Robinhood gets an immediate foothold across Europe and Asia . Robinhood said that it has already started to incorporate Bitstamp’s platform. It’s now connected to Robinhood Legend and its Smart Exchange Routing trading system for enhanced trade execution. Bitstamp reportedly made $95 million in revenue for the 12 months ending April 30, 2025. And that’s just in the first quarter of 2025: Robinhood’s crypto business raked in $252 million. Robinhood expects to spend an additional $65 million on Bitstamp-related expenses through the remainder of 2025, such as technology integration, marketing, and operations. Robinhood outlines future strategy and responds to market The Bitstamp deal isn’t Robinhood’s only move. On May 13, 2025, the company also said it would buy Canadian crypto platform WonderFi for $179 million to become a dominant player in the Canadian market. These acquisitions are part of a larger strategy to become a global crypto powerhouse — serving individual users and professional and institutional traders. Robinhood is also looking at the future of tokenization, where real-world assets can be tokenized into tradeable digital tokens. CEO Vladimir Tenev once called tokenization a “massive unlock” that could enable people to invest in assets like shares of private companies — so long as they’re giants like OpenAI or SpaceX — in minutes. He thinks this innovation could solve several of the biggest problems in secondary markets, particularly concerning private equity. On the market side, investors were reacting favorably to the Bitstamp news. Robinhood stock (HOOD) gained 2.77% to settle at $67.98 on Wednesday and added another 0.44% in the after-hours session.

The poll, conducted online, asked crypto users to guess which digital currency was most used for topping up Zypto VISA Cards over the past week. The final results left many stunned, with Pi Network taking the top spot, followed closely by DASH. The newcomer USD1 secured third place, while XRP surprisingly finished last. So, your guess for which of these cryptocurrencies were used most over the last 7 days was: 1st: $Pi 2nd: $USD1 3rd: $XRP 4th: $DASH Well, you got 1 out of 4 right! $Pi was indeed the most used of the 4, but $DASH was VERY close in 2nd place. Other weeks it's actually been… https://t.co/HCiTpOaOSz — Zypto App (@ZyptoApp) June 1, 2025 Poll organizers later revealed that DASH, which came very close to beating Pi Network this week, has actually topped the list in other weeks. This time, however, Pi managed to claim the number one position, while XRP recorded lower-than-usual activity for card top-ups, marking a noticeable dip in its usage within the Zypto community. Pi Network Price Plunges Amid Market Sell-Off Interestingly, this positive usage milestone for Pi Network comes at a time when its market performance is struggling. As of May 31, 2025, the Pi token’s price has plummeted by 22% in just one week, falling to $0.65. This sharp decline happened alongside a massive market-wide sell-off, where the global cryptocurrency market saw over $170 billion wiped from its total value within days. The ongoing sell-off has triggered concerns about Pi Network’s future prospects. Several factors have contributed to this steep drop in price, including the absence of major updates or positive developments from the project’s team, and the fact that Pi Network still hasn’t secured listings on major crypto exchanges. This has kept liquidity low and discouraged institutional investors from getting involved. What’s Next For Pi Network Price? Analysts warn that if the selling pressure continues, Pi’s price could fall below its current support level of $0.55 and potentially touch a historic low of $0.40. While a strong buying response might push the price back up to $0.86, such a rebound appears unlikely unless the ongoing downtrend reverses. Despite its price slump, Pi Network’s strong performance in real-world use cases like Zypto VISA Card transactions shows that the project still holds appeal among everyday users. However, the widening gap between its growing utility and falling token price raises tough questions about the long-term trust and confidence investors place in the project.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DASH|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-03 01:44:46

A significant announcement has recently come from Morph , the ambitious Ethereum Layer-2 solution backed by major crypto platform Bitget . The project has revealed a key Crypto Leadership Change at the very top. Morph’s Strategic Leadership Shift: What It Means The core of the recent news centers on the transition of leadership at Morph . Cecilia Hsueh, who served as the project’s CEO, has stepped down from her role. Taking the helm is Colin Goltra, who previously held the position of Chief Growth Officer (CGO) at Morph. This internal promotion suggests a potential emphasis on growth and expansion as the project moves forward. Goltra’s background in driving growth initiatives could be a strong indicator of Morph’s strategic focus under his leadership. As a relatively new Blockchain Project , having launched its mainnet in October 2024, establishing and scaling its user base and ecosystem is paramount. Key facts about the leadership change: Former CEO: Cecilia Hsueh New CEO: Colin Goltra Goltra’s Previous Role: Chief Growth Officer (CGO) Project Context: Morph , an Ethereum Layer-2 Backing: Supported by Bitget Mainnet Launch: October 2024 Navigating the Competitive Ethereum Layer-2 Landscape Understanding Morph ‘s position requires a look at the broader Ethereum Layer-2 ecosystem. Layer-2 solutions are crucial for scaling Ethereum, aiming to provide faster transactions and lower fees than the mainnet (Layer-1) while inheriting its security. This space is highly competitive, with numerous projects utilizing various technologies like rollups (optimistic and zero-knowledge) to achieve scalability. Morph aims to carve out its niche within this landscape. The leadership change occurs at a critical juncture, shortly after the mainnet launch, where the focus shifts from development to adoption and network effect. A CEO with a strong growth background like Goltra might be seen as a strategic choice to accelerate user acquisition and developer engagement on the platform. The success of any Ethereum Layer-2 depends heavily on: Technological robustness and security Developer tooling and ease of building User experience and accessibility Ecosystem development (dApps, wallets, infrastructure) Market positioning and adoption strategy Goltra’s transition from CGO to CEO could signify that Morph is prioritizing the last point – aggressive market positioning and driving adoption – as key levers for success in the crowded L2 space.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin BTC is trading around $106,402.39 as Asia begins its trading day, up roughly 0.9%, recovering slightly from a weekend decline attributed to significant outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs and increased geopolitical uncertainty. The largest digital asset by market cap had previously dropped 2% from $105,987 to $103,748 amid notable trading volume spikes, influenced by $616 million in ETF outflows, marking the end of BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust's 31-day inflow streak, and heightened tensions from stalled U.S.-China trade talks. Analysts are increasingly watching BTC's unconventional correlation with Japan's 30-year government bond yields , as highlighted by macro strategist Weston Nakamura. Nakamura suggests that this alignment, stronger recently than traditional connections with U.S. equities, implies a deeper global macro shift in financial markets, indicating Japan’s growing influence over cross-asset dynamics. As investors navigate these complex macroeconomic factors, bitcoin continues to test crucial support levels near $104,300, reflecting both caution and ongoing market volatility. Crypto Must Prepare for Quantum Threat 'Linearly', Not Reactively: Analyst Crypto could face catastrophe if it continues to overlook quantum computing's advancing threat, warns Rick Maeda of Presto Research, who recently published a report on quantum risks, which argued that the industry was unprepared. A key barrier, he said in an interview with CoinDesk, is an economic incentive issue, as investors remain reluctant to fund quantum-resistant technology because he argued that “it’s difficult to create a way to monetize this.” ""Crypto is underprepared,"" he said. ""The biggest risk is just waiting too long."" Maeda argues that blockchains dependent on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) urgently need systematic preparation to withstand future quantum attacks. ""Preparation has to come almost linearly, because we can't wait until the threat is real to start taking it seriously,"" he told CoinDesk in an interview. ""By then, it's already too late."" Yet Maeda offers several caveats to balance fears about quantum computing’s immediate capabilities. He argues that current quantum systems operate at only around 10 logical qubits with high error rates , significantly below the thousands needed to compromise ECC. Additionally, recent quantum advancements, such as Google's processor developments, come with trade-offs in efficiency versus accuracy. While immediate panic isn't necessary, Maeda emphasizes the urgency of incremental, sustained efforts to bolster cryptocurrency's defenses before quantum threats become a reality. News Roundup Meta Shareholders Reject Bitcoin Treasury Proposal in Landslide Vote Meta shareholders overwhelmingly rejected a proposal to shift some of the company's $72 billion cash reserves into bitcoin, with only 0.08% of nearly 5 billion votes cast supporting the initiative, CoinDesk previously reported . Proposed by Ethan Peck of wealth management firm Strive and backed by the conservative National Center for Public Policy Research, the measure aimed to hedge inflation risks by using bitcoin as a strategic treasury asset. Meta has previously ventured into crypto projects, notably the Libra stablecoin effort in 2019, which later collapsed amid regulatory pressures. Despite recent pullbacks from ambitious metaverse projects, the company continues exploring stablecoin-based payments across its platforms. Meta shares rose 3.5% on Monday, trading at $670.09 each. Crypto Lobbyists Urge US Senate to Focus on Stablecoin Bill Crypto industry lobbyists are urging U.S. senators to stay focused as the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating stablecoin issuers, faces potential distraction from unrelated amendments during its final Senate debate, CoinDesk previously reported. Advocacy groups like the Blockchain Association and Crypto Council for Innovation emphasized the need to maintain the bill's narrow goal, especially as senators behind the Credit Card Competition Act try to attach their unrelated legislation as an amendment. The GENIUS Act, which targets the regulation of stablecoins such as Tether's USDT and Circle's USDC, has already garnered bipartisan support in the Senate Banking Committee. Despite complications from unrelated legislative additions, analysts from Capital Alpha Partners give the stablecoin bill a 60-65% chance of becoming law this year, noting that success in the Senate would mark a significant milestone, though the House of Representatives would also need to approve the legislation. Market Movements: BTC: Bitcoin rose 0.9% to $106,402.39, rebounding slightly after ETF outflows and geopolitical tensions triggered a weekend drop, as analysts highlighted its growing correlation with Japanese long-end bond yields. ETH: Ethereum gained 3% to $2,539.04 after staging a V-shaped recovery from intraday lows, supported by strong institutional inflows and resilient buying around the key $2,500 level. Gold: Gold surged over 2% to $3,371.40 on Monday, hitting a three-week high as the U.S. dollar weakened 0.27%, boosting safe-haven demand amid geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. Nikkei 225: Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.36% Tuesday morning, as Asia-Pacific markets advanced following overnight Wall Street gains despite a resurgence in global trade tensions. S&P 500: U.S. stocks rose Monday, with the S&P 500 gaining 0.4%, as investors brushed aside escalating trade tensions with China and the EU.

Recently, Chicago Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) President Austan Goolsbee offered a glimpse into his thinking on the future path of U.S. interest rates , a topic of intense interest for investors, businesses, and everyday consumers alike. His comments, initially reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, suggest a potential shift on the horizon, one that might arrive sooner than some anticipate, even as clouds of tariff uncertainty linger. What Did Goolsbee Say About Interest Rates? According to the report, President Goolsbee expressed a view that interest rates could potentially begin to decrease within the next 12 to 18 months. This is a significant timeframe for market participants trying to gauge the direction of monetary policy. After a period of aggressive rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to combat inflation, the focus has firmly shifted to when and how quickly those rates might come back down. For context, higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can slow down economic activity by reducing spending and investment. Conversely, lower rates stimulate the economy. Goolsbee’s projection offers a potential timeline for this pivot, suggesting that within roughly one to one-and-a-half years, the economic conditions might warrant a less restrictive stance from the central bank. Understanding the Federal Reserve’s Role The Federal Reserve , often referred to simply as ‘the Fed’, is the central banking system of the United States. Its primary mandates from Congress are to promote maximum employment, stable prices (control inflation), and moderate long-term interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which includes the Board of Governors and five Reserve Bank presidents (including the New York Fed president permanently and others on a rotating basis), is responsible for setting monetary policy, primarily by adjusting the target range for the federal funds rate. When the Fed raises the federal funds rate, it influences other interest rates throughout the economy, from mortgages and car loans to corporate bonds. When it lowers the rate, the opposite happens. Goolsbee, as a voting member of the FOMC on a rotating basis or simply a key voice in the discussion, provides valuable insight into the diverse perspectives within the committee regarding the appropriate path for monetary policy . Navigating the Waters of Tariff Uncertainty One of the most intriguing aspects of Goolsbee’s comment is that he believes rate cuts are possible despite ongoing tariff uncertainty . Tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods. They can be used for various reasons, such as protecting domestic industries or as a tool in trade negotiations. However, they can also complicate the economic outlook . How does tariff uncertainty factor into the economic picture? Here are a few ways: Increased Costs: Tariffs directly increase the cost of imported goods for businesses and consumers, potentially contributing to inflation or reducing purchasing power. Supply Chain Disruptions: Uncertainty about future tariffs can make businesses hesitant to make long-term sourcing or investment decisions, potentially disrupting supply chains. Reduced Trade: Tariffs can lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries, reducing export markets for domestic businesses. Business Investment Hesitation: Companies facing unpredictable trade costs may delay expansion or investment plans, impacting economic growth. Typically, increased costs from tariffs could be seen as inflationary, potentially arguing against rate cuts. Reduced trade and investment could slow growth, potentially arguing for rate cuts. The ‘uncertainty’ itself adds another layer of complexity, making it harder for businesses and the Fed to forecast economic conditions accurately. Goolsbee’s view suggests that while tariff uncertainty is a factor, he may see other economic forces as more dominant in determining the appropriate path for interest rates over the next 12-18 months. This could imply that he believes inflationary pressures will continue to ease, or that other aspects of the economic outlook , such as labor market conditions or domestic demand, will evolve in a way that supports lower rates. Goolsbee’s Economic Outlook: What Factors Might He Be Weighing? While the brief report doesn’t detail Goolsbee’s full reasoning, his economic outlook likely considers a range of data points that the Federal Reserve closely monitors. These typically include: Inflation Data: Primarily the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. A sustained move towards the Fed’s 2% target is crucial. Labor Market Indicators: Unemployment rate, job growth numbers, wage growth. A strong but not overheating labor market is key. GDP Growth: Measures of overall economic activity. The Fed aims for sustainable growth. Consumer Spending and Business Investment: Gauges of demand in the economy. Global Economic Conditions: Events outside the U.S. can impact the domestic economy. Goolsbee’s projection suggests he might be seeing a path where inflation continues to moderate towards the target without a significant rise in unemployment, often referred to as a “soft landing.” This scenario would provide the Federal Reserve with the flexibility to begin easing monetary policy . Monetary Policy and the Balancing Act The Federal Reserve ‘s monetary policy is a complex balancing act. They must weigh the risks of keeping rates too high for too long (potentially causing an unnecessary recession) against the risks of cutting rates too soon (potentially allowing inflation to reaccelerate). Factors like tariff uncertainty add to this complexity, as their economic impact can be difficult to predict and can affect both inflation and growth. Goolsbee’s comments highlight that while external factors like trade policy are part of the equation, the Fed’s decisions on interest rates are primarily driven by its core mandates related to domestic price stability and employment. His view implies that, within his forecast horizon, the trajectory of inflation and the labor market will likely be the dominant forces guiding the FOMC’s hand, potentially overriding the uncertainty introduced by tariffs. Challenges and What Could Change the Outlook While Goolsbee’s view offers a potential timeline for rate cuts, it’s crucial to remember that economic forecasts are subject to change. Several factors could alter this economic outlook : Inflation Rebound: Unexpectedly persistent or rising inflation could force the Fed to keep rates higher for longer. Worsening Tariff Disputes: A significant escalation in trade conflicts could have a more severe negative impact on the economy than currently anticipated. Unexpected Economic Shocks: Geopolitical events, financial market instability, or other unforeseen circumstances could derail the current trajectory. Changes in Fed Consensus: Goolsbee’s view is one perspective; other Fed officials may have different timelines or conditions for considering rate cuts. Therefore, while the 12-18 month window provides a hopeful target, the actual path of monetary policy will depend heavily on incoming economic data and how the FOMC collectively interprets it. Actionable Insights for the Reader What does this mean for you, especially if you’re following the markets, including cryptocurrencies? Stay Informed on Fed Speak: Pay attention to speeches and statements from Fed officials, particularly FOMC members. These provide clues about their thinking. Monitor Key Economic Data: Keep an eye on major inflation reports (CPI, PCE), jobs reports, and GDP data. These are the primary drivers of Fed decisions on interest rates . Understand Market Reactions: Financial markets, including crypto, often react significantly to changes in the expected path of monetary policy . Lower expected interest rates are generally seen as positive for risk assets. Diversify and Plan Long-Term: Economic forecasts can change. Maintain a diversified investment approach and focus on your long-term financial goals rather than trying to time market movements based on short-term predictions. Conclusion: A Glimmer of Hope Amidst Uncertainty Chicago Fed President Goolsbee’s recent comments offer a notable perspective: that despite the ongoing challenges posed by tariff uncertainty , the path towards lower interest rates within the next 12 to 18 months remains a plausible outcome in his economic outlook . This view suggests confidence that other economic forces, likely related to the disinflationary trend and the state of the labor market, may create room for the Federal Reserve to ease its restrictive monetary policy stance. While not a guarantee, Goolsbee’s timeline provides a glimmer of hope for those anticipating a shift from the current high-rate environment. However, the path forward is not without its potential pitfalls, and the Fed’s decisions will ultimately be data-dependent. Keeping a close watch on economic indicators and statements from the Federal Reserve will be crucial for understanding how this complex picture evolves.

Qubetics Is the Popular Crypto Coin To Buy With Groundbreaking Potential,https://thecoinrise.com/missed-moneros-peak-qubetics-is-the-popular-crypto-coin-to-buy-with-groundbreaking-potential/,"As the cryptocurrency market continues to make waves, the hunt for the next big digital asset is more intense than ever. With Bitcoin recently reaching all-time highs and setting the stage for an exciting year ahead. While Monero once dominated the privacy coin space, it has since faced stagnation, leaving room for fresh contenders to rise. Among them, Qubetics has caught the attention of crypto enthusiasts and analysts alike, drawing attention for its innovative blend of decentralized VPN technology and blockchain solutions. As the Qubetics presale advances, excitement builds, with early investors looking to take advantage of its incredible ROI potential.

Potential Bearish Pattern Forming There’s also a risk of a head and shoulders pattern forming, a classic bearish signal that could push the price lower if it completes. For now, this pattern hasn’t been confirmed yet — but traders should watch for it over the next few days. Key Support Levels to Watch Looking at the downside, if XRP fails to hold above $2.10, the next support would be near $2.05, and then at $2.00. A decisive drop below $2.00 could send the price tumbling towards $1.80, a crucial support level. What Needs to Happen for a Bullish Shift? The overall market mood is still cautious. While XRP is showing short-term signs of trying to stabilize, the trend remains bearish unless it can break above the $2.21 to $2.28 resistance zone. If that happens, it would be the first hint that bulls are attempting a comeback.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-03 02:17:13

A White House spokesperson has indicated that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are likely to talk sometime this week. This news, initially reported by the Walter Bloomberg account on X, follows previous reports by Bitcoin World anticipating a very soon discussion between the two leaders. Why Does a Trump Xi Talk Matter for Markets? When the leaders of the United United States and China speak, the world listens. These two nations represent massive portions of the global economy and their relationship significantly influences international trade, technology, and geopolitics. A direct conversation between President Trump and President Xi Jinping can signal shifts in policy, de-escalate tensions, or sometimes, unfortunately, exacerbate them. For global markets, including the dynamic crypto market, such interactions are critical indicators of stability or potential volatility. Here are some key areas often influenced by US-China high-level discussions: Trade Policy: Tariffs, trade deals, and economic cooperation are frequently on the agenda. Outcomes can affect global supply chains and corporate earnings. Technology Competition: Discussions around technology, including semiconductors, AI, and data security, have significant economic and strategic implications. Geopolitical Stability: Regional issues, international relations, and strategic competition are often topics that impact global risk sentiment. How Does Geopolitical Risk Connect to the Crypto Market? The concept of geopolitical risk is highly relevant to understanding market movements, including those in cryptocurrency. Geopolitical events – whether conflicts, political instability, or high-stakes talks like a potential Trump Xi talk – introduce uncertainty into the global system. Investors often react to this uncertainty by adjusting their portfolios. Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are sometimes viewed as risk assets. This means their prices can be sensitive to shifts in global risk appetite. During periods of high geopolitical tension, traditional markets might see sell-offs, and this sentiment can spill over into crypto. Conversely, perceived de-escalation or positive diplomatic progress could potentially boost investor confidence, though the correlation isn’t always direct or predictable. The intricate dance of US China relations creates a significant source of this global risk. Any major development, positive or negative, can send ripples through financial markets worldwide. While Bitcoin was created outside traditional financial systems, its increasing integration into global finance means it’s not immune to these external pressures. Potential Impact on Bitcoin Price and Altcoins Given the sensitivity of markets to news related to US China relations , the upcoming Trump Xi talk could potentially influence the Bitcoin price and the broader crypto market. However, predicting the exact nature of this influence is challenging. Potential Scenarios: Positive Dialogue: If the talk is perceived as constructive, leading to reduced trade tensions or increased cooperation, it could potentially boost overall market sentiment, which *might* have a positive flow-through effect on risk assets like Bitcoin. Negative Dialogue or Stalemate: Conversely, if the talks reveal deep disagreements or increase tensions, it could heighten geopolitical risk, potentially leading to risk-off sentiment and downward pressure on asset prices, including crypto. Non-Impactful Talk: It’s also possible the talk yields no significant immediate outcomes, resulting in minimal market reaction directly attributable to the conversation itself. Altcoins tend to follow Bitcoin’s lead, so any significant price movement in Bitcoin influenced by the talk would likely affect the altcoin market as well. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors As the possibility of a Trump Xi talk this week looms, what steps can crypto investors consider? Stay Informed: Keep a close eye on news reports regarding the timing and perceived outcome of the talk. Reputable financial news sources and geopolitical analysts can provide valuable context. Understand the Broader Context: Don’t isolate this event. Consider it within the larger framework of global economic conditions, regulatory developments, and overall crypto market trends. Manage Risk: High-level political events can increase market volatility. Ensure your portfolio is aligned with your risk tolerance. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on speculation about the talk’s outcome. Focus on Long-Term Strategy: While short-term price movements can be influenced by news, a solid long-term investment strategy based on fundamentals and market cycles is generally more resilient to temporary geopolitical fluctuations. While a direct, immediate cause-and-effect between the talk and a specific price jump or drop is hard to guarantee, understanding the potential for increased geopolitical risk or stability is a crucial part of navigating any market, including crypto. Concluding Thoughts: Navigating Uncertainty The anticipated conversation between President Trump and President Xi Jinping is a significant event on the global stage. It underscores the interconnectedness of the world’s economies and the potential for high-level diplomacy to influence market sentiment. For those invested in cryptocurrencies, this talk serves as a reminder that external macroeconomic and geopolitical factors play a role in the market’s dynamics. While the exact impact remains to be seen, staying informed and maintaining a disciplined investment approach are key strategies in navigating the potential volatility that such significant global events can introduce. The intersection of US China relations and the crypto market highlights the evolving nature of digital assets within the broader financial ecosystem.

Currently trading just above $104,000, Bitcoin has recently retraced from its all-time high above $111,000, set last month. Contrasting Bitcoin’s consistent growth, Ethereum and other prominent altcoins have yet to surpass historical highs that they reached several years ago, highlighting a notable divergence in market performance. This divergence has been a focal point among analysts, prompting a deeper examination of investor behavior and capital flows between Bitcoin and altcoins. Recent insights from CryptoQuant analyst Dan suggest that while Bitcoin remains dominant, the situation for altcoins might shift in the upcoming phase of the crypto market cycle. Related Reading: Crypto Bulls See $644M Bloodbath As Bitcoin Dips Below $105,000 Bitcoin Investor Behavior Suggests Potential Shift Ahead CryptoQuant analyst Crypto Dan recently explored the broader implications of this Bitcoin-dominated cycle in his market commentary. According to Dan’s analysis, previous market cycles typically saw a gradual reduction in mid-to-long-term Bitcoin holdings as investor capital redistributed into altcoins. This shift traditionally drove altcoins significantly higher, usually marking the late stages of a bullish cycle. However, this cycle exhibits a different pattern. Frequent minor corrections in Bitcoin’s price are followed by more significant and sharp downturns for altcoins, demonstrating persistent weakness. Crypto Dan notes that currently, very few altcoin investors have realized meaningful profits, an unusual circumstance compared to prior cycles. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Says It’s Time For ‘Cautious Optimism’ — Further Upside Growth Incoming? Despite this ongoing difficulty for altcoin holders, the analyst maintains optimism, emphasizing that historical patterns suggest Bitcoin’s dominance typically declines towards the end of each cycle. If history repeats, altcoins might experience substantial upward movements as the cycle approaches its maturity. Thus, while altcoins currently underperform, investors are advised to maintain patience until Bitcoin’s momentum reaches its final bullish push, potentially signaling a turning point. Whale Activities Hint at Upcoming Altcoin Attention Complementing this perspective, another analyst from CryptoQuant, Maartunn, provided insights into stablecoin inflows to major exchanges. Specifically, Maartunn highlighted that over 75% of Tether (USDT) deposits to Binance, tracked via the TRC-20 network, originated from large wallets, commonly known as whales, since November 2023. Over 75% of USDT Inflows to Binance Are from Whales “The data shows a clear trend: whales prefer Binance. Since November 2023, approximately 75% of total USDT deposits to Binance have originated from whale addresses.” – By @JA_Maartun pic.twitter.com/KCBA8cVCdb — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) June 2, 2025 This substantial concentration of whale activity suggests that major market participants prefer Binance for significant capital movements involving stablecoins. The notable whale-driven inflows to Binance could indicate preparation for substantial market activity, including potential purchasing of Bitcoin or an eventual shift towards altcoins. Historically, stablecoin deposits from large holders precede increased volatility and trading activity, as whales position themselves strategically in anticipation of market shifts.

A significant event recently unfolded, involving a substantial Bitcoin transfer that originated from a major exchange. Unpacking the Recent 7,000 Bitcoin Transfer Reports indicate that a colossal amount of Bitcoin, specifically 7,000 BTC, was recently transferred from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. This movement was promptly flagged by tracking services that monitor large blockchain transactions. At the time of the report, this significant transfer was valued at approximately $731 million, highlighting the immense value that can be moved on the Bitcoin network. Such large-scale movements are not everyday occurrences for individual investors, making them points of interest for those trying to gauge market sentiment or potential strategic plays by major holders. The Role of Whale Alert in Transparency How do we even know about such a massive Bitcoin transfer ? This is where services like Whale Alert come into play. Whale Alert is a well-known cryptocurrency transaction tracker that provides real-time updates on large movements of digital assets across various blockchains. By monitoring publicly available blockchain data, Whale Alert identifies transactions exceeding a certain threshold, often involving millions or even billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. Their reporting brings a degree of transparency to the otherwise pseudonymous world of blockchain transactions. While the identities behind the wallet addresses remain unknown unless linked to a specific entity (like a registered exchange), the fact that a large amount of value has moved is immediately visible. This allows market participants to react to or analyze these movements, speculating on their potential meaning. Key functions of Whale Alert and similar services include: Tracking large transactions across multiple cryptocurrencies. Identifying source and destination wallets (though not necessarily the owners). Reporting transaction value in fiat currency at the time of transfer. Alerting the community via social media and other platforms. Their work is crucial for market observers who want to understand the flow of capital within the crypto ecosystem. Who is the Crypto Whale Behind This Movement? The term “ crypto whale ” refers to an individual, entity, or group that holds a significant amount of a particular cryptocurrency. Because of their large holdings, their trading activities or transfers can potentially influence market prices due to the sheer volume involved. In the context of Bitcoin, a crypto whale is typically someone holding thousands of BTC. The 7,000 BTC transferred from Bitfinex certainly qualifies as a whale-sized movement. However, identifying the exact “whale” is challenging because the destination is reported as an “unknown new wallet.” This could represent several possibilities: A large individual investor moving funds to personal cold storage. An institution (like a hedge fund or corporation) taking custody of purchased Bitcoin. An over-the-counter (OTC) desk facilitating a large private sale, with the buyer moving funds off-exchange. Bitfinex itself moving funds for internal purposes, such as replenishing cold storage reserves or managing balances. Without further information linked to the destination address, the identity of the whale remains a subject of speculation. The term “unknown new wallet” often suggests a wallet that hasn’t been previously tagged or associated with a known entity by blockchain analysis firms. Why Would Bitfinex Be Involved? The transfer originating from Bitfinex is a key detail. Bitfinex is one of the older and larger cryptocurrency exchanges in the market. Exchanges constantly handle large volumes of cryptocurrency, managing deposits, withdrawals, and internal transfers. There are several reasons why a large amount of Bitcoin might move *from* an exchange like Bitfinex: Customer Withdrawal: The most straightforward reason is a large customer withdrawing their Bitcoin from the exchange to their own wallet. This is common for whales or institutions who prefer to hold their assets in self-custody rather than on an exchange. Exchange Cold Storage Management: Exchanges typically hold a significant portion of their users’ funds in “cold storage” – offline wallets that are less susceptible to hacking. They periodically move funds between hot wallets (online, for daily operations) and cold wallets for security and management purposes. This transfer could be Bitfinex moving funds to a new or existing cold storage address. OTC Desk Activity: Many exchanges, including Bitfinex, operate OTC desks for large trades that might otherwise impact the public order book. If a large buyer acquired 7,000 BTC via Bitfinex’s OTC service, this transfer could represent the exchange delivering the purchased Bitcoin to the buyer’s specified wallet. Internal Balance Rebalancing: Exchanges might move funds between different internal wallets for operational efficiency, security partitioning, or consolidating smaller inputs. Understanding the likely reason often requires additional context or analysis of the wallet’s subsequent activity, which isn’t always immediately available. The Significance of a Large Crypto Transaction Every large crypto transaction , especially one involving a significant amount of Bitcoin like 7,000 BTC, is scrutinized for potential market signals. The significance lies in the potential impact these movements *could* have, although correlation is not always causation. Here’s why such transactions are watched: Potential Selling Pressure: If a large amount of Bitcoin moves *to* an exchange from an unknown wallet, it could signal an intent to sell, potentially increasing supply and exerting downward pressure on price. However, this specific transfer is *from* an exchange, which usually doesn’t indicate imminent selling on that exchange’s public market. Potential Buying Pressure (Indirect): If the transfer is a customer withdrawal after an OTC purchase, it indicates significant buying demand that has already been fulfilled off-exchange. This is often seen as a bullish signal, as a large buyer is accumulating and moving assets into secure storage. Increased Confidence/Adoption: Movements to cold storage can indicate a long-term holding strategy by large players, suggesting confidence in Bitcoin’s future value. Institutional adoption often involves large purchases followed by transfers to secure custody solutions. Market Sentiment Indicator: The frequency and direction of large transfers can sometimes serve as a rough indicator of overall market sentiment among whales. It’s important to note that a single large transfer doesn’t dictate the market direction, but it adds a data point to the complex puzzle analysts try to solve. Analyzing the “Unknown New Wallet” Aspect The destination being an “unknown new wallet” is a crucial piece of information. If the destination were a known exchange wallet, it might suggest inter-exchange transfers or preparation for selling. The fact that it’s an unknown, presumably newly active wallet, leans towards the possibilities of cold storage or a new entrant taking custody. Consider the implications: Security Focus: Moving large amounts off-exchange into self-custody is generally viewed as a security-conscious move, reducing counterparty risk associated with keeping funds on an exchange. Long-Term Holding Intent: Wallets associated with long-term holding strategies (like cold storage) typically see large inflows and minimal outflows, especially not to exchanges. Future activity from this wallet would be key to confirming this. Potential New Player: It could represent a significant new institutional or high-net-worth individual entering the space or consolidating previous purchases. While the term “unknown” adds a layer of mystery, blockchain analysis firms are constantly working to de-anonymize addresses by linking them to known entities or activities over time. Challenges and Benefits of Tracking Whale Movements Tracking large crypto transactions offers valuable insights, but it’s not without its challenges. Benefits: Increases transparency in the market. Provides data points for market analysis and sentiment gauging. Helps identify potential large-scale buying or selling activity (when moving to/from exchanges). Highlights significant movements for security monitoring. Challenges: Wallet addresses are pseudonymous, not anonymous; ownership is not immediately clear. A single large transaction can have multiple interpretations (withdrawal, cold storage, OTC, internal transfer). Wallets can be consolidated or split, making it hard to track funds precisely over time. It’s difficult to distinguish between institutional, exchange internal, or large individual movements solely based on the address. Correlation does not equal causation; a transfer doesn’t guarantee a specific market outcome. Therefore, while tracking services like Whale Alert provide crucial raw data, interpreting that data requires careful consideration of context and other market factors. What Does This Mean for the Average Investor? For most individual cryptocurrency holders, a 7,000 BTC transfer might seem like a distant event involving players with vastly different capital. However, these movements are part of the larger market ecosystem that can eventually influence price and sentiment. Here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed, But Don’t Panic: Use reports like this as information, not necessarily a direct signal to buy or sell immediately. Large transfers are relatively common. Understand the Context: Try to understand the potential reasons behind the transfer (e.g., from vs. to an exchange, to a known vs. unknown wallet) rather than just reacting to the headline number. Consider Security: Large transfers to unknown wallets often highlight the practice of moving assets off exchanges for security. This might prompt you to review your own security practices, especially if you hold a significant amount of crypto on an exchange. Focus on Long-Term Trends: While whale movements are interesting, they are just one data point. Focus on broader market trends, fundamental analysis of assets, and your own investment strategy rather than making impulsive decisions based on single large transactions. Ultimately, while whale watching provides fascinating insights into the activities of major market participants, it should be part of a broader approach to understanding the cryptocurrency market. Conclusion: Another Day, Another Whale Movement The transfer of 7,000 BTC from Bitfinex to an unknown new wallet, reported by Whale Alert, is a significant event in terms of the value moved ($731 million). While the exact purpose and owner of the destination wallet remain unconfirmed, such large movements from exchanges often indicate substantial withdrawals by major holders, possibly for cold storage or following an OTC trade. These transactions, tracked diligently by services like Whale Alert, offer a glimpse into the activities of crypto whales and contribute to the overall market narrative. While they don’t provide a crystal ball for price prediction, they serve as valuable data points highlighting the ongoing flow of capital and the increasing adoption and strategic positioning by large players in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

This strategic divestment signals a significant shift in Yuga Labs’ focus, as it doubles down on its core assets like Bored Apes and the ambitious Otherside metaverse project. Understanding the Strategic Shift at Yuga Labs Why would a company like Yuga Labs , known for acquiring prominent NFT projects, decide to sell one of its own? According to co-founder Greg Solano, this decision is part of a “ruthless” approach to eliminate non-core assets. In the fast-evolving world of Web3, focus is paramount. By shedding projects that don’t align perfectly with their central vision, Yuga Labs aims to allocate resources, talent, and energy more effectively towards their foundational pillars: the Bored Apes ecosystem and the expansive Otherside virtual world. This isn’t just about cutting weight; it’s about sharpening the spear. Yuga Labs’ core strategy revolves around building a massive, interconnected ecosystem centered around their premier collections. Projects like Moonbirds , while successful in their own right, likely required significant resources that Yuga believes can be better utilized elsewhere. This move suggests a mature phase for Yuga, moving from aggressive acquisition to strategic optimization. What Does Selling the Moonbirds NFT IP Mean? The sale of the Moonbirds NFT IP isn’t just a simple transaction; it’s the transfer of the rights to the brand, artwork, and potentially future development direction of the popular owl-themed collection. Moonbirds burst onto the scene in 2022, quickly becoming a blue-chip NFT project known for its strong community and unique nesting mechanism. Yuga Labs acquired the IP from Proof Collective in June 2022, a significant move at the time. Now, the stewardship of this valuable NFT IP passes to Orange Cap Games. This transfer includes the rights to the Moonbirds and Oddities collections. For holders, this means the future development, utility, and vision for their beloved owls will now be shaped by a new entity with a potentially different focus – likely centered around gaming, given the buyer’s name. Key aspects of the IP transfer: Ownership: Orange Cap Games now owns the intellectual property rights. Future Development: Orange Cap Games will dictate the roadmap and initiatives for Moonbirds. Community Engagement: While the community remains, interactions and official communications will likely shift to Orange Cap Games. Potential Utility: Orange Cap Games is expected to integrate Moonbirds into gaming experiences or other forms of entertainment. Who is Orange Cap Games and What’s Their Plan for Moonbirds ? While not as widely known in the broader NFT space as Yuga Labs, Orange Cap Games’ acquisition of the Moonbirds NFT IP immediately puts them in the spotlight. Their name strongly suggests a focus on the gaming industry, which aligns with a major trend in the Web3 space: integrating NFTs and digital assets into interactive entertainment. The exact plans Orange Cap Games has for Moonbirds are still unfolding, but the acquisition indicates a belief in the IP’s potential within a gaming or entertainment context. This could involve developing games featuring the Moonbirds characters, creating immersive experiences, or finding new ways to leverage the existing community and IP in the gaming world. For Moonbirds holders, this transition brings both excitement for potential new utility and some degree of uncertainty regarding the future direction under new leadership. Market Reaction: The 40% Price Jump Interestingly, following the news of the sale, the floor price of Moonbirds NFTs saw a significant jump, reportedly increasing by 40%. This immediate positive market reaction might seem counterintuitive for a project being divested, but several factors could explain it: Possible Reasons for the Price Increase: Clarity and Focus: The sale removes uncertainty about Moonbirds’ place within Yuga’s crowded ecosystem. A dedicated entity like Orange Cap Games focused solely on Moonbirds might be seen as a positive for the project’s future development. Alignment with Gaming: The market might be bullish on the prospect of Moonbirds being integrated into gaming, a potentially massive growth area for NFTs. Strategic Buyer: The acquisition by a gaming company validates the IP’s potential beyond just a collectible. Reduced Dilution: With Yuga focusing elsewhere, there might be less perceived risk of Moonbirds being overshadowed by Bored Apes or Otherside initiatives. This price movement highlights how market sentiment in the NFT space can react positively to strategic clarity and perceived alignment with future growth sectors like gaming, even if it involves a change in ownership. Implications for Holders: What Does This Mean for Your Moonbirds ? If you’re a Moonbirds holder, this news is certainly significant. Your asset’s future is now tied to the vision and execution of Orange Cap Games. Here’s a breakdown of potential implications: Potential Benefits: Dedicated Development: Orange Cap Games is solely focused on Moonbirds, potentially leading to more dedicated resources and faster development cycles specifically for the project. Gaming Utility: If Orange Cap Games successfully integrates Moonbirds into compelling gaming experiences, this could add significant utility and demand for the NFTs. New Vision: A fresh perspective from a gaming-focused company could unlock new possibilities for the IP that might not have been prioritized under Yuga Labs. Potential Challenges: Uncertainty: The transition period and Orange Cap Games’ unproven track record in managing a large NFT community introduce uncertainty. Integration Issues: Integrating the existing Moonbirds community and IP into new gaming platforms might face technical or social hurdles. Loss of Yuga Ecosystem Synergy: Moonbirds might lose some benefits or synergies associated with being part of the larger Yuga Labs ecosystem, which includes projects like Bored Apes and Otherside .

A critical player in this space is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Right now, the CFTC is navigating a period of significant transition, particularly concerning its role in CFTC crypto oversight . This flux in leadership coincides directly with ongoing efforts in Congress to potentially expand the agency’s authority over certain digital assets. What does this mean for the future of crypto regulation in the United States? Let’s dive in. What’s Happening with CFTC Leadership Changes? The CFTC, like many government agencies, relies on its appointed commissioners to set policy and guide its enforcement actions. Recently, the agency has seen several commissioners depart, creating vacancies at the top. This wave of departures isn’t just administrative churn; it’s happening at a crucial time when the agency’s mandate regarding digital assets is under intense scrutiny and debate in Washington D.C. Think of it like a sports team losing key players just as they’re about to enter a challenging new season with expanded rules. While the core staff remains, the strategic direction is heavily influenced by the commissioners. The departure of experienced individuals means new appointments will be necessary, and the perspectives of these new appointees could significantly shape the CFTC’s approach to the burgeoning crypto market. According to reports, including one from The Block, this period of transition isn’t necessarily viewed negatively by everyone in the crypto space. Some former chairs of the commission have reportedly suggested that these departures, while potentially causing delays in decision-making while seats remain vacant, could ultimately pave the way for leadership that is more knowledgeable about or even more favorable towards the nuances of digital assets. Key points regarding the leadership changes: Multiple commissioner seats have become vacant. Appointments require White House nomination and Senate confirmation. Delays in filling seats can slow down policy-making and enforcement clarity. New appointees will bring fresh perspectives on digital assets. Expanding CFTC Crypto Oversight: What Does Congress Want? For years, there’s been a debate about which federal regulator has primary jurisdiction over various types of digital assets. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) generally oversees assets deemed securities, while the CFTC oversees commodities and derivatives markets. Many cryptocurrencies, particularly those that don’t fit neatly into the traditional definition of a security, have been argued to fall under the CFTC’s purview as commodities (like Bitcoin and Ethereum, according to past statements by CFTC chairs). However, the lines are blurry, and both agencies have asserted authority, leading to confusion and, at times, conflicting signals for the industry. Recognizing this regulatory ambiguity, Congress has been actively working on legislation aimed at providing clearer rules of the road for digital assets. A significant part of these legislative efforts involves potentially granting the CFTC more explicit and expanded authority over certain aspects of the crypto market, particularly spot markets for digital commodities. Why the CFTC? Proponents of this approach often argue that the CFTC’s framework for regulating commodity markets and preventing fraud and manipulation is well-suited for the characteristics of many cryptocurrencies. They believe that giving the CFTC clear authority could provide much-needed regulatory certainty, fostering innovation while protecting consumers. Congressional objectives often include: Establishing clear definitions for different types of digital assets. Granting the CFTC explicit authority over the spot market for digital commodities. Implementing requirements for registration and oversight of crypto trading platforms dealing with commodities. Enhancing consumer protection measures. Ensuring market integrity and preventing manipulation. How Might Digital Asset Regulation Evolve Under Expanded CFTC Powers? If Congress successfully expands digital asset regulation under the CFTC’s wing, we could see several significant changes in how crypto businesses operate in the U.S. This isn’t just about which agency’s name is on the rulebook; it’s about the specific types of rules that would apply. The CFTC’s historical focus has been on market integrity, preventing fraud, and ensuring fair trading practices in commodity markets. Applying this framework to digital assets would likely involve requirements for trading platforms related to things like: Registration: Crypto exchanges dealing in digital commodities might need to register with the CFTC, similar to futures commission merchants or designated contract markets. Market Surveillance: Implementing systems to detect and prevent market manipulation, wash trading, and other illicit activities. Customer Protection: Rules around handling customer funds, cybersecurity, and disclosure requirements. Reporting: Requirements to report trading data to the regulator. This evolution could lead to a more structured and potentially safer market environment for investors and participants dealing with digital commodities. However, it also means increased compliance burdens for crypto businesses. Potential Impact on US Crypto Regulation The combined effect of CFTC leadership changes and expanded authority could have a profound impact on the overall landscape of US crypto regulation . The perspective of the new commissioners will be crucial in how aggressively or cautiously the agency uses any new powers granted by Congress. If the new leadership is indeed more ‘pro-crypto’ as suggested, it might translate into a focus on creating clear, workable rules rather than solely relying on enforcement actions. Benefits of clearer CFTC oversight could include: Increased institutional participation due to greater regulatory certainty. Reduced regulatory arbitrage between different platforms or asset types. Enhanced consumer and investor confidence. Potential for new regulated financial products based on digital assets. However, challenges remain. The process of confirming new commissioners can be slow, leaving the agency with limited capacity to tackle complex new rule-making. There’s also the inherent difficulty in applying traditional regulatory frameworks to rapidly evolving technology. Furthermore, coordination between the CFTC and SEC will remain essential to avoid overlapping or conflicting rules. This period represents a critical juncture. The decisions made regarding appointments and the specific details of new legislation will shape how digital assets are treated under U.S. law for years to come. The industry is watching closely to see if this period of flux leads to a more favorable and predictable regulatory environment or adds another layer of complexity. Navigating the Future of Crypto Policy: Challenges and Opportunities The path forward for crypto policy in the U.S. is fraught with both challenges and opportunities. The challenges include navigating the political complexities of passing comprehensive legislation, the technical challenges of regulating decentralized technology, and ensuring adequate resources for regulators like the CFTC to effectively oversee a new market. Challenges: Slow legislative process in Congress. Delays in appointing and confirming new CFTC commissioners. Ensuring regulatory frameworks are adaptable to technological changes. Coordination issues between different regulatory bodies (CFTC, SEC, FinCEN, etc.). Risk of stifling innovation through overly burdensome rules. Yet, the opportunities are significant. A clear regulatory framework, potentially led by an empowered CFTC for digital commodities, could unlock significant growth for the U.S. crypto industry. It could encourage more businesses to build and operate domestically, attract more institutional capital, and provide a safer environment for retail investors. Opportunities: Increased regulatory clarity fostering innovation and investment. Potential for the U.S. to become a leader in regulated digital asset markets. Enhanced market integrity reducing instances of fraud and manipulation. Greater consumer protection through clear rules and oversight. Actionable insights for those involved in the crypto space during this period: Stay Informed: Pay close attention to news regarding CFTC appointments and congressional legislative progress. Understand the Nuances: Learn about the differences between commodity and securities regulation and how they might apply to different assets. Prepare for Potential Changes: If you operate a crypto business, start considering what potential CFTC registration and compliance requirements might entail. Engage (Where Possible): Industry participants can often provide valuable input during public comment periods on proposed rules. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Crypto Regulation The current state of flux within CFTC leadership, combined with the push for expanded CFTC crypto oversight by Congress, marks a pivotal moment for US crypto regulation . While the departure of commissioners introduces uncertainty and potential delays, it also opens the door for new perspectives that could shape a more defined and potentially ‘pro-crypto’ approach to digital asset regulation . The ongoing legislative efforts aim to provide much-needed clarity, potentially granting the CFTC explicit authority over digital commodity markets. Navigating these CFTC leadership changes and the evolving crypto policy landscape presents both challenges in the form of regulatory uncertainty and implementation hurdles, and significant opportunities for market growth, innovation, and enhanced consumer protection. The coming months will be critical in determining the future trajectory of how digital assets are overseen in the United States.

As part of this deal, VivoPower will use BitGo’s exclusive over-the-counter (OTC) trading services to purchase $100 million worth of XRP tokens. This move is part of VivoPower’s new treasury strategy, following its successful $121 million fundraising round. A Sign of Growing Interest in Altcoin Treasury Holdings This step by VivoPower marks one of the first major corporate treasury allocations into XRP — a move that mirrors what companies like MicroStrategy did with Bitcoin. By holding crypto assets as part of their corporate reserves, firms aim to diversify and potentially benefit from the growing digital asset market. John Deaton’s Take on the Bigger Picture Reacting to the news, Pro-XRP attorney and expert John Deaton connected this development to a broader trend. He recalled how, after the long-awaited approval of Bitcoin Spot ETFs, he had predicted that ETFs for other altcoins like ETH, XRP, and SOL would eventually follow. After the Bitcoin Spot ETF was finally granted (more like demanded – after being forced to fight Gensler’s Bad Faith @SECGov , which was found to have acted “arbitrary and capricious” in denying one), I said that I had zero doubts about Alt-Coin ETFs eventually following – and not… https://t.co/nDp5lnpUNk — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) June 2, 2025 While some doubted him at the time, Deaton’s reasoning was based on a simple observation: once Bitcoin ETFs proved to be massively successful — even becoming some of the best-performing ETFs in history — Wall Street would naturally look to replicate that success with other digital assets. Companies Copying the Bitcoin Treasury Model Deaton also explained that what Michael Saylor and MicroStrategy did with Bitcoin — turning it into a corporate treasury asset — would eventually inspire other firms to do the same with select altcoins like XRP. VivoPower’s move seems to be the first public example of this trend taking shape. Greed Drives Innovation Deaton was clear that he isn’t endorsing or celebrating these actions, but rather showing how financial incentives and Wall Street’s appetite for profits often predict market shifts before regulations or public sentiment catch up.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-03 03:05:08

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is making moves that could significantly impact the structure and mechanics of Bitcoin ETF offerings in the United States. Specifically, the regulator has opened the floor for public feedback on a crucial aspect of the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund’s operations: the potential adoption of in-kind creation and redemption mechanisms. This might sound technical, but it’s a development with potentially positive ripple effects for the broader Bitcoin market. Understanding Bitcoin ETF Creation and Redemption Before diving into the specifics of the SEC Bitcoin ETF feedback request, let’s quickly recap how ETFs generally work, particularly concerning their creation and redemption processes. This is fundamental to understanding why the SEC’s request is noteworthy. ETFs, or Exchange-Traded Funds, are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. They typically hold assets like stocks, bonds, commodities, or, in this case, Bitcoin. The price of an ETF share is designed to track the value of its underlying assets. To keep the ETF’s market price aligned with the value of its holdings (Net Asset Value or NAV), specialized financial institutions called Authorized Participants (APs) can create or redeem ETF shares directly with the fund issuer. This process helps prevent significant premiums or discounts between the ETF’s market price and its NAV. There are two primary ways this creation and redemption can happen: Cash Creation/Redemption: This is the method currently used by the recently approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. When APs create new shares, they give the fund issuer cash equivalent to the value of the Bitcoin needed. The issuer then uses this cash to buy Bitcoin on the open market. When APs redeem shares, the issuer sells Bitcoin and gives the APs cash. In-Kind Creation/Redemption: This is the method commonly used by ETFs holding physical assets like gold or shares of stock. When APs create new shares, they deliver the actual underlying assets (Bitcoin, in this case) to the fund issuer in exchange for new ETF shares. When APs redeem shares, they receive a basket of the underlying assets (Bitcoin) from the issuer in exchange for returning ETF shares. Here’s a simple comparison: Feature Cash Model (Current U.S. Spot Bitcoin ETFs) In-Kind Model (SEC is reviewing for WisdomTree) Creation Process APs give cash to issuer. Issuer buys Bitcoin. APs give Bitcoin to issuer. Issuer creates shares. Redemption Process APs return shares to issuer. Issuer sells Bitcoin and gives cash to APs. APs return shares to issuer. Issuer gives Bitcoin to APs. Market Impact (Selling Pressure) Issuer may sell Bitcoin on open market during redemptions. Issuer transfers Bitcoin directly to APs during redemptions, avoiding open market sales. Operational Complexity Simpler from issuer’s perspective (handles cash). More complex (requires secure handling and transfer of Bitcoin). Tax Implications (Potential) Potential for capital gains events for the fund when selling Bitcoin for redemptions. May avoid capital gains events for the fund during redemptions (assets are transferred, not sold). Why the SEC is Requesting Feedback on In-Kind Redemption The news, initially reported by The Block, highlights that the SEC is specifically asking for public comments on whether its rules should be changed to accommodate this in-kind mechanism for the WisdomTree Bitcoin ETF . This is a significant step because, despite approving spot Bitcoin ETFs, the SEC mandated the cash creation/redemption model for all approved funds. The SEC’s cautious approach has historically stemmed from concerns about market manipulation in the underlying Bitcoin market, custody of digital assets, and investor protection. The cash model was seen by some as simpler to oversee and potentially mitigating certain risks associated with directly handling Bitcoin during the creation/redemption process. However, the in-kind model has proponents who argue it offers distinct advantages, particularly regarding market impact and potential tax efficiency. The SEC’s request for feedback suggests they are now willing to revisit this aspect, possibly influenced by the successful launch and operation of the cash-based ETFs, or perhaps prompted by renewed arguments from filers like WisdomTree. The Potential Benefits of In-Kind for Bitcoin ETFs Permitting in-kind redemption is the core focus of the SEC’s inquiry and a key point of discussion among market participants. Here’s why it’s considered potentially beneficial: Reduced Selling Pressure: This is perhaps the most frequently cited benefit. In the cash model, when investors redeem ETF shares, the fund issuer must sell Bitcoin on the open market to get the cash needed to pay the Authorized Participant. This selling can contribute to downward pressure on the Bitcoin price, especially during periods of heavy redemptions. With the in-kind model, the fund issuer simply gives Bitcoin directly to the AP. The AP receives Bitcoin, not cash from a sale, thus bypassing the need for the issuer to sell into the market. This could lead to smoother ETF operations with less direct impact on the spot price of Bitcoin. Potential Tax Efficiency: For the ETF fund itself, in-kind redemptions can be more tax-efficient. In the cash model, selling Bitcoin to meet redemptions can trigger capital gains taxes for the fund, which are then passed on to shareholders. In the in-kind model, transferring the asset (Bitcoin) to the AP is generally not considered a taxable event for the fund. This could potentially lead to better after-tax returns for long-term ETF holders. ( Note: Individual investor tax implications upon selling ETF shares remain the same, but the fund’s internal tax efficiency improves. ) Alignment with Traditional Asset ETFs: The in-kind model is standard for many ETFs holding physical commodities or large baskets of securities. Adopting it for Bitcoin ETFs would bring them more in line with these traditional structures, which some argue is a sign of market maturation and regulatory comfort. Potential for Tighter Tracking: Some argue that the direct exchange of asset for shares in the in-kind model can lead to slightly tighter tracking of the underlying asset’s price compared to the cash model, although the difference is often minimal in practice for highly liquid assets. Challenges and Regulatory Considerations While the benefits are compelling, the SEC’s request for feedback also implicitly acknowledges potential challenges that need careful consideration: Operational Complexity: Handling physical Bitcoin (or rather, managing private keys and secure transfers on the blockchain) is operationally more complex than simply moving cash. Fund issuers and APs would need robust infrastructure, security protocols, and custody solutions to manage these transfers safely and efficiently. Custody Requirements: The secure custody of the underlying Bitcoin is paramount. While current cash ETFs already rely on custodians, an in-kind model requires the custodian to facilitate direct transfers to and from APs, adding layers of operational and security considerations. Regulatory Hurdles: The SEC’s initial preference for cash wasn’t arbitrary. They had concerns about the potential for manipulation or difficulties in overseeing direct Bitcoin transfers in the creation/redemption process. The feedback request aims to understand if these concerns can be adequately addressed by proponents of the in-kind model. Impact on Market Makers: Authorized Participants play a critical role. Switching to in-kind would change their operational workflows and risk management strategies. The SEC will want to understand how this impacts market liquidity and stability from the AP perspective. The Role of Crypto Regulation This specific feedback request is a microcosm of the broader landscape of crypto regulation in the United States. The SEC is navigating the integration of a novel asset class (Bitcoin) into traditional financial structures (ETFs). Each decision, like the choice between cash and in-kind mechanisms, reflects the regulator’s ongoing effort to balance fostering innovation with ensuring investor protection and market integrity. The fact that the SEC is even considering this change for the WisdomTree fund, after initially standardizing on cash for all issuers (BlackRock, Fidelity, etc.), suggests an evolving perspective or a willingness to refine the rules based on practical experience since the January 2024 launches. What Does This Mean for the Market and Investors? For the Bitcoin market, a shift towards in-kind redemptions across multiple ETFs (if approved) could potentially reduce a source of selling pressure during downturns, contributing to slightly more stable price action related to ETF flows. It might also be seen as another step towards institutional normalization of Bitcoin. For investors, while the direct impact on buying and selling ETF shares might be minimal, the potential for improved tax efficiency within the fund could lead to slightly better long-term returns. It also signals ongoing refinement in how these investment products operate. Actionable Insights What should investors and market participants do with this information? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on the SEC’s public comment process and any subsequent announcements regarding WisdomTree’s application or potential rule changes. Understand Your ETF: If you hold a Bitcoin ETF, understand its current creation/redemption mechanism (currently cash for all U.S. spot ETFs) and how potential changes could affect it. Consider the Broader Regulatory Landscape: This development is part of the larger picture of how crypto is being integrated into traditional finance. Understanding these regulatory nuances is key to navigating the space. Conclusion: A Step Towards Maturation? The SEC’s request for feedback on allowing in-kind redemption for the WisdomTree Bitcoin ETF is more than just a technical tweak; it’s a signal that the regulatory conversation around Bitcoin ETFs is ongoing and potentially evolving. While the cash model served as an initial, perhaps more cautious, approach, exploring in-kind mechanisms reflects a deeper dive into the operational realities and potential benefits for both fund efficiency and market dynamics. Permitting in-kind creations and redemptions could streamline processes, potentially enhance tax outcomes for fund holders, and, crucially, reduce the instances where fund issuers need to sell Bitcoin on the open market during redemptions. This could be a subtle but important positive development for the stability of Bitcoin price action influenced by ETF flows. As the SEC gathers feedback, the industry will be watching closely to see if this leads to a rule change that could eventually apply to other Bitcoin ETFs, further shaping how this increasingly popular investment vehicle interacts with the underlying digital asset market. It’s another step in the complex, but fascinating, journey of integrating Bitcoin into mainstream finance under the watchful eye of crypto regulation .

The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) now requires all cash-based crypto transactions via ATMs to be capped at roughly USD 3,250 per transaction. This is just one part of the government’s crackdown on financial crime and scam activities that are now taking full advantage of cryptocurrency kiosks all over Australia. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said crypto ATMs are increasingly being used for financial fraud. In response, AUSTRAC set a new transaction limit and refused to renew the license of one ATM operator for failing to report transaction volumes and comply with AML/CTF laws. In addition to the limit, AUSTRAC announced tougher compliance rules. These would include the need for greater customer identity verification, compulsory scam warnings on cash machine screens, and enhanced transaction monitoring systems. The new regulations apply to all registered DCEs running crypto ATMs, with AUSTRAC urging similar limits for all cash-for-crypto services. Australia sees rapid growth in crypto ATMs Over the past seven years, the number of crypto ATMs in Australia has risen sharply. AUSTRAC reveals that over 1,800 of these machines are in operation, a steep jump from the 23 bank machines in 2019. This accelerated expansion has established Australia as the third biggest market for crypto kiosks worldwide after the United States of America and Canada. But the boom has also raised grave concerns. Many of the transactions performed on these ATMs are related to criminal activities . Enforcement agencies have found that various scammers are increasingly using the machines, including those operating romance and fake investment schemes and remote access fraud — offenses that frequently victimize older Australians. Austrac’s data analysis shows those aged 50-plus are particularly susceptible, making up 72% of all transactions by value. The 60- to 70-year-olds constitute almost 30% of this activity alone. Scammers often trick victims into using these machines to send money. AUSTRAC’s CEO warns that anyone told to use a crypto ATM for payments should pause and consider it a red flag for a scam. AUSTRAC establishes working group to strengthen supervision To address the risks, AUSTRAC has initiated a task force to assess crypto ATM providers’ developments. The squad formed in late 2024 had carried out dozens of site visits, business evaluations, and outreach sessions to registered companies. Any provider that does not then meet the enhanced, including adequate KYC (Know Your Customer) checks, transaction monitoring, and suspicious matter reporting requirements — will face enforcement action by the regulator, including deregistration. Recently, AUSTRAC permanently barred a crypto ATM operator that refused to improve its compliance measures. Australia’s action is among the harshest efforts anywhere to control the abuse of crypto ATMs. The new rules could serve as a blueprint for other countries wrestling with accommodating cryptocurrency growth while protecting consumers. Regulators in the US, UK, and the EU have also singled crypto ATMs out as a fraud and money laundering risk. By doing so, Australia joined a growing club of governments seeking to balance innovation with protections. AUSTRAC said it would like everyone to access a full range of financial services, including digital currency services, without fear of them being misused by criminals. Trust in these systems can be developed if the systems are secure, transparent, and not misused by criminals, the agency said.

As both ecosystems mature, they’re beginning to solve each other’s most difficult limitations. AI brings automation, content generation and adaptive intelligence. Crypto brings trustless systems, composability and programmable ownership. Together, they are not just reshaping software – they are laying the foundation for the next internet economy. Over the past decade, crypto has quietly built the base infrastructure for a more open internet. Blockchains, smart contracts, decentralized storage and public-key systems have created the rails for verifiable, user-owned applications. But the applications themselves have often lacked a human interface. Meanwhile, AI has become a transformative force in content, conversation and utility but it exists primarily behind APIs owned by private companies. Without crypto, AI has no native way to express ownership, prove authenticity or distribute value. The intersection of these two technologies is where things get interesting. Crypto fixes the ownership problem in AI. When an AI model generates an image, a video, a song or an essay, who owns that output? Who gets credited or paid? With crypto, we can establish provenance, register outputs as NFTs, encode revenue splits via smart contracts and give AI-generated content an on-chain identity. It’s not just about digital art or collectibles – it’s about building economic rails for intelligence itself. What we’re talking about is the ability to assign financial agency to digital creators that aren’t human and to do it in a way that’s transparent, immutable and global. At the same time, AI fixes the usability problem in crypto. Crypto protocols are powerful, but they’ve always required users to learn complex interfaces and workflows. AI simplifies that. With AI-powered agents or virtual characters, crypto becomes easier to use, more intuitive and more personal. Agents can explain your transaction history, recommend a DeFi strategy, auto-compound your staking rewards or even act on your behalf. Imagine an AI wallet that knows your goals and can navigate crypto like a power user – but with zero friction. This drastically reduces the cognitive load required to participate in decentralized systems. What emerges is a new kind of software, autonomous, self-improving and financially active. Virtual influencers that post, respond and grow audiences. Trading bots that learn and adapt in real time. Digital concierges that offer services across platforms 24/7. These aren’t just AI toys. They are monetizable digital labor. They generate value, interact with users and evolve. And they require crypto infrastructure to function – wallets, payments, identity, coordination and access to permissionless systems. We’re already seeing this materialize in the creator economy. A musician can deploy a digital twin that composes, remixes and engages with fans on their behalf. A fitness influencer can scale themselves into dozens of AI-powered coach bots that interact with users in real time. Every one of these agents can be tokenized, monetized and operated autonomously. And behind it all, crypto is the connective tissue that ensures payments, permissions and provenance work at scale. These systems are already emerging. But the real opportunity is in making them composable, where developers can plug together AI models, data sources and crypto primitives to build entirely new categories of experiences. Just as Shopify enabled a long tail of e-commerce entrepreneurs, this stack will unlock a long tail of intelligent, automated and monetizable software. At a deeper level, what we’re witnessing is the birth of a new computing layer. AI turns software into services that adapt. Crypto turns services into networks that anyone can join or fork. Together, they form ecosystems that are intelligent, decentralized and economically aligned. You don’t just use the app, you own a piece of it, improve it or extend it with your own logic. There are also governance implications. As AI systems begin to participate in markets, we’ll need ways to manage collective behavior, enforce accountability and define rights – not just for human users but for the digital agents and influencers themselves. Crypto-native governance, DAOs and reputation systems may offer a starting point for building these new frameworks. The internet is evolving. We’re moving from platforms to protocols. From static pages to conversational agents. From corporate-owned to user-owned networks. In that world, AI gives us the intelligence to act. Crypto gives us the structure to coordinate. And what we build on top will redefine how people interact, earn and create online. If crypto gave us digital property rights, AI gives us digital labor. The combination isn’t just powerful, it’s inevitable – a nd we’re still early. Harrison Hines is the CEO and founder of Fleek , an agentic cloud platform that gives developers and creators the tools to create, manage and monetize AI agents and virtual influencers. Before launching Fleek, Harrison founded Token Foundry at ConsenSys and has spent the past eight-plus years building in the blockchain and Web 3.0 space, now focused on the next evolution of the web – virtual influencers .

Some analysts suggest that holding its current range could send the cryptocurrency to a another retest of its historical $420 resistance. Related Reading: Bitcoin Rise To $111,000 ATH Doesn’t Mean The Market Is Bullish, Certified Expert Says Monero Bounces From Range Lows Amid the crypto market pullback, Monero led the top 100 tokens by market capitalization list with a double-digit jump in the past 24 hours. The cryptocurrency surged 11.5% on Monday morning, breaking out of its seven-day downtrend. Notably, XMR has seen a 66% price increase over the past month and a half, jumping from the $220 support zone to its current levels. The token registered a significant 55% daily increase at the end of April, touching the $340 mark before retracing. The surge was reportedly fueled by a “suspicious transfer” of 3,520 BTC, worth around $330.7 million, from a potential victim of social engineering. According to crypto sleuth ZachXBT, the stolen funds were swapped for XMR, leading cryptocurrency to retest a key horizontal level. Despite this, the privacy token continued its rally during the May market recovery, which propelled XMR to a four-year high a week ago, nearing the crucial $420 resistance for the first time since 2021. Now, the market’s recent performance has sent Monero alongside the rest of the leading cryptocurrencies to retest key levels. The token retraced 21% in the past week, briefly losing its three-week price range on Saturday. However, XMR has bounced from this level over the past two days after reclaiming the $325 mark and nearing the $370 resistance. XMR Rally Hangs On This Level Analyst Sjuul from AltCryptoGems affirmed that “Monero has an impressive chart and is likely one of the few ‘dino’ coins not far from breaking its all-time high.” He highlighted that XMR is retesting the recently flipped support and resistance zone, which is key for a rally continuation. Losing the $310-$345 area could send the cryptocurrency toward the gap between this level and the next major support around the $220 mark. Similarly, analyst Rekt Capital previously noted Monero repeated its early 2021 playbook after breaking out of its multi-year accumulation range in Q4 2024, surging above the $286 resistance and hitting last cycle’s high levels. He recently pointed out that XMR has historically ended its bull market around the key $422 resistance, with “this sort of price action for XMR occurs once every four years,” and price rallies into the major resistance “often briefly upside wicking beyond there.” Related Reading: $3 XRP Dream Delayed—No Bull Run Before November, Says Top Analyst Amid its recent rejection from the $419 cycle high, the analyst considers that Monero must hold its current range, “if price wants to go against the grain of history and break the $422 resistance over time.” If it fails to hold above the $300 mark, Rekt Capital affirmed that the $286 support is the next crucial level, but added that historically, XMR’s retest post-rejection usually fails. As of this writing, Monero trades at $366, a 32.2% increase in the monthly timeframe.

HYPE is the native token of the Hyperliquid decentralized exchange. This news sparked a rally, pushing HYPE over 6% in the past 24 hours. Although the listing update did not share many details, and it’s unclear when HYPE will go live, still, the news is considered bullish for the token. The $HYPE is real.

Follow us to get notified when our new listing goes live. pic.twitter.com/CrpenFv2uh — Binance.US (@BinanceUS) June 2, 2025 Research from 0xMether shows that when tokens get listed on Binance spot markets, they typically jump an average of 63.6% in price (with a median increase of 26%) and keep a strong 29.2% gain even after 7 days. Therefore, a Binance spot listing typically results in a major price increase for tokens like Hyperliquid (HYPE). Hyperliquid’s Breakout Month: Record Volumes and Whale Trades Hyperliquid has been gaining market strength lately. It recently beat dYdX’s trading volume and passed Sui’s market cap days later. Later, after a trading surge spared by whale James Wynn, the market reached $8.6 billion in daily volume last week. Perpetual DEX volume has exploded in two years from $40.7B in May 2023 to $382.3B in May 2025. Hyperliquid alone handled $264B in May 2025, beating last year’s entire perpetual DEX market by $30B. May was a record month for Hyperliquid, with buybacks up 63% to $67.6M thanks to big trades, a Bitcoin rally that stirred market action, and the platform hit record-high fees. Just recently, Binance Futures launched the HYPEUSDT perpetual contract on May 30. Criticism Over Binance Listing However, there were some criticisms of this move. Some community members were skeptical of the recent tension between the two companies, where Binance was accused of making the JELLYJELLY short squeeze on Hyperliquid worse, which caused bigger losses for the platform. One user shared that they don’t get why Binance US is listing Hyperliquid now. After openly criticizing Hyperliquid, this move might attract more attention from regulators. Some users are even accusing Binance and Hyperliquid of working against each other, but there has been no proof. Who Will List First? The community awaits further details on the listing. HYPE’s price rise is boosting the platform’s momentum. It remains to be seen who lists HYPE spot first in the U.S.: Kraken, Binance US, or Coinbase. One social media user also pointed out that Binance followed Coinbase in listing HYPE perpetual contracts just one day later.

With $321 million in inflows in the past seven days, Ethereum extended its winning streak to six consecutive weeks. This brings the total for this timeframe to $1.19 billion, the most since December 2024, which reflected “a decisive improvement in sentiment” according to CoinShares. Digital Asset AUM Drops Despite Ethereum’s Inflow Streak According to the latest edition of the ‘Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly Report ,’ digital asset investment products recorded $286 million in inflows last week, which extended their seven-week streak to $10.9 billion. However, total assets under management dropped from $187 billion to $177 billion due to market volatility spurred by U.S. tariff concerns. Bitcoin started the week with solid inflows, but momentum shifted mid-week after a New York Court ruled US tariffs illegal, leading to $8 million in outflows by week’s end – the first dip after six straight weeks of $9.6 billion inflows. Meanwhile, there were $3.6 million in outflows from short Bitcoin funds last week, suggesting traders are less confident that BTC will fall. Ethereum dominated inflows this week, but Sui, Solana, and Chainlink also saw modest gains of $2.2 million, $1.5 million, and $0.8 million, respectively, while Cardano posted a minor $0.1 million in weekly inflows. On the other hand, XRP led the outflows this week, shedding over $28 million. Multi-asset investment products also saw $2.4 million in outflows during the same period. Investor Focus Diversifies Investor attention slightly shifted away from the United States, though it still brought in $199 million in inflows last week. Germany followed with $42.9 million, and Australia attracted $21.5 million. Hong Kong stood out, recording its highest weekly inflow – $54.8 million – since the launch of its exchange-traded products over a year ago. Canada settled for $4.5 million in inflows. The same cannot be said for Switzerland, which bucked the trend, as it faced $32.8 million in outflows, which made it one of the few countries with net outflows so far this year.

Reuters reported Wednesday that the leak originated from TaskUs, a US-based outsourcing provider with operations in India. A female employee at the company’s Indore office was allegedly caught photographing her work computer with a personal mobile phone. Former TaskUs employees were either briefed on the breach by company investigators or learned of it from coworkers who witnessed the incident. Coinbase, reportedly, was notified immediately. Coinbase didn’t return Cryptonews’ request for comment by press time. Mass Firing at TaskUs Follows Breach Tied to Coinbase Hack The woman and a suspected accomplice were accused of selling Coinbase customer data to hackers in exchange for bribes. The breach, which was first made public in a May 14 SEC filing, compromised the information of nearly 70,000 users. Stolen data included customer names, phone numbers, addresses, ID documents, account balances and transaction history. Internal company documents were also accessed. More than 200 TaskUs employees were reportedly fired in the aftermath, a mass termination that drew local press coverage in India. TaskUs confirmed that two employees were dismissed early in the year for illegally accessing client data, though the company did not name Coinbase. Coinbase is facing at least six class-action lawsuits after a major data breach involving bribed overseas support staff. #coinbase #lawsuit https://t.co/d8dVrvb7zF — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 19, 2025 Coinbase Cut Ties With Overseas Agents After Vendor Breach Coinbase, in its May SEC filing, admitted that contractors had accessed internal employee data without a business need in “previous months.” However, it said the breach only became apparent after it received an extortion demand on May 11. The hackers allegedly demanded $20m in exchange for not leaking the stolen data. Coinbase refused to pay the ransom and instead announced a $20m bounty for information leading to those responsible. In response, Coinbase said it terminated the TaskUs personnel involved, cut ties with other overseas agents, and implemented tighter controls. It has not publicly named the other foreign agents implicated. The data breach, which began with unauthorized access in Dec. 2024, shows growing concerns over the security of outsourced customer support operations. Coinbase has estimated the financial fallout from the incident could fall between $180m and $400m. The exchange is now dealing with investor lawsuits alleging they incurred substantial losses and damages because of the company’s misleading statements.

The agency recently invited public feedback on a rule change that could allow in-kind redemptions for the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund, while also releasing updated guidance suggesting certain crypto staking services may not be classified as securities. The moves have drawn sharp criticism from former SEC officials and current commissioners alike, raising questions about legal consistency and the Commission’s evolving role in digital asset oversight. SEC Seeks Public Input on In-Kind Redemptions for WisdomTree Bitcoin ETF The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has launched a formal review process and is inviting public commentary on whether to permit in-kind creations and redemptions for the WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund (BTCW), a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approved earlier this year. The move signals a potential shift in regulatory posture toward more flexible and crypto-native ETF structures, but for now, the agency is asking stakeholders to weigh in. The SEC’s call for public feedback, issued Monday, follows previous delays and open-ended inquiries concerning in-kind redemptions for a number of major crypto funds, including BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), the VanEck Bitcoin Trust, and the VanEck Ethereum Trust. “Institution of proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change,” the SEC wrote in its notice. “Institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved.” The Commission is now giving the public 21 days to submit written comments, data, or arguments for or against allowing in-kind transactions for BTCW. The period offers a rare opportunity for both institutional and retail investors, crypto advocates, and regulatory experts to shape how the next wave of crypto ETFs are structured. Currently, most approved crypto ETFs, including BTCW, operate under a cash creation and redemption model. This means that when an investor wants to redeem shares, they receive US dollars rather than the actual underlying asset, Bitcoin, in this case. In contrast, in-kind redemptions allow investors to receive the underlying asset itself, a key feature of many traditional commodity ETFs, such as those tracking gold. This mechanism offers notable advantages: Tax efficiency for investors through avoidance of taxable events until sale. Lower transaction costs by minimizing intermediary conversions between Bitcoin and USD. Operational benefits for issuers, particularly those with on-chain capabilities. However, the SEC has long been hesitant to allow in-kind processes for crypto ETFs due to concerns about custody, market manipulation, and the regulatory status of crypto-native infrastructure. WisdomTree’s ETF Journey WisdomTree’s spot Bitcoin ETF , launched in January 2024, was one of several spot products approved after years of rejection by the SEC. Its approval was seen as a landmark event following Grayscale’s legal victory over the SEC in 2023, which compelled the agency to reconsider its hardline stance on spot Bitcoin ETFs. The current debate over in-kind redemptions is likely the next major battleground in the maturation of Bitcoin ETFs. A shift toward approving such mechanisms could pave the way for more efficient fund operations and greater institutional involvement in the crypto space. It would also reduce reliance on fiat settlements, aligning these products more closely with the ethos of decentralization and digital asset mobility. Industry leaders have advocated strongly for this change. BlackRock, in particular, has been vocal in its requests for in-kind permissions, suggesting that current cash-only models are suboptimal and inconsistent with traditional ETF standards. The SEC’s decision to formally institute proceedings, rather than approve or deny the request outright, indicates that the agency is seeking to build a robust legal and public record before issuing a final verdict. This approach mirrors its process during the spot ETF approval saga, in which waves of public commentary, institutional lobbying, and judicial pressure eventually influenced regulatory direction. If approved, WisdomTree’s BTCW could become one of the first US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs to offer redemptions in actual Bitcoin — a feature that has been long sought after by crypto-native investors and fund managers alike. A Decision with Broader Ramifications Should the SEC approve in-kind transactions for BTCW, it would likely set a precedent for other issuers, including BlackRock, VanEck, and Fidelity, all of whom have expressed interest in similar capabilities. Moreover, the implications go beyond Bitcoin. Ethereum ETFs, which are still under review, could benefit from the framework set by BTCW’s outcome, potentially enabling a new generation of physically settled digital asset ETFs. As the 21-day window for public comment opens, the SEC is positioning itself to make one of the most consequential ETF-related decisions since the initial wave of spot approvals. SEC Faces Internal and External Firestorm Over Staking Guidance Shift Meanwhile, controversy erupted following new guidance issued by the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance on May 29, which stated that some crypto staking offerings may not qualify as securities under the Securities Act. The updated stance effectively provides relief to proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains and opens a new chapter in the SEC’s evolving approach to digital asset regulation. While the guidance was framed as an effort to provide clarity, critics argue it’s anything but. Among the harshest critics is John Reed Stark, former chief of the SEC’s Office of Internet Enforcement, who unleashed a scathing critique on social media. In a lengthy post on X, Stark accused the agency of undermining its core mission of investor protection. “This is how the SEC dies – in plain view,” Stark wrote. “It’s a shameful abdication of its investor protection mission and a betrayal of its proud 90-year legacy.” Stark emphasized that the SEC’s new position directly contradicts federal court rulings in high-profile cases against Binance and Coinbase, in which judges acknowledged that staking programs could indeed be treated as securities offerings under the Howey test, the foundational legal standard used to define securities. While the Coinbase case had been allowed to proceed in March 2024, it was later dismissed in February 2025, a shift many saw as foreshadowing the SEC’s new guidance. Similarly, the SEC’s lawsuit against Binance's staking program was dismissed with prejudice in May 2025, barring the agency from refiling the case, a ruling that marked a symbolic defeat for the regulator’s aggressive stance on staking. Internal Divide: SEC Commissioners at Odds The regulatory turmoil is not limited to external voices. Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw, a sitting member of the SEC, issued a sharply worded dissent in response to the May 29 guidance, arguing that the new interpretation does not align with legal precedent. “The staff’s analysis may reflect what some wish the law to be,” Crenshaw said, “but it does not square with the court decisions on staking and the longstanding Howey precedent on which they are based.” Crenshaw further warned that the SEC's recent actions are part of a broader trend of policy inconsistency and regulatory retreat. “This is yet another example of the SEC’s ongoing ‘fake it till we make it’ approach to crypto — taking action based on anticipation of future changes while ignoring existing law.” Her statement echoes a growing concern that the agency is attempting to rewrite policy through enforcement discretion, a practice that could lead to a ”regulatory vacuum” where market participants are left to guess what rules apply. Over the past six months, the SEC has adopted what many in the industry see as a deregulatory posture toward digital assets. In addition to dropping several lawsuits and investigations, the agency has hosted multiple closed-door roundtables with industry stakeholders aimed at ”collaborative rulemaking.” Critics like Stark have described this shift as a “crypto-deregulatory blitzkrieg” — a rapid pivot that not only contradicts prior agency enforcement actions but also risks undermining the SEC’s credibility with courts and investors alike. Regulatory Contradictions and Token Classification Confusion The May 29 guidance has also reignited a key debate over the classification of specific crypto assets. Commissioner Crenshaw pointed to a pattern of inconsistency in the SEC’s treatment of assets like Ether (ETH) and Solana (SOL). “How is it that these crypto assets are supposedly not securities when it comes to registration requirements, but conveniently are securities when a registrant sees an opportunity to sell a new product?” she asked. These comments reflect ongoing frustration over the SEC’s lack of clear standards for asset classification, a problem that has plagued U.S. crypto regulation for years. Not everyone at the Commission shares these concerns. At the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, Commissioner Hester Peirce, widely known as “Crypto Mom” for her pro-innovation stance, defended the agency’s approach. “Most crypto assets, as we see them today, are probably not themselves securities,” Peirce said. “That doesn’t mean that you can’t sell a token that is not itself a security in a transaction that is a securities transaction.” Peirce emphasized that the SEC’s focus should be on the structure of the offering, not the underlying asset — a nuanced legal position that she argues requires contextual, rather than categorical, regulation. Her comments, though more tempered, align with the growing industry consensus that transaction-level guidance is essential to resolving the murky legal landscape surrounding staking and token offerings. A Divided Commission, A Fragmented Framework As it stands, the SEC appears increasingly divided on crypto policy, with Commissioners Peirce and Crenshaw representing opposing philosophical camps: one advocating for principle-based innovation, the other warning of legal overreach and dilution of the Commission’s regulatory responsibilities. In the meantime, crypto companies are left in regulatory limbo, unsure whether future products involving staking — such as staking-as-a-service, validator pooling, or liquid staking tokens — will require registration, trigger enforcement, or receive a green light under the new interpretation. For institutional investors and retail users alike, the shifting regulatory landscape creates significant uncertainty.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-03 05:30:00

Bitcoin Has Been Following In Gold’s Footsteps on 2-Day Timeframe Last year, Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards shared in an X post how Bitcoin was following the same structure as the Gold all-time high (ATH). Below is the chart that the analyst posted back then. From the graph, it’s visible that BTC was consolidating at its 2021 ATH in a manner similar to Gold’s movement around the 1980 ATH. The latter’s consolidation ended with it breaking out and rallying to a point two times higher. Related Reading: Solana Down 13%, But This Indicator Just Turned Bullish In a new post, Edwards has shared a late update on how things ended up playing out for Bitcoin. As the consolidation around the respective ATHs already hinted, there indeed ended up being some similarity between the breakouts for the prices of the two assets as well. But this is all in the past, where does the latest Bitcoin price action stack up against Gold? Here is another chart posted by the analyst, highlighting the point BTC is currently at: As Edwards has highlighted in the graph, BTC’s breakout since the consolidation phase around the ATH has continued to resemble Gold’s, except for the fact that BTC’s volatility has been roughly twice as high, in terms of both upward and downward moves. That said, the cryptocurrency’s latest close has looked less promising than what the precious metal displayed at a similar stage in its structure. It’s possible that the two could diverge from here, but in the case that they don’t, Gold’s path may provide a glimpse into what could lie ahead for the coin. As is apparent from the chart, the traditional safe-haven asset saw a significant surge from this point. Based on this, the analyst has noted, “close back above $110K and this will probably go bananas.” It now remains to be seen how things would play out for Bitcoin in the near future.

In a Monday blog post, the company announced it was restructuring to focus on its design challenges . It commented: We must rethink our current approach to designing, developing, and stewarding the protocol. This means some members of PR&D won’t be continuing with the Ethereum Foundation. Still, the firm expressed confidence that they will remain active within the Ethereum ecosystem and encouraged other projects to consider them for new opportunities. Ethereum Foundation rebrands R&D division to Protocol Aside from laying off some of its members, the foundation is rebranding its Protocol Research and Development division, renaming it to just “Protocol.” With the rebrand, the foundation hopes to focus on its new priorities: scaling the Ethereum base layer and blobspace and improving user experience. It has called on all teams within Protocol to help drive these initiatives forward. The Foundation emphasizes that the rebrand was completely necessary, seeing how their work in zero-knowledge rollups (zkEVMs) and layer-2 technologies is pushing the blockchain closer to large-scale adoption. While the foundation has yet to disclose how many staff members it laid off, it insisted that the new team will continue to lead Ethereum’s core development and improve public access to upgrade schedules, technical resources, and research outputs. Hsiao-Wei Weng, co-executive director at Ethereum Foundation, also shared on X that he hopes the new structure will encourage their staff to focus and drive key initiatives forward. Additionally, he acknowledged Tim Beiko, Alex Stokes, and Barnabé Monnot for their work in restructuring the Protocol team. The Ethereum Foundation has been instituting changes to its leadership and structure The Ethereum Foundation has been making changes to its structure and leadership since the start of the year. In January, Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin announced the model’s leadership reforms , arguing that they needed to address key challenges stalling the platform’s competitiveness. At the time, he claimed the EF would aim to improve communication with ecosystem stakeholders and ensure privacy, open-source innovation, and censorship resistance. Moreover, he argued that the leadership changes would bring fresh talent, improve execution ability, and make EF more actively supportive of app builders. However, his announcement was soon followed by internal friction and heated discussions over the foundation’s strategic priorities and transparency standards . Some critics even pointed out the foundation’s failure to improve transaction speeds or draw in more developers compared to rival Solana. The foundation also faced complaints about its high transaction fees, stalled expansion, and leadership stagnation. The foundation added a division between its board and executive functions in April. A month before that, the EF made Hsiao-Wei Wang, a longtime Ethereum researcher, and Tomasz Stańczak, CEO of infrastructure company Nethermind, its new co-executive directors.

XRP’s price is currently trading in a tight consolidation range — often a technical precursor to breakouts — while consistent spot buying pressure adds to the bullish sentiment. Historically, similar setups in XRP have resulted in rapid rallies, catching short sellers off guard and triggering short squeezes. Yet, while the elevated open interest signals anticipation, the direction of the next big move remains far from certain. However, without a decisive catalyst, Lee warned, such high levels of open interest could also amplify volatility, with traders at risk of large-scale liquidations if sentiment turns sour. “Without a clear catalyst, such elevated open interest could exacerbate volatility in either direction,” Lee explained. “A bullish surge may trigger a short squeeze, while an influx of profit-taking or macro-driven risk-off sentiment could fuel liquidations and downside pressure.” Market watchers are closely monitoring developments around the XRP Ledger (XRPL), which could serve as a fundamental catalyst, as well as any ETF-related momentum that may emerge from institutional interest.",Markets|Ripple|XRP|market analysis|News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|WALLET|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-03 05:35:02

In the video, Schwartz stated that banks are “very slow movers” and explained Ripple’s growing frustration with their limited willingness to innovate. The post emphasized Ripple’s ambition to reshape cross-border finance and highlighted the perceived limitations of working with established financial institutions. The Limitations of Bank Partnerships Schwartz described banks as reluctant and conservative players in the financial technology space. He stated, “It’s very sexy when you close a deal with the bank, you know, and we do that sometimes, but they’re very slow movers.” He explained that while partnerships with banks were initially a strategic focus for Ripple, the practical outcomes have not always aligned with the company’s long-term goals. According to Schwartz, one of the main challenges in working with banks is their hesitation to innovate. “They’re very slow to execute, they’re very conservative. They’re never going to be Ripple’s success stories,” he said. He noted that banks often resist passing technological benefits on to their customers due to the exposure of internal inefficiencies, as XRP usually removes unnecessary friction from traditional systems. There have been recent calls from the community for Ripple and XRP to take over SWIFT’s role , as it fixes the problems of the legacy system. However, a partnership with Ripple would be an admission by SWIFT of its inefficiencies. Ripple Shifts Focus to Scalable Adoption Schwartz emphasized that although Ripple once prioritized bank-related announcements for public relations purposes, the company has since shifted its focus. “We focused a lot on banks in the beginning just because a press release with a bank is a big thing,” he acknowledged. However, he indicated that Ripple’s priorities have evolved. “Now we’re like, hey, like, we want to, like, move billions of dollars now, and they’re like, yeah, we kind of don’t.” His comments underline Ripple’s increasing emphasis on real-world adoption and scalability over symbolic partnerships.

The Vision for XRP Schwartz’s statements point to Ripple’s long-term vision for the XRP ecosystem. His focus on scalability, inefficiencies in traditional systems, and the need for execution-ready partners reinforces the company’s core direction and desire to move billions of dollars with XRP. Banks are still working with Ripple, as recent reports suggest banks across the globe are building on the XRP Ledger . However, Ripple’s approach enables purpose-driven partnerships and increased adoption of XRP for real-world utility.

Analysts say Ethereum’s breakout versus Bitcoin could trigger a 250x altcoin market rally, with ETH/BTC forming bullish cup-and-handle patterns targeting 55% upside. Bitcoin Pepe raises $13.6m in its extended presale, timing perfectly with the altcoin rotation as the world’s first Bitcoin Layer 2 meme ICO prepares massive exchange announcements for June 17th The altcoin rotation everyone has been waiting for has just kicked into gear. Bitcoin’s stranglehold on the market is cracking. Ethereum just posted its first positive monthly return in 2025, rallying 46% in May as institutional money floods back into altcoins. Meanwhile, whale addresses holding between 10K-100K ETH grew their holdings by a massive 1.4 million ETH during the month—the largest monthly whale buying pressure since July 2022. Institutional investors poured $494 million into Ethereum ETFs during May—nine straight days of buying that shows they’re betting big on higher prices. ETH/BTC breakout signals massive altcoin explosion incoming Ethereum is forming some interesting patterns that historically precede massive altcoin runs. When you look at the ETH/BTC chart, it’s showing patterns that historically appear right before major altcoin rallies begin. When Ethereum starts outperforming Bitcoin, it signals that investors are rotating money out of Bitcoin and into alternative cryptocurrencies. Above : ETH/BTC ratio breaks higher, which may stimulate a huge altcoin season soon. Source : TradingView . Analyst Trader Tardigrade believes Ethereum’s breakout versus Bitcoin could initiate the altseason in 2025, taking cues from periods when Ether’s outperformance versus Bitcoin has coincided with massive rallies in the altcoin market, namely the 2,500%-plus gains during the 2020-2021 crypto bull market. $ETHBTC is forming a Bullish Cup and Handle pattern A breakout could kick off #Altseason in 2025 pic.twitter.com/70rrxzw2Bu — Trader Tardigrade (@TATrader_Alan) May 31, 2025 The technical analysis suggests this rotation could push Ethereum 30-55% higher against Bitcoin over the next few months. History shows that when ETH’s strength builds versus Bitcoin in such a way, smaller projects like Bitcoin Pepe emerge as the best crypto to buy now. Solana is also flashing buy signals while testing the critical $159 support level. As long as Solana holds above the $159 support level, the asset maintains a structurally bullish outlook. The TD Sequential indicator just flashed a buy signal—typically seen during final retracement stages before new impulses begin. With this technical backdrop in place, the question becomes which assets are positioned to capture the most upside. History shows that infrastructure plays and established ecosystems with real utility, they tend to lead during these rotations. Three projects stand out amid this context: Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP): The Bitcoin infrastructure play hitting at the perfect time Bitcoin Pepe is tackling something no one else has figured out—bringing meme coin trading to Bitcoin’s ecosystem. Most projects try to compete with Bitcoin; BPEP extends it by building a layer 2 that delivers Solana-speed transactions on the world’s most secure network. The project recently extended its presale to lock in additional tier 1 exchange partnerships. All existing investors get a 30% token bonus, and major announcements drop June 17th. Smart timing, considering altcoin season momentum is building. Think about what this solves. Bitcoin has $2 trillion in value but processes seven transactions per second. Meanwhile, meme coins need fast, cheap transactions to go viral. Bitcoin Pepe’s PEP-20 standard bridges that gap—thousands of transactions per second while settling on Bitcoin. The team’s already secured numerous partnerships, such as Plena Finance for mobile DeFi, GETE Network for gaming infrastructure, and BE__TV for viral content distribution. They’re building actual use cases rather than launching into the void. All staking pools sold out completely, with the top tier hitting 10,000% APY. That’s serious demand from investors who see what’s coming. Currently at $0.0396 with $13.6m raised, the window closing before June 17th potentially changes the game for Bitcoin meme trading. Ethereum (ETH): The altseason catalyst with institutional backing Ethereum is leading the altcoin charge. As the infrastructure layer for most DeFi, NFTs, and altcoins, ETH benefits when any part of the ecosystem grows. It’s the ‘picks and shovels’ play for altcoin season. Currently trading around $2,500 after hitting resistance at $2,750, Ethereum is holding key support levels that often precede major moves higher. The whale accumulation data is also strong, with 1.4 million ETH added to large wallets, indicating a serious level of conviction among prolific traders. ETF flows also contribute to the alt season narrative. When BlackRock and friends start buying and holding instead of trading, it removes supply from circulation permanently. That’s the foundation for sustained altcoin runs—reduced selling pressure from Bitcoin’s biggest competitor. Solana (SOL): The performance powerhouse ready for meme season Solana’s quietly building the foundation for its next explosive move. Trading around $153 after testing $180 resistance, SOL is holding critical support levels while accumulating energy for the next leg up. The chart just flashed a buy signal right at the $159 support level—a compelling risk-reward setup. Volume’s picking up during recent weakness, suggesting smart money is accumulating while retail investors panic. What makes Solana essential for altcoin season is simple: speed and cost. The network processes thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees, making it the preferred platform for meme coin launches and DeFi protocols that explode during bull markets. If SOL breaks back above $180, the technical target points toward previous highs above $200. It’s positioned to profit from several altcoin season trends as it serves as both an infrastructure play and the hub for meme coin trading. Positioning for the rotation This setup doesn’t come around often. ETH whales are accumulating, technical patterns are breaking bullish, and infrastructure projects like Bitcoin Pepe are positioning themselves perfectly for the altcoin surge. When altcoin seasons hit, they move quickly. The projects that capture the most upside are usually the ones with clear catalysts, real utility, and timing that aligns with market momentum. Bitcoin Pepe checks all three boxes. The presale window is closing fast, with multiple tier 1 exchanges already locked in for launch day. Bitcoin Pepe has raised $13.6m and counting, but the June 17th announcement will be when this project truly explodes into mainstream crypto consciousness. Right now, you’re still early. Most retail investors haven’t discovered the world’s first Bitcoin layer 2 meme project. But when those exchange announcements hit and people realize what BPEP actually solves—bringing meme coin speed to Bitcoin’s ecosystem—these presale prices become a distant memory.

In a June 3 press release , the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) stated that crypto ATM operators must now implement a cash deposit and withdrawal cap of 5,000 Australian dollars (approximately $3,250). Operators must also display scam warning messages at machines to alert users about potential fraud . In addition, ATM providers are now required to conduct more thorough customer checks and enhance their transaction monitoring for suspicious activity. “These conditions are designed to help protect individuals from scams and businesses from criminal exploitation,” AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said in a statement. “In light of the risks and harms we consider it is absolutely necessary to ensure the sector meets minimum standards and reduces the criminal misuse of crypto ATMs,” he added. The new rules come as part of an enforcement initiative following an AUSTRAC taskforce investigation into crypto ATM usage across the country. The task force analyzed data from nine providers and found that individuals aged over 50 accounted for nearly 72% of all transaction value, with those aged 60 to 70 making up 29% alone. You might also like: Australia cracks down on crypto ATM providers over anti-money laundering rule compliance The agency also refused to renew the registration of one operator, Harro’s Empires, citing ongoing risks of misuse. It warned that other digital currency exchange providers failing to meet their obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act could face similar consequences. Although the current cash limit applies only to crypto ATM providers, AUSTRAC urged all exchanges accepting cash to consider adopting similar thresholds to reduce exposure to financial crime risks. In collaboration with the Australian Federal Police-led Joint Policing Cybercrime Coordination Centre (JPC3), AUSTRAC has also developed educational materials that will be placed near ATMs to alert users about common scam tactics, warning signs, and how to report suspicious activity. The announcement follows AUSTRAC’s warnings earlier this year, when it cautioned crypto ATM providers that non-compliance with AML/CTF rules would lead to legal action. At the time, AUSTRAC said it had already been working with industry participants since December 2024 to improve standards across the growing network of machines. Authorities highlighted that some Australians had lost their life savings after being directed to crypto ATMs by scammers. With most machines accepting only cash for Bitcoin purchases, officials say this raises significant risks of exploitation. Meanwhile, in a separate June 3 report , the Australian Federal Police reported 150 scam-related cases involving crypto ATMs between January 2024 and January 2025, with losses exceeding 3.1 million Australian dollars. Authorities believe the actual number may be higher, as many victims are either unaware they’ve been defrauded or are hesitant to come forward. As of last check, Australia is home to over 1,800 crypto ATMs, a dramatic rise from just 23 machines in 2019. According to AUSTRAC, nearly 150,000 transactions occur annually through these machines, moving an estimated $275 million in cash, with Bitcoin, Tether, and Ether being the primary assets purchased.

At least one part of the breach, publicly disclosed in a May 14 SEC filing, occurred when an India-based employee of the U.S. outsourcing firm TaskUs ( NASDAQ: TASK ) was caught taking photographs of her work computer with her personal phone, according to five former TaskUs employees, the report said. The ex-employees said they were briefed on the matter by company investigators or colleagues who witnessed the incident in the Indian city of Indore, noting that the woman and a suspected accomplice were alleged to have been feeding Coinbase ( COIN ) customer information to hackers in return for bribes. The ex-employees and person familiar with the matter said more than 200 TaskUs ( TASK ) employees were soon fired in a mass layoff that drew Indian media attention. Coinbase had previously blamed ""support agents overseas"" for the breach, which it estimated could cost up to $400 million.

Binance Listing? Not Until These Issues are Fixed Some Pi users were excited over the possible listing, but many voiced strong frustrations. According to some users, a listing should not happen until ongoing KYC issues are fixed. Users are not able to transfer their Pi because people in their security circles haven’t passed KYC, even after completing it. This is a common bug that the community wants fixed before any listings. Do You Want to See $Pi Listed on #Binance ? A) YES B) NO Honest answers — Pi News (@PiListingNews) June 1, 2025 Users note that some KYC cases are delayed because fewer people are joining the Pi Validation Program, which needs multiple validators per KYC. One user said his friends did KYC years ago but still weren’t approved, locking 75% of his Pi. He tried the validation program but gave up after waiting a long time. He thinks the system is legit but not fully efficient. Is Pi Doing It On Purpose? One user even said that Pi might be delaying KYC on purpose to keep people’s tokens locked. When the user questioned it, he got muted, and he blamed the moderators for not allowing any criticism. There were also claims that Pi locked up their tokens unfairly despite being an early miner. One user claimed that he lost 2,500 Pi just for missing a deadline. Pi’s Security Concerns Users also note that the wallet system needs serious upgrades and that tokens were locked without their consent. A few even warned Binance to be cautious, fearing the project might vanish once people start buying Pi. While newer projects like Bondex are getting listed on Binance, some are confused why Pi still is not listed despite Pi’s massive community. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Binance’s CZ Calls for Dark Pool DEX After $100M Hyperliquid Liquidation , Pi To Hit All-time Low?

Failure to do so resulted in the loss of a significant portion of their Pi holdings. Users have also called out the lack of transparency, wallet security concerns, and community management issues.

Bitstamp generated $95 million in revenue over the past year, and will now integrate with Robinhood’s systems including its Legend platform and Smart Exchange Routing. This follows Robinhood’s May announcement to acquire Canadian platform WonderFi. Meanwhile, FalconX recently acquired a majority stake in Monarq Asset Management, formerly linked to FTX, to scale its institutional asset management services. In the NFT space, Orange Cap Games acquired the Moonbirds, Mythics, and Oddities collections from Yuga Labs, tripling Moonbirds' floor price post-announcement. Robinhood Completes Bitstamp Acquisition Robinhood Markets, Inc. officially completed its $200 million acquisition of Bitstamp, a Luxembourg-based cryptocurrency exchange. The deal was initially announced in June 2024, and was paid entirely in cash. It also adds a set of over 50 licenses and registrations to Robinhood’s expanding crypto operations. Bitstamp serves more than 5,000 institutional clients and around 50,000 retail users, which greatly strengthens Robinhood’s global presence by opening access to markets in Europe, the UK, and Asia. Bitstamp’s trading activity is predominantly driven by institutional clients, which aligns perfectly with Robinhood's strategic ambitions. The acquisition also brings a sizable operational boost as Bitstamp recorded $95 million in revenue over the past 12 months leading up to April 30, while Robinhood’s crypto division reported $252 million in Q1 2025 alone. Robinhood said it has already started integrating Bitstamp into its broader ecosystem, with the exchange platform now linked to Robinhood Legend and its Smart Exchange Routing system. The company expects to incur approximately $65 million in related costs over the rest of 2025 as the integration progresses. Robinhood’s crypto expansion doesn’t stop there. On May 13, the company announced its agreement to acquire Canadian crypto platform WonderFi for approximately $179 million. Robinhood Crypto general manager Johann Kerbrat explained that more acquisitions could be on the table if they offer a pathway to accelerate development timelines by 18 to 24 months. Robinhood share price over the past 24 hours (Source: Google Finance ) Shares of Robinhood (HOOD) responded positively to the developments by closing up 2.77% at $67.98 on June 2, with a further 0.90% gain in after-hours trading. CEO Vladimir Tenev also believes that tokenization of real-world assets, particularly private equities, will be a major focus for Robinhood moving forward. According to Tenev, tokenizing assets like OpenAI and SpaceX shares could drastically simplify and speed up secondary market transactions, and could potentially unlock huge economic value for the crypto sector in the US. FalconX Acquires Stake in FTX-Linked Monarq Crypto prime brokerage FalconX also recently acquired a majority stake in the parent company of Monarq Asset Management, a Cayman Islands-registered hedge fund that was previously tied to the now-defunct FTX exchange. The deal was first reported by Bloomberg on June 2, and it forms part of FalconX’s growing push to broaden its asset management capabilities and deepen its reach into the institutional investor space. While the financial details of the acquisition were not shared, the strategic value lies in Monarq’s legacy infrastructure and client relationships. FalconX plans to leverage this to expand its services beyond its existing hedge fund and asset management clientele. Monarq Asset Management was formerly known as MNNC Group, and before that, it operated as LedgerPrime—once a key component of the FTX empire. The fund’s evolution was similar to the industry trend of firms distancing themselves from the fallout of FTX’s collapse while repurposing its assets and networks. FalconX’s acquisition happened at a time when it is actively scaling its operations. In January, the company acquired Arbelos Markets, a crypto derivatives startup. In May, it entered into a partnership with Standard Chartered to boost institutional crypto banking services. FalconX sees the Monarq acquisition as a means to grow its institutional offerings by scaling quantitative investment models and adding to its team’s capabilities. It also reflects a broader strategic vision of positioning FalconX as a full-service provider for institutional crypto exposure—combining execution, custody, and asset management under one roof. Despite its ambitious expansion, FalconX has faced regulatory scrutiny . In May of 2024, the firm agreed to pay $1.8 million in penalties and disgorgement to the US. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for failing to register appropriately. As part of the settlement, the company ceased offering services to US residents. FalconX website Nevertheless, FalconX continues to grow globally. It claims to be the largest digital asset prime brokerage in the world by facilitating over $1.5 trillion in trading volume and offering access to 94% of global digital asset liquidity. OCG Acquires Moonbirds from Yuga Labs Meanwhile, crypto gaming startup Orange Cap Games (OCG) acquired the intellectual property rights to the Ethereum-based Moonbirds NFT collection from Yuga Labs. The deal was announced on May 30, and it includes not just Moonbirds, but also its sister collections, Mythics and Oddities. Although the financial terms of the acquisition were not revealed, the move now positions OCG as the new custodian of a once-iconic NFT brand that has seen both dramatic highs and lows in market value. (Source: X ) Yuga Labs initially acquired these collections in February of 2023 as part of its acquisition of PROOF, the company behind Moonbirds. Since then, however, Yuga has been offloading several of its IP assets due to broader market shifts as NFT trading volumes stay low. Yuga co-founder Greg Solano commented on the decision, and explained that Moonbirds deserved a dedicated team. He also praised Orange Cap Games as an ideal steward to lead the brand into its next phase. Despite the sale, Moonbirds will still be featured in Yuga's Otherside metaverse, and any new on-chain assets developed by OCG will remain on Ethereum or migrate to Yuga’s ApeChain, a layer-2 network. The market reacted quickly to the news, with the floor price of Moonbirds tripling to 0.9 ETH after the announcement. Nonetheless, this is a far cry from its April 2022 peak of 38.5 ETH, which is a near 90+% drop from its all-time high. This sale is part of a larger divestiture by Yuga Labs. Earlier in May, the firm sold the rights to CryptoPunks to the Infinite Node Foundation, and in February, it parted with Meebits. Last year, Yuga also sold off IP rights to its gaming projects HV-MTL and Legends of the Mara. This strategic reorientation happened as the broader NFT sector shows signs of revival. According to recent market data , unique NFT buyers jumped 50% in May to 936,000, while trading volume rose by 15% to $430 million compared to April.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-03 06:01:38

Simultaneously, tensions between Washington and Beijing intensified after Trump claimed China had violated a trade agreement with the U.S. Markets now look forward to a potential meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping after the White House confirmed the two leaders are likely to speak later this week. On Monday, Russia and Ukraine held their second round of direct peace talks following a sharp escalation in hostilities the previous day, but the discussions yielded no significant progress in resolving the three-year-long conflict. Gold fell below $3,370 per ounce on Tuesday, pulling back from a near four-week high, as a slight bounce in the US dollar weighed on the metal. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.08% to above 37,600 on Tuesday, snapping a two-day decline. The Japanese yen weakened past 143 per dollar on Tuesday, snapping a three-day winning streak, even as Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda signaled a willingness to raise interest rates if economic and price momentum picks up. Ueda emphasized that Japan's economy is undergoing a moderate recovery, supported by solid business sentiment and improving corporate profits, despite some pockets of weakness. Ueda said the BOJ will review its bond tapering plans while considering feedback from bond market participants. Investors are now awaiting key labor market and household spending data later this week for further indications of Japan’s economic momentum. China ( SHCOMP ) rose 0.32% to above 3,350 while the Shenzhen Component gained 0.1% to 10,050 in post-holiday trade on Tuesday, recouping losses from the previous session despite soft economic data and renewed trade tensions with the U.S., and the offshore yuan strengthened to around 7.2 per dollar on Tuesday, reversing losses from the previous session, as investors shrugged off disappointing PMI data and renewed trade tensions with the U.S. A private survey showed China’s factory activity contracted at the fastest pace since September 2022 in May, weighed by weak output, new orders, and exports. Meanwhile, tensions rose after China denied US accusations of violating a temporary trade deal, instead blaming Washington for breaking the agreement, signaling worsening relations. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 1.22% to 23,512 in Tuesday morning trading, rebounding from losses in the prior session amid broad-based sector gains. India ( SENSEX ) fell 0.28% to 81,199, with the Nifty 50 falling below 24,700 in morning trade on Tuesday, marking the third consecutive session of declines amid weakness in the tech sector, consumer durables, and healthcare stocks, as traders remained cautious amid lingering global tariff concerns. Shares of India’s Adani Group fell between 0.7% and 2% after The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that US prosecutors were investigating whether Adani entities had imported Iranian LPG into India through their Mundra port. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick predicts a trade deal between the US and India could be reached soon, citing progress in negotiations and mutual benefits. He suggested early participants in such deals typically receive better deals. Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.60% to 8,470 on Tuesday, reaching its highest level in over three months, tracking a rebound on Wall Street. The Australian dollar weakened to around $0.647 on Tuesday, reversing sharp gains from the previous session, after Australia's central bank revealed it had considered an outsized rate cut last month. During its May policy meeting, the Australia central bank signaled that policymakers had considered a bold 50 bps cut as a form of ""insurance"" against mounting global trade risks, but ultimately opted for a more cautious 25 bps reduction to a two-year low of 3.85% in May. Separately, data showed that Australia’s current account deficit narrowed to AUD 14.7 billion in Q1 2025 from a revised AUD 16.3 billion in Q4 2024, albeit larger than market expectations of AUD 12 billion shortfall. Australia’s business inventories rose 0.8% quarter-on-quarter in Q1 2025, exceeding both market expectations and the previous quarter’s 0.2% increase. Corporate profits in Australia unexpectedly dropped by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) in Q1 2025, missing market forecasts of 1.1% growth and reversing an upwardly revised 6.0% expansion in Q4 2024. Australia's independent wage-setting body on Tuesday raised the national minimum wage by 3.5%, effective July 1, amid easing inflation. In the U.S., on Monday, all three major indexes ended higher as market sentiment steadied despite disappointing economic data and rising trade tensions. U.S. stock futures were little changed on Tuesday: Dow -0.34% ; S&P 500 -0.34% ; Nasdaq -0.35% .

The regulator, on Tuesday, refused to renew the registration of a local crypto ATM operator , Harro’s Empires. The agency placed operating conditions, including transaction limits, on them. “The conditions come after an AUSTRAC taskforce flagged worrying trends in crypto ATM compliance,” the announcement read. The regulator has imposed a A$5,000 ($3,233) limit on cash deposits and withdrawals, enhanced customer due diligence obligations, mandatory scam warnings, and requirements for more robust transaction monitoring. “In light of the risks and harms we consider it is absolutely necessary to ensure the sector meets minimum standards and reduces the criminal misuse of crypto ATMs.” Crypto ATMs Increased 15X in Two Years Per Coin ATM Radar , there are around 1,824 crypto ATMs across Australia, with the highest number of machines in Sydney. Australia has over 1,800 crypto ATMs. (Source: Coin ATM Radar) The national financial intelligence agency noted that Australia had only 23 operating crypto ATMs in 2019. Besides, the trend increased to 60 in 2022 and over 1,200 in 2024. “In just two years, the number of crypto ATMs in Australia increased more than 15 times,” the agency said. Further, Austrac projected that around 150,000 transactions occur annually, with A$275 million ($178 million) being moved using crypto ATMs. About 99% of those transactions are cash deposits for crypto purchases, mostly Bitcoin , Ethereum and Tether , it added. “I would warn anybody who is asked to use one of these machines to send funds to someone to stop and think twice, as once your money is gone, it is almost impossible for authorities to retrieve it,” said Austrac CEO Brendan Thomas. He added that the agency will continue to monitor the space and take more action if needed. Austrac Taskforce Uncovers “Disturbing Trends” According to Thomas, the Austrac taskforce has uncovered “disturbing trends,” after observing customer activity for several months. “Surprisingly, the 60 to 70 age group were identified as the one of the most prolific users of crypto ATMs in Australia,” he said. They account for 29% of all transactions by value. Besides, after reviewing 9 crypto kiosk providers, the majority of users are over 50 years of age and account for almost 72% of all transactions by value. Though the A$5,000 cash limits apply to crypto ATM operators, Austrac is also planning to apply similar limits to crypto exchanges if they accept cash for crypto transactions. “This will reduce their exposure to money laundering, terrorism financing and other serious crime risks,” said Thomas. Additionally, the Australian Federal Police’s JPC3, a joint policing cybercrime coordination centre, has come up with educational materials for users. These notices will be placed close to the kiosks, detailing how they work, warning signs, and how to report.

Digital asset researcher Anders posted an AI-generated summary that cited the location of Hidden Road’s headquarters at 589 5th Avenue in New York City, while noting its recent acquisition by Ripple for $1.25 billion. Anders asked: “Can someone confirm this, or did the AI go crazy?” The tweet included a screenshot that mentioned the headquarters’ address and Ripple’s acquisition details. It was quickly met with a reply from well-known trader Cobb (@Cobb_XRPL), who commented, “Just too many coincidences with Ripple and XRP man its driving me crazy.” Can someone confirm this, or did the AI go crazy? pic.twitter.com/94mx3ZILQP — Anders (@X__Anderson) May 30, 2025 The Legacy of 589 in the XRP Community The number 589 holds historical significance in the XRP ecosystem, often seen as a symbolic future price target despite its origins being unverified and largely based on community lore. The initial association of the number came from a viral meme suggesting that an episode of The Simpsons had predicted XRP would hit $589. While such an episode does not exist, the number “589” has remained embedded in XRP discussions as a representation of high expectations for the asset’s valuation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Acquisition of Hidden Road Adds New Fuel to the Theory This most recent mention of 589 in a corporate context—specifically tied to the location of a firm now acquired by Ripple—has prompted many to revisit the idea that the number may be more than symbolic. Hidden Road, a global prime brokerage firm that offers services in digital assets, OTC trading, FX, and derivatives, is reportedly now under Ripple’s ownership. The AI-generated information claimed the company is based at 589 5th Avenue, linking the symbolic number to an actual event involving Ripple. Cobb’s Numerology-Based Speculation on Ripple-Circle Deal In a separate post highlighted by Times Tabloid on May 20, Cobb previously tied the 589 number to another rumored strategic move by Ripple. In a tweet speculating about Ripple’s potential acquisition of Circle Internet Financial, the issuer of USDC, Cobb referenced a numerical equation involving the digits 5, 8, and 9, contributing further to the community’s focus on “589” as a signal of major developments. Although none of these references confirm a predetermined price target, the repetition of the 589 motif across various Ripple-related discussions and events continues to fuel speculation. Cobb’s reactions illustrate how even indirect or numerological associations can reinforce belief systems held by XRP supporters.

He said it was “open season on liquidation hunts due to high levels of betting,” before adding that Bitcoin was “waiting to purge the bets before the next swing of all-time-highs.” Paper bets are generally crypto derivatives such as futures, options , and perpetual contracts that allow speculators to bet on the price direction without ever holding the asset. Woo said spot Bitcoin prices are hard to move up with too many of these “casino hitchhikers” onboard. NOW is a BAD TIME to take paper bets on BTC. It’s open season on liquidation hunts due to high levels of betting. BTC is waiting to purge the bets before the next swing of all-time-highs. Chart: paper bets on BTC, hard to move up with too many casino hitchhikers onboard. pic.twitter.com/bj9ikjdn8Q — Willy Woo (@woonomic) June 2, 2025 Leverage Flush Imminent Most derivatives gamblers use leveraged trading, which tends to overheat markets and create more volatility, especially when they get liquidated. When asked about the $100 million liquidation of Hyperliquid whale trader James Wynn last week, Woo explained that the buying pressure was low last week, which means “whales can push things around.” “In neutral environments, it’s easy to move price, especially weekends and summer months,” he said before warning: “Now add incentives to make money through liquidations, it’s the perfect setup for liquidation hunts NOW.” Bitcoin open interest (OI), or the number of open futures contracts that have yet to be settled, hit an all-time high of $80 billion on May 23, according to Coinglass. It has since fallen to $72 billion but remains elevated, indicating a high level of “paper bets” or leverage in the market. When OI surges, it indicates that massive leveraged positions have built up with lots of speculators holding large positions with borrowed money. When the spot price of BTC moves against these over-leveraged positions, traders get forcibly liquidated. These flushouts can create a cascade effect and amplify selling pressure, which can cause a sharp decline in prices and volatility spikes. BTC Price Outlook Bitcoin prices are up marginally on the day, hitting an intraday high of $106,450 before retreating to around $105,350 during Tuesday morning trading in Asia. Since falling from its May 22 all-time high, the asset has remained in consolidation around current levels for the past few days. It looks very strong on the long-term view, but could see more volatility if Woo’s “casino hitchhikers” get liquidated. Meanwhile, the M2 money supply has just hit an all-time high, which is good news for risk-on assets such as crypto.

The Series E round drew participation from ARK Invest, Sequoia Capital, Founders Fund, Thrive Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and QIA. Neuralink announced Monday that its flagship BCI product, Telepathy, had already been implanted into five patients with severe paralysis, and they all could control external devices. Neuralink is running four clinical trials across three countries and has received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s Breakthrough Device designation for a vision-restoring product (Blindsight) and a speech restoration system. Neuralink last raised a $280 million Series D funding round in 2023, with an additional $43 million tranche added months later. Semafor reported last week that this latest deal values Neuralink at around $9 billion. Neuralink promises ‘independence for those with unmet medical needs’ We’re excited to announce our $650M Series E fundraising with participation from key investors including ARK Invest, DFJ Growth, Founders Fund, G42, Human Capital, Lightspeed, QIA, Sequoia Capital, Thrive Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Vy Capital, amongst others. We’re building… — Neuralink (@neuralink) June 2, 2025 The BCI startup claimed that the latest funding would help the company bring its technology to more people, restoring independence for those with unmet medical needs and pushing the boundaries of what was possible with brain interfaces. The Neuralink team said it was testing its implant, which is intended to help people with spinal cord injuries. The device allowed the first patient to play video games, browse the internet, post on social media, and move a cursor on his laptop directly with his brain. Neuralink also announced it was hiring engineers and operators across disciplines who wanted to make a real-world impact. It added that the new funding would accelerate its efforts to expand patient access and innovate future devices that deepened biological and AI connections. Tech startup outlines notable progress since the 2023 Series D funding Musk’s BCI tech company disclosed that in addition to helping five individuals with severe paralysis to control digital and physical devices with their thoughts, it was also pursuing new ways for applying Neuralink technology to use cases beyond digital device control. The company also added that clinical trials were already up and running at different institutions for neurosurgical care spanning two continents, including Barrow Neurological Institute, The Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at the University of Miami, University Health Network (Toronto Western Hospital), and Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi. The Neuralink team said the company had invested heavily in expanding the number of neurons and brain regions its device interfaced with to unlock new dimensions of human potential. Musk has repeatedly described future capabilities, such as enabling blind people to see via blindsight, even those lacking functional optic nerves. He also publicly committed to receiving a Neuralink implant himself. Despite this bold vision, Neuralink faces stiff competition from rival Paradromics, which recently announced implanting its Connexus device into a patient for roughly 10 minutes during a scheduled epilepsy resection surgery to test its safety and ability to record neural signals. Paradromics claims its platform supports faster data transfer rates and longer device lifespans than Neuralink’s. Paradromics also explained that its implants use 420 tiny needles to access individual neurons, offering potentially higher signal quality for tasks such as speech decoding. It recently disclosed plans to launch a full clinical trial by year-end focused on restoring communication for people with conditions like ALS, stroke, or spinal cord injury. Neuralink’s flagship product, Telepathy , uses ultra-thin flexible threads, each thinner than a human hair, embedded directly in the brain. According to the company’s team, these threads house 1,024 electrodes that capture neural signals and relay them wirelessly to external devices such as computers or phones. The goal is to allow individuals with severe paralysis to control digital and physical tools using only their thoughts. Other BCI competitors include Synchron , which places its device in blood vessels near the brain, and Precision Neuroscience , whose system sits atop the brain rather than penetrating it. Both alternatives favor less invasive methods but may offer lower resolution than the neuron-level access used by Neuralink and Paradromics. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

A June 2 release by the Ethereum Foundation has outlined a strategic restructuring of its core development team. The reorganization aims to sharpen focus, improve collaboration, and accelerate progress toward Ethereum’s scaling and usability goals. Key to the restructuring includes laying off several staff members and rebranding the Protocol Research & Development (PR&D) team as simply ‘Protocol.’ The revamped team will focus on three strategic priorities, including scaling Layer 1, improving user experience, and expanding blobspace capacity. “This means some members of PR&D won’t be continuing with the Ethereum Foundation,” stated the release, adding that “We must rethink our current approach to designing, developing and stewarding the protocol. This process of “shipping protocol” is messy, asking us to respond proactively to demands that are hard to articulate and even harder to fulfill.” The announcement comes on the heels of co-founder Vitalik Buterin’s recent confirmation at ETHGlobal Prague that Layer 1 is expected to scale roughly tenfold within the next year, as well as his January 2025 remarks about forthcoming changes to the ecosystem’s leadership. We are indeed currently in the process of large changes to EF leadership structure, which has been ongoing for close to a year. Some of this has already been executed on and made public, and some is still in progress. What we're trying to achieve is primarily the following… — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) January 18, 2025 The changes also come in response to growing industry calls for ecosystem-wide improvements to address operational inconsistencies and recent security concerns.

Ethereum’s Pectra Security Flaw The Ethereum Improvement Proposal EIP-7702, introduced earlier this year, exposed vulnerabilities that malicious actors have actively exploited, underscoring the critical need for a more focused approach to protocol development. Originally introduced to enhance wallet functionality by allowing standard Ethereum accounts to temporarily behave like smart contracts, EIP-7702 has inadvertently opened the door to new forms of abuse. On-chain analysts and security firms have flagged a wave of wallet-draining attacks exploiting the new delegation feature, raising urgent questions about the security implications of recent protocol changes.

The event, first pointed out by the on-chain security platform Cyvers Alerts, has led to an urgent investigation and the halting of Force Bridge’s operations. Cyvers states that an unauthorised and suspicious address seems to have successfully exploited the Force Bridge, managing to temporarily seize control over its operations. The attacker managed to siphon off a significant amount of several crypto tokens, which included: 257,800 USDT, 539.09 ETH, 898,300 USDC, 60,400 DAI, and 0.79 WBTC. Once they had the stolen money, it was converted entirely to Ethereum (ETH) — a common practice when laundering crypto, given how easy it is to buy and sell ETH. From there, the investigator followed the cash through Tornado Cash, an Ethereum mixer that obfuscates transactions from senders and receivers. Mixers are a commonly used laundering tool because they hide the origin and destination of the funds. Tornado Cash’s job is to make tracking the funds impossible.

By using the platform, hackers attempt to sever the connection between the original, pilfered funds and the digital vacuum cleaner’s clean output. Though Tornado Cash has been used by legitimate privacy advocates, it has become a favorite among cybercriminals. They especially seem to favor it after they’ve just pulled off some big, splashy exploit. Tornado Cash continues to operate, despite being sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2022. It functions through decentralized smart contracts—like other DeFi protocols. And those smart contracts, by design, are very difficult to shut down. Who can you appeal to if money is lost in exploits, like the one that happened to Force Bridge, and is sent to a service that can’t be turned off, where it will mix (blur the trail) with other assets in what’s now a largely unregulated marketplace? The team at Nervos Network has moved quickly to limit any additional harm by pausing the Force Bridge contracts. They have stated that they are investigating the situation and are in the process of gathering information to determine the full extent of what happened. Although the specific weakness that was taken advantage of has not yet been disclosed, the scale of the attack—over $200 million worth of digital assets—and the precision with which it was executed suggest a very serious and very skilled hacking job. Community Response and Future Implications This breach adds to the burgeoning list of cross-chain protocol hacks that have plagued the crypto space in recent years. Breaches at interoperability bridges, for instance, have proven to be high-risk targets for hackers, given these protocols’ complex architectures and the vast amounts of liquidity they manage. In 2022, attacks on the Poly Network and Wormhole bridges resulted in hundreds of millions of dollars in losses, while a similar assault on the Ronin Network resulted in a more than half a billion dollar loss. The cryptocurrency community is not taking this situation lightly. Nervos (the platform under which the affected funds were held) has received a lot of concern and even some pressure to communicate effectively with its user base during the ongoing investigation. As Jered from Cyvers (who provides real-time alerting systems for crypto platforms) pointed out, this situation really emphasizes the necessity of providing real-time alerts for any suspicious behavior before funds are moved beyond reach. For Nervos Network, this incident will likely lead to a reevaluation of its bridge architecture and security protocols. As the team works to reestablish trust and transparency, they are advising users to be cautious and avoid using the bridge until further notice. The hack of Force Bridge serves as another “DeFi is insecure” reminder. DeFi hackers are a growing problem, and the only way to stop or at least slow them down is to beef up security measures for DeFi applications. So far, it appears that the app was not sufficiently secured. Commentators note that hackers targeting DeFi projects are quite sophisticated. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Some are looking forward to the future upgrades on Ethereum which might help boost how many transactions the network can handle and lower fees, increasing the value of the coin. ETH may be tapering but people are paying attention to new projects as possible new opportunities. As people become more aware of the crypto space Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is being noticed as a possible ETH alternative. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows A two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance go viral in 2025. More than 11,600 investors have invested $9.8 million in the presale. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $6 after launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is creating a stablecoin backed by the US dollar that will be available on the Ethereum network. Because it is overcollateralized, its price won’t fluctuate drastically like algorithmic stablecoins have. The system relies on audited and safe open-source smart contracts from Certik, so users feel more secure. During its presale Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has raised more than $9.8 million from over 11,600 investors and is currently offered at $0.03 per token hoping to reach $0.035 by the end of this sixth phase enabling a 16.67% increase in the near future and letting investors profit greatly by the time the token launches at $0.06. Even though Ethereum (ETH) is a major part of DeFi the price being stuck at $2500 points to the increasing demand for alternatives like MUTM. Investors who want to join next-generation DeFi protocols can turn to Mutuum Finance which merges a hybrid lending model, a fully collateralized USD-backed stablecoin and Certik-verified security. Get in on the Mutuum Finance presale and prepare for when the next major DeFi surge happens.

A recent development sees former DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg making a notable move in the artificial intelligence space. What is This AI Video Ad Platform? Jeffrey Katzenberg’s venture fund, WndrCo, has co-led a substantial Series A funding round, injecting $15.5 million into Creatify. Creatify is an AI video ad platform designed to streamline and enhance social media marketing efforts. Their core offering, the AdMax platform, leverages artificial intelligence to rapidly produce numerous video variations. The platform is specifically tailored for social media, analyzing high-performing video campaigns on popular apps like TikTok and Instagram to inform and shape its output. This focus aims to give marketers a significant edge in creating engaging content efficiently. Why the Interest in AI Advertising? The investment highlights a broader trend: tech industry leaders are increasingly bullish on AI advertising . The potential for automation and optimization is immense. Consider Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has openly discussed ambitions to automate significant portions of advertising using AI tools. Such tools could potentially test thousands of ad variations across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Threads simultaneously, identifying the most effective ones at speed and scale. This level of automation represents a potential paradigm shift in how digital advertising campaigns are conceived, executed, and optimized. It promises increased efficiency and potentially higher returns on ad spend, areas of keen interest for any business operating online, including those in the crypto space looking to reach wider audiences. Who is Jeffrey Katzenberg and What Does This Investment Signify? Jeffrey Katzenberg is a legendary figure in the entertainment industry, having co-founded DreamWorks. His move into co-leading the Series A funding for Creatify, an AI video ad platform, signals a belief in the transformative power of AI for content creation and marketing. While Katzenberg’s track record includes massive successes, it also includes ventures that didn’t pan out as expected, such as Quibi, the short-form video platform that raised significant capital but was short-lived. This history underscores that while the potential for AI in advertising is vast, the path to success for individual startups is not guaranteed. His involvement, however, brings significant experience in media and content, coupled with the financial backing and network of WndrCo, providing Creatify with valuable resources and credibility. How Does Creatify’s Platform Work? Creatify’s AdMax platform operates by using AI to analyze successful social media video trends and apply those insights to generate new video creatives. Instead of manually producing dozens or hundreds of video variations for A/B testing, the AI can potentially generate them rapidly. Key aspects of the platform: Speed: Generates numerous video variations quickly. Optimization: Learns from high-performing social media content. Targeting: Creates videos geared specifically for platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Scalability: Enables marketers to test a much wider range of creatives than typically possible manually. This capability is particularly relevant in the fast-paced world of social media, where trends change rapidly, and constant content refreshment is key to maintaining audience engagement. What Are the Broader Implications for AI and Digital Marketing? The investment in Creatify underscores the accelerating integration of AI across various business functions, including marketing. The move towards highly automated, AI-driven content creation and testing suggests a future where marketing campaigns are far more dynamic and data-driven. While the automation potential is significant, it also raises questions about the balance between AI efficiency and human creativity, as well as the potential impact on the digital advertising ecosystem. The success of platforms like Creatify will likely depend on their ability to not only generate variations but also to produce high-quality, genuinely engaging content that resonates with diverse audiences. In conclusion, the $15.5 million Series A funding round co-led by Jeffrey Katzenberg ‘s WndrCo for Creatify highlights the growing investment and innovation in the AI video ads space. As AI continues to reshape industries, its impact on digital marketing and content creation is becoming increasingly clear, promising both exciting opportunities and new challenges for businesses navigating the online world.

According to a June 2 weekly report from CoinShares, XRP-focused investment products recorded their second consecutive week of outflows after losing a total of $28.2 million. This contrasts sharply with the larger digital asset market, which saw $286 million in inflows last week and a cumulative $10.9 billion over a seven-week run. Despite the market-wide inflows, overall assets under management fell to $177 billion from an all-time high of $187 billion. This decline occurred as prices cooled in reaction to growing uncertainty about U.S. tariffs , which caused major asset volatility. The ongoing withdrawals from XRP ( XRP ) investment products point to investor hesitancy, as reflected by XRP’s recent range-bound price. At press time, XRP is trading at $2.20, up 1.6% in the past 24 hours. It has traded between $2.11 and $2.35 over the last week. Spot trading activity appears to be climbing. In the past 24 hours, XRP’s trading volume rose over 24% to nearly $2 billion, pointing to renewed interest despite price consolidation. On the derivatives front, open interest is up 2% to $3.98 billion, and derivatives volume has jumped 18% to $3.45 billion, as per Coinglass data . This indicates that more traders are positioning for near-term volatility.

The asset is trading below its 10, 20, 50, and 100-day moving averages, all of which are flashing sell signals, suggesting that it is in a short- to medium-term downtrend. The 200-day exponential moving average is the only discernible bullish signal, indicating that there might be some longer-term support left. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news While the relative strength index is at 43.5, just short of oversold territory but still neutral, the moving average convergence divergence shows a negative crossover, indicating that bearish momentum is still present. The narrowing Bollinger Bands indicate less volatility and a potential breakout in the future. XRP is currently trading near the lower band, which has often acted as support. A bullish breakout would require a move above the $2.30–$2.35 resistance level, ideally supported by rising volume and a crossover of the short-term moving averages. A sustained close above the 50-day EMA would be an early sign of strength. In that case, XRP could attempt to reclaim the $2.50 zone. However, if XRP fails to hold above $2.13 and breaks through $2.10 on heavy volume, the next downside target could lie near the psychological $2.00 level, with extended weakness opening the door to $1.85.

That would be the first-time stablecoins have crossed that mark. And these numbers represent not only a burgeoning taste for dollar-like substitutes but also some broader stablecoin ecosystem maturation at this point. The stablecoin market cap is close to surpassing $250 billion for the first time, up 56 % year-on-year. pic.twitter.com/d0w0AN5euN — Sentora (previously IntoTheBlock) (@SentoraHQ) June 2, 2025 Stablecoins—previously seen as specialized instruments for crypto traders—are today viewed as essential to everything from DeFi (decentralized finance) to real-world payments. With increasing adoption, an expanding supply, and ever-more sophisticated infrastructure arrangements, the sector is experiencing a breakout moment. Stablecoins could soon prove instrumental to something that looks like an internet of money. Supply Surge and Market Maturity Define 2025 Landscape May marked a watershed moment for stablecoins. The overall stablecoin supply in circulation hit new all-time highs, keeping along a trend that has defined most of 2025. Tether (USDT) remains the dominant stablecoin player by a considerable distance in both volume and market share. Yet rivals like Circle’s USDC and Binance’s BUSD have pushed their way into new realms, too, with the result being an increasingly fragmented and diversified stablecoin marketplace. Stablecoin supply keeps climbing, hitting new highs. USDT still leads by a big margin, with USDC and BUSD growing steadily too. The diversity of stablecoins shows how much this market has matured, it’s no longer just a few names dominating. Watching these shifts helps spot… pic.twitter.com/V6TPVz2Ojb — Froggy (@GemBooster) June 2, 2025 The stablecoin ecosystem is no longer dominated by just one or two issuers. Instead, we’re seeing a broader array of tokens serving a much wider range of use cases. That means from algorithmic models to fiat-backed coins and regional digital currencies, the construction of the stablecoin landscape has become a lot more complex—and a lot more resilient. The array of stablecoin choices signifies not just a sector that’s undergoing development, but also one that’s achieving something close to institutional legitimacy. Investors can feel secure working in a terrain that’s not solely the domain of high-risk, high-reward operators. There’s an increasing order to the landscape, a burgeoning clarity about which vehicles are ripe for use. Stablecoins aren’t just signs of life in the crypto sector; they’re part and parcel of a crypto sector that feels fairly close to a tightly regulated, somewhat boring, and definitely upper-middle-class financial space. Record 33.1 Million Active Addresses Signal Explosive Adoption One of the most persuasive signs of the use of stablecoins isn’t just how many are out there but how many people are using them. In May, active stablecoin addresses hit a record-breaking 33.1 million, data from Artemis show. That number really emphasizes, to me, how many people are using stablecoins in their daily blockchain lives and the role they play as a financial underpinning of a wide variety of transactions and decentralized applications. Stablecoins have become a necessity for DeFi platforms, NFT marketplaces, and cross-border payments. Their price stability and predictable value make them the preferred asset for on-chain transactions. Stablecoins facilitate transactions and transfers in a manner comparable to what the US dollar does in the traditional financial system. The activity in wallet shows the unfaltering belief held by many in the industry since long: stablecoins are the on-chain, go-to currency. When you dig into the numbers, though, it starts to really sink in just how much this is the case and how likely this is to keep being the case, lending further credence to the almost unanimous belief that stablecoins are here to stay. Circle’s CCTP Hits Record Volume, Driving Cross-Chain Liquidity One of the most notable happenings in May was Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), which enables the effortless transfer of USDC, across multiple blockchain networks. CCTP saw an unprecedented $7.7 billion in transfer volume during the month—an all-time high and a remarkable 83.3% increase from April. According to Artemis, the number of active stablecoin addresses in May reached a record 33.1 million. Notably, Circle’s CCTP bridge facilitated $7.7 billion in volume during the month—an all-time high and up 83.3% from April. CCTP enables near-instant cross-chain USDC transfers.… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) June 2, 2025 CCTP is quickly turning into a core element of cross-chain liquidity, enabling USDC to flow almost instantly between a variety of ecosystems, including Ethereum, Avalanche, and Arbitrum. This capability lets users and developers move liquid assets across different chains without the help of wrapped tokens or the kind of third-party bridges that have, until now, served as a stopgap way to transfer stablecoins across chains. With interoperability becoming a key focal point in crypto’s next phase, CCTP’s explosive growth underscores the importance of a reliable infrastructure for transferring value between ecosystems. This insistence on reliable infrastructure also suggests that users are increasingly demanding faster, safer, and more seamless ways to move their assets—demands that tools like CCTP are beginning to meet. Looking Ahead: A Turning Point for Stablecoins Stablecoins have a different and more useful place in the digital economy. A stablecoin market exists now. Because it is expanding and has the potential to integrate much further, it is something we have to factor in. As the sector moves nearer to the $250 billion mark, there is no longer any time to waste on a narrative that is solely about supply or speculation. Now, it is also an issue of usability, scalability, and integration into real-world finance. And in that story, stablecoins are no longer just actors on the stage; they are becoming the very infrastructure on which the future of finance is being built.

The Aptos ambassador program expanded last week (much more on this program in the essay below). Aptos formed two strategic partnerships with big financial players: one with the trading venue and services operator CMC Markets and one with the big financial player Euronext. The final week of May showed Aptos much more plugged into the big financial world. This week’s key events showcase Aptos’ blossoming influence in decentralized finance, international payments, and real-world asset tokenization. 1. Aptos deployed the decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol Topaz. 2. Aptos joined forces with the blockchain network IBC and the project Heliax. 3. Aptos powered a world-first, real-time, cross-border payments between the United States and Japan using stablecoins. 4. Aptos collaborated with the project Vela on creating digital assets and went further than any other project by actually starting to use real-world assets to create those digital assets. Global Expansion: The Aptos Collective Welcomes New Ambassadors A fascinating announcement came from the Aptos Collective—the project’s main worldwide ambassador program—when it revealed that 39 fresh faces have entered its ranks as part of the Summer 2025 generation. These ambassadors not only come from all over the world but also amplify the already significant reach of Aptos and its efforts toward community engagement. Weekly $APT @Aptos Recap – Tuần 4, tháng 05 Thế hệ Aptos Collective mùa Hè 2025. 39 thành viên mới đã gia nhập đội ngũ đại sứ toàn cầu của Aptos https://t.co/jZ7Pggz0Ei USDC native đã chính thức có mặt trên Bybit dành cho mạng Aptos… pic.twitter.com/uLHj9oUtey — Blog Tiền Ảo (@blogtienao_hq) June 2, 2025 The Aptos Collective performs a vitally important function that aids in accomplishing the network’s mission and in spreading its values. That function is to create a presence in local communities—by hosting events, educating developers, and promoting the organic growth of a local ecosystem. The presence created by the Aptos Collective is a crucial bootstrap for local communities on the path to realizing the wave of grassroots engagement that is necessary for the Aptos network to achieve its full potential. Given that regional communities are increasingly driving Web3 adoption, the expansion of the Aptos Collective can be seen as a sign of something at least akin to an investment in long-term ecosystem health, if not an outright investment with a hope of some return on global scalability. Finance and DeFi Innovations: From USDC to Liquid Staking Aptos’s DeFi space received huge updates in the last week of May. A major core event was the fully-fledged integration of native USDC on Bybit for the Aptos network. This occurred just days after the decentralized exchange (DEX) Tortuga had also gone live on Aptos. We took a look at what these two updates mean for stablecoin transactions on Aptos. The liquidity and accessibility of USDC are enhanced when they are on a centralized exchange such as Bybit. This complements Aptos’ already interoperable position with premier financial protocols and augurs well for reach deeper into DeFi. Simultaneously, Aptos’s DeFi space sees exciting innovation through projects like Kofi Finance. The platform introduces us to liquid staking, a solution that could potentially change the way users interact with staked assets on the network. Liquid staking enables users to earn staking rewards and retain liquidity, which opens the door to new DeFi strategies and much more capital-efficient use of assets within the ecosystem. What led Kofi Finance to choose liquid staking as a path to take for this project? The DeFi landscape of Aptos is speeding up its diversification, and with platforms such as Kofi leading the charge, the chain is setting itself up as a serious contender in the next wave of DeFi evolution. Driving Real-World Utility and Global Payments Integration Outside of DeFi, Aptos seeks to make blockchain technology relevant to the real world. Its latest initiative in this direction is a campaign called “Real World Assets – Real World Aptos,” which underscores the network’s accelerating focus on converting physical and traditional assets into blockchain-based representations. While still not the most frequent of occurrences across the crypto space, real-world asset tokenization is recognized as a nascent trend with the potential to bring large numbers of new users to blockchain networks. And making real-world asset tokenization a part of its value proposition to users and developers appears to be a strategic emphasis for Aptos. Aptos’s partnerships are making news, with the recent attention generated by its collaborations with Allscale and Movemaker. These two partnerships are exploring ways to use the Aptos blockchain to create a truly global payments system. All three companies in this partnership—Aptos, Allscale, and Movemaker—are working to develop a set of payment solutions that use the Aptos blockchain. They hope to create payment solutions that are cost-effective, fast, and capable of providing real-time payment services across financial networks around the world. In addition to the excitement, Aptos was named recently as one of the fastest-growing ecosystems by Circle, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin. This accolade comes from Token Terminal, a well-regarded analytics platform that specializes in crypto assets. Aptos’ stablecoin ecosystem is growing at an incredibly fast clip right now, and this is part of a larger context in which it’s clear that there’s some very serious momentum building aboard the Aptos blockchain. In a lighter but just as important note, the Aptos ecosystem’s rapidly expanding DeFi Cattos project recently dropped a hint about its upcoming “F Point” rewards system. The project describes this new, gamified incentive layer—but doesn’t yet tell us much about it. Have the Cattos already imagined a system that will drive even deeper engagement with their community? Looking Ahead: Aptos Builds Momentum Into Summer It is obvious that Aptos is gathering a smooth and steady momentum as we wind up the first half of 2025. Aptos has, if anything, only worked harder to, in its own words, win the “hearts and minds” of the crypto community as it evolves and advances beyond its Layer 1 beginnings to become a truly versatile blockchain platform with all kinds of applications that reach well beyond the layer it started on. Aptos is demonstrating that it has the technical and social capital to make a lasting impact in the rapidly evolving crypto universe. Its combination of serious funding and committed community gives it a good chance of being relevant in both the technical and social dimensions that are necessary for success in the crypto space.

Activity with venture capital slowed and sank to the weakest level we have seen for the year so far. But the market for mergers and acquisitions did the exact opposite, surging to new heights, driven by a blockbuster deal that sent shockwaves through our sector. Data from the industry indicates that crypto fundraising in May 2025 tallied just about $600 million, making for the year’s lowest monthly total to date. And the total number of funding deals dropped to lows we haven’t seen since early 2021. To me, these two trends signal something pretty clear: investors are just not that into crypto right now. And sentiment seems to be driving these funding figures. Even as venture capital quieted, strategic consolidation began to escalate. In May, M&A activity in the crypto world soared to a new high, with total disclosed deal value just shy of $3 billion. And a significant part of that was Coinbase acquiring Deribit, the largest crypto options exchange, in what you might call a bold move to assert the importance of derivatives trading in the overall digital asset landscape. VC Pullback Signals Investor Caution in Uncertain Market May’s lethargic fundraising scene is an indication of a larger realignment in the crypto venture world. Only $600 million has flowed into the industry’s coffers this past month. And while this was the only month in 2025 with such a low figure, it is even more disconcerting when you consider the STOP THE FLIGHT element of what took place in May. Even when examined through the prism of deal volume, the decline looks harsh. The actual number of funding rounds carried out in May plummeted to a level not observed since the 2021 bull run’s earliest days. This points not only to a deceleration in the raising of large, attention-getting sums but also to a more general, early-stage financing and seed deal cooling that has gone on for a few months now. Interestingly, although the total amount of capital raised decreased, crypto applications focused on finance and artificial intelligence largely made up the value that was raised. Projects relating to financial infrastructure accounted for 39% of all fundraising, indicating that, despite the overall slowdown, the core building blocks of the crypto economy still have investor interest. Meanwhile, solutions that involved artificial intelligence in some capacity captured 25% of the total, underscoring how decentralized technologies and AI are increasingly converging—an intersection that seems to be shaping investment theses across the tech sector. Crypto monthly fundraising slowed to a 2025 low in May, coming in right around $600M. Financial (39%) and AI (25%) applications drove most of the value raised The total number of deals hit a low not seen since early 2021 pic.twitter.com/a19T4Nvu2i — Dan Smith (@smyyguy) June 1, 2025 Blockbuster Coinbase-Deribit Deal Drives M&A Surge Despite a slowdown in venture market activity, a surge in mergers and acquisition (M&A) activity took place during May 2023. The total disclosed value of crypto M&A activity in May 2023 was just shy of $3 billion, which was not only a record amount for the month but also the largest single-month tally since Messari began tracking crypto M&A data in 2020. Central to this history-creating month was the buyout of Deribit by Coinbase. While the exact terms of the deal didn’t make it to the public’s ear, the acquisition was believed to form a large chunk of May’s almost $3B worth of M&A activity. This telling move sees the crypto-exchange giant dive deeper into the lucrative op-ex market. Meanwhile, with Deribit commanding a decent share of crypto trading options globally (as in mammoth contract size), this positions Coinbase to better serve its institutional clients and compete against its unregulated offshore rivals. It is important to mention, however, that the majority of crypto-related M&A deals do not make their financial terms public. This leaves the actual scale of the activity something of a mystery—but perhaps a more impressive one than the numbers suggest. It’s also worth pointing out that the sheer number of deals struck in May was one of the lowest monthly levels we’ve seen this year. An Industry in Transition: Fewer Bets, Bigger Moves May’s figures, when viewed together, show the industry at a crossroads. Venture capitalists have stepped back, putting their money into fewer, more thoughtfully chosen investments that are less likely to run afoul of regulators or the current slack macroeconomic conditions. At the same time, the big players in the digital space, the ones with actual cash to spend, are using this market dip to acquire the kinds of infrastructure and talent that will keep them ahead of the game. This change toward consolidation and particular investment might in the end bring about a more robust crypto sector. In the immediate future, though, it means less in the way of cash and support for startups and a more cutthroat environment for almost all projects trying to establish themselves in the crypto market. When 2025 unfolds, all eyes will be on whether VC funding continues to be on the downside and whether M&A will remain the alleged main story in a slowly maturing digital asset industry.

Wintermute has a significant footprint in the Arbitrum ecosystem and has captured a top 5 spot among Arbitrum DAO delegates, supported by a growing group of 174 individuals who have delegated to Wintermute. My guess is that those who are delegating also include employees of Wintermute. As of May 30, Wintermute holds 12.72 million ARB tokens that allow it to vote in the DAO—3.56% of the total voting power. This makes Wintermute a pretty important voice in determining what happens on Arbitrum. Not only that, but unlike some other crypto firms, Wintermute’s voting power has been growing of late—a 2.07% increase over the past 90 days. This seems to suggest that confidence in its stewardly stewardship has been growing, and that both individual and institutional delegators continue to trust Wintermute. Delegate Spotlight #3: @wintermute_t Wintermute is a top crypto liquidity provider across CeFi, DeFi, and TradFi. They’re also a top 5 Arbitrum DAO delegate, backed by 174 delegators. Let’s break down their DAO activity via our @Dune dashboard pic.twitter.com/9fIbak9AGo — Entropy Advisors (@EntropyAdvisors) June 2, 2025 A Consistent Governance Player with a Proactive Approach One of the most remarkable aspects of Wintermute’s actions within the DAO is how engaged they are. The firm has a voting participation rate of 86.67%—an impressive and consistent presence in making governance decisions. They have pushed forward 5 proposals and have taken part in over 60 of them. That level of participation is a clear sign of a long-term commitment to the Arbitrum ecosystem. What distinguishes Wintermute is how they vote. Not like some delegates who seem to relish the drama of waiting until the final hours to tip the scales—perhaps to gauge community sentiment or test the waters for market reactions—Wintermute tends to vote with more of a sense of urgency, tipping the scales early, usually between days two and four of a proposal’s lifecycle. Their voting behavior suggests a model of governance that combines independent analysis with a kind of forward-thinking, decision-making that’s to be lauded as preferable to governance that’s mainly reactive. This advance position assumes not just an influence but also signals a tone for others to follow. When influential delegates like Wintermute take to the polls early, it often sends a strong directional cue to the rest of the community. Rising Delegations Cement a Stable Governance Role Wintermute’s substantial influence did not materialize overnight. Their rise in the DAO governance realm came about through two significant delegation pushes—one in late 2023 and another in early 2024. These pushes took their voting power from around 5 million ARB (and counting) to well over the magical 10 million ARB number. Ever since, they have kept attaining that high level of voting power faithfully, even though the crypto market and the delegation shifts within the DAO have undulated. That steadiness highlights an important fact: Wintermute is seen as a reliable and trustworthy actor by an increasingly diverse and large group of delegators. Maintaining stability at the summit of DAO governance is no small challenge. The decentralized nature of these organizations means that reputation, engagement, and decision-making of high quality are essential if you are to maintain an influence that can be nudged, if not pushed, in the direction that you want it to go. Strategic Voting: Supportive Yet Selective Of the more than 60 proposals Wintermute has voted on, the majority have received their support. However, they have not hesitated to abstain or vote against proposals when deemed necessary. Notably, they expressed opposition to the OpCo proposal—a move that drew attention across the DAO community. That selectivity indicates Wintermute is not just a rubber-stamp voter. Their decisions are deliberate, based on internal assessments, and aimed at long-term value in the ecosystem. That gives them even more credibility, really. Why do I say that? Because a lot of these VC/hedge fund types just want to go along to get along. As the Arbitrum DAO continues to grow, the delegates it has will be the ones to shape its evolution. They will have the reins of leadership in their hands. Delegates like Wintermute are currently leading the way and serving as pioneers. Their combination of early participation, solid engagement, and principled decision-making makes them a model group of delegates for the Arbitrum DAO and its community. In a sector frequently condemned for indifference or poorly aligned incentives, Wintermute distinguishes itself not only as a liquidity behemoth but also as a governance champion charting a purposeful, impactful course.

Price-Action According to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis model, the token rose from $0.191 to $0.200, fueled by strong technical momentum and high-volume trading that saw peak volume hit 470 million units during the 01:00 hour. The rally comes at a time of heightened global economic uncertainty, with geopolitical tensions weighing on risk assets across the board. Despite this backdrop, Dogecoin’s price action has defied broader market trends, breaking through key resistance at $0.193 and forming a new support level at $0.200 after brief consolidation. Technical analysis highlights DOGE’s strong uptrend, with higher lows and higher highs forming throughout the period. The most aggressive buying occurred during the final four hours of the session, with volume spikes at 01:43 (32.9M units) and 01:46 (37.3M units) underscoring significant institutional accumulation. A notable $20 million DOGE transfer to Coinbase coincided with the launch of the SHIB DAO, sparking renewed interest in the meme coin sector and potentially contributing to the surge. Technical Analysis Recap DOGE climbed from $0.191 to $0.200, a 5.75% gain over 24 hours. Price action formed a clear uptrend with higher lows and higher highs, particularly after 22:00. Strong volume support emerged at $0.190, while resistance at $0.193 was broken with conviction. Peak volume of 470M occurred at 01:00, marking the most aggressive buying session. Final hour saw DOGE climb from $0.197 to $0.200, with notable volume spikes at 01:43 (32.9M) and 01:46 (37.3M). Price broke the $0.200 psychological barrier at 01:50, establishing a new support level. DOGE closed the session with decreased volatility but maintained levels above $0.200. As DOGE heads into the next trading session, traders will be watching closely to see if the meme coin can sustain its momentum amid broader market volatility.",Markets|AI Market Insights|Dogecoin|News,EN,0,0,DOGE|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-03 07:39:47

For many businesses, that efficiency often hits a bottleneck at the IT helpdesk. Waiting to get access to an application or resolve a technical glitch can be frustrating. This challenge is particularly relevant in the tech sector, where quick access to resources is critical. A new player is emerging to tackle this head-on: Console, a startup focused on bringing AI IT Helpdesk solutions to the enterprise. Revolutionizing IT Automation with AI Console recently announced a significant milestone, securing $6.2 million in seed funding. This investment, led by Thrive Capital, is aimed at accelerating Console’s mission to automate mundane IT tasks using artificial intelligence. The goal is clear: free up IT teams from repetitive work so they can focus on more strategic initiatives. The idea for Console originated with Andrei Serban, who saw the heavy workload on IT teams while working at Rippling. He recognized the potential for AI to handle common requests like password resets, software access grants, and basic troubleshooting. By automating these tasks, Console aims to significantly reduce the time employees spend waiting for support and allow IT professionals to engage in more complex, valuable projects. Console’s Approach to Helpdesk AI While the concept of automating helpdesk functions isn’t entirely new, Console differentiates itself through its ease of deployment and integration. Unlike some competitors that require complex, lengthy installations, Console is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing tools like Slack. This allows companies to make the AI assistant available to their employees in just a few weeks. Console positions itself not as a replacement for the IT helpdesk staff, but as an AI co-worker that enhances their capabilities. Employees interact with Console’s AI agent directly through messaging platforms. The AI leverages information about the user and their permissions to quickly address requests. According to Console, its AI can resolve over 50% of common tasks autonomously, only escalating more complex issues to a human IT professional. Securing AI Funding: The Thrive Capital Perspective The speed of installation and Console’s effective automation capabilities have already attracted notable customers, including Scale AI, Flock Safety, and Calendly. These early successes were key factors in securing the $6.2 million in AI Funding from Thrive Capital. Thrive Capital, known for backing leading AI companies like OpenAI, sees Console as a strong fit within their investment thesis regarding the transformative potential of AI in IT operations. Vince Hankes, a partner at Thrive, believes that although Console’s fast integration might initially seem like a potential weakness, the AI’s rapid improvement through user interaction will make it an indispensable part of a company’s infrastructure over time. Expanding Enterprise AI Capabilities Console’s vision extends beyond just IT. The company plans to expand its AI assistant’s capabilities to support other internal functions, such as answering employee questions related to HR, finance, and legal matters. The ultimate goal is for Console to become the first point of contact for employees seeking help across various internal departments, further solidifying its role in driving Enterprise AI adoption and efficiency. This funding round highlights the growing confidence in AI-driven solutions to solve real-world business problems, particularly within enterprise environments. By tackling the repetitive tasks that burden IT teams, Console aims to not only improve efficiency but also elevate the strategic importance of IT within organizations.

45447319,https://nulltx.com/?p=150171,1748936423,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,"MicroStrategy Adds Another 705 BTC, Extends Lead as Largest Corporate Holder",https://nulltx.com/microstrategy-adds-another-705-btc-extends-lead-as-largest-corporate-holder/,"MicroStrategy , the enterprise software giant that has turned into a Bitcoin bull, has made a fresh Bitcoin purchase. Last week, it announced that it had bought 705 more BTC, valued at $75.1 million, at an average price of $106,495 per BTC. Company CEO Michael Saylor said that MicroStrategy now holds a total of 580,955 BTC, which are worth about $60.5 billion at today’s prices, making them, by a country mile, the largest corporate Bitcoin holders. MicroStrategy’s BTC strategy has become one of the most financially successful decisions ever taken by a corporation. It now has an unrealized profit of $19.83 billion—a figure that could change at any second, since it’s based on the numbers coming from the Bitcoin network. MicroStrategy( @Strategy ) bought another 705 $BTC ($75.1M) at an average price of $106,495 last week. #Strategy currently holds 580,955 $BTC ($60.5B), with an average buying price of $70,023 and an unrealized profit of $19.83B. https://t.co/tIy3luAAqa pic.twitter.com/DFRv8R87SX — Lookonchain (@lookonchain) June 2, 2025 Not the Biggest Whale, But the Biggest Corporation Even though it currently holds more Bitcoin than any other public company in the world, MicroStrategy is still not even close to being the top holder of Bitcoin. In fact, the company that has the most Bitcoin in the world is actually a pseudonymous figure who may or may not be a single person: Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto’s original mining wallet holds approximately 1.096 million BTC, worth about $112.2 billion at the current market price of $103,792. That’s nearly double MicroStrategy’s stash. Despite this, MicroStrategy holds the title of the largest publicly traded company with BTC on its balance sheet. Since August 2020, the company has adopted Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset—a move that was both unprecedented and widely scrutinized at the time. Fast-forward nearly five years, and the decision appears visionary. The company’s Bitcoin holdings have appreciated massively, and its stock price has surged over 7x since its initial BTC buy. Although Satoshi is unassailable in terms of sheer BTC possession, MicroStrategy heads up the institutional adoption of Bitcoin. It and a growing number of companies are considering digital assets, like Bitcoin, as part of their treasury strategy. Institutional Buying Gains Momentum MicroStrategy is not the only one wagering substantially on Bitcoin. Per the most recent info from SosoValue and its BTC Treasuries Dashboard, 14 different firms that are publicly listed now hold the crypto asset, and these companies together own 637,000 BTC—worth around $66.1 billion. Of these 14 companies, 10 are U.S.-based, with the other four across the Pacific in Japan—all of which is to say that momentum toward Bitcoin’s institutional adoption appears to be building regionally. Tesla and the Japanese company Metaplanet are notable Bitcoin holders but trail behind MicroStrategy. Yet MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin holdings are not just notable; they’re an astonishing 50 times larger than Tesla’s—not to mention they’re held at a cost BTC price of around $24,000, which is low in the world of corporate-held BTC prices. Nano Labs Ltd, the company with whom Elon Musk’s space travel interests are in touch, holds the highest average cost basis for its BItcoin: $99,500. Blockchain Inc. holds its BItcoin at the lowest average price: $30,405. Every company that has gone public and disclosed purchasing Bitcoin is currently sitting in the green, thanks to the current market price of $103,792. This profitability could well spark additional interest from firms that haven’t already bought in and could lead even more companies to scoop up some Bitcoin, especially as the cryptocurrency keeps proving itself as a long-term value play. 微策略是目前比特币的最大持有者吗？ —— 不是，中本聪才是 Satoshi Nakamoto 公开账户目前持有 109.6 万枚 BTC，总价值 1122 亿美元，而微策略的 BTC 持有量为 58 万枚（602 亿美元），想成为「比特币最大庄家」还得再买近一倍的量哈哈 自 2020 年 8… pic.twitter.com/8verivv2bo — Ai 姨 (@ai_9684xtpa) June 2, 2025 Market Watches Whale Activity Closely Bitcoin is the sole digital asset that demonstrates consistent institutional faith during this market cycle. Corporate treasury strategies today are concentrated, almost exclusively, on Bitcoin. Profits are impressive; floating profits are through the roof. New entrants into this market are piling into this digital gold. And so analysts have turned their sights not just to the price of Bitcoin but also to the behavior of the Bitcoin whales—first and foremost, the corporate treasurers that have committed to holding this asset in their vaults. For institutional investors, the cost basis of $70,023 per BTC for MicroStrategy is presently regarded as a critical benchmark. It stands as both a financial floor and a psychological threshold. With MicroStrategy, even last week, buying above that average—like with last week’s purchase at $106,495, for example—it sends a powerful message about long-term, steadfast conviction. Market focus on the whale cost basis highlights the powerful influence that big, strategic Bitcoin holders have in molding both sentiment and technical support for the cryptocurrency. These corporate players, often referred to as Plus-edition whales, are handfuls of ELPs—they’re not even in the top 10. Yet, these quasigovernmental types are enough to keep buying. And because they can keep buying, they keep providing a level of price stability that our couldn’t-even-attempt society of Bitcoin retail investors doesn’t provide. Conclusion: MicroStrategy’s Strategy Pays Off Big Bitcoin’s price at the heart of MicroStrategy’s financial strategy, in 2020, is a thank-you note, written in profitable contractually-obliged software, to the half-dozen or so MicroStrategy employees who, back in 2013, connected their employer to the virtually wonk-tastic world of cryptocurrency. Even better, this seems to be a decision that Saylor himself couldn’t have predicted would end up as the most lauded corporate investment since the ill-fated AOL Time Warner merger. Despite the massive, overshadowing profile of Satoshi Nakamoto, MicroStrategy plays an undeniable role in legitimizing Bitcoin as a legitimate corporate asset—and everyone else seems ready to follow its lead.

This announcement has provided much-needed regulatory clarity for PoS networks and their participants. The SEC emphasized that staking rewards are considered compensation for services provided to the network, rather than profits derived from the efforts of others, which is a key criterion in the Howey Test for determining securities. This distinction alleviates previous concerns about the regulatory status of staking activities, thereby encouraging broader participation in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) networks such as Ethereum, XDC Network, Solana, Cardano, Toncoin and many more. Comparative Overview of Leading PoS Chains Blockchain LiveNet Launch Consensus Mechanism Key Focus Areas Regulatory Engagement Ethereum 2015 PoS (since 2022) Smart Contracts, DeFi Active discussions with regulators Solana 2020 PoS High-speed dApps, NFTs Limited Cardano 2017 PoS Academic Research, Smart Contracts Emphasis on formal methods Toncoin 2018 PoS Messaging Integration, dApps Emerging XDC Network 2019 DPoS Trade Finance, RWA Tokenization Strong institutional & governmental partnerships Coinciding with this regulatory update, the XDC Network has achieved a notable milestone by ranking in Top 7th position among PoS cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap. This ascent reflects XDC's growing prominence in the blockchain ecosystem, particularly in enterprise applications and real-world asset tokenization. XDC Network's Strategic Positioning Launched in 2017 and went livenet in 2019, the XDC Network operates as an enterprise-grade, EVM-compatible blockchain, utilizing a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. Its infrastructure is designed to facilitate fast, low-cost transactions, making it suitable for applications in trade finance, cross-border payments, and asset tokenization. Regulatory Compliance and Government Partnerships XDC Network's commitment to regulatory compliance is evident through its integration with the ISO 20022 financial messaging standard, ensuring compatibility with existing financial systems. The network has also partnered with various governmental bodies to advance blockchain adoption: Singapore's IMDA TradeTrust: XDC has integrated with the Infocomm Media Development Authority's TradeTrust framework to facilitate the creation and financing of Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records (MLETR)-compliant digital trade documents. Brazil's SERPRO: The network is collaborating with SERPRO, Brazil's federal data processing service, to implement blockchain-based KYC and AML verification systems. Zanzibar's National Blockchain Sandbox: XDC serves as the underlying technology for Zanzibar's initiative to stimulate digital asset and blockchain technology growth. $XDC is recognized as legal tender for payments and digital asset use in Panama and Indonesia , with ongoing use case exploration in countries like the UAE, Brazil, Nigeria, and Kazakhstan through regulated token partnerships. Real-World Applications and Ecosystem Growth XDC Network's infrastructure supports various real-world applications: Trade Finance: Through platforms like TradeFinex, XDC facilitates the digitization of trade finance instruments, enhancing efficiency and transparency. Asset Tokenization: The network enables the tokenization of real-world assets, such as U.S. Treasury bonds and private credit, providing liquidity and broader access to investment opportunities. Cross-Border Payments: Partnerships with entities like Bitso Business leverage XDC's infrastructure to enable low-cost, instant cross-border transactions, particularly between the U.S. and Mexico. XDC 2.0: The Technical Foundation Behind Institutional Confidence In 2024, the XDC Network released the XDC 2.0 whitepaper , introducing its next-generation consensus model based on Chained HotStuff BFT. This upgrade is central to the network’s enhanced performance, including 3-second finality, improved security, and deflationary tokenomics — key features aligned with enterprise and public-sector demands. Notably, XDC 2.0’s architecture is engineered for regulatory clarity, with explicit support for account abstraction, compliance-friendly staking, and KYC-integrated dApps — all of which align strongly with the SEC’s recent recognition of protocol staking as non-securities-based activity. The whitepaper demonstrates a clear roadmap for scaling institutional use while preserving decentralization. XDC Market Update XDC Network price today is $0.060511 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $35,218,776 USD. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #76, with a live market cap of $981,206,760 USD. It has a circulating supply of 16,215,318,634 XDC coins and the max. XDC is traded on the exchanges, namely Kucoin, Bitfinex, Uphold, Gate.io, HTX, CEX.io, Bitget, HitBTC, Huobi, Indodax, Bitrue, CoinDCX, and Coins.ph, Bitmart, FMFW, Lbank, MEXC, BLOX, Mercatox, CoinEX, StealthEx, Whitebit, Bybit, CoinW, DigiFinex, BuyUcoin, Liquid, Bequant, ProBit, Changelly Pro, Proton DEX, Kinesis. XDC is also listed on Xswap DEX, Globiance DEX, Changelly, SwapZone, Simple Swap, and more, and the complete list can be found at Get XDC on the website . XDC Network's ascent in the PoS blockchain landscape is marked by its strategic focus on regulatory compliance, governmental partnerships, and real-world applications. As the blockchain industry continues to evolve, XDC's enterprise-grade solutions position it as a formidable contender in facilitating the digital transformation.

According to data from crypto.news, Ethereum ( ETH ) jumped 6.5% to an intraday high of $2,644 on June 3 (Asian morning hours), pushing its market cap to over $314.8 billion. It was the top performer among the 10 largest cryptocurrencies today, up nearly 86% from its year-to-date low. On the derivatives front, open interest in ETH futures has surged to $35.67 billion, nearing its all-time high and well above the $19.6 billion recorded on April 3, per CoinGlass . Further, its long/short ratio on Binance was 1.8 at press time, indicating a clear bullish bias among traders. Meanwhile, its funding rates have also remained positive for over a month. ETH’s bullish setup is further reinforced by strong institutional inflows and on-chain trends suggesting reduced selling pressure. According to CoinShares data, ETH-based investment products attracted $321 million in inflows last week, their highest weekly figure since December 2024. That momentum continued in U.S. markets, with spot Ether ETFs recording four straight weeks of positive inflows totaling over $653.9 million.

This steady decline in exchange balances suggests increased self-custody, typically a sign that investors are positioning for long-term gains rather than short-term selling. Meanwhile, several major corporations have also shown interest in the flagship altcoin, with notable recent purchases from firms such as BTCS and Fidelity , both of which have significantly increased their ETH holdings. ETH price analysis On the 4-hour ETH/USDT chart, ETH price remains above the rising trendline of a multi-week ascending triangle and is holding firm above the 50-period Simple Moving Average, a sign of sustained bullish momentum.

To top it off, the MACD has made a bullish crossover, further confirming upward pressure. ETH Aroon and MACD chart — June 3 | Source: crypto.news If this momentum continues, ETH could first test the $2,713 level, which lines up with the 50% Fibonacci retracement zone. A breakout above that could pave the way toward $3,000, Ethereum’s 61.8% retracement level, which would mark a roughly 15% jump from its current price. On the flip side, if ETH dips below $2,500, it might invalidate the current bullish setup. In that case, we could see a pullback toward the $2,377 level, which coincides with the 200-day SMA and may act as a key support zone.

Typically, DOGE has always been involved in social hype and excitement. But now that investors are growing more discriminating and the macro environment around crypto is suffering, the massive 56% wipeout is no less than a warning. With over 2,000 DOGE investors exploring other profit avenues, the Dogecoin price plunge has exposed a bearish sentiment among memecoin holders. Among many, Unilabs is gaining massive traction as the next-generation DeFi asset manager with over $30.5 million in assets under management (AUM). Dogecoin (DOGE) Crashes By 56%: More Downside Possible? According to analysts, it’s about time investors started calling Dogecoin (DOGE) what it is. A 56% drop that reveals a lack of investor community. DOGE’s 2025 price performance has been a complete mess so far. Following a break below the 50 EMA and a paper tiger test of the 100 and 200 EMAs, the Dogecoin price is currently holding onto a weak support zone at $0.20. Source: TradingView The degree of decline in the Dogecoin price is not another healthy retracement. Instead, it’s a clear indication that the memecoin enthusiasts no longer believe in DOGE. The technical image appears bleak following the Dogecoin price plunge. Typically, an asset should never see price action below the 50 EMA, but DOGE is just about done for the time being. The chart indicates that the market does not believe in a sustainable Dogecoin price recovery, given the lack of real support from the convergence of the moving averages (black 200 EMA and orange 100 EMA). There’s no doubt that DOGE’s momentum has vanished because even the RSI indicators at the bottom of the chart are trapped in neutral to bearish territory. Experts Support Unilabs As the Viral PassiveFi Coin This Cycle As the Dogecoin price struggles on the brink of a crash at $0.20, all eyes are shifting to the explosive rise of Unilabs (UNIL) . This DeFi asset manager is a next-gen PassiveFi powerhouse that's doing more than just going viral. With over $1.9 million raised in Stage 2 of its presale and 400+ million tokens already sold, Unilabs is topping charts and attracting attention from investors chasing stability, innovation, and actual utility in a market flooded with hype and hollow promises. While DOGE falls behind crucial technical indicators, UNIL is surging ahead, backed by real fundamentals and a clear roadmap. Unilabs is an AI-powered ecosystem designed for sustainable, automated wealth creation, especially for memecoin enthusiasts seeking shelter amid the broader market meltdown. Unilabs beats memecoin speculation with real yield through platform-generated dividends, staking rewards, and AI-optimized portfolio management. This PassiveFi model empowers users to earn while they sleep, vote on platform evolution, and access premium investment strategies that are typically restricted to hedge funds and institutions. According to a senior analyst, UNIL could deliver explosive gains by Q1 2026, hitting a massive 50x milestone from its presale stage if current momentum continues. With AI-backed rebalancing tools and a deflationary staking mechanism supporting long-term value, Unilabs presents a data-driven roadmap that appeals to retail investors and crypto whales. Conclusion: With the market’s reliance on viral memecoins shaking, Unilabs is stepping into the spotlight as the viral PassiveFi platform. While DOGE clings to the nearest support levels, UNIL potentially dominates it with automated returns, community governance, and AI-powered insight.

They are noticing other crypto coins like Unilabs (UNIL) providing a 30% return to their early buyers. This presale gem has crushed the $2M raised milestone in just two weeks. Plus, with the initial coin offering now in phase two, this number is bound to skyrocket before its official launch. Although experts like Trader Tardigrade and Shib Spain foresee hefty price jumps for Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, UNIL stands out from these meme coins. Since it also redefined the market by launching the first AI-powered DeFi asset management platform, traders are looking at UNIL as a good crypto to buy. Unilabs (UNIL) Gains Traction With a 30% Price Increase While the DOGE price and the Shiba Inu price are seeing downtrends, many traders are focusing on Unilabs (UNIL) . Since early investors are already up 30% in profits, countless traders rush to buy this crypto coin before its presale ends and price skyrockets. In fact, over 400M UNIL tokens have been bought in the second presale round alone. Interest in Unilabs is high since it brought something new to the DeFi space. Notably, it launched the first AI-driven DeFi asset manager that now boasts over $30M AUM. It includes a meme coin identification tool that uses AI-fueled insights to look at a new meme coin's virality and listing potential. This will give users a heads-up on new promising meme coins. By holding UNIL, traders also get many perks. These include governance voting rights and staking rewards of up to 122% APY. One UNIL now costs just $0.0051, a 30% increase from its starting price of $0.004. But, this value will soar to $0.0062 when the third presale round begins. Because Lido Finance surged post-launch, the deeper AI integration of Unilabs could make it a dominant platform in the market and UNIL one of the tokens to watch. Trader Tardigrade: The DOGE Price Could Soar Past $1 Dogecoin (DOGE) is a meme coin that is now going through some turbulence. CoinMarketCap shows that the DOGE price fell over 15% in the past seven days. Dogecoin dipped from around $0.25 to below $0.19 during that time. But, market analyst Trader Tardigrade is still bullish for Dogecoin (DOGE). In a recent post, he told his X followers that this meme coin is forming falling wedges as bases alongside a parabolic curve. This could lead to the DOGE price potentially soaring to $0.45 and even $1 soon. With the potential of a 21Shares spot DOGE ETF incoming, this Dogecoin price prediction may come true. However, some traders are still skeptical since the DOGE price has already surged over 20% on the YTD chart. Therefore, its highest upswings could be behind it. As a result, traders are sidestepping Dogecoin for UNIL. Analyst Predicts the Shiba Inu Price Potentially Rising Soon One of the meme coin titans, Shiba Inu (SHIB), has also seen some red price charts. On the one-week chart, Shiba Inu dipped from around $0.000014 to nearly $0.000012, per CoinMarketCap. In other words, over a 10% drop in the Shiba Inu price. The community is still excited because of a bullish Shiba Inu price prediction from analyst Shib Spain. According to his X post, this meme coin looks very bullish. He foresees the Shiba Inu price potentially soaring past $0.000018 soon. Despite this bullish Shiba Inu (SHIB) statement, many investors are focusing on UNIL instead. Since it has a high market cap of around $7B, much new money must come in for the Shiba Inu price to soar. Meanwhile, UNIL will not face this issue, making its growth faster than Shiba Inu. What Makes Unilabs (UNIL) More Appealing Than Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB)? The hype around the potential growth of the DOGE price and the Shiba Inu price is now shifting to Unilabs (UNIL). Unlike meme coins that depend on virality, UNIL offers real utility and great opportunities for passive income. For example, its referral layer lets users who spread the word about it gain extra rewards. This presents an amazing opportunity for fast returns. As a result, UNIL could capture more eyes than Dogecoin and Shiba Inu in the long run.

Bridging has been growing for legitimate reasons, while also serving to mix or swap funds more easily. On-chain researcher ZachXBT noted that bridge volumes may not be organic, instead being caused by hackers aiming to launder funds. ZachXBT commented on a recent X post by @arjunnchand, which suggested LiFi protocol sees record volumes. pic.twitter.com/UNLp55AREp — Tay 💖 (@tayvano_) June 3, 2025 Bridges most often serve to bring funds back to the Ethereum main chain, which then grants access to TornadoCash or other DEX services used for mixing. Cross-chain bridges also serve in instances of multi-chain attacks. The LiFi bridging service faces a challenge similar to other Web3 protocols, where its permissionless nature means few tools to stop bad actors, and an unwillingness to screen for them on principle. The case is similar to the peak volumes of THORChain following the Bybit hack, where the protocol was among the few to deny cooperation, monitoring, and freezing of funds. LiFi received criticism not just for its accidental usage by hackers, but for celebrating the increased volumes as a sign of growth. The LiFi founder and team stated they have been trying to decrease hacker volumes, though the bridge service has always seen some share of unwanted transactions. ZachXBT points to DPRK activity on bridges ZachXBT believes sudden peak volumes can signal the involvement of DPRK hackers trying to launder funds. The Bybit hack has still been a source of traffic for bridges, which caused increased chain-hopping to evade address screening. In the case of the LiFi bridge, ZachXBT estimates 15-25% of the activity may be due to the involvement of DPRK hackers. LiFi also works as a bridge aggregator, aiming to offer seamless cross-chain swaps. Previously, bridge activity was sometimes due to incentives or airdrop farming. Some chains have generally higher bridging activity, due to their active DeFi sector. Bridging is often a way to cash out of a protocol or a DeFi exchange. Bridges are among the most vulnerable smart contracts, often leading to sizeable attacks and the draining of funds. Bridge volumes have increased in the past month The investigations of ZachXBT coincide with a general growth in bridge volumes for the past month. Bridges remain key for the ecosystem, most often for moving funds between Ethereum and L2 chains. Arbitrum saw the most significant bridging activity in the past month, though not all bridge activity is based on organic demand. | Source: DeFi Llama Over $880M goes through various bridges daily, with most of the volume concentrated on top apps. Arbitrum saw the biggest bridging volumes in the past month, for a total of $2.77B. However, small bridges are also raising red flags for sudden spikes in volumes. Some of the bridges handle very low volumes, hence any deposit is a significant gain. For others, like the Hyperliquid bridge , activity is linked to increased demand for the underlying app. LayerZero , the leading bridge as of May 2025, also increased its net volumes in the past month, with significant daily spikes. Bridge activity also grows based on DEX demand and attempts to introduce cross-chain tokens. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

The Ethereum Foundation (EF), a pivotal organization driving the development of the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain, has recently announced a significant reorganization of its internal development team. This move, aimed at sharpening focus and accelerating progress, signals a strategic shift in how the EF approaches key challenges and opportunities facing the network. Understanding the Ethereum Foundation Restructure According to a June 2 announcement cited by Cointelegraph, the Ethereum Foundation has streamlined its operations. What was formerly known as the Protocol Research & Development (PR&D) unit has been rebranded simply as “Protocol.” This isn’t just a name change; it signifies a clearer, more concentrated mandate for the team. The core reason behind this restructure appears to be the need to channel resources and expertise into the most critical areas required for Ethereum’s continued evolution and success. As the network matures and faces increasing demands, focused effort becomes paramount. Key Pillars of Ethereum Development: Scaling, Blobspace, and UX The newly formed Protocol unit will concentrate its efforts on three distinct but interconnected areas crucial for future Ethereum development : Scaling Ethereum’s Base Layer: This involves fundamental improvements to the Ethereum protocol itself to handle more transactions and users directly on the mainnet. Think of this as strengthening the foundation upon which everything else is built. Increasing Blobspace Capacity for Rollups: A major focus area is enhancing the data availability layer specifically for layer 2 scaling solutions like rollups. Blobspace, introduced with the Dencun upgrade, provides a cost-effective way for rollups to post transaction data onto the Ethereum mainnet. Increasing its capacity is vital for reducing rollup fees and boosting their throughput, thereby improving overall Ethereum scaling . Enhancing the User Experience: This pillar focuses on making interacting with Ethereum easier, safer, and more intuitive for everyone, from developers building applications to end-users making transactions or using dApps. A better UX is key to broader adoption. These three areas represent the forefront of challenges and opportunities for Ethereum development today. Addressing them effectively is essential for Ethereum to remain competitive and fulfill its potential as a global settlement layer. Driving ETH Scaling Forward The emphasis on scaling the base layer and, particularly, on blobspace capacity for rollups highlights the EF’s commitment to tackling Ethereum’s throughput limitations. While rollups are currently the primary strategy for scaling, their efficiency is directly tied to the cost and availability of data space on layer 1 (blobspace). By dedicating a core team to increasing blobspace capacity, the EF is directly supporting the growth and affordability of the rollup ecosystem. This, in turn, benefits users through lower transaction fees and faster processing times. Simultaneously, exploring base layer scaling improvements ensures that the foundational layer continues to evolve and support the broader ecosystem. Meet the Leaders Guiding Ethereum’s Future To ensure these critical focus areas receive the attention they deserve, the Ethereum Foundation has assigned experienced developers to lead the charge: Tim Beiko: A prominent figure in Ethereum core development, known for coordinating All Core Developers calls. Alex Stokes: Another key contributor with deep technical expertise in protocol research and implementation. Barnabé Monnot: Recognized for his work on consensus mechanisms and protocol economics. These veteran developers have been officially tasked with overseeing the progress and initiatives within these newly defined focus points. Their leadership is expected to provide clear direction and accelerate the pace of development in these vital areas. Implications for the Ethereum Ecosystem This restructuring by the Ethereum Foundation has several implications for the wider ecosystem: Clearer Priorities: Developers and the community gain clarity on where the EF’s core protocol team’s efforts will be concentrated. Potential for Faster Progress: By narrowing the focus, the team may be able to achieve breakthroughs and implementations more quickly in the chosen areas. Impact on Layer 2s: Increased focus on blobspace directly benefits rollup projects, potentially leading to lower costs and increased adoption of Layer 2 solutions. Team Changes: The announcement also mentioned that some members of the former PR&D team are departing the organization. While specific details aren’t provided in the cited announcement, team transitions are a natural part of organizational restructuring and can sometimes bring fresh perspectives or allow individuals to pursue other opportunities within the broader crypto space. Overall, the move is a strategic pivot designed to optimize the EF’s impact on core Ethereum development , ensuring the network is well-positioned for future growth and adoption. Conclusion: A Strategic Move for Ethereum’s Future The Ethereum Foundation ‘s decision to restructure its core development team and laser-focus on scaling the base layer, expanding blobspace for rollups, and improving user experience is a significant and positive step. By concentrating expertise and resources on these critical areas, the EF is reinforcing its commitment to building a more scalable, efficient, and user-friendly Ethereum network. With seasoned leaders like Tim Beiko, Alex Stokes, and Barnabé Monnot at the helm of these efforts, the stage is set for accelerated progress in key areas that will shape the future of decentralized technology.

On June 2, the company revealed plans to launch an initial public offering (IPO) for 2.5 million shares of its 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock. This isn’t just standard corporate financing; the stated purpose directly ties back to Strategy’s core identity in the crypto space: funding additional Bitcoin purchases. This announcement immediately captured the attention of investors and crypto enthusiasts alike, highlighting the company’s continued commitment to its unique corporate Bitcoin strategy . What Exactly is Strategy Planning with These Preferred Shares ? Let’s break down the technical details. Strategy intends to offer 2.5 million shares of a specific type of stock. This isn’t the common stock you’d typically trade on the open market. It’s classified as 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock. What does that mean for potential investors and for Strategy? Preferred Stock: This type of stock has certain advantages over common stock, often including priority in receiving dividends and assets in the event of liquidation. However, preferred shareholders typically don’t have voting rights. 10.00% Series A: This indicates a specific class of preferred stock, likely with a fixed dividend rate of 10.00% per annum based on its liquidation preference (the value at which it would be redeemed). Perpetual: This suggests the stock does not have a maturity date; the company is not obligated to buy it back at a specific time, although it may have call options (the right to redeem it). Stride: This term might refer to specific features or terms outlined in the stock’s prospectus, unique to this particular series issued by Strategy. The offering is structured as an IPO, meaning it’s the first time this specific class of preferred shares is being offered to the public. This allows Strategy to raise a substantial amount of capital directly from investors interested in this specific financial instrument. Why is Strategy Doubling Down on its Corporate Bitcoin Strategy ? For years, Strategy , under the leadership of Michael Saylor, has been one of the most prominent corporate advocates for Bitcoin. Their strategy is straightforward: accumulate as much Bitcoin as possible and hold it as a primary treasury reserve asset. They view BTC as a superior store of value compared to traditional fiat currencies, offering a hedge against inflation and a potential for significant long-term appreciation. This latest offering is a clear signal that their conviction hasn’t wavered. Despite market volatility, Strategy continues to find ways to leverage its financial structure to increase its BTC holdings. Their existing substantial holdings are a testament to this strategy, and this new funding initiative aims to add even more digital gold to their balance sheet. It reinforces their position as a leading example of a company fully embracing a corporate Bitcoin strategy on a large scale. The Mechanics: How Does This Funding Work for BTC Acquisition ? According to the press release, the net proceeds from the offering will be used for “general corporate purposes.” While this is a broad term, the release specifically highlights two key areas: Bitcoin Acquisitions: This is the most exciting part for the crypto community. A significant portion of the funds raised will be directly allocated to purchasing additional Bitcoin on the open market. This increases Strategy’s overall exposure to the digital asset and further solidifies its position as a major corporate whale. Working Capital: Funds will also be used for general working capital needs. This is standard for any company, covering operational expenses, potential investments in their core business intelligence software, and other day-to-day costs. However, the explicit mention of BTC acquisitions alongside working capital leaves little doubt about the primary driver behind this financing round. By issuing preferred shares, Strategy can raise capital without diluting the voting power of its common shareholders. This financing method provides a stream of funding specifically intended to fuel their ongoing BTC acquisition efforts, demonstrating a creative approach to treasury management in the digital age. What Does Strategy’s Move Mean for the Bitcoin Market? Strategy is already one of the largest corporate holders of Bitcoin globally. When they announce plans to buy more, it sends a ripple through the market. Here’s what their continued accumulation could imply: Increased Buying Pressure: Direct purchases by a large entity like Strategy add demand to the market, which can potentially support the price of Bitcoin . Market Sentiment: Strategy’s actions are often seen as a bullish signal by the crypto community. It reinforces the narrative of institutional adoption and confidence in BTC as a long-term asset. Validation of Corporate Strategy: Other companies considering adding BTC to their balance sheets might look to Strategy’s ongoing efforts as a model or validation of the concept. While the exact amount of BTC Strategy will purchase with the proceeds depends on the final amount raised and the market price of Bitcoin at the time of purchase, the intention itself is a notable event for the market. Preferred Shares vs. Common Stock: A Quick Comparison Understanding the difference between the shares being offered and the common stock traded under the ticker MSTR is crucial. Here’s a simplified look: Feature Preferred Stock (Series A Perpetual Stride) Common Stock (MSTR) Ownership Type Senior claim on assets/earnings over common stock Basic ownership stake in the company Dividends Fixed rate (10.00% per annum) with priority payment Variable, declared by the board (Strategy does not currently pay common dividends) Voting Rights Typically none Usually one vote per share Potential for Appreciation Less direct correlation to company’s operational growth; tied to dividend yield and redemption value Directly tied to company’s performance and market perception (including BTC holdings) Risk Profile Lower risk than common stock in liquidation; dividend payments are more predictable (if paid) Higher risk than preferred stock; price is more volatile This offering provides investors with a different way to gain exposure to Strategy, primarily through a fixed-income-like instrument, rather than the direct equity exposure of common stock, which is more volatile and closely tracks the value of Strategy’s underlying assets, including its significant Bitcoin holdings. Key Takeaways and What to Watch Strategy’s plan to issue preferred shares for BTC acquisition is a significant development. Here are some key points and things to keep an eye on: Execution of the Offering: The success and terms of the IPO will determine the exact amount of capital raised. Amount of BTC Purchased: Monitor Strategy’s future announcements regarding their Bitcoin holdings to see how much BTC they acquire with the proceeds. Market Reaction: Observe how the market responds to both the offering itself and Strategy’s subsequent BTC purchases. Future Funding Rounds: Will Strategy continue to use similar financing methods to fund further BTC accumulation? This move highlights Strategy’s aggressive approach to leveraging financial markets to build its Bitcoin treasury, reinforcing its unique position at the intersection of traditional finance and the burgeoning digital asset economy.

Software Engineer Presents This $100M Liquidation As Proof,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-price-is-being-manipulated-software-engineer-presents-this-100m-liquidation-as-proof/,"A recent tweet by software engineer Vincent Van Code has brought renewed attention to allegations of systemic manipulation in the cryptocurrency market, particularly targeting major exchanges. In his post, Van Code stated, “This post reinforces what me and many others on here have been saying. XRP and many other crypto are manipulated. Binance is the worst of the worst.” The post refers to a detailed thread from crypto enthusiast Stellar Rippler, who outlines a high-profile liquidation event involving trader James Wynn and uses it to illustrate a broader pattern of market manipulation and data exploitation within centralized exchanges. This post reinforces what me and many others on here have been saying. #XRP and many other crypto are manipulated, Binance is the worst of the worst. https://t.co/4lRstLVTlO — Vincent Van Code (@vincent_vancode) June 1, 2025 Stellar Rippler’s thread opens by highlighting the story of James Wynn, a trader who reportedly lost over $100 million after placing significant long positions on Bitcoin. According to Rippler, Wynn’s sudden liquidation was not merely a case of market volatility but an orchestrated outcome designed to maximize profits for the exchanges. Rippler argues that the most alarming revelations came after the trades were executed and Wynn publicly reflected on the experience by tweeting, “Money is not real.” Exchanges Allegedly Exploiting User Data and Market Control The thread asserts that major crypto exchanges possess full visibility into user behavior, including open positions, leverage ratios, liquidation levels, and even inferred emotional states based on trading patterns. Rippler suggests that this data access enables exchanges to manipulate market movements strategically. He claims that many of the largest platforms operate internal market-making desks that serve as counterparties to user trades. With access to users’ positions and the ability to shift liquidity, these desks allegedly manufacture sudden price movements that trigger mass liquidations—events referred to as “engineered wicks.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 This strategy, Rippler claims, ensures that exchanges profit from both sides of the trade, particularly when using leverage, which is described as a “profit center” for these entities. The post states that over $10.3 billion in liquidations were recorded in 2023, attributing much of this volume to deliberate liquidation targeting. Wynn’s $100 million loss, in this context, is portrayed as part of a systemic pattern rather than an isolated incident. Lack of Regulation Compared to Traditional Markets Drawing comparisons with traditional finance, Rippler contrasts crypto platforms with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), which, under U.S. regulations, does not trade against users and maintains a separation between custody and execution. He stresses that practices such as wash trading and insider dealing are prosecutable in traditional markets, while many crypto exchanges operate with no such oversight. Binance is mentioned specifically, with Rippler referencing its $4 billion legal settlement and guilty plea by its CEO as proof of misconduct in the industry. The thread closes by linking these practices to the long-standing controversy surrounding XRP . According to Rippler, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s lawsuit against Ripple in 2020, coupled with restrictions on XRP’s U.S. trading, created artificial market conditions that held back price discovery and investor participation. He notes that during this period, central banks and large institutions reportedly explored the technology behind closed doors. XRP, Regulatory Delays, and the Question of Suppression Vincent Van Code’s endorsement of the thread underscores a growing sentiment among some in the crypto community that the markets remain fundamentally compromised. His specific inclusion of XRP in the discussion ties into longstanding accusations that the asset has been subject to price suppression through both regulatory action and market tactics. While the allegations remain unproven in court, and specifics of Wynn’s liquidation have not been independently verified, the viral nature of Stellar Rippler’s thread and its amplification by developers like Van Code suggest continued skepticism over the integrity of centralized crypto markets.

Crypto groups urge lawmakers to keep the bill focused, as unrelated amendments threaten delays. Citigroup forecasts the stablecoin market could grow to $2 trillion by 2030. Crypto industry groups are urging US lawmakers to advance a landmark stablecoin bill as it heads to the Senate floor this week, warning that unrelated amendments could derail long-awaited regulatory clarity. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act is poised for Senate debate, following a procedural green light on May 19. The measure, which would establish clear rules for stablecoin issuance and oversight, is expected to have sufficient votes to move to the House. Crypto Groups Urge Lawmakers to Prioritize Stablecoin Oversight Bill Several crypto advocacy organizations, the Blockchain Association, Crypto Council for Innovation, Digital Chamber, and DeFi Education Fund, issued a joint statement on June 2, calling on lawmakers to prioritize the bill’s “targeted and comprehensive approach to stablecoin oversight” as it advances through potential amendments. After initial Democratic hesitation due to concerns over former President Donald Trump’s crypto ties, including a family-backed stablecoin initiative, support for the bill has strengthened in recent weeks. However, the legislation faces a new hurdle: a proposed amendment on credit card fees. Senators Dick Durbin and Roger Marshall are pushing to attach the Credit Card Competition Act (CCCA), which would force networks like Visa and Mastercard to compete on swipe fees charged to merchants. The move is strongly opposed by banks and card companies, who argue it represents government overreach. Crypto advocates fear the controversial amendment could derail progress. “Unacceptable,” is how James Czerniawski of Americans for Prosperity described the proposal, adding that it would harm consumer credit access. Today, the executives of the four leading digital asset industry groups jointly issued the following statement on the GENIUS Act.

Without consensus on these amendments, procedural delays could push final Senate passage into the week of June 9, according to journalist Eleanor Terrett. Stablecoin Market to Surge 10x to $2 Trillion by 2030 Citigroup has projected a dramatic rise in the stablecoin market, forecasting that its total market capitalization could soar from nearly $240 billion today to over $2 trillion by 2030 . The prediction says the growth in adoption would be driven by regulatory developments and increased interest from both financial institutions and the public sector. According to the banking giant, stablecoin supply could reach $1.6 trillion by the end of the decade under its base-case scenario, while a more optimistic outlook places the figure at $3.7 trillion. As reported, the number of active stablecoin wallets has surged by over 50% in the past year , reflecting growing adoption and engagement within the digital asset ecosystem.

This approval now legally allows RLUSD to be used by Ripple and other DFSA-licensed businesses within Dubai’s financial free zone. Ripple says RLUSD is backed 1:1 with US dollars, supported by high-quality liquid assets, with segregated reserves, external audits, and clear redemption rights. The stablecoin is reportedly designed for enterprises, not casual retail use. Jack McDonald, Ripple’s Senior Vice President of Stablecoins, said the new approval reflects the company’s goals. “The DFSA’s approval of RLUSD is proof of our commitment to building a stablecoin that meets the highest standards of trust, transparency and utility,” Jack said. He added that the stablecoin’s regulatory-first design is tailored to push institutional use of blockchain across international markets, beginning with cross-border payments. Ripple integrates RLUSD into its payments system With the DFSA’s approval in place, Ripple now has the ability to embed RLUSD into its DFSA-licensed payments solution. This lets the company combine the functions of a blockchain-based infrastructure with a trusted digital dollar that can operate smoothly across its existing global payout network. Unlike stablecoins created for users swapping tokens on exchanges, RLUSD was developed for businesses needing more reliable transaction rails. It targets the speed, cost, and complexity issues common in traditional international payments. The approval also extends to any other licensed company working inside the DIFC. That means RLUSD can now be legally used by other DFSA-regulated firms. The DIFC had nearly 7,000 companies operating at the close of 2024, according to Ripple, showing a broad field of potential adopters. Ripple claims it has seen a 55% year-over-year jump in stablecoin activity across the region in 2024. Reece Merrick, Ripple’s Managing Director for the Middle East and Africa, described the region as a hotbed of crypto activity. “The DFSA’s approval of RLUSD is yet another step forward for Ripple’s operations in the region,” Reece said. Ripple is already locking in deals to put its regulated infrastructure to work. The company recently confirmed that Zand Bank and Mamo will be the first customers in the UAE to start using Ripple’s blockchain-powered payments offering. The announcement also comes alongside Ripple’s new partnership with local firm Ctrl Alt, which will support the Dubai Land Department’s (DLD) new Real Estate Tokenization Project. That initiative will involve placing real estate title deeds directly onto the XRP Ledger, bringing blockchain to land ownership in a tangible, government-backed way.

He had predicted the Bitcoin decline from $109,000 back down and then called a bottom at $77,000, predicting the BTC price would bounce to new all-time highs, which it did. Now, with the Bitcoin price recoiling from hitting a new all-time high above $111,000, the crypto analyst is back with next steps and where the cryptocurrency could be headed from here. Why The Bitcoin Price Golden Cross Matters In his X post, Doctor Profit starts out by explaining the psychology of the current market, calling out those who continue to call out for a bear market. He refers to these people as ‘exit liquidity’ for the real players, hinting that they’re wrong for their stance. Rather, he points out an important formation in the Bitcoin price chart and that is the Golden Cross, which appeared last week. Related Reading: 312 Million Dogecoin Moved To Coinbase – What’s Going On? The analyst calls the appearance of this Golden Cross “a macro-level signal with historic accuracy.” He explains that since this signal is so rare, but has been right every time, there is no reason to deviate from it. Also, he further explains that the Golden Cross has always been a long-game signal. Hence, results are not expected to start showing so early. The Golden Cross pattern had appeared on the weekly chart, and the crypto analyst highlights its historical accuracy. Each time that the Bitcoin price has formed this Golden Cross, it has usually led to a multi-month rally. If this is the case this cycle, then it suggests that the Bitcoin bull run is far from over. Don’t Worry About The Bears After the Golden Cross pattern appeared, another concerning development had taken place on the Bitcoin price chart and that is a bearish divergence on the weekly timeframe. Normally, this means an end to the rally and that the price could start to plummet. However, the crypto analyst seems unfazed by this. He refers to a similar bearish divergence appearing when the Bitcoin price was trading at $80,000 and nothing happened. Since the cryptocurrency had continued its bullish run at that point, the analyst takes this as a hint that the bearish divergence is lagging and only appeared due to Donald Trump’s tariff announcement last week. “No actionable value here,” Doctor Profit said. Things To Watch Out For So far, Doctor Profit attributes the drawdown in the Bitcoin price to “standard cycle behavior.” This includes profit-taking from short-term holders who bought in the last six months, while long-term holders remain unmoved. Another bullish factor includes the fact that BlackRock’s outflows remain low despite Trump’s renewed tariff war. Related Reading: Bitcoin Still Bullish, But $200,000 Off The Table And $137,000 In Sight Formations on the Bitcoin price chart that show bullish tendencies include a Cup and Handle pattern on the daily chart that puts the breakout zone between $113,000 and $115,000. Also, the Bitcoin price has been recording higher highs and higher lows after recording its bottom at $74,000, which shows trend support remains strong. The Bitcoin price is also trading above all major moving averages (MAs), including the 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages. Last but not least, Doctor Profit also pointed out that the MACD line has crossed above the signal line on the weekly chart. This means that momentum remains in favor of the bulls. Given this, the analyst believes “there is no reason to be scared at all.” Featured image from Dall.E, chart from TradingView.com",Bitcoin|analyst|bitcoin|Bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT|crypto|crypto analyst|crypto news,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|DOGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-06-03 08:00:35

A recent development from the renowned crypto investment firm Paradigm highlights this drive for innovation. Paradigm Research has introduced a fascinating new concept aimed at tackling a specific challenge within DeFi: efficiently managing large pools of stablecoins. This proposal outlines a hypothetical system they call Orbitals AMM . What Problem Does Orbitals AMM Aim to Solve? Before diving into Orbitals, let’s quickly touch upon Automated Market Makers (AMMs). At their core, AMMs are protocols that automate trading by using liquidity pools instead of traditional buyer-seller order books. Users trade against the pool, and pricing is determined by algorithms based on the ratio of assets within the pool. AMMs are foundational to many DeFi platforms, enabling seamless token swaps. Existing AMMs, while effective for pairs or small groups of assets, face challenges when dealing with very large pools containing numerous stablecoins. Imagine a pool holding not just USDC, USDT, and DAI, but potentially dozens or even hundreds of different stable assets. Managing liquidity and ensuring efficient swaps in such a high-dimensional space becomes incredibly complex. This is where the need for new DeFi Innovation arises. The primary problem Orbitals seeks to address is improving capital efficiency within these large-scale Stablecoin Pools . In traditional AMMs, liquidity can be spread thinly across the entire price range, leading to slippage, especially for large trades. Concentrated liquidity, a concept popularized by Uniswap v3, helps by allowing liquidity providers (LPs) to allocate their capital to specific price ranges where trading is expected to occur. However, applying this concept effectively to pools with many different assets is a significant hurdle. How Does Orbitals AMM Propose to Work? According to The Block, the Orbitals AMM proposal extends the idea of customizable concentrated liquidity into higher-dimensional spaces. While the specifics are highly technical, the core idea seems to involve creating a structure that allows liquidity to be concentrated not just along a single price curve (as in a 2-asset pool) but across multiple dimensions representing the relationships between numerous assets in the pool. Think of it like this: In a simple two-asset AMM, liquidity is concentrated along a line segment. In a three-asset pool, it might be concentrated within a 2D plane or surface. For a pool with 10,000 assets, you’re dealing with a space of 9,999 dimensions! Orbitals proposes a way to define and manage liquidity within this complex, multi-dimensional environment efficiently. The proposal suggests a method for LPs to specify where their liquidity should be active within this high-dimensional space, much like specifying a price range in Uniswap v3, but generalized for many assets. This targeted approach is intended to ensure that capital is utilized where it’s most needed for swaps, reducing slippage and increasing returns for LPs. Potential Benefits of the Orbitals Concept If successfully implemented, a system like Orbitals could bring several significant advantages to the DeFi ecosystem: Enhanced Capital Efficiency: By allowing liquidity to be concentrated precisely where swaps are likely to occur across numerous stablecoins, Orbitals could drastically reduce the total amount of capital required to support large trading volumes with minimal slippage. Support for Massive Stablecoin Pools: The concept is specifically designed to handle pools with a very high number of assets (from 2 up to potentially 10,000), opening the door for highly diversified stablecoin baskets or pools including a wide range of tokenized real-world assets. Improved Trading Execution: For traders, concentrated liquidity means less slippage on large trades within these multi-asset pools, leading to better execution prices. New Opportunities for LPs: Liquidity providers could potentially earn higher fees on their deployed capital due to increased efficiency and targeted liquidity provision. This kind of forward-thinking DeFi Innovation is crucial for the continued growth and maturity of the decentralized finance space, particularly as the variety and volume of stable assets increase. Are There Challenges with High-Dimensional AMMs? While the potential benefits are exciting, developing and implementing an Automated Market Maker as complex as Orbitals presents significant challenges: Complexity: Understanding and managing liquidity in a high-dimensional space is inherently complex, both for the protocol design and for liquidity providers. The user interface and tooling required to make this accessible would need to be exceptionally well-designed. Gas Costs: Performing calculations and state updates in such a complex system on a blockchain could potentially lead to high gas costs, although layer 2 solutions or specific protocol optimizations might mitigate this. Risk Management: LPs would need sophisticated tools to manage their positions and understand the risks associated with providing liquidity in specific multi-dimensional ranges. Impermanent loss calculation and mitigation become significantly more complicated. Implementation Difficulty: Building a robust and secure smart contract system for Orbitals would be a major undertaking, requiring extensive auditing and testing. These challenges mean that while the Paradigm Research proposal is groundbreaking, bringing it from concept to a production-ready protocol is a long and difficult road. Why This Research Matters for Stablecoins and DeFi The proposal for Orbitals AMM underscores the ongoing effort within the crypto space to build more robust and efficient financial infrastructure. As the number and types of stablecoins grow – from fiat-backed to crypto-backed and algorithmic – the need for efficient mechanisms to swap between them becomes more critical. Large, efficient Stablecoin Pools are essential for stability, arbitrage, and facilitating complex transactions within DeFi. Paradigm’s work here is a prime example of how dedicated research can identify pain points in existing systems and propose entirely new paradigms (pun intended!) to overcome them. Whether Orbitals is ultimately built exactly as proposed or inspires other similar designs, this research contributes valuable ideas to the public domain, pushing the entire field of Automated Market Maker design forward. It’s a reminder that DeFi is not just about deploying existing protocols; it’s about continuous innovation and theoretical exploration to build the financial systems of the future. According to The Block, this proposal is currently a hypothetical concept, but its potential implications for liquidity management in multi-asset environments are significant. In Conclusion: A Glimpse into the Future of Liquidity The Orbitals AMM concept from Paradigm Research represents a significant step forward in the theoretical understanding of how to manage liquidity in complex, multi-asset environments. By extending concentrated liquidity into higher dimensions, it offers a potential pathway to dramatically improve capital efficiency for large-scale Stablecoin Pools and other baskets of correlated assets. While the path from proposal to practical implementation is fraught with technical challenges, this kind of fundamental research is vital for the long-term health and growth of decentralized finance. It highlights the exciting possibilities that lie ahead for DeFi Innovation , promising more efficient, robust, and versatile Automated Market Maker designs that can handle the increasing complexity of the digital asset landscape.

Robinhood, the popular U.S. mobile platform known for stock and crypto trading, has officially announced the completion of its acquisition of Bitstamp, one of the world’s longest-standing cryptocurrency exchanges. This isn’t just another industry headline; the Robinhood Bitstamp Acquisition is a significant development with wide-ranging implications for both companies and the broader crypto market. If you’re invested in crypto or use either platform, you’ll want to understand what this means. Robinhood Bitstamp Acquisition: The Deal Details The announcement, made on Robinhood’s official website, confirms the finalization of the deal that was initially agreed upon in June 2024. Valued at a substantial $200 million, the acquisition was paid entirely in cash. This move signals Robinhood’s serious commitment to expanding its presence and capabilities within the cryptocurrency space. Here’s a quick breakdown of the core transaction: Acquirer: Robinhood Markets, Inc. Acquired: Bitstamp Ltd. Value: $200 million USD Payment Method: 100% Cash Initial Agreement: June 2024 Completion Announced: [Insert Date of Announcement – Assuming recent based on prompt] Completing this crypto acquisition is a strategic maneuver that positions Robinhood for significant growth and diversification. Why This Robinhood Crypto Move Matters: Licenses and Global Footprint One of the most compelling aspects of the Robinhood Bitstamp Acquisition is the immediate and substantial expansion of Robinhood’s regulatory reach and geographic presence. Bitstamp brings with it a wealth of operational experience and, crucially, a large number of licenses and registrations across the globe. Robinhood stated that this deal enables them to secure more than 50 licenses and registrations worldwide. Why is this important in the crypto world? Regulation is complex and varies significantly by jurisdiction. Holding licenses in multiple key markets allows a platform to legally offer crypto trading and related services to a much wider audience. For Robinhood, which has primarily focused on the U.S. market, acquiring Bitstamp is a fast track to becoming a truly global player. The acquisition specifically targets expansion into critical markets: Europe: A large and established crypto market with varying regulatory frameworks. UK: A significant financial hub with evolving crypto regulations. U.S.: While Robinhood is based here, Bitstamp’s existing U.S. licenses and infrastructure can complement and potentially enhance Robinhood’s current offerings. Asia: A massive growth market for crypto adoption. Expanding into these regions is not just about reaching more users; it’s about building a resilient business that can navigate diverse regulatory landscapes and tap into different pools of liquidity and customer demand. This significantly bolsters Robinhood Crypto ‘s ambition. Bitstamp Exchange Brings Institutional Crypto to Robinhood Beyond retail trading and geographic expansion, the acquisition of Bitstamp Exchange provides Robinhood with something entirely new: an institutional crypto business. Bitstamp has a long-standing reputation and infrastructure that serves institutional clients, including banks, hedge funds, and other financial firms looking to engage with digital assets. Entering the Institutional Crypto market is a major step for Robinhood. While their core business has historically been retail-focused, the institutional space represents a different scale of trading volume, liquidity needs, and service requirements. By acquiring Bitstamp’s established institutional arm, Robinhood gains: Immediate access to an existing institutional client base. Expertise in providing services tailored to institutional needs (e.g., custody, execution, reporting). Potential for higher trading volumes and revenue streams compared to retail alone. Enhanced credibility within the broader financial ecosystem as a platform capable of serving sophisticated clients. This move diversifies Robinhood’s business model and positions them to capture a share of the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. It signals a maturity in Robinhood’s crypto strategy, moving beyond just offering spot trading to individual users. Benefits and Synergies of This Crypto Acquisition Bringing Robinhood and Bitstamp together creates several potential benefits and synergies: Expanded Asset Offerings: Bitstamp lists a wider range of cryptocurrencies than Robinhood currently does. The acquisition could lead to more assets becoming available to Robinhood users over time. Improved Liquidity: Combining the trading volumes and order books of both platforms could potentially lead to deeper liquidity, resulting in better prices and execution for traders. Enhanced Technology and Security: Both platforms have developed robust trading technology and security infrastructure. Sharing best practices and integrating systems could improve the overall platform performance and security for users. Diversified Revenue Streams: Robinhood gains revenue from Bitstamp’s global retail and institutional businesses, reducing reliance solely on its U.S. retail operations. Regulatory Navigation: Bitstamp’s experience navigating diverse global regulations can be invaluable for Robinhood’s international expansion efforts. This crypto acquisition is designed to leverage the strengths of both entities to create a more powerful and globally competitive digital asset platform. What Are the Challenges Ahead for Robinhood and Bitstamp? While the potential benefits are clear, integrating two companies, especially across different geographies and business models, comes with challenges: Integration Complexities: Merging technology platforms, operational processes, and company cultures can be difficult and time-consuming. Regulatory Hurdles: While Bitstamp brings licenses, maintaining compliance across 50+ jurisdictions is an ongoing challenge that requires significant resources and expertise. Market Competition: The crypto exchange landscape is highly competitive, with many established global players. Robinhood will need to effectively differentiate itself. Maintaining Reputation: Bitstamp has a long history and a reputation as a reliable exchange, particularly among institutions. Robinhood will need to ensure this reputation is maintained and enhanced post-acquisition. Talent Retention: Ensuring key personnel from Bitstamp remain with the combined entity is crucial for retaining operational knowledge and relationships, particularly in the Institutional Crypto space. Successfully navigating these challenges will be key to realizing the full potential of the Robinhood Bitstamp Acquisition . Actionable Insights for Users and the Market What does this mean for you, whether you’re a Robinhood user, a Bitstamp user, or simply watching the market? For Robinhood Users: Potentially look forward to a wider range of supported cryptocurrencies and potentially enhanced trading features as integration progresses. The move signals Robinhood’s continued commitment to crypto. For Bitstamp Users: While integration details will unfold, the acquisition by a large, publicly traded company like Robinhood could potentially bring more resources, innovation, and potentially greater liquidity to the platform. Stay informed about any changes to terms of service or platform features. For the Market: This acquisition is a bullish signal for the crypto industry, showing that major traditional finance players like Robinhood are deepening their commitment to digital assets. It highlights the growing importance of regulatory compliance and global reach in the exchange business. The entry of a stronger player into the Institutional Crypto space could also accelerate broader adoption. Keep an eye on official communications from both Robinhood and Bitstamp for specific details on platform changes and timelines. A New Chapter for Robinhood Crypto The completion of the Robinhood Bitstamp Acquisition marks a pivotal moment for Robinhood. For $200 million in cash, Robinhood has significantly accelerated its global expansion plans, gained access to over 50 crucial licenses, and successfully entered the lucrative Institutional Crypto market via the reputable Bitstamp Exchange . This strategic crypto acquisition transforms Robinhood Crypto from primarily a U.S. retail offering into a potentially formidable global player with a diversified business serving both retail and institutional clients. While integration challenges lie ahead, the completion of this deal is a clear statement of Robinhood’s intent to be a major force in the future of digital asset trading worldwide.

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto coin in presale, priced attractively at $0.03 and quickly gaining traction for its innovative DeFi model. While ADA remains a top cryptocurrency due to its smart contract ecosystem and long-term stability, many are betting that MUTM could be the next big crypto to deliver exponential gains, with projections hinting at a 100x surge to $3 during the next bull run. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is selling at $0.03 and is gaining interest rapidly. Already, more than $9.8 million has been raised in the presale of Mutuum Finance, with 11,600 people participating so far, who will witness the tokens appreciate to $0.035 as phase six begins. For those searching for the best crypto to invest in, especially among emerging projects, MUTM is increasingly being seen as a gem hiding in plain sight. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Steam as a Rising DeFi Player Mutuum Finance is attracting even greater investor interest with its growing decentralized finance (DeFi) lending platform. Leveraging cutting-edge DeFi technology and crypto lending features, the platform has already raised over $9.8 million and built a community of 11,600 holders. Currently, MUTM tokens trade at $0.03, with the following presale round having the price rise to $0.035. The early investors will achieve returns of up to 100%, with the token debuting at a price of $0.06. Increasing Credibility with Certik Audit Mutuum Finance’s groundbreaking lending infrastructure is reshaping decentralized markets while cementing its reputation in the DeFi space. A huge milestone was achieved with the successful conduct of a smart contract audit by Certik a move that drastically boosts investor trust. With this seal of approval Mutuum Finance is now among the top crypto projects to watch. Leaderboard Feature Boosts Community Engagement To further tap into its users Mutuum Finance has introduced a leaderboard-based gamification featuring the top 50 token owners in real time. The leaders will receive bonus tokens creating a fun and competitive way to drive more users up the board and remain there. Early Investors Rewarded, Community Continues to Grow As the platform gains traction Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 prize each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. Many find the Buy-and-Distribute feature in the Mutuum Finance model one of its most outstanding traits. It works by purchasing tokens on the open market and giving them to people who take part in staking so the staking process keeps happening and maintains the tokenomics. Because the tokens support an active community this strategy calls for investors who are in it for the long term. Cardano (ADA) holders are now eyeing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as the next major breakout with the presale price of $0.03 projected to skyrocket to $3. Backed by over $9.8 million raised and 11,600+ investors, MUTM’s rapid momentum is powered by a hybrid DeFi lending model, a completed Certik audit, and unique features like gamified leaderboards and a Buy-and-Distribute mechanism. With token prices set to rise to $0.035 in the next presale phase and launch at $0.06, early backers are positioned for strong gains.

After periods of significant inflows or relative stability, June 2 marked a notable shift, with these investment vehicles experiencing substantial net outflows. This development offers a glimpse into current market sentiment and the dynamics at play within the burgeoning Bitcoin ETF market . US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Register Significant Net Outflows According to data shared by Trader T (@thepfund) on X, June 2 saw a combined total of $267.64 million worth of net outflows from US spot Bitcoin ETFs. This figure represents the aggregate flow across all currently operating spot Bitcoin ETFs in the United States. Let’s break down which specific ETFs contributed to this total: BlackRock’s IBIT: This fund, often a leader in inflows, recorded the largest net outflow for the day at $130.56 million . ARK Invest’s ARKB: ARK’s offering followed, with net outflows totaling $73.91 million . Fidelity’s FBTC: Fidelity’s fund also saw significant outflows, amounting to $50.11 million . Grayscale’s GBTC: While GBTC has historically seen large outflows since converting, its outflow on this particular day was relatively smaller at $16.47 million compared to the others. Interestingly, not all funds experienced outflows. Bitwise’s BITB stood out as the only ETF to record a net inflow, albeit a modest one, totaling $3.41 million for the day. Other ETFs in the market reported no changes in their holdings on June 2. Understanding Bitcoin ETF Outflows: Why Do They Matter? When we talk about Bitcoin ETF outflows , we’re essentially seeing investors pulling their money out of these specific investment products. This can happen for various reasons: Profit Taking: Investors might sell their shares after a period of price appreciation to lock in gains. Market Sentiment: A shift in overall sentiment towards Bitcoin or the broader market can lead to selling pressure. Reallocation: Investors might move funds to other asset classes or investment opportunities. Macroeconomic Factors: Broader economic news or changes in interest rates can influence investment decisions across all markets, including crypto. These flows are important because they provide insight into the demand for Bitcoin via these regulated investment vehicles. Significant and sustained outflows could signal waning investor appetite or a shift away from this particular access point to Bitcoin. Navigating the Current Bitcoin ETF Market Landscape The introduction of US spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year was a landmark event, opening up a new avenue for traditional finance participants to gain exposure to Bitcoin. These ETFs have quickly become a significant part of the overall Bitcoin ETF market globally and are closely watched indicators of institutional investment interest. While a single day of outflows, even one totaling over $267 million, doesn’t necessarily indicate a long-term trend reversal, it highlights the dynamic nature of the market. Fund flows in and out of these ETFs can be influenced by daily price movements, news events, and broader market liquidity. It’s crucial for investors to look at the flow data over a longer period to identify potential trends rather than focusing solely on a single day’s figures. The cumulative flows since the launch of these ETFs still represent a substantial amount of capital that has entered the Bitcoin ecosystem. Spotting Broader Crypto ETF Trends Monitoring Crypto ETF trends , including those for Bitcoin, provides valuable context for the wider digital asset space. As more types of crypto ETFs are approved or proposed in various jurisdictions, understanding the flow dynamics helps gauge investor confidence and the maturing infrastructure around crypto as an asset class. Outflows in one type of crypto product could coincide with inflows into others, or they might reflect a general risk-off sentiment. Conversely, strong inflows often accompany periods of positive price momentum and heightened investor optimism. The performance of these ETFs and their flow patterns are likely to continue playing a key role in the narrative around institutional investment in cryptocurrencies. They act as a bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world, and their activity is a closely watched metric by analysts and investors alike. Conclusion: A Day of Outflows in Focus June 2 presented a notable day for US spot Bitcoin ETFs , with the market collectively experiencing significant net outflows led by major players like BlackRock and ARK. While Bitwise managed to attract some inflows, the overall picture for the day was one of capital leaving these funds. This event serves as a reminder of the volatility and rapid shifts that can occur in the crypto market, influencing the flow of funds even within regulated investment products like ETFs. Keeping an eye on these flows remains essential for anyone tracking the health and direction of the Bitcoin ETF market and broader Crypto ETF trends driven by institutional investment .

In a new video analysis, technical strategist Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) argues that the price plateau masks a structural shift now visible on every major Ethereum chart. “I’m seeing things that are so historical that I had to make a video about it—it just cannot be ignored,” he told viewers at the outset. Ethereum Flashes Bullish Setup Not Seen Since 2020 On the monthly ETH-USD chart, Kevin begins by zooming out to the monthly ETH-USD chart. The price, he reminds viewers, has “done nothing but trade in a massive range” ever since April 2021, masking the kind of compression that often precedes violent expansion. The tell-tale turn, in his view, came this April when Ethereum wicked into the $1,400 area only to reverse and close with a candle he labels a “massive demand candle.” That pattern, he notes, has appeared only twice before on a monthly ETH chart—each time after a major correction and each time followed by sustained upside. The May candle delivered confirmation: a 41% body that lifted price back above the long-term super-trend, an area many technicians had already written off as “guaranteed to break.” Related Reading: Ethereum Supply On Exchanges Hits 7-Year Low – Breakout Loading? What makes the structure “so historical,” Kevin argues, is the alignment of high-momentum indicators that rarely fire together. The monthly stochastic RSI is about to execute what he calls a “V-shaped cross” out of oversold territory; the last clean cross marked the 2020 macro bottom. The MACD histogram, meanwhile, has been compressing into what he likens to a symmetrical triangle that has taken four years to complete, signalling “coiled energy” that can only resolve in a large directional move. Even on-chain money-flow readings, he says, are “tied for the lowest level in history—but already reversing,” implying that deep-pocketed holders have begun to accumulate while retail sentiment remains subdued. Kevin then pivots to the dominance metrics that, in his framework, dictate whether a move in Ethereum can spill over into the broader altcoin market. On Ethereum-dominance he pulls up Heikin-Ashi candles to show the first green print in more than a year exactly at the zone that formed the 2019–20 base. “We’re at the same spot ETH dominance bottomed in 2019,” he says, pointing to a series of demand candles that mirror the pre-bull-run pattern of the last cycle. A Market Cipher buy signal has just appeared, the VWAP has crossed the zero line, and money flow is curling up from all-time-low depths. In Kevin’s view, the implication is clear: “Whales are starting to accumulate, and nobody is paying attention.” Related Reading: Ethereum Price At $8,000: Pundit Predicts Parabolic Run For ETH The ETH/BTC ratio completes the trifecta. Here Kevin shows the pair tagging the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement of the entire 2020-21 advance, printing its own demand candles and flipping green on the Heikin-Ashi readout. More striking to him is the monthly stochastic RSI, which has spent 1,066 days—almost three full years—below the 20 threshold that traditionally marks bear-market exhaustion. “It’s game time,” he declares. “This thing is getting ready to cross back up, and the negativity on ETH is happening right under everyone’s nose.” Underlying the technical case is a macro backdrop Kevin believes is becoming incrementally supportive. “You don’t actually need the Fed to cut,” he tells viewers. “We just need guidance—looser policy on the horizon, decent inflation prints—and Ethereum will do the rest.” Historically, he argues, a decisive rotation in ETH has been the trigger for what he calls “durable altcoin outperformance,” because it signals that risk capital is migrating down the market-cap spectrum. In that sense, a true Ethereum breakout is less a single-asset story than a signal for an entire sector. Sceptics will note that Ethereum still faces heavy resistance in the $2,800–3,000 zone and that previous rallies have stalled at that ceiling. Kevin concedes the level is critical but insists the weight of monthly signals makes a sustained breach increasingly likely. “These are monthly timeframes,” he cautions. “They don’t play out overnight, but the evidence says the multi-year bear market in ETH-BTC is ending.” At press time, ETH traded at $2,607.

On Tuesday, the Solana Foundation announced it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), a move that signals deeper regional ambitions and long-term infrastructure plans. Still, Solana (SOL) barely budged, trading around $160 despite the strategic implications. Here’s a deeper dive. A Power Move in the MENA Region This MOI sets the stage for tangible initiatives in Dubai, including talent development programs, data-sharing efforts, workshops, and advisory sessions – all building toward a Solana Economic Zone in the city. “This partnership helps Solana founders plug directly into that momentum,” the foundation shared on X.

Earlier on Monday, NewGenIVF Group Limited, a fertility services provider based in Asia, revealed it would be investing $30 million into Solana staking – a massive leap from its initial $1 million Bitcoin buy in December 2024. “The decision to scale our investment from our initial $1 million Bitcoin position to this substantial $30 million Solana commitment reflects our growing conviction in digital assets as a legitimate asset class,” said Siu Wing Fung Alfred, Founder and CEO of NewGen. It’s a surprising source, sure. While the timing may be coincidental, the back-to-back announcements paint a picture of rising institutional confidence in Solana. Love to see it. Technicals Paint a Cautious Picture Despite the bullish headlines, SOL’s price action has been muted. The token broke below a key ascending trendline last week and dipped over 9%, settling at $157 over the weekend. At the time of writing, it hovers just below the 200-day EMA at $163.22, a critical resistance zone. Technical indicators remain cautious – RSI sits at 45, below neutral, and the MACD shows a bearish crossover. If the 200-day EMA holds, SOL could revisit its May 6 low of $141.41. But if bulls reclaim $163.22, a push toward $184.13 is back on the table. The Big Picture: A Long Game in Motion! Solana’s push into Dubai is about embedding itself into the foundations of global Web3 policy and infrastructure. Add in major capital inflows like NewGenIVF’s staking commitment, and the long-term narrative for SOL continues to build. Whether or not the charts catch up in the short term, Solana is clearly positioning for something bigger.

Key Takeaways: Pi Network users are frustrated over second migration prompts and unresolved KYC issues. A massive 276 million PI token unlock in June could add significant selling pressure to the market. Pi Coin remains under bearish pressure, with $0.64 support at risk and lower levels possible if sentiment worsens. On X, many Pi Network users shared screenshots of their app’s updated checklist. Even those who had already completed their initial migration were surprised to see new prompts for action. “This Pi of a thing is nonsense.

Still I am stacked pic.twitter.com/xLmH9yaNgC — Gemechis Demelash (@GemechisDemela2) June 2, 2025 A popular parody account of Pi Network founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis fueled speculation with a viral post declaring, “PI NETWORK 2ND MIGRATION HAS BEGUN!” The message, which quickly gained traction, urged users to prepare for Mainnet by completing several steps: submitting KYC verification, finalizing their checklist (including wallet and lockup settings), and approving Pi transfers for Mainnet. The post claimed that completing these steps would enable users to unlock real-world utility for their Pi coins, including purchasing goods and services, accessing Pi-powered decentralized apps (dApps), and participating in broader Web3 innovation. However, the Pi Core Team has yet to confirm any new migration phase through verified channels. All this comes as Pi Network prepares to unlock 276 million PI tokens in June, a supply event valued at roughly $176 million, according to data from PiScan . With trading volumes low and sentiment fragile, this unlock could severely test market resilience. Pi Coin Remains Under Pressure as Bears Dominate Pi Coin continues to trade under pressure , hovering around the $0.64 mark. The 30-minute chart shows a prolonged downtrend from the May 12 highs, with price consolidating near the lower Bollinger Band at $0.6410. RSI (14) at 40.27 signals weak buying momentum, while MACD remains flat, indicating indecision. Zooming into the 5-minute chart, Pi faces a similar picture. RSI has dropped to 29.00, oversold territory, suggesting that short-term sellers are dominating. MACD is also trending negative, with no bullish divergence in sight. The lack of volume spikes further confirms fading interest. On the 1-minute chart, Pi tested intraday lows of $0.6405, while RSI briefly dipped to 30.90 before a slight bounce. However, lower highs and lower lows persist, keeping the near-term bias bearish. With the massive 276 million PI token unlock looming this month, downside risks remain elevated. If $0.64 breaks decisively, the next support lies at $0.60, followed by the psychological $0.40 level. To flip the narrative, bulls would need to reclaim the $0.65-$0.66 zone with strong volume.

Meanwhile, Singapore’s Monetary Authority has taken a hardline stance by ordering all local crypto firms to halt overseas services by June 30 unless licensed under strict domestic financial laws. Legal experts warned that such licenses will be rare due to heightened anti-money laundering risks. In contrast, Russia is embracing crypto innovation through tightly controlled channels. State-owned bank Sber introduced a Bitcoin-linked structured bond and plans to launch crypto exchange-traded products, all within the confines of Russian law. Overall, governments around the world are intensifying their scrutiny and oversight of the cryptocurrency industry, with Australia, Singapore, and Russia each adopting distinctly different approaches. AUSTRAC Cracks Down on Crypto ATM Fraud Australia’s national financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, implemented new regulations that are aimed at curbing the rising number of scams involving cryptocurrency ATMs. As of June 3, crypto ATM operators must adhere to a cash transaction cap of 5,000 Australian dollars (which is approximately $3,250), alongside enhanced customer due diligence measures, better scam awareness displays, and more robust transaction monitoring protocols. While the limits currently only apply to crypto ATM providers, AUSTRAC is encouraging crypto exchanges that accept cash to consider adopting the same restrictions. Part of AUSTRAC’s announcement The decision was made after findings from an AUSTRAC-led task force launched in September to assess whether existing Anti-Money Laundering and counter-terrorism controls in the crypto ATM space were sufficient. The task force analyzed data from nine major ATM providers and found that people over the age of 50 were overrepresented, and accounted for almost 72% of all transactions by value. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas shared that the new rules were instituted to deter criminals from directing vulnerable people to use crypto ATMs and to prevent businesses from being exploited. He added that the regulations are not permanent and will be reviewed over time in collaboration with law enforcement and industry stakeholders. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) are also concerned, and reported that 150 unique crypto ATM scam cases were submitted via ReportCyber between January of 2024 and January of 2025. These incidents resulted in losses exceeding 3.1 million Australian dollars. However, the AFP believes this figure likely underestimates the true scale, as many victims either don’t realize they’ve been scammed or are reluctant to come forward. Crypto ATMs in Australia (Source: Coin ATM Radar ) Australia experienced a surge in crypto ATM installations since late 2022, growing from just 67 in August of that year to 1,819 today. This makes it the third-largest market globally. Localcoin leads the domestic market with 753 machines, followed by Coinflip with 700 and Bitcoin Depot with 182. Singapore Orders Crypto Firms to Halt Overseas Services Countries like Singapore are also cracking down on illegal crypto activity. Singapore’s central bank recently issued a firm deadline for all local digital token service providers (DTSPs) to cease offering services to overseas markets by June 30, 2025. The directive was announced by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and comes in response to industry feedback on the proposed regulatory framework under the Financial Services and Markets Act (FSM Act) of 2022. MAS made it clear that no transitional arrangements will be provided. This means that all affected entities must either shut down their overseas operations or obtain a license by the end of the month to remain compliant. Under Section 137 of the FSM Act, any Singapore-based individual, company, or partnership engaging in digital token-related services outside the country is presumed to be operating from Singapore and is therefore subject to local licensing requirements. This includes firms for whom token services are not a core business activity. MAS warned that violators of this law could face fines of up to 250,000 Singapore dollars, approximately $200,000, and up to three years in prison. Only firms already licensed or exempted under existing financial laws, like the Securities and Futures Act, Financial Advisers Act, or Payment Services Act, may continue their operations without conflicting with the new restrictions. Post from Hagen Rooke (Source: LinkedIn ) While the framework does allow for the possibility of licensing, legal experts suggest that approvals will be extremely rare. In a LinkedIn post , Hagen Rooke, a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, explained that MAS is unlikely to issue many licenses due to the high regulatory risks associated with overseas operations, particularly around anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CFT). He advised affected companies to urgently consider operational restructuring to sever any Singaporean ties that might trigger compliance obligations. The move is a serious escalation in Singapore’s oversight of the crypto sector and places a lot of regulatory pressure on firms that use the country as a base to offer digital asset services internationally. MAS’s concern is that such firms could exploit legal loopholes by claiming Singapore incorporation while conducting largely unregulated business abroad. Russia’s Sber Rolls Out BTC-Backed Investment Product Some countries are taking steps to open up more to crypto. Russia’s largest commercial bank, Sber, officially launched a new financial product that links investors to the performance of Bitcoin and the dollar-to-ruble exchange rate. The offering is a structured bond available on the over-the-counter market, and it allows qualified investors to earn income based on the rise in the US dollar value of Bitcoin as well as fluctuations favoring the dollar over the Russian ruble. Sber announced that it plans to list the product on the Moscow Stock Exchange to increase transparency, liquidity, and ease of access for eligible participants. Announcement from Sberbank The move is a big shift in Russia’s financial landscape, and it was announced just days after the Bank of Russia gave the green light for regulated institutions to offer certain crypto-linked instruments to accredited investors. Importantly, the central bank still prohibits direct cryptocurrency sales by financial institutions. Sber’s structured bond is fully compliant with Russian regulations, as it is denominated in rubles and does not require investors to interact with crypto wallets or offshore platforms. This approach ensures that the product remains within a tightly controlled legal framework, which mitigates some of the risks that are often associated with unregulated crypto exposure. In addition to the bond, Sber also announced plans to offer more crypto-related exchange-traded products via its SberInvestments platform. The first of these, a Bitcoin futures product, is expected to launch on June 4, pending the Moscow Exchange’s formal rollout. Sber’s growing engagement with crypto-linked assets is part of a trend within Russia, where other major institutions like T-Bank also introduced similar investment products. T-Bank’s offering is described as a “smart asset,” and is backed by the state-supported tokenization platform Atomyze.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-03 09:38:40

In a significant development for the digital asset space, Aptos CEO , Avery Ching, is scheduled to appear before the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture on June 4th. This appearance marks a pivotal moment, offering a direct line for a leading figure in the blockchain industry to communicate the tangible benefits and potential of this technology to key policymakers. Why is the US Congress Interested in Blockchain Technology? The U.S. House Committee on Agriculture might seem an unusual venue for discussions on advanced digital ledger technology. However, its jurisdiction extends significantly into areas critical for the future of finance and digital assets, particularly concerning market structure and trading oversight. As cryptocurrencies and blockchain applications become more integrated into global financial systems and various industries, committees like this are tasked with understanding their implications to inform potential regulatory frameworks. For years, discussions around blockchain technology have often been confined to technical circles or the financial sector. However, its potential applications stretch far beyond speculative trading. Policymakers are increasingly recognizing the need to understand how this technology functions and how it could impact various sectors under their purview, from finance to supply chains, and even potentially agriculture-related markets or tracking systems. What Real-World Impact Can Blockchain Technology Offer? One of the core messages Avery Ching is expected to deliver centers on the real-world impact of blockchain technology. This goes beyond the volatile world of crypto trading and delves into practical applications that can bring efficiency, transparency, and security to existing systems. Think about areas ripe for disruption: Supply Chain Management: Tracking goods from origin to destination with immutable records, reducing fraud and increasing transparency. Digital Identity: Creating secure, verifiable digital identities that users control. Financial Inclusion: Providing access to financial services for the unbanked or underbanked populations globally. Secure Data Sharing: Enabling secure and auditable exchange of sensitive information across organizations. Intellectual Property Rights: Creating clear, timestamped records of ownership for creative works and inventions. Avery Ching, as the leader of Aptos Labs, is well-positioned to articulate these benefits. Aptos is a relatively new blockchain network built with scalability, safety, and upgradeability in mind, aiming to support widespread adoption of Web3 applications. Their focus is on building a foundation for mainstream use cases, which directly aligns with the theme of real-world application. Who is Avery Ching and Why is His Testimony Significant? Avery Ching is a prominent figure in the blockchain space, bringing a strong technical background from his time at Meta (formerly Facebook) where he worked on the Diem blockchain project. His role as Aptos CEO places him at the forefront of developing high-performance blockchain infrastructure designed for mass market adoption. Testifying before the US Congress is a significant opportunity for several reasons: Direct Education: It allows for direct, unfiltered communication about blockchain’s capabilities and potential to policymakers who are shaping future regulations. Building Trust: A public testimony can help demystify blockchain and build confidence in its legitimacy and utility beyond speculative investment. Influencing Policy: By highlighting practical applications and the potential for positive economic and societal impact, Ching can help advocate for regulatory approaches that foster innovation rather than stifle it. Representing the Industry: Ching’s testimony represents not just Aptos, but broadly, the segment of the blockchain industry focused on building foundational technology for future applications. His testimony could help shift the narrative around blockchain in Washington D.C., moving from one solely focused on risks and illicit activity to one that also recognizes its potential as a powerful tool for solving complex problems and driving economic growth. What Are the Potential Challenges and Opportunities Discussed? While the focus will likely be on the positive real-world impact , it’s also probable that the testimony will touch upon the challenges facing widespread blockchain adoption. These include: Regulatory Uncertainty: The lack of clear, consistent regulations in the U.S. remains a major hurdle for businesses building on or using blockchain. Scalability: Ensuring blockchain networks can handle the transaction volume required for mass adoption of real-world applications. User Experience: Making blockchain technology accessible and easy to use for the average person. Security Risks: Addressing vulnerabilities and ensuring the security of digital assets and data. Public Perception: Overcoming skepticism and negative perceptions often linked to cryptocurrency volatility and scams. Ching’s testimony offers an opportunity to present how technologies like Aptos are addressing these challenges through technical innovation and a focus on safety and reliability. It’s a chance to showcase the maturity of the technology and its readiness for broader integration into the economy. What Actionable Insights Can We Glean from This Testimony? For those watching the space, this testimony provides several key takeaways: Increased Regulatory Focus: The fact that a blockchain CEO is testifying before Congress underscores the growing attention policymakers are paying to this technology. This suggests that regulatory clarity, while potentially slow, is likely on the horizon. Shift Towards Utility: The emphasis on real-world impact signals a maturing industry focusing on practical applications beyond speculation. This is a positive sign for the long-term viability of blockchain technology. Industry Engagement is Key: The industry is actively engaging with regulators to educate and inform. This proactive approach is crucial for shaping sensible policy. Aptos’s Position: Aptos Labs is positioning itself as a leader in building foundational technology for mainstream adoption, gaining visibility and credibility through such engagements. Investors, developers, and businesses should pay close attention to the details of the testimony and the committee’s response. It could offer insights into the regulatory direction and the types of blockchain applications that policymakers view favorably. Looking Ahead: The Future of Blockchain and Policy Avery Ching’s appearance before the US Congress is more than just a single event; it’s part of a larger ongoing dialogue between the rapidly evolving world of blockchain and the institutions responsible for governing markets and technology. The goal is to bridge the knowledge gap and foster an environment where innovation can thrive responsibly. The outcomes of such testimonies might not lead to immediate legislative changes, but they are crucial for building a foundation of understanding. As blockchain technology continues to mature and its real-world impact becomes more evident, informed policy becomes essential to harness its potential while mitigating risks. In conclusion, the upcoming testimony by Aptos CEO , Avery Ching , before the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture represents a vital step in bridging the gap between cutting-edge blockchain development and regulatory understanding in the US Congress . By focusing on the tangible, positive real-world impact of blockchain technology, Ching has the opportunity to educate policymakers and advocate for a regulatory environment that supports innovation and widespread adoption. This event underscores the increasing seriousness with which both the industry and government are approaching the future of digital assets and distributed ledger technology, signaling a move towards integrating these powerful tools into the fabric of the global economy.

The token climbed steadily from $6.09 to $6.40, establishing key support above the $6.30 level. Market volatility remains elevated, fueled by geopolitical risk and speculation surrounding rate cuts in Europe and the U.S. Still, UNI appears to be benefiting from risk rotation as traders seek upside in altcoins, with price holding firm despite choppy conditions. A sharp spike in volume during the early hours of the session, particularly at $6.5557, marked a potential short-term top. However, subsequent pullbacks were met with aggressive buying, reinforcing a bullish bias and keeping UNI on track for further gains — provided it can sustain price action above the $6.30-$6.33 zone. Technical Price Highlights UNI exhibited strong bullish momentum over 24 hours, climbing from 6.09 to 6.40, representing a 5.09% gain despite significant price swings. The token established a clear uptrend with higher lows until encountering resistance at 6.57, followed by a sharp rejection with abnormally high volume (3.89M) at 02:00, creating a high-volume resistance zone. Support has formed around the 6.30-6.33 range where buyers consistently stepped in, while the overall range of 0.49 (8.07% of starting price) demonstrates substantial volatility. In the last hour, UNI experienced significant volatility with a notable recovery pattern, dropping to 6.36 before establishing higher lows and highs. Volume spiked dramatically to 56,320 at 07:59, confirming buyer conviction at these levels. Price action formed a clear support zone around 6.38-6.39, while resistance near 6.41 was tested multiple times.

The bull market is very much intact, and the king of the cryptocurrencies is moving into a final, potentially explosive stage. The general trend is up It might be argued that certainly in the United States, and in the global economy, the US stock market is the yardstick of the direction in which the biggest world economy is going. Yes, economic, political, and world conflict events are going to provide shocks and tremors to the market, but with global liquidity on the rise, it would seem that at least into the end of 2025 the general directional trend is up. S&P 500 reentering all-time high territory Source: TradingView It’s when one looks at the monthly chart for the S&P 500 that the longer term picture comes fully into focus. What did the Trump tariffs do? They allowed a highly overbought stock index to reset with a 21% dip to a strong support level. Just look at the size of the wick on that monthly candle that tested 4,800 points. That this dip was so rapidly bought up is testament not only to the confidence that the market has in the economy going forward, but also in the knowledge that the steamroller of increasing global liquidity is not likely to falter any time soon. The big test is fast approaching, where resistance awaits at around 6,000 points. Once/if this is broken, and consolidation takes place above, the S&P 500 can resume the general pattern that started in early 2023 of fairly consistent new all-time highs. Finally, looking at the monthly Stochastic RSI at the bottom of the chart it can be seen that the indicators are crossing back up, signifying big upside price momentum is about to arrive. $BTC retests support after wedge breakout Source: TradingView Before moving on to the long-term chart for $BTC a quick drill down into the very short term 4-hour chart shows that the price did in fact eventually break out of the falling wedge. It can be seen that now the price could be coming back to test the top of the wedge, which could take it back to the $104,000 support, with a potential bounce, either from there, or the current $105,000 level. Monthly chart suggests bullish continuation for $BTC Source: TradingView The monthly chart shows the current bull market in all its glory. Free of the day-to-day noise, it shows that the price is heading into what could be the third big wave higher. The monthly candle close for May is a very good one, with the top of the candle closing nicely above the previous candle body highs. There is the possibility that the price could still come back down to $102,000 and confirm those candle body tops as support. Towards the bottom of the chart, the Stochastic RSI is showing a bullish cross up of the indicators, and at the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index reveals that the indicator line is on top of the yellow moving average line. All is set for a continuation of this rise. Those who have the knowledge and fortitude to ignore the sometimes wild short to medium term price action will be the ones who come out ahead in this bull market. Ignore the very high time frame at your peril. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

45450921,https://cryptonews.com/?p=367283,1748943735,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/52/45450921.jpeg,CZ Proposes Dark Pool Perp DEX to Tackle Market Manipulation Risks,https://cryptonews.com/news/cz-proposes-dark-pool-perp-dex-to-tackle-market-manipulation-risks/,"Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao has proposed building a dark pool-style decentralized exchange for perpetual contracts. In a post on X, he raised concerns over the risks created by full transparency in on-chain trading. CZ believes now is a good time for someone to develop a more private, secure trading solution. CZ’s comments come in the wake of a major liquidation event involving $100 million in Bitcoin long positions on Hyperliquid, reportedly held by trader James Wynn. Crypto whale @JamesWynnReal has exited his $1.25B Bitcoin long on Hyperliquid at a $13.4M loss. The 40x leveraged bet saw $40M in paper gains before turning red. #Hyperliquid #Bitcoin https://t.co/mUpMzr17kj — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) May 25, 2025 The liquidation followed Bitcoin’s drop below $105,000 and sparked allegations on X that some users may have coordinated efforts to trigger Wynn’s liquidation. Order Visibility Threatens Large Traders CZ said he has long questioned why decentralized exchanges allow real-time visibility of user orders. While transparency is a key feature of DeFi, he argued it puts large traders at a disadvantage. “If you’re looking to purchase $1 billion worth of a coin, you wouldn’t want others to see it,” he wrote. “People might try to buy before you, effectively front-running you.” Given recent events, I think now might be a good time for someone to launch a dark pool perp DEX. I have always been puzzled with the fact that everyone can see your orders in real-time on a DEX. The problem is worse on a perp DEX where there are liquidations. Even with a CEX… — CZ BNB (@cz_binance) June 1, 2025 On perp DEXs, the risk is greater, as traders’ liquidation points are often visible on-chain. CZ warned this could allow others to manipulate the market and force liquidations, especially against large leveraged positions. In traditional finance, institutional traders avoid this risk by using dark pools, private exchanges that allow large trades without alerting the public order book. According to CZ, dark pool volumes are typically 10 times larger than those of “lit” public exchanges. Even centralized crypto exchanges offer more privacy than DEXs, he noted, since order books are not tied to identifiable wallet addresses. This level of anonymity helps protect against targeted attacks. CZ Calls for a Privacy-Focused Perp DEX CZ suggested that now might be the right moment to build a dark pool perpetual DEX using privacy technology such as zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs. This could involve not showing the order book or hiding smart contract deposits until after a delay. “A dark pool style DEX + perps, either by not showing the orderbook, or even better not showing deposits into smart contracts at all, or until much later. This should be doable with ZK or similar encryptions,” he said. The idea, he added, is not meant to dismiss the benefits of transparency. CZ acknowledged that some traders and market makers might prefer public data for better liquidity and order absorption. But he emphasized that different market participants need different tools. CZ concluded his post by encouraging developers building such a product to reach out to him. However, he clarified there are no guarantees of investment or response. “This is just a Sunday idea,” he wrote. The idea gained traction among users who shared similar concerns. Another user proposed building the solution using ZK rollups on a Layer 2 network, to which CZ responded , “That’s one possible way too. There are many possible tech solutions.” The post CZ Proposes Dark Pool Perp DEX to Tackle Market Manipulation Risks appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|CZ|James Wynn|Perpetual Futures,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|ZRX|BNB|ZK,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-03 09:42:15

But newly surfaced details raise serious questions about the exchange’s transparency and the timeline of its disclosure. The Coinbase customer breach that involved the leak of sensitive user data including customer names, IDs, phone numbers, addresses, and more, has raised security questions across the industry. The exchange revealed the incident on May 15, 2025, adding that the attackers had attempted a $20 million ransom-style extortion. However, Reuters reports suggest that the exchange learned of the breach much earlier in the year, as far back as January. Coinbase previously admitted in its May SEC filing that it learned of accessed employee data “in previous months” but failed to grasp the full extent of the threat until it received the extortion demand from the cybercriminals. As the events progressed, the true extent of the coordinated scheme became clear. Coinbase customer data breach ties to insider operation The breach reportedly began with an India-based employee of TaskUs, a U.S. outsourcing firm. According to former employees of the firm, the employee was caught photographing customer data from her work computer using her personal device. Along with a suspected accomplice, she allegedly sold sensitive Coinbase user information to malicious actors in exchange for payment.

Security breaches have long remained a threat to the crypto industry, with malicious actors constantly lurking in the shadows to prey on unsuspecting victims. In May alone, hacks and exploits led to an estimated $244.1 million in losses , highlighting the high stakes involved in such incidents.

Can the critical $0.80 support level stop further breakdwon? Ondo Finance ( ONDO ) price has recently broken its uptrend structure, forming a lower high and then breaking below the lower trendline of an ascending broadening wedge pattern, resulting in a lower low at $0.78. That pullback also sliced through the key horizontal support zone at $0.90. Buyers stepped in at the $0.78 swing low, driving a recovery that has pushed the price back to $0.85 at press time. Despite this, ONDO remains well below the EMA 20 and has yet to reclaim the key $0.90 level to signal a potential shift in momentum. The current support at $0.80 appears strong, as the price was supported here previously — on pullback following the first higher high in mid-April, when the uptrend had just began. However, momentum is weak—RSI sits at 40, below the neutral 50 level and under its moving average, signaling a lack of bullish strength. On the MACD, there are early signs that bearish momentum may be fading, indicated by shrinking red histogram bars.

A strong move above this level, supported by follow-through and solid volume, could open the door to a retest of the $1.00 mark—the recent lower high. However, to fully reclaim the previous bullish structure, ONDO price would also need to break above the most recent peak at $1.10. On the downside, a breakdown below the key support at $0.80 could potentially send ONDO toward the next major support around $0.70. On the fundamental side, Ondo Finance recently met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . In that meeting, which took place in late April, the firm’s leadership team joined legal representatives from Davis Polk & Wardwell to discuss how traditional financial regulations might apply to tokenized securities .

This development highlights the increasing trend of companies exploring digital assets for corporate reserves and strategic financial management. What’s Behind Classover’s Ambitious Solana (SOL) Plan? Classover Holdings has signed a securities purchase agreement with Solana Growth Ventures, outlining a potential funding infusion of up to $500 million. This substantial capital is earmarked specifically for building a treasury reserve based on the Solana blockchain ecosystem. The initial phase of this funding involves $11 million, contingent upon meeting customary conditions. What’s particularly noteworthy is the allocation plan: up to 80% of the net proceeds from this funding is intended for direct purchases of SOL , Solana’s native cryptocurrency. This strategic decision by Classover to anchor its treasury reserve in SOL suggests a long-term view on the potential of the Solana network. Solana is known for its high throughput and low transaction costs, characteristics that could be appealing for managing a dynamic corporate treasury in the blockchain space. Why a Crypto Treasury? Understanding the Trend The concept of a crypto treasury involves a company holding cryptocurrencies as part of its balance sheet or financial reserves, similar to how traditional companies hold fiat currency, gold, or other assets. This trend gained significant traction with early corporate adopters like MicroStrategy and Tesla. Companies might choose to build a crypto treasury for several reasons: Potential Growth: Cryptocurrencies, while volatile, offer potential for significant appreciation, which could enhance the company’s overall financial position. Diversification: Holding digital assets can provide diversification away from traditional fiat-based reserves. Alignment with Innovation: For tech companies, holding crypto can align their balance sheet with the innovative technologies they might be exploring or integrating. Ease of Transaction: For companies operating globally, certain cryptocurrencies can offer faster and cheaper cross-border transactions. Classover’s decision to build a treasury specifically focused on Solana and SOL indicates a belief in the specific strengths and future prospects of this particular blockchain ecosystem. The Significance of a $500M Cryptocurrency Investment A potential cryptocurrency investment of up to $500 million is a substantial amount, regardless of the company or the asset. For Classover, an EdTech company, this represents a bold strategic pivot into the digital asset space. For the Solana ecosystem, it signifies growing institutional confidence and potentially a significant source of demand for SOL tokens as funds are deployed for purchases. Let’s break down the potential scale: Initial Phase: Funding: $11 million Estimated SOL Purchase (up to 80%): Up to $8.8 million Potential Full Funding: Funding: Up to $500 million Estimated SOL Purchase (up to 80%): Up to $400 million Such large-scale purchases, especially if executed over time, could have a notable impact on market dynamics for SOL . What Are the Potential Benefits and Challenges for Classover? Embarking on a large-scale cryptocurrency investment strategy comes with both opportunities and risks. Potential Benefits: Significant potential upside if the value of SOL appreciates. Strategic alignment with the future of digital finance and blockchain technology. Potential for yield generation or participation in the Solana ecosystem through staking or DeFi protocols (though the announcement specifically mentions treasury reserve). Potential Challenges: Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile, which could lead to significant fluctuations in the value of the treasury reserve. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving in many jurisdictions, posing potential compliance risks. Security Risks: Managing and securing large amounts of cryptocurrency requires robust security infrastructure to prevent hacks or loss. Market Liquidity: Deploying and potentially liquidating such a large amount of SOL would need careful market execution. Classover’s partnership with Solana Growth Ventures suggests a level of strategic guidance and support from within the Solana ecosystem, which could help navigate some of these challenges. Looking Ahead: EdTech Meets Blockchain Treasury This move by Classover is a compelling example of how companies outside the traditional finance or pure-play crypto sectors are exploring the strategic benefits of blockchain technology and digital assets. It signals a growing confidence in Solana as a platform capable of supporting significant corporate financial operations. While the initial funding is $11 million, the potential for up to $500 million represents a massive commitment. How Classover manages this treasury, the performance of SOL , and the broader implications for corporate adoption of crypto treasuries built on specific blockchains like Solana will be keenly watched by both the tech and crypto communities. In Conclusion Classover Holdings’ plan to build a significant Solana -based crypto treasury with potential funding up to $500 million is a landmark development. It underscores the increasing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies like SOL and highlights the strategic considerations companies are making regarding their financial reserves in the digital age. This ambitious cryptocurrency investment by an EdTech company could pave the way for further cross-industry adoption of blockchain treasury solutions.

On June 1, Schwartz posted an image of a slot machine win totaling $1,458.30 with a larger potential prize of $11,106.78. The caption contained only one word, “Jackpot.” Although the tweet made no mention of Ripple or XRP, the numbers displayed in the image quickly became the subject of online discussion. Schwartz’s long-standing pattern of sharing vague or playful content has led many in the community to view even casual posts as possible hints or signals. Jackpot! pic.twitter.com/z1dpgyuOub — David 'JoelKatz' Schwartz (@JoelKatz) June 1, 2025 Community Reactions Range From Excitement to Skepticism Following the post, XRP holders quickly began sharing their interpretations. Some pointed to the $11,106.78 amount on the screen, speculating that it could reference a future price prediction or major event for XRP. A user replied , “$11,106.78 XRP confirmed,” sparking further commentary. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Others took a more humorous view. One community member joked about a likely return of Schwartz’s cryptic messaging, writing that a week of riddles might follow. Schwartz responded with a meme, indicating that the post was likely intended to be lighthearted. At the same time, some followers expressed frustration with how even unrelated tweets can become overanalyzed. One comment noted that the CTO could share any content, such as a picture of his dog, and some in the community would still try to extract hidden meanings. Post Gains Traction Despite Lack of Context Despite containing no official information or references to upcoming developments, the post rapidly gained visibility. It attracts hundreds of thousands of views in a short time, showing how the XRP community follows Schwartz’s activity. The tweet’s timing, vague content, and the community’s heightened sensitivity to potential Ripple news contributed to the speculation. However, no clarification or follow-up has been provided by Schwartz. This brief tweet serves as a reminder of how the XRP community continues to scrutinize the actions of Ripple leadership. Whether intended as a simple personal post or something more, the reaction reflects the ongoing anticipation around XRP and the influence of public figures within the ecosystem.

The acronym, for Trump Always Chickens Out, has become a major talking point when analyzing Trump’s ongoing trade war. Could it explain why most cryptos are trading sideways at the moment? Given the market uncertainty due to Trump’s constantly changing trade wars, Bitcoin is losing some of its shine, and people are asking, What are the best altcoins to buy now? Time for a closer look. Trump, Master of Unpredictability, Continues His Work What’s the single biggest factor limiting crypto growth right now? It’s not the US regulatory environment, which is increasingly pro-crypto. Indeed, right now Congress is in session debating a landmark stablecoin bill. It’s not even the US economy, which has proven surprisingly resilient. It’s Trump’s approach to the trade wars he himself initiated. On key geopolitical issues, like the war in Ukraine, Trump shows signs of changing his tune. And on tariffs and direct trade-related matters, he’s again demonstrating his trademark indecision, with a surprise increase in steel and aluminum tariffs (mostly targeted at China) the latest development. The cryptocurrency market has had to grapple with the fallout, as President Trump’s erratic economic strategies cast a shadow over investor confidence and stall the momentum of digital assets. That was clear in $BTC ETF outflows following Trump’s latest announcements. A net $430M outflow on Friday and another $130M on Monday highlight how rattled investors are. Adding to the risk potential is the approaching end to the 90-day ‘pause’ in tariffs Trump placed on most US trading partners. We’re well over halfway through the pause period, and sky-high tariffs could resume as early as July unless something changes. And yet, TACO uncertainty hasn’t caused widespread losses, but rather a curious mixture of gains, sideways trading, and localized losses. Market Stability Hides Crypto Gains and Falls For one thing, Bitcoin has remained remarkably stable, mainly trading sideways around $105K. There’s not a lot of movement lately, with $BTC down around 0.2% over the past 24 hours. Despite this, market sentiment remains pro-Bitcoin, with news of more companies moving to purchase Bitcoin. Beyond Bitcoin, the rest of the crypto market is a mixed bag. Solana ($SOL) – down 9.4% over the past week, as questions remain about proposed $SOL ETFs Dogecoin ($DOGE) – down 15% over seven days, even as Elon Musk leaves the US Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) XRP ($XRP) – down 5.34% over the week, even while trading volume remains high Cardano ($ADA) – down 10.33% in a week, but up 3.16% daily, fighting to break through a key $0.70 price barrier It can’t all be blamed on Trump; $XRP and $ADA’s trials could be down to their waiting on the SEC for long-running ETF applications. But, as far as uncertainty goes, even SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw says the SEC needs to do more to provide clarity. While Trump and the SEC decide what to do next, crypto presses on. Here are three of the best altcoins poised to quietly make big gains despite the uncertainty. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Free Bitcoin Airdrops for $BTCBULL Holders What’s one way to profit from crypto? Build a project around the most profitable crypto, Bitcoin itself. BTC Bull ($BTCBULL) does just that. Buy $BTCBULL , hold it on your Best Wallet app , and you could earn free $BTC when Bitcoin’s price reaches $150K and $200K. You can also look forward to a mega $BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin reaches $250K. It’s one of the easiest ways to diversify your exposure to Bitcoin. With $BTCBULL, you have four ways to earn: Presale $BTCBULL staking $BTCBULL price increase post-launch $BTC airdrop for token holders using Best Wallet app $BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin hits $250K On the other hand, token burns for $BTCBULL are programmed for when $BTC hits $125K, $175K, and $225K, reducing supply and driving up the price of $BTCBULL. This Yin and Yang structure of alternate airdrops and token burns keeps BTC Bull Token moving in tandem with $BTC, though at a far, far lower price. $BTCBULL currently costs just $0.002545, but our price prediction shows the token could increase 230% to reach $0.0084 by year’s end. Remember to hold your tokens in the Best Wallet app and stay tuned to the $BTCBULL X channel to ensure you get your share of those airdrops. When the requirements are posted, act fast to secure your free Bitcoin. Visit BTC Bull Token presale page . Cardano ($ADA) – Will Growing Adoption Power $ADA Past Resistance? Cardano has an interesting story. Only a few years ago, it was touted as one of the legendary ‘Ethereum killers,’ heir to Ethereum’s spot as the number 2 crypto behind Bitcoin. Cardano and XRP, among others, were tipped to break through with faster transaction speeds and lower fees, stealing Ethereum’s crown as the leading DeFi protocol. These days, though, Ethereum seems safer than ever in second place. So, rather than try to replace Ethereum, chains like Cardano have evolved alongside it. The Cardano network recently passed 110M transactions, indicating broad adoption and support. And yet, the token’s price hasn’t been able to break through the $0.70 resistance mark, held back by futures volatility and ETF uncertainty. If it does push through, could Cardano make big gains and return to its recent highs above $1.20? Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Top Utility for Next-Generation Crypto Wallet Best Wallet Token ($BEST) is the native token of a top Web3 wallet, Best Wallet. Aside from being non-custodial, no-KYC, multi-chain, and highly secure, the Best Wallet app is the only crypto wallet focusing on presales. It offers a built-in ‘Upcoming Tokens’ section that gathers the top crypto presales in one place, letting investors research and purchase tokens long before they reach the open market. The $BEST token dials wallet functionality up to 11, adding: Early access to the best new crypto projects Higher staking rewards Reduced transaction fees $BEST holders can also participate in community governance and make their voice heard on the direction of the project. The Best Wallet app is easy to use without compromising security. Best Wallet users can also look forward to the arrival of Best Card, which will let them use crypto to pay for goods and services offline as easily as using a credit card. The Wallet + Card +Token combo could push $BEST to $0.035215– up 40% from its current $0.025125, as our price prediction shows . Learn how to buy Best Wallet token , and join a presale already past the $12.9M mark. Visit Best Wallet Token . Will Trump TACOs Deliver Good Deals? The big question with TACO is this; is Trump shooting from the hip, or orchestrating a masterful deal? If uncertainty continues, Bitcoin and the best altcoins could continue to muddle along without significant gains or losses. But if Trump demonstrates his art of the deal one more time, it could send Bitcoin – and $BTCBULL, $ADA, and $BEST – rocketing upwards. Remember, though – always do your own research.

The nation’s financial intelligence agency, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), has announced new, stricter operating rules and transaction limits specifically targeting crypto ATM operators. This move is a clear signal from Australian regulators about their intent to prevent the potential misuse of these machines for illicit activities. Understanding the New Australia Crypto ATM Rules The core of AUSTRAC’s new framework for crypto ATM operators revolves around enhanced anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) measures. The primary goal, as reported, is to prevent criminal abuse of crypto ATMs. These machines, while offering convenient access to cryptocurrencies, can also pose risks if not properly regulated, potentially becoming conduits for money laundering or other financial crimes. So, what exactly are the key components of these new Australia crypto ATM rules ? AUSTRAC has outlined several specific requirements and limitations: Transaction Limits: A strict cap of $3,250 AUD has been placed on both deposits and withdrawals per transaction at crypto ATMs. This limit aims to make it harder for large sums of illicit funds to be moved through these machines without scrutiny. Fraud Warning Signs: Operators are now required to display prominent warning signs about potential scams and fraud associated with cryptocurrency transactions. This is a crucial step in protecting consumers who might be vulnerable to fraudulent schemes. Strengthened Transaction Monitoring: Crypto ATM operators must implement more robust systems to monitor transactions. This includes identifying suspicious patterns of activity that might indicate money laundering or other criminal behaviour. Enhanced Customer Due Diligence (CDD): Operators are mandated to strengthen their processes for identifying and verifying their customers. This means customers using crypto ATMs may face more rigorous identity checks, particularly for transactions approaching the new limit. These measures collectively represent a significant tightening of oversight for Crypto ATM operators Australia . Why is AUSTRAC Introducing These Crypto Regulations? AUSTRAC’s role is to protect Australia’s financial system from criminal abuse. Cryptocurrencies and the infrastructure surrounding them, like ATMs, are relatively new technologies that can be exploited by criminals seeking to move illicit funds outside traditional banking channels. By introducing these specific AUSTRAC crypto regulations , the agency is proactively addressing these risks. The convenience of crypto ATMs – allowing users to quickly convert cash to crypto or vice versa – makes them attractive targets for illicit activities. Without proper controls, they could facilitate layering or integration stages of money laundering. These new rules are designed to build a stronger regulatory perimeter around this specific part of the crypto ecosystem. What Do the New Crypto ATM Limits Australia Mean for Users and Operators? The introduction of these limits and requirements has distinct implications for both the businesses running the machines and the individuals using them. For Crypto ATM Operators Australia: The new rules necessitate operational changes. Operators must: Update their software to enforce the $3,250 transaction limit. Revise their Know Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) procedures to meet AUSTRAC’s enhanced requirements. This might involve implementing new identity verification technologies or processes. Install physical signage for fraud warnings at their ATM locations. Invest in or upgrade their transaction monitoring systems to detect suspicious activity more effectively. Potentially face increased compliance costs and administrative burdens. Ensure staff are adequately trained on the new procedures and regulations. Compliance is not optional. Failure to adhere to these new AUSTRAC crypto regulations could result in significant penalties. For Users of Crypto ATMs: For individuals using crypto ATMs, the most noticeable change will be the transaction limit. If you typically conduct larger transactions, you will need to use alternative methods, such as cryptocurrency exchanges. You may also encounter more stringent identity verification steps, even for transactions below the limit, as operators strengthen their CDD processes. While potentially less convenient for high-value users, these measures are intended to increase the safety and integrity of the service, protecting users from unwittingly participating in illicit financial flows or falling victim to scams highlighted by the new warning signs. How Do These Australian Crypto Laws Fit into the Bigger Picture? These specific rules for crypto ATMs are part of a broader effort by the Australian government to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. Australia has been actively working on how to regulate the crypto sector, addressing everything from exchange licensing to consumer protection. These Australian crypto laws are evolving, and the ATM rules represent a targeted intervention in a specific area identified as high-risk. Compared to some other jurisdictions, Australia is taking a measured approach, focusing on known risk points like cash-to-crypto conversions facilitated by ATMs. This contrasts with countries that might impose blanket bans or require full licensing for all crypto activities from the outset. The focus on AML/CTF aligns with global standards set by bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Benefits and Challenges of the New Framework Implementing these Australia crypto ATM rules brings both potential benefits and challenges. Benefits: Reduced Illicit Activity: The primary benefit is hindering criminals from using crypto ATMs for money laundering and other financial crimes. Increased Consumer Protection: Fraud warnings and enhanced scrutiny can help protect users from scams. Enhanced Integrity: A more regulated environment can build greater trust in the legitimate use of crypto ATMs. Regulatory Clarity: Operators now have clearer guidelines on their AML/CTF obligations. Challenges: Compliance Costs: Operators will incur costs to upgrade systems and processes. User Experience: Lower limits and stricter verification might inconvenience some users. Potential for Workarounds: Criminals may seek alternative methods or structures to circumvent the limits. Balancing Innovation: Regulations must be carefully balanced to avoid stifling legitimate innovation in the crypto space. AUSTRAC’s approach attempts to strike this balance by targeting specific risks without shutting down the service entirely. Actionable Insights for Operators and Users For Crypto ATM operators Australia , the message is clear: compliance is paramount. Review your current systems and procedures immediately to ensure they meet the new AUSTRAC standards. Engage with compliance experts if necessary and train your staff thoroughly on the updated requirements for transaction monitoring and customer due diligence. Transparency with your users about the changes, particularly the new Crypto ATM limits Australia , is also essential. For users, be aware of the $3,250 limit. If you need to transact larger amounts, plan to use regulated exchanges or other platforms. Always be vigilant about fraud, paying attention to the warning signs posted at ATMs. Understand that requests for identity verification are now a standard part of the process designed to protect the integrity of the financial system. Conclusion: A Step Towards a Safer Crypto Ecosystem in Australia The introduction of new Australia crypto ATM rules by AUSTRAC marks a significant step in enhancing the regulatory oversight of digital currency transactions within the country. By imposing clear transaction limits, mandating fraud warnings, and strengthening monitoring and customer verification, AUSTRAC aims to significantly reduce the risk of crypto ATMs being exploited for criminal purposes. While these changes present challenges for Crypto ATM operators Australia in terms of compliance and may require users to adjust to new limits and procedures, they are ultimately intended to foster a safer and more secure environment for interacting with cryptocurrencies. These Australian crypto laws are part of a global trend towards greater regulation in the digital asset space, signalling Australia’s commitment to combating financial crime within this evolving sector. The focus on targeted AUSTRAC crypto regulations for high-risk areas like ATMs demonstrates a pragmatic approach to integrating digital currencies into the regulated financial landscape.

Serious investors looking to grow their investment understand that a new token in the DeFi space is the future of 10x gains or more. So far, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token has been a roaring success in all aspects. Let us take a look at how this project could make bigger gains for investors than Solana (SOL). Innovative Platform Design The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project takes the DeFi industry to new heights with its revolutionary innovations. One of them is the incentives system for liquidity support. When a depositor supplies assets into the ecosystem, they go into common pools that earn variable interest rates determined by the pool’s utilization rate. When a depositor adds liquidity to the protocol, they receive mtTokens, which represent their share in the pool, plus accrued interest. The deposits are tracked via smart contracts, which uphold the non-custodial nature of the protocol. Various liquidation safeguards are in place, including a Certik audit that helps to protect the protocol’s resilience. These liquidation safeguards are meant to ensure that the top-tier pools do not run out of liquidity. Various tools are employed, including automated adjustments. Every action is governed by open-source code to ensure the highest degree of transparency. Some of the features in place to protect the platform include: Over-collateralization Borrowers who want to access assets from lenders must over-collateralize their position. They acknowledge that the value of their collateral can fluctuate, thus requiring sufficient headroom. If the value of collateral dips below a certain level, then the collateral becomes eligible for liquidation. Liquidators are then given a discount to purchase the debt. The process ensures there is a healthy buffer between assets and liabilities. Asset Caps Asset caps ensure that there is a limit on how much a given asset can be added to Mutuum Finance. It ensures the protocol does not have excess exposure to one type of asset, which may have heightened volatility or low liquidity. Additionally, it limits the impact that unlimited asset minting can have on the ecosystem. Setting the right deposit limit involves checking numerous metrics like trading volume, price stability, and historical performance. Besides deposits, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) also sets limits on the borrowing of certain assets. The caps ensure that tokens are not exposed to price manipulation or liquidity shortages. By setting limits on volumes borrowed, Mutuum Finance reduces the chances of insolvency triggered by sharp price changes. Restricted Collateralization Certain assets with low liquidity might be placed in the restricted collateralization mode. In this mode, a single collateral asset can only be used to borrow the same asset or with higher limitations. For instance, if the token’s price oracle is prone to manipulation, restrictions like this ensure there is no wide-scale impact on the ecosystem.. Enhanced Collateral Efficiency For assets that have correlated price movement, like stablecoins, Mutuum Finance will offer the Enhanced Collateral Efficiency (ECE). It ensures that they have elevated borrowing limits when both collateral and the loan are in the same group. It ensures that participants benefit from better capital efficiency while protecting the overall ecosystem. The feature is only available to tokens that demonstrate near identical market behavior or consistent pegs. Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio The LTV ratio is used to determine the quality of a token on the platform. For instance, an LTV of 75% for MATIC means that a user who adds 1 MATIC to a pool as collateral can borrow up to 0.75 MATIC worth of another token. The exact LTV is based on market metrics and will fluctuate over time as asset prices change. Liquidation Penalty Once a debt becomes undercollateralized, the platform deems it unsafe. Liquidators can then purchase the debt to stabilize the protocol. When a position is liquidated, there is a penalty, equivalent to the liquidation bonus given to the liquidator. A portion of the penalty goes to the treasury. This measure is used to ensure the long-term solvency of the protocol. Reserve Factor A reserve factor is used to determine the fraction of the borrower’s interest that is collected from the borrower. Tokens that are more stable will carry a small reserve factor, while more volatile ones are given a higher one to account for the higher uncertainty. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Success The innovative design of the platform has led to an increase in presale participation recently. So far, the presale has raised over $9.9 million from over 11,500 participants. Tokens are selling for $0.03 in Phase 5, and over 20% of the tokens have been sold since the current phase began about a week ago. At this rate, this could be the fastest phase in the presale. The reason why tokens are selling off much faster than in phase 1, when prices were at $0.01, is the recent release of the Certik audit. That has boosted trust in the project, accelerating demand. For anyone looking to be part of this innovative platform, getting into the current phase guarantees a 100% ROI based on the listing price of $0.06.

33767162,[object Object],1748944839,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Is Altcoin Season Over Or It Never Started? Here’s What Historical Data Says,https://bitcoinist.com/is-altcoin-season-over-data/,"Following the explosive 2021 Bitcoin and crypto bull run, the expectations of an “altcoin season” have become even more pronounced. This term refers to a period where the prices of altcoins rise rapidly and outperform the Bitcoin price by a large margin. Usually, this happens after the Bitcoin price has put in a new all-time high, and money is rotated into altcoins. However, this has not been the case this cycle. So what happened to altcoin season? Altcoin Season Has Not Started Yet Crypto analyst and expert Michaël van de Poppe took to the X (formerly Twitter) platform to share with his over 790,000 followers that the altcoin season has yet to begin. This goes against the widespread belief that the altcoin season has already come and gone, and is officially over. According to van de Poppe, the altcoin market is actually still in a bear market, but it is about to end. The analyst’s prediction comes as the Bitcoin price remains above six figures, and yet the altcoin market continues to struggle close to its lows. Despite the abysmal market movement and the massive decline in positive sentiment, the crypto analyst still believes that the best is yet to come. He predicts that the crypto bull market is about to begin , and this would be bigger than ever because the bear market has gone on for so long. Furthermore, he points out that this cycle is different than previous cycles and the next 1-3 years will be different as well. Thus, he predicts many investors will miss it for being impatient. Using the chart above, which was created by crypto analyst TechDev, van de Poppe shows that the altcoin market is at a pivotal point. It shows a period where the Bitcoin price is rising and altcoins have remained flat. However, this has usually turned out to be the calm before the storm, and altcoin season tends to follow . If the analyst is right, then the altcoin season never started, and is still in the future. Market Deviations Hold Back Altcoins As Michaël van de Poppe mentioned, this cycle has been quite different from the previous one, and there have been a few reasons for this. The first is the advent of large buys from institutions such as Michael Saylor’s Strategy and heavy hitters like BlackRock buying up Bitcoin through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) . The natural consequence of this is that money is now only staying in Bitcoin rather than rotating out at the top into altcoins like last cycle. Also, a big difference between the current cycle and the 2020-2021 cycle is the availability of free cash. Following the COVID-19 lockdown of 2020, governments around the world disbursed billions of dollars to citizens to help them weather the storm, and this ‘free cash’ had inadvertently found its way into the market, triggering a massive altcoin season. Other factors that have been pointed out to have contributed to this are the extreme P2P that emerged with the advent of instant meme coin creations. Thousands of new coins flood the market daily, and this has left liquidity spread thin. Also, broader macroeconomic factors such as Donald Trump’s tariff wars have contributed greatly to keeping market performance muted, and the weaker altcoins have suffered more for it.",Altcoins|Altcoin|altcoin news|Altcoin Season|Altcoin season news|altcoins|Altcoins news|Bull run|crypto|crypto bull run|crypto news,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-03 10:00:39

According to crypto analyst pumpius on X, Germany’s second-largest bank, DZ BANK, has officially gone live with a Ripple-powered digital asset custody platform. With over €350 billion in assets under custody, this partnership marks a huge milestone for Ripple, especially as it slips into the core infrastructure of traditional finance without making a huge hype. A Building Block for the Digital Euro? DZ BANK’s integration comes under Germany’s forward-looking Electronic Securities Act (eWpG), which allows institutions to issue digital securities without paper certificates. This legal structure has opened the door for Ripple to become a backbone for tokenized assets and, potentially, CBDC development. Analysts even called it “CBDC infrastructure, disguised as custody”, a major signal of what’s brewing behind the scenes. Tokenized Bonds, Crypto Securities & XRP Ripple is quietly making its way into traditional banking, and now it’s starting to show. Germany’s second-biggest bank, DZ BANK, is officially using Ripple’s technology to manage digital assets like tokenized bonds and crypto securities. The move is fully approved under German law. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Norway’s NBX Joins Bitcoin Treasury Trend, Stock Jumps 138% , Instead of making a big public splash, Ripple is focusing on building quietly behind the scenes. The goal is to become part of the financial system from the inside. It’s no longer just about cross-border payments. Ripple is now creating tools that help banks manage digital assets from start to finish, including issuing, storing, and settling them. Interestingly, DZ BANK has become the first major European bank to put Ripple’s institutional-grade custody system into real-world use. This move could set the stage for other top-tier banks to follow. At the center of it all is XRP, serving as the bridge that ties the entire digital asset process together, from issuance to settlement.

DZ BANK stands for Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank, translating to “German Central Cooperative Bank.” It’s Germany’s second-largest bank by assets and the central institution for approximately 700 cooperative banks. How is Ripple involved with DZ BANK? Ripple has partnered with DZ BANK to provide a digital asset custody platform for tokenized bonds and crypto securities. This integration positions Ripple’s technology within Germany’s regulated financial infrastructure. What is the Electronic Securities Act (eWpG)? Germany’s eWpG allows institutions to issue digital securities without paper certificates, facilitating the tokenization of assets. This legal framework enables Ripple’s technology to be utilized for managing digital assets like tokenized bonds and crypto securities. How does XRP fit into Ripple’s European strategy? XRP serves as a bridge asset within Ripple’s platform, facilitating the issuance, settlement, and transfer of digital assets.

Drawing comparisons to XRP’s explosive rally and subsequent crash in 2017, the expert warns that while a major price surge could be on the horizon, it could quickly be followed by a devastating 90% crash. History May Be Repeating Itself According to the expert’s chart analysis, XRP is mirroring its 2017 price structure, when a Bullish Stochastic RSI (SRSI) cross on the monthly time frame triggered a 20x price surge. Back then, XRP skyrocketed before crashing 96%, wiping out unsuspecting investors the analyst refers to as “dumb money.” Source: Jaydee The chart shows that XRP is once again approaching a critical SRSI cross, a signal that previously preceded the 2017 rally. The analyst added, “2017 looks a lot like present time before the 20x move.” If history repeats, XRP could see a sharp rally before facing another severe sell-off. The Warning: Be the 5%, Not the 95% The analyst challenges traders to be part of the 5% ‘smart money’ who take profits before the market turns. The chart marks a future “pink box” area where he predicts a 90% crash could occur after the next market top. “Will you be the 5% who takes advantage before the 90% crash… or will you lose like dumb money by the end of the cycle?” the analyst warns. He also said that while “utility” narratives may drive price speculation temporarily, the window to exit profitably could be short-lived. Once the market euphoria peaks, history is proof that a brutal correction typically follows. SRSI Confirmation Needed For now, the key indicator to watch is the monthly Stochastic RSI cross. The analyst warns that this signal needs to confirm itself before traders act, but insists the setup is eerily similar to the conditions that sparked XRP’s historic 2017 rally. “Are we going to confirm this cross?” the analyst teases, hinting at a make-or-break moment for XRP’s price trajectory.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-03 10:05:17

This could be a game-changer for crypto investors, offering smoother processes and important tax benefits. Peirce, who’s well-known for her pro-crypto views, explained that letting investors redeem ETF shares for actual Bitcoin instead of cash would make the whole system more efficient and less costly when it comes to taxes. Why In-Kind Redemptions Are Important In-kind redemptions have been a frequent topic among investors and ETF providers. Peirce said this is something the SEC plans to address sooner rather than later. During a Coinage Media interview , she pointed out that allowing ETF issuers to create products that best serve investors – and reduce operational challenges – is key. “How can you let people design products in a way that’s most helpful for investors in those products?” Peirce asked, hinting at a shift toward investor-driven innovation. Her comments quickly caught the attention of the crypto community, especially on social media where industry insiders praised her openness. The Issues with Cash Redemptions Right now, Bitcoin ETFs use a cash redemption model. This means ETF issuers have to sell Bitcoin on the market to pay investors who redeem shares. This often triggers taxable events and adds extra costs. Peirce supports switching to in-kind redemptions to fix these problems. This model allows authorized participants to swap ETF shares directly for Bitcoin, making the process simpler and more tax-efficient. Big players like BlackRock and ARK Invest have already proposed such changes. Earlier this year, BlackRock filed a proposal with Nasdaq to allow in-kind redemptions for its iShares Bitcoin Trust. Analysts see this as a smart move to cut tax burdens and ease operations. SEC’s Regulatory Challenge Peirce’s remarks come at a time when the SEC is still cautious about crypto regulation. Even though the agency approved spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, it has pushed for cash redemptions, frustrating many investors. Her recent comments, made during a PubKey event and noted by crypto commentator Frank Corva, show a regulator willing to listen and rethink strict rules. This could point to a more flexible approach from the SEC – one that balances investor protection with room for innovation. What This Means for Investors and the Bitcoin ETF Market Allowing in-kind redemptions could make Bitcoin ETFs more attractive by improving after-tax returns and lowering costs. Peirce’s insights suggest the SEC might soon back changes that make ETFs easier and better for investors, potentially reshaping the market for good. With major firms already pushing for these reforms, we may be on the brink of a new phase of Bitcoin ETF innovation driven by closer cooperation between the industry and regulators If the SEC follows through, in-kind redemptions could become the standard, transforming Bitcoin ETFs into more efficient and cost-effective investment tools.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-03 10:05:22

That number came in lower than what Reuters-surveyed economists were expecting — they had forecasted a flat 2%. April’s reading was 2.2%, making this latest figure a noticeable decline. The biggest drop came from services inflation, which eased to 3.2% in May. That’s down from 4% in April and is the lowest the services category has been in over three years. Core inflation, which takes out volatile categories like energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco, also pulled back, falling to 2.3% from April’s 2.7%. Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief eurozone economist at Capital Economics, said the dip in services showed that April’s spike was temporary. “May’s steep decline in services inflation, to its lowest level in more than three years, confirms that the previous month’s jump was just an Easter-related blip and that the downward trend in services inflation remains on track,” Jack said in a note. ECB weighs Eurozone May numbers ahead of Thursday rate decision ECB officials are expected to cut rates this Thursday, with markets already pricing in a 95% chance of a 25-basis-point reduction. The current deposit facility rate sits at 2.25%, slashed from the 4% high reached in mid-2023. Even though the latest data confirms a cooling trend, Jack thinks it won’t change the ECB’s decision this week much, as their mind is already made up. “But May’s inflation data strengthen the case for another cut at the following meeting in July,” he added. Meanwhile, the overall Eurozone economy is still facing serious uncertainties, thanks mostly to US President Donald Trump, who is pushing new tariff plans that are rattling global markets. His proposal for “reciprocal duties” includes targeting European Union exports. In the middle of all this, the OECD released its latest Economic Outlook on Tuesday, predicting the euro area will grow by 1% in 2025, which is unchanged from its last forecast. The OECD also expects Eurozone inflation to end the year at 2.2%, the same projection it gave in March. Bond yields dropped across the region right after the data came out. The German 10-year bond yield slipped by more than two basis points to 2.499%, while the French 10-year yield dropped by over one basis point to 3.169%. Traders saw this as a clear sign that more easing might be ahead. The euro also plunged, decreasing by about 0.3% against the dollar by Tuesday afternoon, according to data from CNBC. This continues a trend from earlier months, where signs of softer inflation typically led to weaker currency performance.

Get ready for a significant shift! Bitcoin miner Bitmine is making a move that could change its trajectory in the financial markets. What’s Happening with Bitmine’s Stock Listing? According to a recent announcement via GlobeNewswire, the shares of common stock for the Bitcoin miner , Bitmine, are anticipated to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange American ( NYSE American ) on or around June 5th. This marks a pivotal moment for the company and its investors. The planned stock listing on the NYSE American signifies a transition away from its current trading platform. Upon the successful completion of the listing, Bitmine’s shares will cease trading on the OTCQX market, where they have previously been available. This move is often seen as a step up for companies, potentially offering increased visibility, liquidity, and access to a broader base of institutional and retail investors. Why is a NYSE American Listing Significant for a Crypto Stock? Moving from the OTCQX to a major exchange like the NYSE American is a notable event for any company, particularly a crypto stock like Bitmine. Here’s why: Increased Visibility: Listing on a prominent exchange exposes the company to a much wider audience of potential investors and financial media. Improved Liquidity: Major exchanges typically facilitate higher trading volumes, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares. Enhanced Credibility: Listing on the NYSE American often requires meeting stricter listing standards regarding financials, corporate governance, and reporting. This can enhance the company’s perceived credibility and legitimacy in the eyes of investors. Potential for Institutional Investment: Many institutional investors have mandates that restrict them from investing in over-the-counter stocks. A NYSE American listing can open the door to this significant pool of capital. For a Bitcoin miner , this move aligns the company more closely with traditional publicly traded companies, potentially attracting investors who are interested in the crypto sector but prefer the regulatory oversight and infrastructure of major exchanges. What Does This Mean for Bitmine Investors? Existing investors in Bitmine’s OTCQX-traded shares will see their shares transition to the NYSE American . The exact process and timing for this transition will be managed by brokerage firms. Investors should typically not need to take direct action, but it is always advisable to confirm details with their broker. The move could potentially impact the crypto stock ‘s trading dynamics, including volatility and price discovery, as it enters a new trading environment with different market participants. Looking Ahead: The Future for Bitmine on NYSE American The planned stock listing on the NYSE American is a strategic decision for Bitmine as it seeks to grow and mature as a public company. While the exact impact remains to be seen, the transition is generally viewed positively within the financial community for the reasons outlined above. As of the expected listing date around June 5th, market participants will be watching closely to see how Bitmine’s shares perform on the new exchange and how this move influences its access to capital and overall market valuation. The success of a Bitcoin miner like Bitmine on a major exchange could also serve as an indicator for other crypto-related companies considering similar transitions. This development underscores the increasing convergence of the cryptocurrency industry with traditional financial markets, offering new avenues for investors to gain exposure to digital assets through publicly traded entities. In Conclusion: A New Chapter for Bitmine Bitmine’s impending stock listing on the NYSE American represents a significant milestone. This transition from the OTCQX is expected to enhance the company’s market presence, potentially improve liquidity, and attract a wider range of investors. For those interested in the performance of Bitcoin miner companies and the broader crypto stock market, Bitmine’s debut on NYSE American will be a key event to monitor around June 5th.

The company directly compares itself to MicroStrategy (MSTR), presenting a more focused and efficient model for Bitcoin exposure. Unlike MicroStrategy, which has over 500,000 BTC and must spend significantly to maintain returns, Twenty One promotes a more nimble and capital-efficient structure. The company claims full scores across six categories, including Bitcoin-native operations, zero existing debt, and tailored KPIs focused on Bitcoin.

Its community lives on Telegram and Discord, where things stay active and fun. With tools like Toshi Tools and its own collectible NFToshis, it brings both value and vibes. That balance of entertainment and usefulness is what gives Toshi its edge in the meme coin crowd. What can we expect from TOSHI in the future? Let’s turn to the Toshi crypto price prediction. Toshi coin price prediction: general outlook May 2025 turned out to be a strong month for Toshi, with the meme token jumping approximately 60.5%. In the first half of the month, it peaked at $0.000677. However, the rally cooled off a bit — over the past week, the price dipped by nearly 20%. As of June 03, Toshi is trading at $0.0005667 TOSHI 1-monthchart, June 2025 | Source: crypto.news Toshi’s future will depend on a combination of factors, including strong community engagement, viral momentum on social platforms, and overall sentiment toward meme coins in the broader crypto market. Continued activity on Telegram, Discord, and X will be crucial to maintaining hype, while any acknowledgment — direct or subtle — from Coinbase or major crypto figures could significantly boost investor interest. As Toshi is built on the Base blockchain, the token also stands to benefit from the network’s growth and adoption. Upcoming feature releases like enhanced Toshi Tools, new NFToshis drops, or gamified community incentives could attract fresh attention and reignite enthusiasm.

Long-term forecasts suggest potential highs of $35.60 by 2030. Worldcoin made waves in early 2024 when its token WLD nearly hit $12, but since then, it has struggled to break past key resistance levels—even during bullish market events.

Further, this credibility and backing, combined with a potential increase in trading volume, could drive the price of WLD Coin to an impressive $5.89 by the end of 2025. If the market faces external pressures, then it could potentially drive the price down to a low of $1.61 . Price Prediction Potential Low ($) Average Price ($) Potential High ($) 2025 1.61 3.25 5.89 Worldcoin Price Prediction 2025 The Q2 2025 price action for Worldcoin (WLD) clearly showed signs of exhaustion before it could push higher. Despite recent optimism, its inability to establish a sustained long-term bullish trend remains evident. Looking at its historical performance, the recent 3x gains appear modest—like a mere bucket of water from a deep well. Since early 2024, WLD is still down over 80% from its highs, even with the latest price surge. Many are now asking: What could truly push Worldcoin higher? As seen time and again in the crypto space, social sentiment is often the key driver. Renewed marketing efforts and the involvement of high-profile figures could significantly enhance Worldcoin’s perceived value. The recent investment marks a crucial first step in that direction. If this momentum continues, WLD may achieve a Change of Character (ChoCh) in its current price structure by breaking above the $2.12 level in May or June. Once this level is cleared and a ChoCh is confirmed, Worldcoin could break out of its bearish pattern and potentially retest the $4.18 level by the end of 2025. However, if WLD fails to maintain a bullish trajectory this year, its price could drop as low as $1.10.

The Solana Foundation has officially joined forces with Dubai’s Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) through a significant Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). This partnership signals a strong commitment from both sides to foster a collaborative environment for the burgeoning crypto and blockchain sectors in Dubai. It’s a move that could significantly shape the future of Solana Dubai and the wider digital asset landscape in the region. Why is the Solana Foundation Partnering with VARA Dubai? The core purpose of this MOU, announced via the Solana Foundation’s X account, is to bridge the gap between crypto innovators and regulatory bodies. This collaboration aims to create a clearer, more supportive ecosystem for blockchain development . By working closely with VARA Dubai , the Solana Foundation seeks to: Facilitate open dialogue between developers building on Solana and the regulators overseeing the virtual assets space. Share knowledge and best practices to ensure innovation happens responsibly. Identify potential challenges and work together on solutions. This proactive approach to engagement is crucial for the sustainable growth of any technology, especially one as disruptive as blockchain. What Does the MOU Entail? Key Areas of Collaboration The agreement outlines several key areas where the Solana Foundation and VARA will focus their joint efforts. These initiatives are designed to build a robust and compliant environment for blockchain technology in Dubai: Talent Development Programs A major focus is on nurturing local talent. This involves creating educational programs and initiatives to train individuals in blockchain development , specifically focusing on the Solana ecosystem. A skilled workforce is essential for building and scaling decentralized applications (dApps). Data Sharing and Workshops Regular data sharing and interactive workshops are planned. This will allow VARA to gain deeper insights into the technical aspects and market dynamics of the Solana network, while providing developers with a better understanding of regulatory expectations and compliance requirements in Dubai’s jurisdiction. Advisory Sessions The partnership includes provisions for advisory sessions. These sessions will offer guidance to developers navigating the regulatory landscape and provide VARA with expert technical input from the Solana Foundation . This two-way communication is vital for creating effective and informed crypto regulation . Support for a Solana Economic Zone Perhaps one of the most ambitious aspects is the support for establishing a dedicated Solana Economic Zone in Dubai. While details are still emerging, such a zone could potentially offer tailored regulatory frameworks, incentives, and infrastructure to attract Solana-based projects and businesses, positioning Dubai as a hub for the Solana ecosystem in the MENA region. Benefits of the Solana Foundation – VARA Dubai Partnership This collaboration offers mutual benefits for both the Solana Foundation and VARA Dubai , as well as the broader crypto community in the UAE: For Solana Foundation: Provides a clear pathway for growth and adoption in a strategically important global hub with a forward-thinking regulatory body. Facilitates direct engagement with regulators to shape future policies. For VARA Dubai: Enhances regulatory understanding of a leading blockchain platform. Positions Dubai as a welcoming yet well-regulated destination for blockchain innovation. Allows for proactive development of crypto regulation tailored to specific technologies. For Developers & Businesses: Offers greater regulatory certainty, access to talent development resources, and potential support structures within a dedicated economic zone. Reduces friction in launching and operating blockchain projects. For the Crypto Ecosystem in Dubai: Attracts investment, talent, and innovation. Fosters a more mature and responsible market environment. Challenges and Considerations While the MOU is a positive step, implementing such a partnership isn’t without its challenges: Balancing Innovation and Regulation: Finding the right balance between fostering rapid blockchain development and ensuring robust consumer protection and market integrity is a continuous challenge. Pace of Change: The crypto space evolves rapidly. Regulations need to be adaptable without being overly burdensome. Global Coordination: While this focuses on Solana Dubai , crypto regulation often requires international coordination to prevent regulatory arbitrage. Addressing these will require ongoing communication and a willingness to adapt from both the Solana Foundation and VARA Dubai . What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto in Dubai? This partnership is a strong indicator of Dubai’s ambition to become a global leader in the virtual assets space. By collaborating directly with a major blockchain ecosystem like Solana, VARA is demonstrating a willingness to engage deeply with the technology it regulates. This could pave the way for more tailored and effective crypto regulation , encouraging further investment and innovation. The focus on talent development also suggests a long-term vision for building a sustainable ecosystem within Dubai, not just attracting external projects. The potential for a Solana Economic Zone could be a game-changer, providing a concentrated environment for growth. Actionable Insights for Developers and Businesses For those involved in blockchain development or looking to launch crypto businesses, this MOU provides clear signals: Look to Dubai: The emirate is actively creating pathways for blockchain projects. Engage with VARA: Understand the regulatory requirements and leverage resources provided through partnerships like this. Build Responsibly: Focus on compliance and user protection from the outset. Explore the Solana Ecosystem: With the Solana Foundation ‘s direct involvement, opportunities within this specific network in Dubai are likely to increase. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Solana and Dubai The signing of this MOU between the Solana Foundation and VARA Dubai marks a significant milestone. It signifies a mutual commitment to collaboration, innovation, and responsible growth in the virtual assets sector.

In a new strategy session, Cowen tells his 900,000 YouTube subscribers that the TOTAL 3 chart, which tracks the market cap of all digital assets excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum ( ETH ) and stablecoins, remains in a downtrend against the flagship crypto asset and has yet to find a market bottom. “I don’t care how great you think your altcoin community is. I don’t care if your developers that you follow have not yet rugged you. Altcoins, in my opinion, are oscillators at best against Bitcoin, and many of them just bleed to Bitcoin. So if individually altcoins will bleed to Bitcoin, then collectively they should as well, and that’s the reason why I think alt/Bitcoin pairs will eventually find themselves down here [at 0.25]. I think it’s just a matter of time.” Source: Benjamin Cowen/YouTube A move toward the support area highlighted by Cowen would signal that altcoins are significantly underperforming Bitcoin. Cowen also points out that altcoins are in a multi-year downtrend against Bitcoin with no signs of reversing the trend anytime soon. “I don’t know exactly when alt/Bitcoin pairs are going to go to the range lows. I can’t tell you that, but what I can say is what you’re witnessing is basically the slow conversion of people holding alts and then they are just converting them to Bitcoin… The chart tells you what’s happening. Alts put in a new low against Bitcoin [on June 1st]. So any prior altseason that was called for, any prior call for a low by alt/Bitcoin pairs up until today was wrong.” TOTAL3/BTC is currently hovering at 0.33.

Central to the controversy is the “ Big Beautiful Bill ,” a legislative proposal that would impose a 10-year moratorium on state-level AI regulations, effectively centralizing control at the federal level. The bill also provides $500 million to help federal agencies upgrade old systems with new AI tools and automation. Trump and his supporters say the plan will strengthen and advance the country. Still, many people online push back, saying it gives too much power to Washington, increases surveillance , and helps big tech while ignoring privacy risks and state protections. Trump blocks state AI laws and gives full control to Washington Trump’s “ Big Beautiful Bill ” includes Section 43201, the Artificial Intelligence and Information Technology Modernization Initiative, which presents a long-term federal plan for AI in government systems. The initiative will allocate funds to the Department of Commerce to modernize outdated technology and improve how federal agencies use commercial artificial intelligence and automation tools. The bill also blocks every US state and local government from passing laws that regulate or limit artificial intelligence models, tools, or automated systems for the next decade. Exceptions exist for state laws that don’t directly deal with AI or aim to control it, even though these cases are very limited and vague. Trump’s team says national control is better for innovation and easier for businesses that build AI tools across many states, but people strongly disagree on social media platforms like X. One user mentioned that the bill goes against the conservative values of small governments with a post saying , “So much for limited government interference .” Another user compared the plan to a scene from George Orwell’s 1984, writing , “ Palantir’s Foundry is the new telescreen, watching your every move ,” in reference to the government possibly using surveillance tools made by Palantir. Many other users also raised alarms about what the bill could mean for privacy, fairness, and power with comments like, “ It seems the purpose of this is to facilitate Palintar [sic] to control everyone in a fascist surveillance state, ” using strong language to express concern that the bill will give tech companies too much control over people’s lives. People push against bill that uses AI money to benefit big tech and risks privacy The bill allocates $500 million to upgrade outdated technology and improve government efficiency through artificial intelligence and automation. Still, people say this large sum of money wil l be nefit big-tech companies like Palantir , which have strong ties with the government. Netizens suspec t th is bill will favor powerful figures like Peter Thiel, Elon Musk, and J.D. Vance, who have investments or leadership roles in these tech companies and are linked to President Trump. One user summed up this skepticism by saying, “ Exactly what Thiel, Musk, Vance, & Palantir wanted from Trump in his Big Beautiful Bill.” At the same time, another accused the bill of enriching Trump’s family, writing, “ So he and his family ca n ma x profits .” People also think that federal agencies like the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and FEMA will use AI tools for surveillance to infringe on people’s privacy and increase the government’s overreach. The “Big Beautiful Bill” will also prevent local governments from enforcing laws they have already created to protect residents from the dangers of AI, meaning states will not respond effectively to the challenges AI causes within their communities. Businesses trading with countries in the European Union will also struggle because the E U has im plemented its own AI Act.

After attending the XRP Las Vegas event, King shared a bold prediction that’s making waves across the industry: “The next two years will change crypto forever.” From clear regulations to rising institutional interest, King believes we’re entering a turning point that will push crypto into its next major chapter. XRP Las Vegas confirmed one thing: the next 2 years will change crypto forever. Regulatory clarity is coming. Institutions are leaning in. Adoption and growth are about to accelerate substantially. For those who missed it, here's an overview — first off, the most important… pic.twitter.com/UBn0pzvg5h — Austin King (@OnchainAustin) June 2, 2025 Regulatory Clarity Is Almost Here According to King, the U.S. government is finally getting closer to providing clear crypto regulations. This could be a major breakthrough for the industry, which has spent years operating under uncertainty. He sees this aligning with the growing involvement of major financial players. Institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have already launched Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, and Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy continues to gain traction. King believes this shift will help legitimize crypto in a way that unlocks long-term growth and adoption. Institutions Are Changing Their Tune King also reflected on how much has changed in the past decade. He noted that for years, crypto had to defend itself against criticism from central banks, regulators, and traditional financial institutions that didn’t believe in it. Now, many of those same institutions are investing. Tesla’s $1.5 billion Bitcoin purchase in 2021, followed by some selling, and involvement from companies like SpaceX show how institutional interest is growing fast. King called it a “stunning pivot,” and said this shift is creating some of the biggest opportunities he’s ever seen in his eight years in crypto. Real Projects Will Lead the Next Wave King also pointed out that a major change is happening within the industry itself. For years, many crypto companies focused heavily on marketing without delivering real value. But now, that’s starting to shift. King believes we’ll soon see a big move of capital away from hype-based projects and into those creating real-world impact. “Over the next 2 years, you’ll see a significant amount of liquidity rotate from marketing-based companies to projects driving real-world impact,” he predicted. This gives forward-thinking networks a huge edge. Crypto Has a Big Role to Play King is hopeful about the future of cryptocurrency as he sees it as a reconstruction of the global financial system. The sector is expected to grow at an exceptional rate as adoption picks up speed and stability approaches. He thinks that the function of cryptocurrency in the world will be redefined in the next two years. Will his predictions come true? Time will tell.

The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA) has granted approval for RLUSD, paving the way for its legal use within the prestigious Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). This move underscores Dubai’s growing ambition to become a leading UAE crypto hub and sets a precedent for how digital assets can integrate into traditional financial ecosystems. What Does DFSA Approval Mean for Ripple RLUSD? The approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority is more than just a regulatory green light; it’s a stamp of legitimacy and operational clearance within a highly respected financial jurisdiction. For Ripple, having Ripple RLUSD recognized and permitted by the DFSA allows financial institutions and businesses operating within the DIFC to confidently use the stablecoin for various transactions and services. This includes payments, settlements, and potentially other regulated financial activities. This approval is crucial because the DFSA operates under a robust regulatory framework, known for its adherence to international standards. Inclusion within this framework signifies that RLUSD has met stringent requirements related to stability, compliance, and operational integrity. It positions RLUSD not just as a digital asset, but as a regulated financial instrument within one of the world’s key financial centres. Why is the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) Important? The Dubai International Financial Centre is a special economic zone in Dubai that serves as a leading financial hub for the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region. It’s home to a vast number of international banks, financial institutions, and fintech companies. Being able to operate within the Dubai International Financial Centre provides direct access to a sophisticated market and a network of established financial players. For a stablecoin like RLUSD, this access is invaluable for adoption and integration into mainstream financial workflows. Operating within the DIFC means adhering to its specific laws and regulations, which are separate from the rest of the UAE. The DFSA is the independent regulator of financial and ancillary services conducted in the DIFC. Their approval is a specific authorization for activities within this zone, highlighting the targeted approach Dubai is taking towards digital asset integration. Stablecoin Regulation: A Global Trend and Dubai’s Approach The regulatory landscape for stablecoins is evolving globally, with jurisdictions grappling with how to classify and oversee these digital assets pegged to stable values like fiat currencies. Effective stablecoin regulation is seen as essential for protecting consumers, ensuring financial stability, and preventing illicit activities. Dubai, through the DFSA and other authorities like the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA), has been proactive in establishing frameworks for virtual assets. The DFSA’s approach within the DIFC often involves adapting existing financial regulations to digital assets, ensuring a level playing field and maintaining market integrity. This approval for RLUSD demonstrates the DFSA’s willingness to engage with and regulate innovative digital financial products, provided they meet necessary standards. Key aspects of stablecoin regulation often considered include: Reserve Requirements: Ensuring the stablecoin is fully backed by reserves that are held safely and transparently. Redemption Rights: Guaranteeing users can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying asset at par value. Anti-Money Laundering (AML) & Know Your Customer (KYC): Implementing robust procedures to prevent illicit use. Governance & Auditing: Establishing clear governance structures and undergoing regular audits of reserves and operations. The DFSA’s approval suggests RLUSD has addressed these critical regulatory concerns, building trust among potential users and institutions within the DIFC. Benefits of RLUSD Approval in the DIFC This regulatory nod opens up several potential benefits for Ripple, the DIFC, and the broader digital asset ecosystem: For Ripple and RLUSD: Increased Legitimacy and Trust: DFSA approval significantly enhances RLUSD’s credibility on a global stage, particularly within institutional finance. Access to a Key Financial Market: Direct entry into the sophisticated and well-regulated DIFC ecosystem. Potential for Adoption: Financial institutions within the DIFC can now explore using RLUSD for various use cases without regulatory uncertainty within the zone. Competitive Advantage: Positions RLUSD favorably among stablecoins seeking institutional adoption in regulated environments. For the Dubai International Financial Centre: Enhancing Fintech Offering: Attracts more digital asset businesses and talent to the centre. Facilitating Digital Transactions: Provides a regulated stablecoin option for businesses operating within its jurisdiction. Reinforcing Regulatory Leadership: Demonstrates the DFSA’s capability to regulate complex digital assets effectively. For the Broader Market: Model for Regulation: Provides a case study for how other jurisdictions might approach stablecoin regulation within financial hubs. Increased Institutional Confidence: Regulatory clarity in a major financial centre can boost overall institutional interest in stablecoins and digital assets. What are the Potential Challenges or Considerations? While approval is a major positive step, integrating a stablecoin like Ripple RLUSD into the existing financial infrastructure within the DIFC won’t be without its challenges. These could include: Integration Complexity: Existing financial systems within institutions need to be adapted to handle stablecoin transactions. This requires technical development and operational adjustments. Market Education: Despite the approval, educating traditional finance professionals within the DIFC about the practical use cases, benefits, and operational differences of stablecoins compared to traditional assets will be necessary. Competition: The stablecoin market is competitive. While DFSA approval is a strong differentiator, RLUSD will compete with other digital payment solutions and potentially other stablecoins that may seek or gain similar approvals in the future. Evolving Regulation: The regulatory landscape for digital assets is still maturing. While the DFSA has provided approval based on current frameworks, future regulatory changes at the local or international level could impact operations. Examples of Potential RLUSD Use Cases in the DIFC With DFSA approval, institutions within the Dubai International Financial Centre could potentially leverage RLUSD for several applications: Cross-Border Payments: Facilitating faster, cheaper, and more transparent international money transfers between entities operating within or connecting with the DIFC. Trade Finance: Using RLUSD for settlements in trade finance transactions, potentially reducing settlement times and counterparty risk. Tokenized Assets: Settling transactions involving tokenized securities, real estate, or other assets issued within the DIFC’s regulatory framework. Fund Management: Providing a stable digital asset for fund managers within the DIFC to use for liquidity management or settlement purposes. Remittances: While the DIFC is primarily institutional, this approval could indirectly support improved remittance corridors connecting through institutions based there. These examples highlight how a regulated stablecoin can bridge the gap between traditional finance and the digital asset space, offering efficiency gains and new possibilities. Actionable Insights for Businesses in the DIFC For financial institutions and businesses operating within the Dubai International Financial Centre , Ripple’s RLUSD approval presents an opportunity to explore integrating regulated digital assets into their operations. Here are some actionable insights: Assess Use Cases: Evaluate where a regulated stablecoin like RLUSD could offer efficiencies or new services in your existing business model (e.g., payments, settlement, treasury management). Understand the Framework: Familiarize yourself with the specific DFSA regulations governing the use of RLUSD and other virtual assets within the DIFC. Pilot Programs: Consider running pilot programs to test the integration and benefits of using RLUSD in a controlled environment before full-scale adoption. Engage with Ripple: Directly engage with Ripple to understand the technical integration requirements and support available for using RLUSD. Stay Informed: Keep abreast of further developments in stablecoin regulation within the UAE and globally, as frameworks continue to evolve. Embracing regulated digital assets early could provide a competitive edge in an increasingly digitized financial landscape. Dubai’s Vision as a UAE Crypto Hub This approval for Ripple RLUSD is another clear indicator of Dubai’s strategic vision to become a leading global centre for virtual assets. The emirate has been actively developing comprehensive regulatory frameworks, attracting crypto businesses, and fostering innovation in the blockchain space. The presence of multiple regulatory bodies like the DFSA (for the DIFC) and VARA (for the rest of Dubai) reflects a nuanced approach to overseeing different aspects of the virtual asset market. By providing regulatory clarity and approval pathways, Dubai aims to attract legitimate businesses and investors while mitigating risks associated with unregulated crypto activities. The approval of a stablecoin from a major player like Ripple within the DIFC sends a strong signal to the international community that Dubai is serious about integrating digital assets into its financial future in a regulated and responsible manner. This positions Dubai as a forward-thinking UAE crypto hub , ready to embrace the potential of blockchain technology and digital currencies. Conclusion: A New Era for Digital Finance in Dubai The approval of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin by the Dubai Financial Services Authority marks a significant step forward for both Ripple and Dubai’s ambition in the digital asset space. Allowing RLUSD within the Dubai International Financial Centre provides a regulated pathway for its use by financial institutions, potentially unlocking efficiencies in payments, settlements, and other financial services. This development underscores the importance of clear stablecoin regulation and highlights Dubai’s commitment to becoming a leading UAE crypto hub . While challenges in integration and market education remain, the DFSA’s approval provides the necessary regulatory certainty for institutions within the Dubai International Financial Centre to explore the benefits of using a regulated stablecoin like Ripple RLUSD . This is a crucial moment in the convergence of traditional finance and the digital asset world, setting a positive precedent for future integrations.

One mistake can wipe out days of profits. HyroTrader tackles this issue by merging firm-backed capital and stringent risk controls. This review outlines how HyroTrader’s framework supports traders in developing disciplined habits, minimizing emotional choices, and safeguarding capital, which are essential for long-term success. The Role of Risk Management in Crypto Trading Cryptocurrency markets are active 24/7, leading to potential price fluctuations at any time. In the absence of a solid strategy, traders frequently make impulsive decisions. A robust framework like HyroTrader’s emphasizes long-term growth over quick profits by implementing clear risk management rules. These rules help mitigate overconfidence during winning periods, diminish emotional “revenge trades"" following losses, and encourage consistent trading behavior. By mandating compliance with daily and cumulative drawdown limits, HyroTrader promotes proactive thinking and preparation for adverse situations. HyroTrader’s Core Risk Framework HyroTrader’s crypto prop trading program starts with a structured evaluation designed to assess both profitability and adherence to drawdown limits. Traders can choose from account sizes of 10,000 USDT, 25,000 USDT, or 50,000 USDT and are required to pay a one-time fee. Throughout this evaluation phase, all trades utilize live order-book data from exchanges like ByBit and CLEO. To successfully pass, a trader must achieve a profit target, typically between 8 percent and 10 percent, while ensuring they do not exceed daily drawdown limits or activate the total drawdown cap. These stringent rules simulate real-market conditions, guaranteeing that only disciplined traders advance to the funded stage. Learn more: HyroTrader reviews Transition to a Funded Account After successfully passing the evaluation, the trader gains access to firm capital. At this stage, the trader keeps 70 percent of the net profits, while HyroTrader covers losses as long as they fall within the set drawdown limits. Importantly, the same daily and total drawdown rules apply. If a trader surpasses any of these limits, the account will be closed, no matter how much profit was made that day. This consistent application of rules supports the habits formed during the evaluation and highlights that managing firm capital necessitates careful strategies rather than impulsive wagering. Key Risk Controls at Funded Levels HyroTrader implements two primary safeguards to protect capital. First, daily drawdown limits stop trading when losses reach a predetermined percentage of the account balance, typically around 5 percent. This helps prevent a poor trading session from escalating into a more severe situation. Since the daily limit resets every morning, traders have a fresh start, encouraging them to take breaks after a losing day instead of attempting to recover losses. Second, the overall drawdown cap acts as a strict safeguard for company funds. Usually set at approximately 10 percent of the initial balance, this cap ensures that the account does not drop below a specific level. Traders understand that small losses are a natural part of trading, and clinging to a position that exceeds risk limits jeopardizes their funded status. Together, these two measures foster a disciplined environment that protects both the trader’s development and the firm’s investments. Tools and Features That Support Risk Management HyroTrader’s technology stack provides speed and transparency, enabling traders to effectively follow rules. It streams live data from ByBit and CLEO, ensuring every tick represents genuine market depth. This precision safeguards against artificial wicks and deceptive spreads that commonly occur in simulated environments. When traders move from evaluation to funded status, their performance metrics stay consistent because the same real-market conditions are applied. Automated stop-loss tools enhance risk management. Traders can establish accurate stop orders that activate at the exact price, even if they are not at their desks. By utilizing one-cancels-the-other (OCO) bracket orders, both stop-loss and profit-target levels are controlled with a single command. This hands-free strategy guarantees that each position has its own defined risk limit, preventing a singular losing trade from affecting the overall account. Scaling Through Consistent Risk Management HyroTrader’s tiered structure rewards traders for effective risk management and consistent profitability. Once they pass the evaluation, traders move into the initial funded stage, enjoying a 70 percent profit share while adhering to drawdown limits. If they successfully complete several payout cycles without issues, their profit share rises to 80 percent, and their capital allocation may increase twofold. At the following milestone, they could see their profit split further increase to 90 percent, along with the opportunity to access enhanced programs or lower fees. However, any rule violations at any stage result in either a return to the evaluation phase or a complete loss of funded status. This strict policy cultivates habits that prove beneficial even beyond the prop trading environment. Conclusion Effective risk management is crucial in crypto trading, and HyroTrader’s approach highlights this through live market evaluations and strict drawdown limits. By demanding consistent performance and imposing penalties for violations, the firm cultivates disciplined habits among traders. The incorporation of real exchange executions, automated stop-loss tools, and tiered profit sharing promotes a growth trajectory that minimizes emotional stress and prevents overleveraging. For those looking for a systematic setting to enhance their risk management abilities, HyroTrader presents distinct advantages compared to typical prop firms. With its emphasis on real-time crypto data and firm-provided capital, it facilitates the pathway to enduring success. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

In light of current market trends and blockchain developments, we’ve asked Google Gemini AI about the direction it thinks the digital asset will go and its potential price by June 30, 2025. According to Gemini, the projected Cardano (ADA) is projected to trade between $1.1 and $1.8 by the end of June. The AI’s prediction is based on a combination of market momentum, Cardano’s technical and ecosystem progress, and broader cryptocurrency sector dynamics. Factors Supporting This Forecast Gemini outlines five core factors behind its forecast: Market Momentum and Bitcoin Performance: The AI notes that historically, altcoins like Cardano tend to perform better after Bitcoin enters the later stages of a bull market. Gemini points out that BTC set a favorable backdrop already, and as its dominance weakens , altcoins often experience notable price surges. Ecosystem Development : While acknowledging that Cardano has grown slowly, Gemini recognizes the gradual development and upgrades. Despite these developments, it notes that ADA “still lags behind Ethereum and Solana” in terms of DeFi and NFT utilization, which could limit its short-term upside. Regulatory Landscape and Institutional Adoption : Gemini considers regulatory clarity an influential factor. Not all assets share XRP’s regulatory clarity , and the AI states that Cardano may perform better under moderate regulatory conditions. However, stricter regulations could reduce speculative inflows and dampen growth. Community and Governance Factors: Cardano’s decentralized governance , especially with the Voltaire phase, is viewed positively by Gemini. It suggests this governance shift could stimulate renewed interest in the network. Nonetheless, the AI cautions that reliance on formal methods and peer-reviewed development may hinder its competitive pace relative to more agile platforms. Competitive Pressure and Risks: Gemini highlights the intense competition Cardano faces from other Layer 1 blockchains. Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and Avalanche continue to attract more developer activity and capital. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other Potential Targets for Cardano (ADA) In addition to the forecasted price range, Gemini also provides a probability distribution for ADA’s price outcomes by June 30. The chatbot listed a 20% chance of remaining below $1, a 60% chance of trading between $1 and $1.8, a 15% chance of trading between $1.8 and $3, and a 5% chance of rising above $3. The most probable scenario, according to the AI, is that Cardano will trade between $1 and $1.8. However, the recent increase in whale activity suggests that the asset may shock investors and aim for higher targets.

Since then, it’s fallen 6% , sitting now right at $105K. Was the ATH a rare surge, and have Bitcoin’s fundamentals returned to something more pessimistic? Or is this a temporary pullback with strong support underneath? Evidence points more to the latter, especially with news that Bitcoin miners in Nigeria are addressing one of the longest-standing objections to crypto. And that could set Bitcoin, and the Bitcoin meme coin BTC Bull token, up for big moves in the weeks to come. Bitcoin Goes Green in Nigeria, Answers Longstanding Criticism Nigerian startup Green Flare aims to take environmentally-damaging natural gas flares (burn-offs) and turn them into Bitcoin . Specifically, they’ll use the energy generated by burning off the natural gas to power large-scale Bitcoin mining operations. Once the three-stage project is completed, it will generate 53MW of energy for Bitcoin mining rigs. Burning off gas from oil production is a leading producer of greenhouse gases, including methane. And Nigeria ranks in the top 10 for gas flaring emissions , accounting for 75% of global flaring, according to World Bank’s 2023 data. At the same time, producing Bitcoin required so much energy that, in 2023, total global Bitcoin mining operations would have ranked 27th in the world in energy consumption . According to the same UN report, 66% of the energy used to mine Bitcoin came from fossil fuels. In light of this data, Green Flare’s plan makes perfect sense. Offsetting Bitcoin’s emissions footprint by capturing and using energy that would otherwise have been wasted? A great plan, if we’ve ever seen one Two of the three sites should be live by Q4 of 2025. The investment shows the increasing maturity of the crypto and Bitcoin economies. Despite Pullback, Bitcoin Remains ‘Structurally Strong’ According to the experts at Bitfinex, Bitcoin is undergoing its first meaningful correction since the April lows, cooling off after a relentless 50 percent surge that took the asset from $74,501 to a new All-Time High of $111,880. The current pullback reflects a change in tempo, following nearly 50 days of uninterrupted upside marked by minimal retracements. — Bitfinex, Bitfinex Alpha The pullback is more than a technical correction; the ‘TACO’ phenomenon – for ‘Trump Always Chickens Out – continues to keep tariffs and the trade economy in a state of uncertainty and volatility. That impacts Bitcoin directly and indirectly. More disposable income encourages retail traders, while higher Treasury rates often cause risk-adverse investors to shift towards T-bills and away from Bitcoin. But despite the external and internal factors leading to the correction, Bitfinex reports: We believe Bitcoin remains structurally strong. This correction appears to be a healthy reset rather than a breakdown —Bitfinex, Bitfinex Alpha Trump’s TACO moves might be a sign of instability, or galaxy-brained chess moves; either way, Bitcoin looks strong beneath the surface, and poised for future growth. When it does head back up, will it take BTC Bull Token with it? BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – First-Ever Bitcoin Meme Coin with $BTC Airdrop BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) comes loaded with features designed to keep Bitcoin and its bullish buddy moving in tandem up the crypto charts: Regular token burns to incentivise $BTCBULL price increase (at $125K, $175K, and $225K) Token airdrops – including $BTC airdrops – to rewards project participants 14-day ‘cooling-off’ period during the presale when investors can return tokens (think of it as a ‘money-back guarantee’) It’s all designed to encourage participation in one of the most innovative crypto presales currently available. Buy $BTCBULL , hold it on the Best Wallet app , and you’ll be eligible to earn free $BTC when Bitcoin’s price reaches $150K and $200K. The team also says there might be a tiered airdrop event with optional participation in social media tasks once the presale ends. BTC Bull Token provides four ways to earn: Presale $BTCBULL staking (61%) $BTCBULL price increase post-launch $BTC airdrop for token holders in the Best Wallet app $BTCBULL airdrop when Bitcoin hits $250K Investors keen to capitalize on $BTCBULL’s meme coin momentum can track the token’s price upward as Bitcoin climbs, while others looking for a way to double-down on $BTC’s gains can use the BTC Bull Token presale as a way to diversify exposure. $BTCBULL currently costs just $0.002545, but our price prediction shows the potential for the token to increase 230% to reach $0.0084 by year’s end.

Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Pi Network (PI) Source: TradingView Pi Network (PI) is trading between $0.57 and $0.76. In the past month, the coin's price increased by 10.19%, showing some upward momentum. However, the last week saw a drop of 16.77%, highlighting volatility. Over six months, PI has declined by 7.94%, reflecting challenges in sustaining its value. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 49.38, indicating neutral market sentiment. The Stochastic value is 27.81, suggesting the coin may be nearing oversold conditions. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages stand at $0.65, showing alignment in short-term and long-term trends. Looking ahead, the nearest resistance level is $0.88. If PI breaks through this, it could reach the second resistance at $1.07, which would be an increase of about 64% from current levels. On the downside, the nearest support is at $0.49. Falling below this could see the price drop to the second support at $0.29, a significant decrease. Based on the data, PI's price could swing in either direction, and traders should monitor these key levels closely. Solana (SOL) Source: TradingView Over the past week, Solana (SOL) experienced a price decline of 8.98%, settling within a range of $145.84 to $174.58. Despite this short-term dip, the cryptocurrency has seen a 1-month increase of 8.45%. However, looking at the last six months, SOL has dropped by 30.65%, indicating significant volatility in its performance. Technical indicators show SOL approaching its nearest resistance level at $191.40. If it breaks through, the next target could be $220.14, which would be an approximate 25% rise from current levels. On the downside, support levels at $133.92 and $105.18 may provide a safety net if the price falls further. The Simple Moving Averages over 10 and 100 days are closely aligned at around $159, suggesting consolidation. The Relative Strength Index stands at 58.66, pointing to moderate buying pressure, while the Stochastic indicator at 70.65 hints at nearing overbought conditions. A MACD level of 1.31 indicates mild bullish momentum. Based on these figures, SOL could either test higher resistance levels or retrace to support levels, depending on market sentiment and trader activity. Conclusion PI's token unlock and SOL's Dubai partnership show promise. Yet, XYZVerse's unique sports memecoin aims for greater success during this bull run.

About $162M of the stolen funds were intercepted, with the potential of reimbursing holders. SlowMist counted 15 major hacking incidents in May, with a total haul of $257M. The major hack for the month was the Cetus Protocol DEX exploit, losing $230M due to flawed smart contracts. The hack also led to a fast vote to freeze over $160M on the SUI blockchain, then claw back the funds from the hacker wallets. The SlowMist report counted a higher end sum for all exploits, compared to PeckShield’s estimates of $244M for the past month. Cork Protocol lost $12M due to flawed validation of user-supplied data, allowing the hacker to make use of flawed pricing. The third-biggest hack was added at the last moment. The Taiwanese BitoPro exchange admitted outflows of $11.5M in a multi-chain hack, with ongoing transactions. However, BitoPro did not announce the hacks immediately, and only admitted the losses when ZachXBT noted the suspicious transactions. DPRK hackers join the attack on r etail and small wallets Two smaller hacks involved Demex, with a loss of $950K due to oracle manipulation, and Zunami Protocol, losing $500K from a still unclear exploit. According to SlowMist , smart contract flaws were the main cause of losses in 95% of hacking cases. For the past month, a total of six social media accounts were compromised, leading to losses from meme token shilling or social engineering. Hijacked X accounts have slowed down lately, but are still a vector for reaching potential targets. Individual phishing scams were also active in the past month. A total of $9.6M was stolen from 7,164 victims. According to SlowMist, Lazarus Group is now targeting individuals with large wallets, taking up to $5.2M from a single victim through malware. The exploit targeted a merchant with a notable crypto wallet. SlowMist issued a warning to merchants accepting crypto to avoid exposure of their main wallets. The other potential victim class are retail buyers involved with on-chain merchants. Marinade Finance led to SOL reward losses Although not explicitly a hack, Marinade Finance was also a source of losses in May, due to protocol flaws. The project allowed validators to only bid with dust amounts of SOL while receiving disproportionate rewards. As a result, validators took more SOL than they deposited, leading to losses for mSOL holders that staked with Marinade Finance. Marinade Finance allowed validators to bid high for block production, but then drop their bid and only deposit dust. Despite this, Marinade Finance still allowed the release of rewards for security and block production. This meant that malicious validators could gain significant passive income with minimal investments. Based on rough estimates, those validators took as much as 3.4M SOL, which was once again staked and received additional rewards. The main reason was that the Marinade Finance code did not in fact remove low bidders as promised. The exploit ran for 126 Solana epochs, or more than three months, before the potential for unfair gains was noticed.

A significant development recently emerged concerning one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Coinbase lawsuit activity is heating up on multiple fronts, but a specific case in Oregon is now taking a critical turn as the exchange seeks to move the dispute to a higher court. This move highlights the ongoing tension between state-level actions and the desire for federal clarity in the realm of crypto regulation . Understanding the Oregon Lawsuit Against Coinbase The core issue at the heart of the legal challenge in Oregon revolves around allegations that Coinbase has been selling unregistered securities . State regulators in Oregon initiated this lawsuit, claiming that certain digital assets offered or traded on the Coinbase platform fall under the definition of securities and that Coinbase failed to register them appropriately with the state, as required by state law. This isn’t the first time such allegations have been leveled against a crypto platform, but each case contributes to the broader conversation about how existing securities laws apply to novel digital assets. Key aspects of the Oregon lawsuit likely include: Specific Assets Targeted: The lawsuit likely identifies particular cryptocurrencies or services offered by Coinbase that the state deems unregistered securities. Allegations of Non-Compliance: Claims that Coinbase failed to adhere to state securities registration requirements, potentially exposing Oregon residents to risks. Requested Remedies: The state is likely seeking injunctions to stop certain activities, penalties, and potentially restitution for affected investors. For Coinbase, facing a lawsuit from a state regulator adds another layer to its complex legal environment, which already includes significant action from federal bodies like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The state-level approach, however, presents unique challenges due to the potential for varying interpretations and regulations across different states. Why Coinbase Seeks Federal Jurisdiction Coinbase’s recent filing isn’t about denying the existence of the lawsuit; it’s about where that lawsuit should be heard. The exchange has formally requested a U.S. federal court to take over jurisdiction of the case currently being pursued by Oregon state authorities. This strategic legal maneuver is based on several arguments put forth by Coinbase. Coinbase contends that the Oregon lawsuit represents an overreach of state authority. Their argument hinges on the idea that matters concerning the regulation of national or international platforms like Coinbase, especially regarding complex financial instruments or assets traded across state lines, should properly fall under federal jurisdiction . Federal courts are typically seen as the appropriate venue for cases involving federal law, interstate commerce, or significant national implications. Furthermore, Coinbase has suggested that the case was initiated for political rather than purely legal purposes. While the specifics of this claim weren’t detailed in the initial report, it implies a belief that the state action might be motivated by broader political stances on crypto or a desire to set a precedent at the state level, rather than solely addressing specific violations within Oregon. The core of Coinbase’s legal position is that the ‘corresponding matter ought to be handled at the federal level, not the state level,’ as stated in reports. This push for federal oversight aligns with Coinbase’s long-standing call for clear, comprehensive federal legislation and regulation for the crypto industry in the United States, arguing that a patchwork of state rules creates confusion and hinders innovation. State vs. Federal: The Battle Over Crypto Regulation The clash between Oregon and Coinbase over jurisdiction is a microcosm of the larger debate surrounding crypto regulation in the U.S. Currently, there is no single, overarching federal framework specifically designed for cryptocurrencies. Instead, various federal agencies (like the SEC, CFTC, FinCEN, IRS) and individual states assert authority based on existing laws, often leading to overlapping, conflicting, or ambiguous requirements. Arguments for Federal Jurisdiction often include: Uniformity: A single federal framework would provide consistent rules across the entire country, simplifying compliance for national platforms like Coinbase. Expertise: Federal agencies like the SEC and CFTC have extensive experience regulating financial markets and commodities, which proponents argue is necessary for complex crypto issues. Interstate Commerce: Cryptocurrency trading inherently involves transactions across state lines and international borders, making it a matter of interstate commerce typically regulated at the federal level. Arguments for State Involvement often include: Local Protection: States argue they have a duty to protect their own residents from harmful practices within their borders, regardless of where the service provider is based. Innovation Labs: States can sometimes act as testing grounds for regulatory approaches, potentially leading to more tailored or innovative rules. Filling Gaps: In the absence of clear federal action, states may step in to address perceived risks or consumer protection issues. The outcome of Coinbase’s request to move the Oregon case could influence this debate. If a federal court agrees to take the case, it could signal a preference for handling significant crypto regulatory questions at the federal level, potentially discouraging similar state-level actions or paving the way for more centralized oversight. What Defines ‘Unregistered Securities’ in the Crypto World? A central theme in many crypto regulatory battles, including the Coinbase lawsuit in Oregon, is the classification of digital assets as unregistered securities . U.S. securities law, primarily governed by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, requires that securities offered or sold to the public be registered with the SEC (or state equivalents) unless an exemption applies. The test most often applied to determine if something is an investment contract (a type of security) is the Howey Test, derived from a 1946 Supreme Court case. It asks if there is: An investment of money In a common enterprise With an expectation of profits To be derived solely from the efforts of others Applying this test to cryptocurrencies is complex. While Bitcoin and Ethereum are often cited as examples that may not meet this test, many other tokens, particularly those associated with specific projects or ecosystems where the value is heavily dependent on the efforts of a central team, could potentially be deemed securities. Regulators like the SEC and state bodies have taken the stance that many tokens offered and sold are, in fact, unregistered securities, while crypto companies often argue otherwise, classifying them as commodities, currencies, or utility tokens. Coinbase, in its defense against allegations of facilitating trading in unregistered securities, typically argues that the assets listed on its platform are not securities, or that it operates a marketplace for assets that trade on secondary markets, which presents different legal considerations. The outcome in cases like the one in Oregon will help shape the legal interpretation of various digital assets. Challenges and Implications for Coinbase Facing multiple legal challenges, including the Oregon lawsuit and actions from federal regulators, presents significant challenges for Coinbase: Legal Costs: Defending against lawsuits, especially those involving complex jurisdictional questions and novel legal interpretations, is expensive and resource-intensive. Regulatory Uncertainty: The proliferation of lawsuits and differing regulatory stances creates uncertainty for Coinbase’s business operations, product offerings, and future planning. Reputational Impact: Lawsuits alleging violations of securities laws can damage public trust and potentially deter users. Operational Restrictions: Adverse rulings could force Coinbase to delist certain assets or alter its business practices. Coinbase’s strategy to push for federal jurisdiction is an attempt to streamline these challenges, potentially consolidating similar legal issues under a single court and jurisdiction, which could lead to more consistent outcomes and potentially clearer guidance, albeit within the context of litigation rather than legislation. Looking Ahead: The Path to Regulatory Clarity The battle over jurisdiction in the Coinbase lawsuit is more than just a procedural squabble; it’s a key moment in the ongoing struggle to define the regulatory future of the crypto industry in the United States. While legislative efforts to create a clear federal framework have stalled, legal cases like this one, along with the SEC’s actions, are actively shaping the regulatory landscape through enforcement and judicial interpretation. For participants in the crypto market, these developments underscore the importance of monitoring regulatory actions and understanding the potential legal status of different digital assets. The outcome of jurisdictional disputes and the underlying allegations of selling unregistered securities will have lasting impacts on how crypto exchanges operate and how digital assets are treated under U.S. law. Conclusion Coinbase’s move to shift the Oregon state lawsuit to federal court marks a significant development in the ongoing regulatory saga surrounding the cryptocurrency industry. By arguing for federal jurisdiction and claiming state overreach, Coinbase is not only defending itself against specific allegations of selling unregistered securities but also actively participating in the broader debate about the appropriate level of government to oversee crypto activities. This Coinbase lawsuit highlights the urgent need for regulatory clarity and uniformity, as the current patchwork of state and federal actions creates complexity and uncertainty for businesses and investors alike. The resolution of this jurisdictional question and the ultimate outcome of the case will be closely watched, offering potential insights into the future direction of crypto regulation in the United States.

But while Pepe dominates headlines, Unilabs is redefining what smart crypto investing looks like. It is bringing the power of AI in the world of assets management, providing game-changing features to even retail traders. Continue reading this article to find out more about it. Pepe Coin Price Analysis: A Surprising 40% Rally in June Pepe coin price has regained popularity following a swift revival from a brief drop. The currently best meme coin is trading over $0.000013 after a 40% surge in the last month. Pepe coin price recently dipped close to $0.000012, but straight recovered owing to heavy buying activity at key support levels. This recovery could point toward a bigger market surge for this best meme coin. A famous analyst predicts that the Pepe coin price will skyrocket after Bitcoin surpasses $120,000. During the recent massive Bitcoin surge, Pepe’s market capitalization skyrocketed from $400 million to $4 billion, providing investors with a 10x return in just one month. The analyst thinks that PEPE, the best meme coin, which has a market capitalization of $5 billion, would rise by a lesser but still significant 3x. Assuming this trend continues, the Pepe coin price might reach $0.000045. The forecast sees Pepe as tightly linked to Bitcoin and forecasts that the best meme coin will gain significantly in the coming weeks. Over a 4-hour period, the Pepe coin price is currently trading at about $0.00001439. The Pepe coin price remains below important resistance levels of $0.000015 and $0.000017, which are crucial for confirming an upward trend. However, the MACD indicator recently generated a bullish signal when the MACD line crossed over the signal line. Based on this, it appears that buyers are building momentum, which might lead to price spikes soon.

As of Q2 of 2025, Unilabs already has over $30 million in Assets Under Management (AUM), which shows the high investor interest in its ecosystem, despite being a fresh project. The platform’s highlighted features include a proprietary AI tool called EASS (Early Access Scoring System). It analyzes new crypto tokens using metrics like team credibility, market momentum, and profit potential. With it, investors can find promising projects before they surge parabolically. This helps them stay ahead of the market with early access to hidden gems. Another leading feature is its breakthrough Memecoin Identification Tool. It will scan blockchain data and social signals to detect trending meme coins before they take a ride to the moon. This feature allows retail investors to get a rare edge in spotting early-stage meme coins that could deliver 50x or even 100x ROI. The best part about UNIL is its four AI-powered specialized funds: the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund. Investors get a broad exposure via this and can invest in any one of these according to their risk level and diversify their portfolio for higher returns. PEPE vs Unilabs: Next Market Leader? Even though the Pepe coin price is bullish in recent weeks, Unilabs offers something meaningful with real-world utility and multi-strategy income tools. While PEPE remains a speculative token that is boosted by internet trends only, Unilabs is built for active and profitable investment options with tools for retail traders that were once reserved for institutional traders only. Unilabs blends DeFi tokens with traditional asset logic. This way, investors who want crypto growth can have a hybrid portfolio without leaving conventional investment strategies behind. Its native token UNIL is currently in its presale phase. The presale is a super-hit as its total funding nears the $2M mark in only 2 presale rounds. Each UNIL token is currently priced at $0.0051 only, a highly discounted price for this high-potential project.

Pump or Dump? Analyst Explains All Possibilities!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/what-to-expect-for-xrp-price-in-the-coming-days-pump-or-dump-analyst-explains-all-possibilities/,"Following US President Donald Trump's victory in November 2024, the rally in XRP, one of the altcoins that rose the most along with Bitcoin )=, has slowed down. XRP, which rose to over $3 with a big rise, fell below $2 due to tariff tensions in April. After gaining $2, XRP continued to stay above this level, while the XRP open interest approached $5 billion. While this indicates increased speculative activity in the derivatives market, it is also seen as a sign that strong volatility may be experienced in XRP. Speaking to CoinDesk, Bitget Chief Market Analyst Ryan Lee stated that XRP open interest has risen to around $5 billion. Ryan Lee warned investors who are short, stating that if the increase in XRP open interest is combined with a possible XRP price increase, a short squeeze could occur. “Over the weekend, XRP open interest rose to nearly $5 billion. This means that investors engaged in significant speculative activity in the derivatives market. “Such a rapid increase in open interest is indicative of strong potential momentum as market participants prepare for decisive moves.” In contrast, the analyst said that long positions could be in danger if there is no clear catalyst to push the XRP price higher, and that long positions could be liquidated en masse. This is also likely to increase downward pressure on the XRP price. “Without a clear catalyst for XRP, open interest could be liquidated in either direction. If long positions are liquidated, downside pressure could intensify,” Lee said. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What to Expect for XRP Price in the Coming Days? Pump or Dump?

Whale Wallets Are Still Accumulating These XRP Rivals,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/does-this-bitcoin-price-dump-signal-the-end-of-the-bull-market-whale-wallets-are-still-accumulating-these-xrp-rivals/,"The Bitcoin price drop has prompted many people to ask if it marks the end of the bull market or if it is simply pausing for a while. While most investors are panicking, whale wallets are still acting discreetly but taking action. Their targets? Sui Crypto and Remittix, two promising tokens that want to rival XRP, gaining attention despite the drop in the market. Whales appear to be betting against the instability of the Bitcoin price, watching Sui Crypto’s rising DEX volumes alongside Remittix’s promising remittance technology. Bitcoin Price Dip Sparks Panic Bitcoin’s decline to $104,910 as of June 1, 2025, has caused doubts about the bull market. According to experts, several factors, including geopolitical issues and economic problems are responsible for this, even though Bitcoin price still boasts 50% annual growth. Source: CoinMarketCap Traders holding the asset have been selling, which indicates that the cycle is mature. As the Bitcoin price looks to rise above $107,000, short-term holders are looking to cut their exposure, showing that the bull market is at its peak. Analysts have also predicted a drop before the asset hits another high, noting that the bull market may be postponed. There is also the issue of regulatory changes. The SEC recently dropped its complaint against Binance, showing that they intend to cooperate with these platforms under the Trump administration. The House of Representatives also introduced the Digital Asset Market Clarity (CLARITY) Act to regulate digital assets, with analysts noting that it could be a big win for the crypto market, especially the Bitcoin price. Despite reports of a recent Bitcoin price drop, previous trends and current data have shown that the bulls may have temporarily paused their activities for now. Why Smart Money Is Flowing Into Sui Crypto Whale wallets are buying Sui Crypto, a token that is rivaling XRP, indicating trust from investors. Sui’s 80% price jump in the past month, touching around $3.27 as of June 1, 2025, and DEX volumes rising above that of other big companies drove the rise. Source: TradingView The fundamentals of Sui Crypto remain strong despite the asset seeing a 16% price fall after the $223 million Cetus Protocol hack. The Sui Foundation’s assistance and its community’s belief have kept the price of the token up, with technical indicators showing it could hit a record high. As institutional interest grows, Canary Capital filed an ETF linked to Sui, showing a belief in the regulatory approval under the new United States administration. Analysts believe this will help Sui Crypto’s legitimacy with traditional investors. Sui Crypto is starting to show that it can be stronger than XRP as whales have been buying a lot of the tokens. Technical indicators, institutional interest, and increasing usage show that Sui Crypto can grow in the crypto industry. Remittix: The XRP Rival Turning Simplicity into Global Crypto Utility Remittix, a new XRP rival, is quietly making its way up in the crypto market by showing its practical value, while the market is being dominated by established tokens like the Bitcoin price. It enables users to send more than 100 digital assets to bank accounts globally, converting them into fiat currencies. There are no hidden fee charges, wallet confusion, or intermediate stages. The platform makes it easy for businesses to accept digital assets and settle them in fiat using Remittix’s API, which works for both fiat and crypto pairs. The process is easy to use and has been attracting early fiat investors. With almost $15.5 million raised and the token still in presale, RTX has a good chance of becoming a major player in the cross-border payments market and eventually surpassing XRP. Conclusion The market is presently on alert due to the issues surrounding the Bitcoin price. Whales are turning to projects like Sui Crypto and Remittix, XRP rivals, for hope in the market. Remittix, with its $0.0781 entry price and aim to simplify crypto conversions, is attracting the most whales. This has caused some analysts to call it the next breakout token in the market. In a few days, over 66% of the tokens have been sold out in its current presale round, showing that new and experienced traders are bullish about the token.

A new tax law will significantly impact capital gains, especially for high-net-worth individuals , and is expected to reshape how investors manage both traditional and digital assets. Australia Crypto Tax Law Targets Unrealized Gains A major policy shift, dubbed “landmark” by analyst Fred Krueger , introduces a capital gains tax on unrealized gains for the 2025–2026 fiscal year. This new rule will apply to assets exceeding 3 million AUD (about US$2 million ), including stocks, real estate, and digital assets like Bitcoin . The tax— up to 15% —will apply even if the gains exist only on paper and have not been realized by selling the assets. The rationale? Officials argue these taxes are essential to fill budget gaps . Ripple CTO David Schwartz offered a long-term strategy, suggesting that investors could use their appreciated assets as loan collateral rather than liquidating them. Backlash From Experts The move has not gone unchallenged. Critics warn it may reduce investor confidence and harm Australia’s economic appeal. Tom Lee , Chief Investment Officer at Fundstart Capital, condemned the policy, calling it an “insanely bad idea” that could shrink investment inflows and damage long-term growth. .article-inside-link { margin-left: 0 !important; border: 1px solid #0052CC4D; border-left: 0; border-right: 0; padding: 10px 0; text-align: left; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li { font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: 600; list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 0; display: inline-block; } .entry ul.article-inside-link li:last-child { display: none; } Also Read : Pakistan Makes Another Big Move: New Draft on Crypto Regulation , Australia Introduces Crypto ATM Limit Amid Rising Scam Cases In parallel with the new tax law, Australia’s Financial Intelligence Agency, AUSTRAC , has rolled out new rules to tackle the rising threat of crypto scams . A new limit of 5,000 AUD (about US$3,250 ) per transaction is being implemented for crypto ATMs . The change comes after alarming statistics revealed that 72% of crypto transactions involved in scams were made by individuals over the age of 50 . AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas stated that the updated rule will enhance transparency , safeguard consumer rights , and maintain market integrity . Final Thoughts Over the past year, Australia has reported more than 150 crypto fraud cases , resulting in over 3 million AUD in total losses.

Recently, attention has turned to the Solayer ecosystem following a notable crypto transfer . According to insights from the on-chain analytics platform Onchain Lens, a digital wallet identified as being linked to the Solayer team executed a substantial transfer. The transaction involved moving a considerable amount of LAYER token , the native asset of the Solayer protocol, directly to the Binance exchange. Understanding the Solayer LAYER Transfer The specifics of the transfer are quite striking. The wallet associated with the Solayer team moved precisely 4.15 million LAYER token units. At the time of the reported transfer, this volume of tokens was valued at approximately $3.54 million USD. Such a large movement of assets, especially from a team or foundation wallet to a major exchange like Binance , is closely watched by market participants and analysts using on-chain data . Why is this particular crypto transfer noteworthy? Large token movements to exchanges often signal potential selling activity. While there can be various legitimate reasons for a team to deposit tokens onto an exchange – such as providing liquidity, covering operational costs, or facilitating strategic partnerships – the immediate assumption many traders make is that these assets could be liquidated, potentially increasing selling pressure on the token’s price. What is Solayer and the LAYER Token? Before diving deeper into the implications, let’s briefly touch upon what Solayer is. Solayer is a restaking protocol built on the Solana blockchain. It aims to bring restaking concepts, similar to those popularized in the Ethereum ecosystem, to Solana. The LAYER token serves as the utility and governance token within this ecosystem, likely used for staking, rewards, or participating in protocol decisions. Understanding the project’s fundamentals is crucial when analyzing team-related transfers. A healthy project typically manages its token treasury transparently, and significant movements are often accompanied by official communication to avoid speculation and maintain investor confidence. Why Does On-Chain Data Matter for Binance Transfers? This event highlights the critical role of on-chain data in providing transparency in the cryptocurrency market. Unlike traditional finance, where large institutional movements are often opaque, blockchain technology allows anyone to view transactions on the public ledger. Platforms like Onchain Lens specialize in tracking and interpreting these movements, offering valuable insights into potential market dynamics. Monitoring flows to and from exchanges, particularly major ones like Binance , is a key strategy for many traders. Significant inflows can suggest increased selling supply, while large outflows might indicate accumulation or movement to cold storage. Here’s a quick look at why monitoring on-chain data for exchange flows is important: Potential Selling Pressure: Large deposits, especially from known wallets (like team or early investor wallets), can indicate an intent to sell. Liquidity Analysis: Exchange balances reflect the immediate supply available for trading. Investor Sentiment: Aggregate flows can sometimes provide a pulse on overall market sentiment for a specific asset. Transparency: It allows the community to see where significant amounts of tokens are moving. Potential Reasons for the Solayer Team’s Crypto Transfer While the exact reason for the Solayer team moving 4.15 million LAYER token to Binance hasn’t been officially stated, several possibilities exist: Liquidity Provision: The team might be moving tokens to provide liquidity on the exchange, potentially for market making or ensuring smooth trading. Operational Costs: Funds might be needed to cover ongoing development costs, marketing, or team salaries, requiring conversion of tokens to stablecoins or fiat. Strategic Partnerships: The tokens could be part of a strategic deal or collaboration that requires assets on an exchange. Token Distribution/Airdrop Preparation: Though less common for such large amounts directly to a trading venue, it’s a theoretical possibility depending on their plans. Selling: As mentioned, this is the most speculated reason when team tokens move to exchanges, potentially to realize gains or fund future operations. Without official communication from the Solayer team, the precise motivation behind this significant crypto transfer remains subject to interpretation based on the publicly available on-chain data . Market Reaction and Actionable Insights News of such transfers often leads to speculation among traders and investors. For holders of the LAYER token , monitoring the market’s reaction to this news is crucial. Increased selling pressure following the transfer could indicate that a portion of the deposited tokens is being sold on Binance . Actionable Insights for Readers: Monitor LAYER Price: Keep a close eye on the price action of the LAYER token on exchanges like Binance . Look for increased volume and price volatility. Follow Official Channels: Look for any official announcements from the Solayer team regarding the purpose of this transfer. Transparency is key to dispelling negative speculation. Use On-Chain Data Tools: Familiarize yourself with tools and platforms that track exchange flows and whale movements to gain independent insights. Exercise Caution: Large team deposits can add selling pressure. Consider this information as part of your overall risk assessment for the LAYER token . This event serves as a reminder of the importance of staying informed using all available information, including on-chain data , when navigating the cryptocurrency markets. Conclusion: Watching the LAYER Token’s Next Move The transfer of 4.15 million LAYER token , valued at $3.54 million, from a Solayer team wallet to Binance is a significant event that warrants attention. While the reasons behind this crypto transfer are not yet officially confirmed, the move has been flagged by on-chain data analysts and raises questions about potential future selling pressure on the token. Investors and traders interested in the LAYER token and the Solayer ecosystem should closely monitor market developments and any official communications from the team to understand the full context and potential impact of this substantial asset movement.

Not only that, the daily trading volume for Ripple has also seen a modest boost in its numbers, rising 11% to $1.87 billion. This indicates that the market has seen a recent rise in XRP trading activity. At the moment, XRP’s market cap stands at $129 billion.

The company plans to use the funding to advance its initiative to build a Solana (SOL)-based treasury reserve. The New York-headquartered company said on Monday it expects an initial closing and funding of $11M shortly after customary closing conditions are satisfied. Classover must dedicate up to 80% of the net proceeds to purchasing SOL under the terms of the deal. Chardan Capital Markets LLC will act as the financial advisor and sole placement agent for the offering. Chardan will be paid a cash fee equal to 1% of the net proceeds received by the Company from the sale of the notes in the offering. The latest funding round complemented Classover’s previously announced $400M equity purchase agreement, increasing the company’s total potential financing to $900M. The company initiated its Solana reserve strategy by purchasing 6,472 SOL for approximately $1.05M and is exploring the acquisition of discounted sets of locked tokens to further its accumulation and treasury objectives. Company CEO Ms. Luo hails the agreement as a pivotal milestone Classover CEO Stephanie Luo emphasized the significance of the deal, stating that it marked an important milestone in Classover’s long-term vision to align its treasury strategy with the global digital economy. The company faced significant operational challenges, with InvestingPro data showing a 102% year-over-year revenue decline and an overall Financial Health Score rated as “WEAK.” The financing came as InvestingPro analysis showed the company’s current ratio was just 0.02, indicating significant pressure on working capital. The data also revealed that the company operated with moderate debt levels but faced challenges with short-term liquidity, making the fresh funding round critical for its operations. The convertible notes will allow holders to convert them into Classover’s Class B common stock at an initial conversion price of 200% of the stock’s closing price on the day before the closing date, with potential adjustments as specified in the notes. “By entering into this agreement, Classover reaffirms its strong commitment to becoming a leader in blockchain-aligned financial strategy and positioning itself among the first publicly traded companies to directly integrate SOL into its treasury operations.” – Stephanie Luo , CEO at Classover Holdings Inc. More details on the purchase agreement and the terms of the notes are in Classover’s Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Classover shares jump 40% after Solana treasury announcement Classover Holdings shares surged nearly 40% on Monday after unveiling plans to raise up to $500 million for a Solana-based corporate treasury. However, Yahoo Finance data shows that the share price dipped 1.88% in after-hours trading. The stock remained down 48.19% over the past month and 7.23% year-to-date. In May, Classover shares surged 510% to $6.78 after the company entered into an equity purchase facility agreement with Solana Strategies Holdings to support working capital and pursue acquisitions. However, the shares were down to $2.67 by May 31 and recorded a 52-week high of $10.65. Coingecko’s data also showed that Solana rallied to $160 amid mixed signals, reflecting a 4.5% increase over the past 24 hours. However, SOL saw an 8.4% decline over the past week. New developments with the Classover partnership point to prospective momentum swings that might influence the asset’s near-term path.

Each of these could have a big impact on the crypto market, especially Bitcoin and altcoins. 6th June: Non-Farm Payrolls & Unemployment Rate On June 6th, all eyes will be on the Non-Farm Payrolls report and the updated unemployment rate. In April, the US added 177,000 jobs and kept unemployment steady at 4.2%. This time, economists expect a smaller gain of 130,000 jobs. If job growth slows more than expected, the Federal Reserve might decide to ease up on its strict money policies. A weaker dollar could then make Bitcoin more attractive for those seeking safe havens during market uncertainty 11th June — CPI Inflation Report Next up, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for May will be released on June 11th. This report is one of the most important inflation indicators in the US. In April, inflation cooled to 2.3%, slightly below the 2.4% forecast. For May, analysts expect inflation to rise back to 2.4%. If inflation stays in check or falls, the Fed may consider cutting interest rates, creating a more positive environment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies 12th June – PPI Inflation Report The next day, June 12th, brings the Producer Price Index (PPI) report. This report tracks how much manufacturers charge for goods. In April, PPI inflation was at 2.4%, slightly below forecasts. For June, analysts expect a small rise to 2.5% 17th June – FOMC Minutes June 17th is a big day. As it brings the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes. Investors will look closely at these notes for hints about future policy. Current possibilty suggest a 95% chance that the Fed will leave rates unchanged in June. However, any sign that the Fed is considering easier policies later this year could be bullish for Bitcoin. 17th June — U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes Also on June 17, the US will release the Import and Export Price Indexes. These indexes measure changes in prices of goods traded internationally. In April, the Import Price Index was steady at 0.1%.

But the conversation is changing. Why? For many, these concepts or trends are complicated and extremely risky. However, there’s good news. OKToken. What is OKToken anyway? And how is it changing the discourse around DeFi? OKToken is a next-gen ERC-20 digital asset on the Ethereum network that was designed expressly for long-term benefits through its unique on-chain formula that divides USDT reserve by the circulating supply. How to Earn in Crypto Without Trading OKToken introduces an unprecedented model, a viable alternative to speculative strategies. And unlike other platforms that require users to rely on market swings and human-influenced trading decisions, its on-chain formula is based only on mathematics; OKToken price = USDT in contract ÷ circulating supply . From buying tokens token to earning profit—OKToken dispels the common practice of trading, farming, or staking to earn gains on your investments. Besides being an alternative to staking and farming, the OKToken USDT reserve formula enables predictable growth. The allure of the crypto market is unpredictability and volatility, meaning that token prices can go up and down as the market shifts. But OKToken’s model differs in that regard—it dispels unpredictability, guaranteeing that the price can only go up or stay the same—it can never go down. Additionally, once your net profit exceeds +20%, the contract automatically closes your position and releases your returns. Passive Income in DeFi Without Farming While traditional DeFi projects require liquidity provisions, risk exposure, and multiple strategies, OKToken simplifies everything in a plethora of ways: No staking, no farming, or LP No lock-ups Starts from $10 Auto-sell at +20% net profit An open-source transparent on-chain contract OKToken aims to show users that there is a stable strategy in Web3 with minimal entry barriers. Most projects require you to part way with enormous sums of money, creating an entry barrier for low-income investors. But OKToken is different. It has a mere $10 registration fee. Additionally, OKToken adopts a similar model to the hourglass model—a supply and price mechanism designed to favor irreversible growth, akin to how sand fills an hourglass. As time passes and users continue to buy OKToken, the USDT reserve grows while the circulating supply decreases through token burns. This model supports price stability as well as protects early participants. How to Start with $10 in Crypto Getting started with OKToken is simple. You must visit the website, connect a compatible wallet like MetaMask or TrustWallet to the network, purchase $10 worth of OKToken via USDT, and activate the contract. This platform also offers an affiliate program, another viable avenue for you to earn. You must click on the top-right corner of your account and copy your personalized invite link to share with friends. The affiliate structure is split into three tiers: Level 1: 20% of the project’s revenue Level 2: 20% of the revenue generated by the Level 1 partner you referred Level 3: 20% of the revenue generated by the Level 2 partner you referred OKToken as a Crypto with Rising Price As the DeFi landscape experiences massive success, users are on the lookout for transparent, stable, efficient, safe, and legitimate alternatives to farming, staking, and speculative trading. OKToken delivers that with a token with no lock-up fund, zero unpredictability, and a seamless user experience. It is more than a token, it is a viable way to grow your portfolio without the plethora of risks synonymous with the crypto and DeFi markets.",Information,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING|USDT,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-03 12:25:45

The ruling clarified that retail sales of XRP do not constitute investment contracts, effectively placing them outside the SEC’s jurisdiction. This decision has been pivotal in shaping the regulatory understanding of digital assets, despite ongoing debates from Bitcoin advocates who continue to claim XRP lacks clear classification. Ripple lawyer Bill Morgan has now directly addressed these arguments, asserting that legal clarity has been established where it matters most — in court. bill morgan @Belisarius2020 · Follow There is illogical nonsense being spread about the issue of legal clarity and XRP. The proposition is that XRP lacks legal clarity because no court has ‘classified’ what it is. Bitcoin maxis say Bitcoin has been classified as a commodity but XRP has not been so classified so 4:06 PM · Jun 3, 2025 73 Reply Copy link Read 12 replies XRP retail sales not securities, says Torres ruling Morgan, a pro-Ripple legal analyst, outlined that the core issue in the SEC’s lawsuit against Ripple was never about labelling XRP itself as a security or commodity, but whether the nature of its sale to investors met the criteria of an investment contract under existing securities law. Judge Torres found that institutional sales of XRP did meet that definition, while retail sales did not. This dual outcome provided a nuanced legal framework that separates XRP’s treatment based on how and to whom it was sold. Morgan explained that US courts do not assign labels to digital assets. Instead, they resolve disputes based on the facts of a case. Therefore, the question of whether XRP is a security or commodity misses the point. The clarity comes from how the court interpreted the law in the context of XRP’s distribution — a distinction often overlooked by critics. Bitcoin classification argument lacks legal grounding Bitcoin supporters — often referred to as Bitcoin Maximalists or “Maxis” — have argued that because XRP has not received a classification from regulatory bodies such as the SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), it remains in a legal grey area. They contrast this with Bitcoin’s status as a commodity recognised by both agencies, suggesting this places Bitcoin on firmer regulatory footing. Morgan challenged that logic, stating that classification is not absolute and can vary depending on the legal framework of different countries. For instance, Australian authorities treat Bitcoin as property rather than a commodity. He noted that insisting on a single, universal classification is legally flawed and undermines how the court system functions in the US. In his view, the ruling from Judge Torres has already settled the question of XRP’s legal status for retail sales, and that alone constitutes meaningful clarity. Ripple supports regulatory framework for crypto In addition to the courtroom win, Ripple has also welcomed legislative developments aimed at improving the regulatory environment for digital assets. Ripple’s Chief Legal Officer Stuart Alderoty endorsed the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act passed in the US last week, which aims to provide clearer rules for the classification and regulation of cryptocurrencies. Morgan echoed the sentiment, adding that clarity should come through legal outcomes rather than political declarations or market assumptions. He maintained that the court ruling on XRP offers a strong precedent for how digital asset transactions should be assessed going forward. Rather than fixating on labels, he said, regulators and industry participants should focus on how assets are used and sold in practice. In a symbolic gesture of reconciliation, Ripple co-founder Brad Garlinghouse donated the “Skull of Satoshi” artwork — often seen as a satirical emblem of crypto culture — to the Bitcoin community. While largely symbolic, the move appeared to aim at diffusing hostilities between supporters of rival blockchain platforms following years of animosity.

While most of the market has been on an upward trajectory over the past month, XRP has remained relatively flat; in the past week, it has declined by over 7%. Looking elsewhere for growth, Ripple (XRP) investors have been timing their exits and moving capital into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . As interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to gain ground, analysts have made some lofty predictions regarding its price. Let us look at these price forecasts. Analysts predict $5 for MUTM Mutuum Finance is currently in the presale, where each token is selling for $0.03. At the current level, a rise to $5 would signal an over 160x price increase. However, when looking back at other revolutionary projects in the crypto world, these gains are modest. For instance, early XRP investors have seen gains of over 300x. There are good reasons why many analysts believe that the price of MUTM tokens could rise to $5 when the token goes live. They include: A Successful Certik Audit One of the most important requirements for modern crypto investors is security. The best way for a project to demonstrate that it is secure is via a Certik audit. Certik audits are held in high regard in the crypto world, and they usually signal that investors can trust a project. With trust for the Mutuum Finance protocol at its highest level possible, this project could easily rise to $5. Recent CoinMarketCap Listing When looking for new projects to invest in, one of the places most investors turn to is the CoinMarketCap crypto price aggregator platform. Mutuum Finance recently secured a listing on the world-famous platform. Not only will this boost its visibility, but it will also help to increase trust in the project. CoinMarketCap is known for having high standards when listing a project. They often check that it has undergone the right audits and various other security measures. The reason for this is that they aim to remain a trusted source of price data on the crypto industry. Consequently, projects that show signs of manipulation would not get a listing on this prestigious platform. Awesome Protocol Design In the DeFi world, the main driver of growth is innovation. Investors are always on the hunt for a platform that allows them to make stable profits over the long term. Unfortunately, many DeFi projects have suffered from a lack of consistency. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has designed a protocol that ensures all participants get the full benefits of DeFi with none of the downsides. One of the critical decisions they made was asset vetting. When depositors send their funds to a smart contract on Mutuum Finance (MUTM), they begin to receive interest. The interest rate is set by market forces, and rises as pool utilization rises. To ensure that the platform remains solvent in the long term, only high-quality assets are allowed. The assets allowed on the platform are determined algorithmically, based on various metrics that check for liquidity, centralization, volatility, and much more. However, the platform also balances the needs for deep liquidity. As such, it may allow assets with low liquidity and high volatility. To determine which of these assets to allow, it checks market demand for them and weighs them against the long-term stability of the platform. To entice high-quality assets into the platform, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will create a rewards program to reward stakers of these assets. This deliberate choice ensures that resources are allocated where they are likely to have the best outcome for the platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale wows investors Investors have been keeping a close eye on the ongoing Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale, which has delivered some amazing numbers. It has so far raised over $9.9 million from eager investors. More than 11,500 investors have taken part in the ongoing presale, which is in phase 5. At the current price of $0.03, investors stand to make a 100% ROI based on the listing price of $0.06. However, those returns pale in comparison to the analysts’ forecast of $5 for MUTM tokens once they go live. On top of the factors mentioned above, another one that is expected to fuel the rise to $5 is the upcoming beta launch of the platform. The Mutuum Finance team has time for this release to be on the same day as the token listing. As the platform’s features become available to the public, it is going to generate publicity and news stories on its amazing design. That could push an unprecedented level of capital into Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as investors seek to own a share of the future of finance. You could avoid this mud rush on listing day by adding MUTM tokens to your portfolio at the current price of $0.03. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will rise by 16.67%, diminishing the expected returns.

While analysts predict further gains, WIF’s hourly RSI at 71 signals overbought conditions, suggesting a potential short-term pullback. WIF on the Run The cryptocurrency market registered a slight rebound in the past 24 hours, but dogwifhat (WIF) stole the show by becoming the best performer from the top 100 club . WIF Price, Source: CoinGecko Its price spiked by 17% within this timeframe, currently trading at just south of $1. WIF’s market capitalization surged to nearly $1 billion, surpassing FLOKI to become the eighth-largest meme coin. The asset’s impressive resurgence coincides with the rising WIF trading volume. The figure has exceeded $510 million in the last 24 hours, thus surpassing TRX ($440 million), ADA ($473 million), HYPE ($318 million), and many other leading altcoins. This suggests increased interest from investors. WIF is a popular dog-themed meme coin based on the Solana blockchain. It went live at the end of 2023, and it traded at mere cents initially. A few months later, however, the token became one of crypto’s rock stars, with its price skyrocketing to an all-time high of almost $5 and a market capitalization beyond $4.5 billion. Many major crypto exchanges, including Binance , Coinbase, and Kraken, have listed WIF in recent years, while notable industry figures like Arthur Hayes have publicly endorsed it. The Next Targets? Multiple analysts and market observers believe the price of the meme coin has much more room for growth. The X user Coinvo described the recent spike as a “classic break and retest” pattern, which is about to send the valuation “absolutely parabolic.” Sjuul also chipped in. He told his almost 500,000 followers on the social media platform that WIF’s current condition is “not looking bad,” suggesting that the price is preparing for a further surge above $1.45. However, investors should tread carefully due to the notorious volatility of meme coins in general. They should also keep an eye on WIF’s Relative Strength Index (RSI), whose ratio has risen to 71 on an hourly scale.

The move, instituted through a June 2 blog post, occurs against the background of increasing pressure on the Ethereum ecosystem to address technical delays threatening the network's dominance. Why the Shake-Up? The EF outlined three priorities for the reconstituted Protocol team: Scaling Ethereum's base layer (L1) to handle greater transaction load. Scaling blobspace , a critical component for rollup data availability. Improving user experience (UX) to attract mainstream onboarding. The reshuffle follows months of criticism over the EF's governance and direction. Skeptics argue that Ethereum will lag behind rivals like Solana and zkEVMs if it fails to address scalability and usability. But sources also point out that the changes in the organization are also on efficiency and responsibility. More lean, the Foundation also expects to end internal silos, quicker decisions, and the assurance that resources are laser-focused on the most important upgrades. That may mean deeper interactions with the broader Ethereum development community, including outsider researchers and client teams, as the network prepares for its next wave of innovation. “The EF’s ‘messy’ R&D approach wasn’t cutting it. This reboot is about focus—scaling L1 and making Ethereum user-friendly isn’t optional anymore.” Pectra Upgrade Looms: A Test for the New Team Timing is everything. Ethereum's Pectra upgrade, which was implemented on May 7, added 11 EIPs intended to enhance scalability and wallet functionality. Developers are already making their way toward the next milestone: Fusaka, which will introduce PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling) to make blob transactions faster. Feature Pectra Upgrade Fusaka Upgrade Launch Date May 2025 Expected late 2025 Main Focus UX, staking, L2 integration Scalability, data availability Key Innovation Smart accounts, more blobs PeerDAS, higher gas limits Staking Changes Bigger validator balances Improved validator coordination Scalability Impact Doubles blob capacity Major boost to block/gas limits The EF's thinner Protocol team is now tasked with maintaining momentum while integrating the knowledge of recently laid-off staff. Large developers like Tim Beiko and Alex Stokes are redeployed to concentrated areas of activity, but morale issues continue. The shake-up also raised up discussion about developer financing and long-term sustainability. With fewer full-time members, the Foundation can end up increasingly relying on grants, bounties, and community-initiated projects to fill gaps—an approach that democratizes development but splinters if not handled with delicacy. Community Reactions: Hope and Skepticism Some in the Ethereum community are optimistic about the Foundation’s restructuring, arguing it will help teams focus on scaling and user experience. For example, @BullishOnETH thinks this streamlining is overdue, writing: “Finally! The EF is streamlining to focus on what matters: scaling and UX. ETH to $10k.” Supporters believe this decisive move could boost innovation and keep Ethereum ahead of competitors. Others are far more skeptical, warning that layoffs during a crucial upgrade cycle could hurt morale and slow progress. @DeFiWatchdog sees the timing as risky, stating: “The EF layoffs are a red flag. Cutting R&D during a critical upgrade cycle? Not a good look.” Critics fear losing talent now could undermine Ethereum’s ability to deliver on its ambitious roadmap. What's Next for Ethereum? The reorganized Protocol team now must: Ramp up Verkle tree integration to become the new Merkle Patricia Trees. Have Fusaka's PeerDAS rolling out smoothly by late 2025. Balance transparency with efficiency — a tall order for an under-the-microscope team. If the Foundation's gamble succeeds, Ethereum could emerge leaner and more competitive. But with the Pectra upgrade fresh and Fusaka in the pipeline, the next year will be a test of whether a leaner, re-sharpened R&D team can deliver on the network's ambitious roadmap. As Ethereum's Protocol team makes its shift, the stakes cannot be higher. With Pectra live and Fusaka on the horizon, the EF's wager on efficiency will break or make ETH's dominance or expose its vulnerabilities.",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|SOL|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-06-03 13:44:06

Geopolitical tensions and shifting trade policies are creating ripples across cryptocurrency markets, with shiba inu emerging as a surprising beneficiary amid the uncertainty. Still, the cryptocurrency failed to maintain gains above the 100-day simple moving average (SMA) at $0.00001332 and changed hands at $0.00001317 at the time of writing, representing a 2.9% gain over the past 24 hours.

The decline happened despite the increase in the adoption of the smart contract network. According to the report of XRPL monthly activity from XPMarket, the network still managed to pull more unique active wallets for May despite the lower activity. During the month, 278,362 wallets executed transactions instead of the 252,000 in April. Most of the transactions were related to payments, showing that this has been the network’s primary use case. However, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Automated Market Maker (AMM) activity increased, with NFT mints rising to 2.56 million from 1.76 million. XRPL transaction type for May 2025 (Source: XPMarket) Most of the NFT mints and trades happened on XRP Cafe, while other dApps on the network, such as XPMarket and Bidd, also saw some activity. Interestingly, the surge in mints was not an indicator of increased NFT transactions on XRPL because it was matched with increased burns and cancellations, while trading also declined by 8.4%. This shows that users are still experimenting with XRPL’s NFT capabilities by creating and dropping assets. The data also showed an increase in the network AMM activity, with both deposits and withdrawals growing during the month, further confirming that most network users are still testing out its features. 10% of active wallets interacted with dApps in May While the transaction volume for XRPL fell in May and was significantly lower compared to other major smart contract networks such as Ethereum and Solana , the biggest sore point for the network was the interaction with decentralized applications (dApps). According to the report, over 28,000 wallets interacted with any known dApp on the network during the month. This is around 10% of all the unique active wallets for the month and underscores XRPL’s struggles with user adoption. Interestingly, a breakdown of the data further shows the dearth of substantial user engagement on the network. Of the around 28,000 wallets, 23,606 interacted with only one dApp. 3,782 users engaged with two dApps, while 968 wallets interacted with three decentralized platforms. The ultra users engaged with more than three dApps, with 293 users during the month. Despite being only 0.11% of all unique active wallets, ultra users for May were more than those in April, when only 150 wallets interacted with more than three dApps. As the report observed, the low engagement rate represents a challenge for XRPL, and the network must find a way to “ keep users interested and active across the ecosystem.” Unsurprisingly, the struggle to see mass adoption by users is reflected in the total value locked (TVL) on the network. According to Defillama , XRPL only has $58.76 million in TVL, which is low enough to rank outside the top 50 blockchain networks for DeFi value. Institutional adoption soars for XRPL While user engagement remains a sticky point for XRPL, the network has seen increased institutional adoption in the past few months, mostly due to Ripple Payments. Since Ripple got regulatory approval to offer its payment services in the United Arab Emirates, at least two companies have been onboarded to the service, which means they are using XRPL. The Dubai Land Department also recently announced that it chose XRPL for its real estate tokenization project pilot, which is another evidence of institutional use, especially in the Middle East and Asia. Nevertheless, its failure to see mass adoption after 13 years has not stopped many from being bullish on the XRP token. Sustainable energy company Vivo Power recently announced a $100 million XRP treasury, joining the millions of retail users who hold the token. XRP has been up 3% in the last 24 hours and trades at $2.207, even though it remains down 4.95% year to date.

It all started in India, where someone working with Coinbase was paid to leak the data. Now, many people are asking if the KYC rules that are supposed to keep them safe are making things worse. How the Breach Happened? The breach, which happened in December 2024, was not caused by a direct hack of Coinbase’s systems. Instead, hackers bribed a customer service agent working for TaskUs in India to steal sensitive information belonging to about 70,000 Coinbase users. This employee allegedly used her personal phone to take pictures of private data, while a suspected accomplice helped pass this information on to the hackers. The stolen data included government-issued IDs, home addresses, and other personal details. In May 2025, Coinbase officially revealed the breach in an SEC filing and confirmed that employee data had also been accessed during the incident. Perhaps, this shocking act turned the spotlight on how KYC and outsourced teams might be exposing crypto users to serious risks. KYC: Helping or Hurting? Eventually, KYC was introduced to stop money laundering and crime. But in real life, it’s the everyday crypto users who get exposed when there’s a breach. Illicit actors are even using fake IDs made with AI to get around these checks. However, 404 Media reported that half of identity checks can now be bypassed with these AI tools. In one case in 2023, blockchain detective ZachXBT showed how easy it was to trick an exchange by pretending to be North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un! What’s The Solution: Zero-Knowledge Tech Some people think zero-knowledge (ZK) technology could be the answer. It can let people prove their identity without sharing personal details. But ZK tools are costly and hard to put in place, and experts believe that regulators are unlikely to relax KYC rules anytime soon. As the fallout continues, users are urged to take extra steps to stay safe. Experts recommend turning on two-factor authentication and never sharing seed phrases or private info with anyone",News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|ZK,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-03 13:45:28

With an increasing need for AI in blockchain, this token is now catching the attention of many for all the positive reasons. The Ozak AI ecosystem plans to use real-time information and predictions to achieve many goals by 2025. Let us discuss the significant achievements the project is targeting during these remaining months. 1. Finish All Presale Phases Successfully Ozak AI started the year strong with its presale launch. The project has already raised over $1.1 million, with each $OZ token currently priced at just $0.003. The team is moving forward with the presale rounds and the capital raised will help boost development and begin the marketing phase. With the current pace, the token might sell out much sooner than people expect. The next stage 4 price will go up to $0.005 per token. 2. Deploy the Ozak Stream Network (OSN) The Ozak Stream Network is an impressive and exciting highlight of the project. The system will send data in real-time with very little delay. This advantage is essential for investors and traders who depend on prompt and reliable information. The launch of the network is scheduled for before the fourth quarter. After going live, it will enhance the experience for users using any Ozak AI platform. 3. Launch AI-Powered Prediction Agents Ozak AI is working on introducing customizable Prediction Agents. They will assess the market situation, build forecasts and send out trading recommendations. It will enable investors to invest wisely and more safely. Agents will use machine learning that improves as new information is added. 4. Integrate a Decentralized Infrastructure Layer The lack of complete transparency and security is a primary issue in crypto. For this reason, Ozak AI will develop a decentralized physical infrastructure network (DePIN). With this upgrade, the single points of failure are reduced and the organization’s data is more protected. It will also make it possible for users to add resources and receive passive benefits. 5. Expand into the DeFi Ecosystem Ozak AI is interested in facilitating transactions through decentralized finance. They plan on including automated investing solutions, AI-controlled risk management and smart contracts. Such tools will simplify and make DeFi operations easier for everyone. Ozak AI’s involvement in DeFi will expand its purpose and reach more users. 6. List the $OZ Token on Major Exchanges Token accessibility remains a key focus. Ozak AI aims to get listed on top centralized and decentralized exchanges by the end of the year. These listings will boost liquidity, attract institutional interest, and increase the token’s market visibility. 7. Reach a Price Target of $1 Finally, the team has its eyes on a major price target. Analysts and early backers believe the $OZ token could hit $1 by the end of 2025 due to its planned listing price of $0.05. That would be a 300x gain from its current price, rewarding early investors handsomely. Conclusion Ozak AI is not just another AI project. It has a clear roadmap and growing support. As it works toward these milestones, the project is positioning itself for long-term success in the AI-crypto space.

Meanwhile, all eyes are turning toward Ruvi AI (RUVI) , a promising new cryptocurrency that has been gaining serious momentum. With analysts predicting that Ruvi AI could lead the next bull run, investors are starting to take note of its remarkable growth potential and groundbreaking technology. Dogecoin’s Struggles Dogecoin’s meteoric rise in past market cycles was primarily driven by hype and celebrity endorsements, but its recent performance has painted a less-than-rosy picture. The coin’s lack of intrinsic utility has caused skepticism among investors. With no significant technological advancements or partnerships to speak of, Dogecoin has struggled to maintain relevance in an increasingly competitive market. This decline in DOGE’s market position has forced many investors to rethink their strategies and pivot toward tokens with greater practical value and long-term growth potential. The Rise of Ruvi AI Enter Ruvi AI, a project standing out for all the right reasons. Ruvi AI aims to bridge the gap between blockchain and artificial intelligence, focusing on solving real-world problems across critical industries.

According to a May 28 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, an eye-popping 4.9 billion votes were cast in opposition while 3.92 million — a mere 0.08% of the total — supported the proposal. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg controls 61% of the company’s voting power, an April regulatory statement reveals, which could mean that he voted down the idea. The proposal, submitted in January by Bitcoin champion Ethan Peck, representing the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), asked Meta to convert a portion of its $72 billion in excess cash and cash equivalents into the apex crypto to better preserve shareholder value. The measure touted Bitcoin, with its fixed supply and strong past performance compared to bonds, as a more reliable long-term store of value. Peck claimed that the tech giant should treat the largest crypto as a strategic reserve asset, similar to a corporate war chest designed to endure monetary policy uncertainty. He also pointed out that Meta’s second-largest shareholder, BlackRock, advised that a 2% Bitcoin allocation is reasonable. While Meta doesn’t want to hold crypto on its balance sheet, the firm has previously dipped its toes into blockchain. In June 2019, it unveiled Libra, a global stablecoin project backed by a basket of fiat currencies. That project collapsed in 2022 after unwelcome regulatory scrutiny and internal wrangles, rebranding briefly as Diem before shutting down and selling assets to crypto bank Silvergate . Peck also submitted similar Bitcoin treasury proposals to Microsoft and Amazon on behalf of the conservative think tank NCPPR. Microsoft shareholders voted against the plan in December, while Amazon shareholders are awaiting a vote on whether to put at least 5% of the company’s assets into Bitcoin. Bitcoin Treasury Frenzy Though Bitcoin treasury proposals were rejected by Meta and Microsoft, global publicly listed companies continue accumulating the flagship crypto. Data tracked by Bitcoin Treasuries shows that over 115 public companies have added Bitcoin to their balance sheets, with one of the newest entrants being GameStop. Michael Saylor’s Strategy leads all publicly traded firms with 580,955 BTC , worth over $60 billion, while eight others, including Marathon Digital Holdings and Elon Musk’s Tesla, each hold roughly $1 billion worth of Bitcoin.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-03 13:50:29

Bitcoin’s (BTC) grip on the crypto market may soon loosen. On Tuesday, June 3, MEXC COO Tracy Jin shared her analysis with crypto.news, highlighting significant signs of an upcoming altcoin season. Notably, Jin explains that Ethereum’s (ETH) performance following the Pectra upgrade is showing strong momentum. “Ethereum is decisively leading the charge for transition and capital rotation into altcoins in this current market cycle, and other coins like XMR, ENA, HYPE, AAVE, and ARB are following suit, posting more than 5% gains in contrast to BTC’s muted 0.6% gain during Tuesday’s recovery rally,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. You might also like: Here’s why we won’t see altcoin season any time soon, according to analysts Jin also emphasized that exchange-traded fund flows have recently tilted decisively in Ethereum’s favor. Specifically, Ethereum ETFs have recorded an 11-day streak of inflows totaling $630 million. In contrast, Bitcoin ETFs saw three consecutive days of outflows, totaling $1.2 billion. According to Jin, this indicates rising institutional interest in Ethereum, especially in the aftermath of the Pectra upgrade. She notes that more institutions are now considering alternatives to Bitcoin ahead of the next market cycle. You might also like: Ethereum’s Pectra upgrade is a game changer, staking infrastructure firm P2P.org explains We are not in altcoin season yet, Jin suggests Still, Jin clarifies that the altcoin season has not officially begun. For one, only 27 out of the top 100 altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s dominance remains strong at 63.1% . That said, Ethereum has posted modest gains, with its dominance increasing by 2% in May. “While recent altcoin performance has been encouraging, history suggests that the true altseason typically begins when Bitcoin’s dominance starts to diminish, and doesn’t take hold until Bitcoin’s dominance starts to decline more meaningfully,” Tracy Jin, MEXC. For a full-fledged altcoin season to emerge, Jin believes Bitcoin’s dominance must drop more sharply. She suggests this is possible as Bitcoin stabilizes at the psychological level of $100,000. In that case, Ethereum could break through the $2,750 resistance and rally toward $3,200.

It’s all about the sentiment shift, as concerns about Bitcoin’s energy consumption are easing in light of the growing energy demands of artificial intelligence (AI). With institutional buying, we might see a run to $250,000. AI’s Energy Appetite Shifts Spotlight From Bitcoin For years, Bitcoin has faced criticism over its energy consumption, which amounts to around 176 terawatt-hours (TWh) annually. However, a recent study in Joule projects that AI could soon overshadow Bitcoin’s impact, with predictions that AI may consume 49% of global data center electricity by 2025, totaling approximately 201 TWh per year. New analysis by Alex de Vries-Gao predicts that by late 2025, AI’s power consumption will approach half of all global data center energy use — meaning AI could soon outpace Bitcoin mining! #AI #Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/jIfhjLrktm — YomirGo (@YomirGo) June 3, 2025 Industry experts, such as Alex de Vries-Gao , note that AI’s unchecked growth is driven by big tech firms rapidly expanding their infrastructure without complete transparency on energy usage. Nvidia alone has been absorbing nearly 48% of Taiwan Semiconductor’s chip packaging capacity, underscoring the surge in demand for AI hardware. Elon Musk’s xAI initiative aims to create one of the world’s largest AI superclusters, intensifying concerns about energy demands. This shift in focus from Bitcoin’s energy use to AI’s consumption has improved Bitcoin’s environmental perception among investors, helping it regain momentum. Institutional Confidence Drives Bullish Outlook; Bitcoin Supported? Adding fuel to Bitcoin’s rally is The Blockchain Group’s recent acquisition of 624 BTC worth $68.7 million, bringing its total holdings to 1,471 BTC, valued at over $106 million. The company plans to acquire 260,000 BTC by 2033, reflecting robust institutional confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term prospects.

Bitcoin Technical Setup Points to $250K Potential Bitcoin price prediction remains neutral as BTC has formed a tightening symmetrical triangle on the 2-hour chart, with dynamic support from the 50-period exponential moving average (EMA) near $105,295. Bitcoin Price Chart – Source: Tradingview Candlestick patterns, including doji and spinning tops, suggest indecision and potential reversal, while the MACD is turning bullish with an impending crossover. Entry: Buy above $106,571 on confirmation. Target: $108,933, with a potential upside to $250K as catalysts align. Stop-loss: Below $105,215 to manage risk. This unique combination of AI’s energy impact, improved sentiment, and rising institutional interest presents a compelling case for Bitcoin’s next significant move toward $250,000. BTC Bull Token Presale Nears $7.8M Cap as 61% APY Staking Attracts Investors With BTC/USD trading near $105K, attention is rapidly shifting to altcoins, especially BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . As of today, the presale has raised $6,772,528.93 out of a $7,789,647 cap, with just over $1 million left before the next price hike. BTC-Pegged Rewards and Supply Burns Drive Scarcity BTC Bull Token’s innovative mechanism ties rewards directly to Bitcoin’s price. Here’s how it works: BTC Airdrops: Token holders receive BTC rewards, with presale participants enjoying priority. Supply Reductions: For every $50,000 increase in BTC’s price, a portion of $BTCBULL is burned, reducing overall supply and supporting token value. Current Token Price: $0.002545, poised to rise as the cap nears. This approach blends dynamic rewards with built-in scarcity, aligning $BTCBULL’s value with Bitcoin’s performance. 61% APY Staking Pool Without Lockups BTC Bull Token’s staking pool offers an enticing 61% APY, currently holding 1,731,936,103 $BTCBULL. The key benefits include: No Lockups or Fees: Investors can stake and unstake their tokens freely without incurring penalties. Full Liquidity: Access funds anytime, unlike typical DeFi lockups. Consistent Yields: Passive income for token holders, independent of market conditions. This structure appeals to both seasoned DeFi investors and newcomers seeking yield without complex terms. Momentum Builds Ahead of Presale Cap With less than $1 million left before the presale closes, buyers are moving fast. BTCBULL’s combination of BTC-tied rewards, strategic burns, and high-yield staking is driving participation. The presale offers an opportunity to enter before the subsequent price increase, especially as BTC’s price action intensifies. Key Highlights: USDT Raised: $6,772,528.93 / $7,789,647 Token Price: $0.002545 Total Staking Pool: 1.73 billion $BTCBULL Staking APY: ~61% BTCBULL Token’s innovative model is attracting attention as it nears its hard cap. The presale window is closing quickly, making this the last chance to secure the current price before the subsequent price increase.

Following the Dubai Financial Services Authority’s approval, RLUSD can now be integrated into Ripple’s licensed payments platform and used by companies within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), which can now use RLUSD for multiple virtual asset services, including payments and treasury management. The DIFC is a free economic zone and financial district that serves businesses throughout the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. Over 7,000 companies operate within the financial hub. RLUSD, which went live in December, has been touted as a highly regulated enterprise-grade stablecoin product. As reported previously by ZyCrypto , the stablecoin also received approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) just before its official launch. In March, Ripple obtained full regulatory approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority to offer blockchain-powered payment solutions. With the DFSA license, the company was preparing to tap into the UAE’s flourishing $40 billion international payments market. The most recent approval could help strengthen Ripple’s footprint in the region’s fast-growing digital asset ecosystem, where regulatory clarity has been a key catalyst boosting adoption. “The DFSA’s approval of RLUSD is proof of our commitment to building a stablecoin that meets the highest standards of trust, transparency, and utility,” said Ripple’s Senior Vice President of Stablecoins, Jack McDonald, in a statement. “With regulation-first design and enterprise-grade features, RLUSD is uniquely positioned to drive institutional use of blockchain technology across global markets, starting with cross-border payments.” Strengthening Ties In A Crypto-Friendly Region The approval of RLUSD for use within the Dubai International Financial Centre comes as Ripple is expanding its presence in the crypto-friendly UAE. The company has recently teamed up with several local entities, including digital bank Zand and fintech platform Mamo, which are expected to be early adopters of its regulated payment services. Additionally, Ripple has partnered with infrastructure provider Ctrl Alt to support the Dubai Land Department’s (DLD) pioneering Real Estate Tokenization Project. The company said real estate title deeds will be tokenized on the XRP Ledger. With its latest Dubai approval, Ripple continues to position itself as a dominant player in blockchain-based payments, even as its long-standing legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission recently hit a roadblock .",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-03 13:56:20

In the last month, it dipped slightly by 0.25%. In six months, MKR experienced a significant decline of 31.8%. The 10-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) is $1,592, and the 100-day SMA is $1606.22. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 41.57, indicating MKR is approaching oversold territory. The Stochastic oscillator is at 21.11, also suggesting potential oversold conditions. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) level is 2.3588, which could signal possible upward momentum soon. Based on these indicators, MKR might be poised for a rebound. The nearest resistance level is $1,895, approximately 19% above the current price range. The nearest support level is $1,365, about 13% below. If MKR breaks through $1,895, it could target the second resistance at $2,160, a potential increase of around 46%. Conversely, if it falls below $1,365, it may drop to the second support at $1,100, a decrease of about 26%. Uniswap Uniswap (UNI) has seen significant price changes recently. In the past month, its price increased by 15.52%, showing a positive trend. However, in the last week, the price dropped by 1.45%. Over six months, UNI declined by 59.97%, indicating a major downward movement. UNI is trading between $5.57 and $7.37, below its recent average prices of $6.17 (10-day average) and $6.38 (100-day average). This suggests the price is lower than usual, which might indicate a bearish trend. Some market indicators show the token might be oversold, meaning the price could be too low and might rise soon. However, other signals point to slight downward momentum. If the price rises, UNI may face resistance at $8.44, about 14% above the current price. Breaking this level could lead to $10.25, a potential 39% increase. If it falls, support exists at $4.83 and then at $3.02, which is about 46% below the current price. The data suggests UNI’s price could rise or fall, so traders will watch these levels. Conclusion While MKR and UNI show strength, XYZ’s unique sports-meme platform and ambitious growth targets position it as a standout in the current bull market.

Within hours, pro-XRP attorney Fred Rispoli fired back on X. “I love @daveweisberger1, but on this point he is mcgloning so hard,” he wrote, invoking Bloomberg strategist Mike McGlone’s reputation for bearish hyperbole. “Just based on what I’m getting offered for my Ripple shares on the secondary market, I don’t think Ripple would even have to sell one XRP to buy Circle.” Rispoli agreed that Ripple cannot raise $10 billion in pure cash, yet insisted the company could “easily afford the acquisition for a mix of cash and debt” and a heavy equity-swap. Related Reading: $3 XRP Dream Delayed—No Bull Run Before November, Says Top Analyst When Weisberger replied that Circle’s board would likely demand hard dollars unless it accepted Ripple equity or XRP “without a haircut,” Rispoli dug in. “No way to get $10B in cash—and $10B is too high anyway,” he wrote, citing late-2024 private-research valuations that placed Ripple at $15 billion excluding its ~36 billion escrowed XRP. If Circle’s price tag fell to $7–9 billion, he said, Ripple could close with “$1–3 billion cash on hand, a heavy stock exchange, and debt,” especially with “all that GCC money sloshing around crypto world right now.” Rispoli conceded it would be “a reach” but “doable without meaningfully selling XRP.” Weisberger acknowledged the math—“That’s a reasonable analysis,” he wrote—yet cautioned that any price at the upper end of Rispoli’s range “could be some short-term pain for us XRP holders.” Ripple’s tender-offer buyback in January 2024 valued the company at $11.3 billion, disclosing more than $1 billion in cash and about $25 billion in digital assets—mostly XRP—on its books. The firm still controls roughly 52 billion XRP (about 40 percent of supply), though 36 billion sit in timed escrow releases, limiting immediate access. At today’s $2.20 spot price, the spendable portion is worth a little under $35 billion, but moving even a fraction quickly would collide with thin venue depth—a point Weisberger hammered home. Related Reading: Wave Count Analysis Reveals The XRP Price Trigger Point For Take-Off Ripple’s cash pile also shrank after its $1.25 billion purchase of prime broker Hidden Road in April, a deal settled with a blend of cash, equity and RLUSD stablecoins. That acquisition suggests the company prefers hybrid structures, bolstering Rispoli’s claim that Treasury XRP need not flood the market. Is Circle Even For Sale? The debate may be academic. Circle, issuer of USDC, has repeatedly declared it “not for sale” while marching toward a New York Stock Exchange listing that now targets a $7.2 billion valuation. Ripple’s rumored approach earlier this spring reportedly topped $5 billion, well below Weisberger’s stress case and within Rispoli’s “doable” band, but Circle rebuffed the talks and updated its S-1 two weeks later, enlarging the float rather than seeking a buyer. Strategically, Ripple already fields its own dollar-token RLUSD, launched in January and positioned by president Monica Long as “complementary to XRP, not a competitor.” Absorbing USDC’s issuer would instantly rocket Ripple towards the size of Tether. Even under Rispoli’s optimistic structure, Ripple might still need to liquidate several hundred million dollars’ worth of XRP for working capital and closing costs.

Strategic Diversification and Treasury Resilience The move, revealed in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on June 2, positions the Hong Kong -based logistics technology and real estate company among a growing list of global firms turning to Bitcoin as a reserve asset. According to details from the filing, Reitar Logtech’s proposed Bitcoin acquisition is part of a broader treasury diversification initiative aimed at reinforcing the company’s financial resilience. The firm plans to use the digital asset allocation to support its global logistics technology infrastructure expansion while leveraging the benefits of holding a non-correlated financial asset. CEO’s Perspective Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Chan emphasized the strategic rationale behind the move, stating, “This strategic treasury diversification initiative underscores our commitment to maintaining a strong financial foundation while scaling our global logistics technology platform…By exploring bitcoin treasury allocation, we aim to fortify our financial position while aligning with digital transformation trends in the supply chain industry.” BTC Program and Acquisition Framework The Nasdaq-listed firm (RITR) disclosed it is in advanced negotiations with a consortium of institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals experienced in digital asset investments. Under its proposed ""BTC Program,"" Reitar Logtech would acquire Bitcoin held by the consortium by issuing its ordinary shares. The number of shares allocated would be determined based on the prevailing Bitcoin price and the company’s share price at the time of each transaction. The company’s tentative plan outlines the purchase of 15,000 Bitcoin, with an illustrative valuation of $1.5 billion based on a hypothetical price of $100,000 per Bitcoin. Reitar’s management indicated the initiative would not only bolster its balance sheet but also provide operational flexibility for logistics technology acquisitions and expansion into high-growth Asian smart logistics markets. Market Reaction and Next Steps Following the announcement and SEC filing, shares of Reitar Logtech rose by 9% on Monday, reflecting investor optimism around the strategic shift. The positive market response signals a broader acceptance of Bitcoin and other digital assets as credible components of corporate treasury strategies. Reitar Logtech noted that discussions remain ongoing, with the final terms subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory clearances, and due diligence processes. The company acknowledged that there is no guarantee the deal will proceed or that any Bitcoin will ultimately be purchased. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The feature allows developers to leverage staked assets from any integrated blockchain to verify protocol decisions on any other supported chain. According to a press release shared with Cryptonews, Relay unlocks shared staking logic and trustless coordination across blockchain ecosystems, which was previously impossible for developers. “This opens the door for protocols to build bridges, settlement layers, oracles, and rollups without relying on multisigs or proof-of-authority setups, and without sacrificing decentralization,” Symbiotic noted. Staking is Possible Between Entirely Different Networks, Tokens The announcement marks the first time, stake alignment is possible between different networks, tokens, and consensus layers. Additionally, this capability introduces a new paradigm for building truly multichain decentralized applications (dApps), the release explained. Algys Ievlev, co-founder of Symbiotic, emphasized the difficulties in building secure multichain infrastructure, which remained expensive custom work. “Relay solves that,” he noted. It makes verifiable, stake-backed coordination between chains as simple as a plug-in without any trust assumptions or permissioning, enabling secure outcomes across ecosystems.” Besides, for users, the dApps can verify outcomes and process interactions across chains, without trust issues. Symbiotic Relay Enables a Unified Crypto Ecosystem The feature combines the strengths of the largest blockchain ecosystems into a single coordination layer, the release read. Chains including Bitcoin , Ethereum and Solana , which were once siloed, can now be tapped simultaneously. This includes combining Bitcoin’s security, Ethereum’s programmability, and Solana’s speed, all while using staked capital as a shared source of verifiable security. In April, Symbiotic raised a $29 million Series A funding round led by Pantera Capital. The funding saw participation from Coinbase Ventures and more than 100 angel investors across industry-leading teams such as Aave, Polygon, and StarkWare. Symbiotic announced a $29 million fund that would launch the Universal Staking framework, extending blockchain security into broader economic coordination. #Symbiotic #Staking #BlockchainSecurity https://t.co/8lXScjcp88 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 23, 2025 Misha Putiatin, co-founder of Symbiotic, told Cryptonews at the TOKEN2049 Dubai exclusive interview that the company is already working with over 40 networks, preparing to launch. “Most protocols want to reward users and create meaningful alignment between users and protocol success,” he told Cryptonews. “But there hasn’t been a flexible, modular system that lets you do that across multiple chains—until now.” The post Coinbase-Backed Symbiotic Launches ‘Relay’ for Trustless Multichain Staking and Consensus appeared first on Cryptonews .",Blockchain News|Staking|Symbiotic,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|SOL|SPONSORED,"{'name': 'cryptonews', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptonews.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptonews,2025-06-03 14:06:33

In a recent YouTube video titled “Ask Me Anything,” the Cardano boss expressed support for Ripple, explaining that the payment firm’s acquisition of Circle can strengthen the cryptocurrency ecosystem. “There’d be antitrust concerns with the Ripple acquisition of Circle. I think it’d make the space better.” He asserted. Hoskinson remains critical of the current cryptocurrency ecosystem, explaining that combined efforts have been made to centralize the space, making it difficult for projects outside these in-groups to thrive. Hoskinson, who stated that a “Coinbase A16Z Circle mafia” is dedicated to creating an exclusive network within the crypto ecosystem, is quoted as saying; “And if you are outside of it, you get completely blacklisted, and it’s hard to get listed, it’s hard to get liquidity, and it’s hard to get a stablecoin.” Sheraz Ahmed, the managing partner at blockchain consulting firm STROM Partners, who shares Hoskinson’s sentiments, remarked that the acquisition of Circle and other potential future acquisitions are signaling a shift in the market. Crypto officials amplify centralization concerns Speaking to Blockwork’s Katherine Ross, Ahmed explained that a “few dominant players are absorbing the best tech.” While the move legitimizes the crypto space, it raises concerns about decentralization, he asserted. The conversations follow rumours that Coinbase and Ripple are bidding to acquire Circle. Ryan Rasmussen, the head of research at Bitwise, told Blockworks that Circle offers attractive opportunities that he believes will prompt Coinbase to go after the stablecoin issuer. “They already clearly leaned into USDC as the go-to stablecoin across the Base ecosystem, and really across Coinbase…You get yield on USDC just for holding it in your account. So I think from an issuer perspective, it makes a lot of sense.”",Cryptocurrency|News|Cardano|Charles Hoskinson|Circle|Ripple,EN,0,0,ADA|BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|USDC,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-03 14:07:09

Pepe coin ( PEPE ) climbed from last week’s low of $0.000011 to a high of $0.00001285. This rebound occurred in a high-volume environment, with 24-hour trading volume surging by 40% to $1.05 billion. Pepe rallied for several reasons. First, the recent crypto market crash has stalled over the past few days. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has risen from last week’s low of $103,000 to $105,400, while Ethereum ( ETH ) rose to $2,650 Pepe is highly sensitive to Ethereum price movements because it is the second-biggest meme coin in its ecosystem after Shiba Inu ( SHIB ). For instance, it crashed by 81% between its high in November last year and its low in April, as Ethereum tumbled from $4,000 to $1,300. Pepe has also jumped as on-chain data indicates accumulation by both smart money and retail investors. The number of PEPE holders has risen to 446,000, up from 366,000 on January 1.

Pepe smart money buying | Source: Nansen Additional data shows that the supply of Pepe coins on exchanges has been in a steady decline. It dropped to 104.85 trillion, down from 160 trillion at the start of the year. Falling supply suggests that investors are holding rather than selling. On-chain data on Pepe holders and exchange supplies | Source: Santiment Pepe price technical analysis Pepe chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Pepe has rebounded from a low of $0.000005815 in April to $0.00001260. It has formed a golden cross pattern, with the 50-day and 200-day moving averages crossing, a technical setup that often signals long-term bullish potential. Therefore, further gains will be confirmed if the price breaks above the key resistance level at $0.00001615, the May high. If that occurs, the next level to watch is $0.00002830, representing a 123% increase from the current price. A drop below the support at $0.000010 would invalidate the bullish outlook.

Stage 1 of the presale sold out in a flash, and Stage 2, now live at just $0.00000035, offers crypto investors a rare shot at a deep-value entry point backed by a potential 10,000% ROI, according to early market forecasts. With an 80% bonus still in play, and backed by solid fundamentals and well-designed floppynomics, this altcoin is becoming the focal point for investors chasing exponential gains before altcoin euphoria returns. Why FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) Presale Is A Strategic Entry Point For 10,000% ROI FloppyPepe (FPPE) is rapidly positioning itself as one of the most asymmetric ROI opportunities in the current altcoin market. The crypto project’s presale isn’t just another early buy-in; it’s a calculated launchpad designed to reward high-conviction participants before exponential growth kicks in. What sets early investors up for a massive ROI potential is not just their early entry, it’s also this altcoin’s intentional fusion of aggressive floppynomic architecture designed to boost its value over time. The zero-tax, deflationary framework, which also features a 1% burn on every transaction, enables consistent supply compression as demand builds while organically engineers scarcity, community growth, and social capital—all key drivers for vertical price action. With each presale stage increasing in price, early buyers also benefit from compounding upside even before public trading begins on Uniswap and Tier-1 centralized exchanges. Moreover, the floppynomics permits a staking infrastructure and governance utility that will convert token holding into a yield-generating opportunity. As holders earn and participate, the token’s utility strengthens, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that drives both retention and valuation, exactly the kind of setup that historically precedes 10,000% ROI explosions in altcoin markets. Viral Utility Fuels This Altcoin’s Growth In The Crypto Market FloppyPepe (FPPE) integrates real AI infrastructure, such as FloppyX , a powerful agent for real-time video generation, interactive feedback loops, and personality-driven brand and meme content creation. Complementing it is Meme-o-Matic , a decentralized AI meme engine that converts cultural trends into high-velocity, viral assets. Users can generate, vote on, and monetize memes through contests and circulation, turning creativity into utility while driving continuous engagement and ecosystem growth. Community engagement is already surging, with prominent crypto influencers like David in Crypto spotlighting this altcoin’s AI-driven platform as a major strength in its future position in the market. As viral content spreads through these AI agents, so does the token’s footprint, turning each new participant into a node in its ever-expanding network. Moreover, expansion is already strategic and aggressive, with integrations on CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, and airdrop contests fueling global discovery. The project’s Discord and Telegram communities are growing rapidly, while its AI agents enter beta testing . Each campaign and partnership not only boosts visibility but also drives the transactional volume of this altcoin, setting the stage for both explosive launch momentum and sustainable post-listing ROI. The Best Time Take Advantage Of FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) 10,000% ROI Potential Is Now Momentum around FloppyPepe (FPPE) is building at a record-breaking pace, Stage 1 sold out in record time, and Stage 2 still offers a rare low entry at just $0.00000035 . Early backers are already sitting on gains, but the window is closing fast as each stage brings a programmed price increase. With listings on Uniswap and major CEX platforms looming, the ROI potential of this altcoin is rising dramatically. The active 80% bonus (Code: FLOPPY80 ), combined with referral rewards and exclusive airdrops, creates an unusually rich reward structure for crypto presale participants. These incentives are strategic tools designed to drive network growth, virality, and deep community involvement that could support the altcoin’s growth. In a crypto market on the verge of altcoin euphoria, this presale stands out as a clean-slate opportunity packed with AI utility, solid token economics, and strong security infrastructure, including a thorough and completed SolidProof audit . Every metric of this altcoin signals breakout potential. For serious ROI hunters, this presale is the last low-risk window before the exponential 10,000% growth curve kicks in.

RLUSD’s dual DFSA+NYDFS approval gives it a unique edge for global payments. UAE’s flexible rules attract stablecoin firms, unlike Europe’s strict MiCA regulations. On June 3, Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin scored a regulatory double-win, earning approval from both Dubai’s DFSA and New York’s NYDFS in a rare dual-certification move. The green light positions RLUSD as a heavyweight contender in the $160B stablecoin arena, backed by bulletproof 1:1 reserves and institutional-grade audits. Ripple USD is now a recognized crypto token under the DFSA’s regime in Dubai. RLUSD is: Enterprise-grade Compliant Built for real utility Another milestone as we expand our footprint in the DIFC and across the UAE. https://t.co/uvNcpRZDRG — Ripple (@Ripple) June 3, 2025 The approvals grant RLUSD firepower in Dubai’s financial hub while showing skeptics that Ripple’s stablecoin is compliant, redeemable, and built for the regulatory big leagues. Why DFSA Approval Is Just One Step in Ripple’s Regulatory Journey The Dubai Financial Services Authority’s approval of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin creates new opportunities within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), where nearly 7,000 financial institutions and technology companies operate. This regulatory milestone allows approved entities to incorporate the dollar-pegged digital asset into their payment systems. The decision comes amid measurable growth in stablecoin adoption across the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Chainalysis data shows a 55% increase in stablecoin transaction volume during 2024 compared to the previous year. Such market conditions suggest growing institutional interest in blockchain-based settlement alternatives. RLUSD APPROVED IN DUBAI: RIPPLE’S STABLECOIN GOES GLOBAL Source: RippleX It’s official: Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin has been approved by Dubai’s DFSA for use inside the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). This isn’t just another stablecoin. RLUSD is now:… — Jungle Inc Crypto News (@jungleincxrp) June 3, 2025 Ripple has positioned its technology to meet this demand. The company’s existing partnerships with UAE financial service providers—including digital bank Zand and payment platform Mamo—create natural pathways for RLUSD implementation. These collaborations may accelerate adoption among regional businesses seeking efficient cross-border payment solutions. Beyond financial transactions, Ripple is testing blockchain applications in property management through a pilot program with the Dubai Land Department. The project explores how distributed ledger technology could streamline real estate record-keeping processes. The DIFC’s approval reflects Dubai’s broader strategy to integrate digital assets within its $400 billion annual trade economy. As one of the few stablecoins approved by both DFSA and NYDFS regulators, RLUSD enters this market with established compliance credentials that may appeal to risk-conscious financial institutions. Tether vs. Ripple: The Dirham-Dollar Stablecoin Race Heating Up Ripple’s recent DFSA approval for its RLUSD stablecoin represents the culmination of a deliberate expansion strategy. The company first secured its full operational license in Dubai’s DIFC in March 2025 , establishing the necessary regulatory foundation. This development followed similar approvals for competing stablecoins— Circle’s USDC and EURC gained DIFC recognition in February 2025 under the centre’s updated crypto framework. USDC & EURC are the first stablecoins recognized by the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA)!

This activity coincides with tightening regulations elsewhere, particularly in Europe, where MiCA compliance now mandates large euro-denominated reserves—30% for smaller issuers and 60% for larger ones like Tether. These regulatory differences help explain why crypto firms favor jurisdictions like the UAE. The DIFC’s balanced approach combines clear guidelines with operational flexibility, contrasting with Europe’s more stringent requirements that increase compliance costs. Industry analysts view this regulatory divergence as a key factor shaping market development. Recent projections indicate the sector’s growth potential.

The bank’s base case predicts $2 trillion in stablecoin circulation by the end of the decade. Ripple’s Dubai approval and the flurry of regional activity appear to validate this growth trajectory, demonstrating how stablecoin innovation is becoming a global phenomenon rather than a U.S.-centric development. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Does Ripple’s Regulatory Approval Create an Uneven Playing Field Against SWIFT? Ripple’s DFSA approval allows faster blockchain payments versus SWIFT’s legacy system, but both serve different institutional needs in an evolving payments sector. How does RLUSD’s NYDFS charter benefit UAE businesses? RLUSD’s simultaneous approvals from Dubai’s DFSA and New York’s NYDFS mark a rare feat. It positions Ripple to serve international clients who crave cross-border compliance. Companies can now access dollar liquidity while transacting with U.S. partners, thereby avoiding the delays associated with unregulated stablecoins. What Regulatory Requirements Apply to RLUSD in Dubai? The DFSA mandates RLUSD maintain 1:1 USD reserves, undergo audits, and enforce AML controls—stricter oversight than unregulated stablecoins, but allowing licensed usage.

The UNIL presale has already hit over $2M, with a stage two price of just $0.0051. Meanwhile, sentiment towards the SEC vs. Ripple case continues to dictate XRP price predictions. On Saturday, May 31, the XRP token recorded a slight gain, partially reversing Friday’s 4.62% dip, closing the session at $2.17. Notably, the altcoin dipped below $2.10 for the first time since May, but later recovered. Unilabs Could Outperform Ripple with AI Utility Demand As XRP price predictions continue to attract negative predictions, Unilabs’ passive income is drawing more attention among crypto whales across the globe. As the DeFi market evolves rapidly, investors are also looking for more than just yield farms. Most of the investors now seek secure, smart, and dynamic ways of earning. This is where Unilabs jumps in. Unilabs is emerging as a key player in next-gen DeFi, aiming to bring institutional-grade asset discovery to everyday users However, the platform isn’t just about identifying the next high-yield project within the crypto market. It also provides all UNIL token holders with the chance to earn without trading through its passive income system. Unilabs has boosted its passive income options by adding features like mining pools. It also has a twelve-level reward system that lets UNIL holders earn a portion of the platform’s fees, with returns up to 122% APY. Legal Uncertainties Push XRP Price Below $2.1 The U.S. SEC held a final closed meeting on May 29, raising hopes within the crypto market for a second SEC request for the indicative ruling on settlement terms with the XRP Foundation. However, the SEC has remained quiet on the case involving the Ripple Foundation. Judge Torres rejected the SEC’s request for an indicative ruling that would lower the $125M penalty and lift the injunction prohibiting XRP sales to institutional investors. Since the rejection, the price of XRP has dipped from $2.57 to a May 31 low of $2.08, highlighting investors’ unease over the SEC’s silence and the ruling. Source: CoinMarketCap If the judge rejects the settlement terms, the XRP Foundation will cross-appeal, and the SEC will progress with its appeal. The altcoin’s recent dip has also attracted more negative XRP price predictions among analysts. If the SEC withdraws its appeal, Ripple may aim to reach its all-time high of $3.84, with ETF approval possibly driving XRP prices up to $5. A rejection will see the price of Ripple dip further toward the $1.50 level, forcing its investors to look for alternative projects like Unilabs. Unilabs’ 122% APY Leads to Over $2M in Presale Funding Unilabs demonstrates reliability and transparency by providing passive income to UNIL holders, with profits automatically distributed via smart contracts. This has already seen the UNIL token surpass key milestones, including the over $2M presale funding. With an increasing adoption, the UNIL token has also recorded impressive gains, including an over 27% gain from its starting price of $0.004. With over 70% of stage two sold out, stage three welcomes a new rally with a price target of $0.0062, representing a 55% gain from the $0.004 starting price. These milestones are what set the UNIL token apart, leading to bullish price predictions among crypto experts. The recent predictions suggest Unilabs could surge by 11,300% by June, making it one of the best crypto investment options. Conclusion The recent lawsuits facing the XRP Foundation are starting to have a significant impact on its price movement. With this, many analysts are starting to put out negative XRP price predictions, as the altcoin dips below the 2024 gains. Meanwhile, Unilabs continues to attract bullish predictions, as crypto experts believe it could rally by 11,300% in June.

It moved beyond mere token swaps. Lots of people and services turned to dollar-pegged coins for moving value. Activity hit fresh highs, hinting that stablecoins are now the main channel for on-chain payments. Related Reading: XRP Could Transform Your Finances Long Before $10K, Angel Investor Says Spike In Wallet Activity According to Artemis data, more than 33 million wallets sent or received stablecoins during May. That’s a big jump compared with earlier months. It shows more folks are leaning on these digital dollars than on native tokens. Many traders, DeFi users, and everyday people tapped stablecoins to keep their funds tied to the US dollar. This wave of usage also came as the wider market showed signs of life, with prices slowly rising and confidence climbing. Shift To Faster Networks Based on reports, BNB Smart Chain counted over 10 million active wallets for stablecoin moves early in May. TRON came very close, with a little over 9 million wallets during that same stretch. These two networks are cheap and quick. Folks want to dodge higher fees on older chains. By month’s end, both BNB Smart Chain and TRON could top those numbers again. That trend speaks to growing demand for fast, low-cost payments and DeFi deals. Ethereum simply can’t match these lower fees right now. Stablecoin Supply Growth Stablecoins also saw more tokens enter circulation. The total supply grew to $244 billion, up nearly 3% in just one month. But not all coins minted equally. Tether’s USDT remained the heavyweight champion. It added nearly $4 billion to its total supply in May alone. Most of that new USDT landed on TRON. Today, TRON holds nearly $78 billion in USDT, while Ethereum carries $73 billion. In sum, USDT’s overall supply now tops $153 billion and added tokens almost every day. USDC moved in the opposite direction. Its supply dipped slightly, thanks to outflows on Solana. Still, USDC keeps about $60 billion circulating across all its chains. Related Reading: Pepe Makes It To Trump’s Feed—Is A Crypto Endorsement Next?

The CCTP bridge saw $7.7 billion flow through it, up 83% month-on-month. That rush of bridging means more people are shuttling dollars between networks for trades, lending, or simple transfers.

Today, he is developing EVEDEX",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/thomas-kralow-mastered-the-art-of-adaptation-and-seizing-opportunities-in-every-circumstance-today-he-is-developing-evedex,"Having overcome the difficulties of a challenging childhood and a life-changing move to the United States, Thomas Kralow mastered the art of adaptation and seizing opportunities in every circumstance. Today, he is developing EVEDEX , a platform embodying his principles of financial freedom and security, and is also the founder of two funds and one of the largest educational projects in the world. How Thomas Kralow Carved His Path to the Top of the Industry The Beginning of the Journey How His Mother's Resilience and Life Challenges Shaped Thomas Kralow Thomas Kralow was born in Riga, Latvia, and has frequently emphasized in interviews that he grew up in a hard-working family. From his early childhood, his mother had envisioned him moving to the United States to pursue higher education, viewing it as a gateway to a better life. She saw education as the key to success, and Thomas consistently trusted her judgment, following her guidance. For his family, higher education held special significance, especially since, as Thomas recalls, his mother herself had to abandon her university studies due to family hardships. When Thomas was only two years old, his father, influenced by a new religious movement, gave away the family's entire business, cars, and house to the religious organization. Thomas recalls how this decision plunged him and his mother into severe hardship, marking a dramatic shift from comfort to poverty. ""My mother heated baby food using a candle,"" he remembered, describing this period as critical and challenging. Thomas always speaks proudly of his mother and admires her resilience. Growing up, he watched her rebuild their lives, simultaneously fulfilling both parental roles. In interviews, he consistently credits his mother for instilling core life principles in him, most notably a deep understanding of responsibility. Thomas is dedicated to ensuring his family always feels supported and cared for, vowing never to allow another woman in his life to endure similar struggles to what his mother faced. Moving to the USA Thomas explains that his mother, aware of the difficulties of living in Latvia, set a goal for herself: to secure a future for her son in the United States. She believed he would have far better opportunities there, especially if he earned a college degree. She insisted that Thomas apply to law school, convinced that a law degree is always in demand and guarantees a stable income. In Thomas’s view, his mother believed that success could be achieved only through a traditional system, simply because she didn’t know any other ways. For her, a stable profession and a university education seemed like reliable paths to a secure future, and she always tried to pass that belief on to her son. However, looking back now, Thomas admits that this degree never yielded the results he had hoped for and wasn’t a decisive factor in his success. First Earnings to Pay for College in the US One of the reasons Thomas started looking for part-time jobs in the US was the cost of his education. When he enrolled in college, his mother urged him to focus solely on his studies and not to worry about finances. But once he began, it turned out the tuition was far higher than expected, which pushed Thomas to seek additional income. Thomas’s first job was at the campus library, where he made about $600 per month. He recalls that this wasn’t much, and local regulations limited him to a maximum of four hours per shift. After a while, he realized the money wouldn’t cover all of his needs, so he started looking for other opportunities that would offer opportunities to earn a larger income. Thomas explains that to pinpoint new income streams, he used a deductive method, a strategy he still relies on today. The core idea was to analyze the world around him, identify what people needed, and see how his own abilities could meet those needs. He remembered his long-standing passion for cars, which led him to consider that market as a potential source of income. His first deal was selling an old Mazda Protege. This specific dark-green 2001 model was in poor shape: the body was rusty, and the exhaust emitted suspiciously colored smoke. Thomas bought it from a girl in a neighboring town for just $550, even though the market price for such a car was around $2,300–$2,700. Thomas says that fixing up the car cost him about $200. He replaced the head gasket himself, which he picked up for $30 at a local store, and used a spray can of paint to make the exterior look more presentable. To sell the car, Thomas got creative and only showed it to buyers in the evening so the covered-up rust wouldn’t be as noticeable. In the end, he made over $1,000 in profit on that single transaction. That was when he realized that in the US, people are often willing to take a financial loss just to get rid of unwanted items, and there’s profit potential in that. It was his first taste of the concept of margin and its possibilities. Next, Thomas switched to buying and reselling electronics, as well as restoring and selling discarded furniture. To make this work, he bought a yellow van that had once been used by plumbers for $1,500, which allowed him to transport and store items in a small warehouse. This new way of making money earned 18-year-old Thomas between $5,000 and $8,000 per month. Over time, his approach evolved into a system that he says still works to this day: many people are willing to part with items for next to nothing just to avoid the hassle of selling them. Thomas realized he could often find items like old dining sets in a dump and easily sell them for $100–$200. This income helped him to cover his educational expenses. Development in Trading Getting into Trading In his interviews, Thomas mentions that he first tried his hand at trading when he was around 15 or 16, but he soon gave it up because it seemed far too complicated and he had neither proper training nor support. Everything changed when, thanks to his mother, he happened to meet someone who became his mentor. A “Swiss German” named Alf, described by Thomas as “a professional in asset management, retail trading, and futures”. Thomas was astounded by how much Alf was earning, sums that seemed enormous compared to Thomas’s own income at the time, barely enough to afford a one-dollar burger. Alf invited Thomas to come to Switzerland and learn under his guidance. For Thomas, it was a major life decision: accepting this offer meant leaving his life in the US behind, taking a risk, and sacrificing friends, his future, and even his education. Despite all of the risks, he chose to go for it, and that marked the beginning of his journey. On the Importance of the Right Perception of the Industry Thomas often recalls that his mentor painted a picture of apparent simplicity: “Take it slowly, manage your risks, and everything will be fine.” On one hand, this idea gave him confidence, but later Thomas realized that such images create false expectations. He observes that many trading coaches on social media today perpetuate an illusion, portraying trading as easy and guaranteed to be profitable, requiring no special effort. For newcomers, this illusion of simplicity leads to unrealistic expectations and a lack of understanding of the complexities and risks. Thomas believes this activity is quite risky, especially if you’re trading with your savings and have family commitments, amongst others. “Statistically, you’re more likely to scale Mount Everest than to earn a steady income from trading”, Thomas says in one of his interviews, talking about how difficult it is to make money in this field. He suggests imagining reading a book about climbing Everest, but emphasizes that the author is the key factor: someone who simply gives advice, or someone who has actually done the climb themselves. Thomas stresses that this is the difference between mere information and genuine execution, and it explains why many trading courses fail to meet expectations: they offer knowledge (which isn’t always high-quality or current) but don’t provide the practical experience needed. When Thomas first began trading, he had $15,000 to start with. He recalls serious psychological hurdles because that was his entire savings. Still, he had a dream, to reach a million, and that goal drove him to overcome his fears and take risks where necessary. Thomas remembers that even a 10% profit on his $15,000 wasn’t enough to cover basic everyday needs such as bills, food, relationships, and living expenses. With earnings like that, he says, he would have been treading water, unable to move forward or work toward his bigger goal. Thomas explains that he always strictly controlled his risk, never exceeding 1–2% per trade. He stuck to simple rules, setting the risk-to-reward ratio at at least 2:1 or 3:1. Though he had other strategies, he avoided what he calls “foolish trades” carrying, say, 30% risk, because he believed that these types of trades were almost guaranteed to result in losses. These rules helped him to limit his losses but also curbed his profit potential. Thomas acknowledges that some traders get lucky: they manage to turn $15,000 into $200,000 in just two weeks, especially in crypto during a bull market if they happen to jump in at exactly the right time. In cases like that, he notes, fortune simply “smiles on them”. Thomas points out that these success stories create an unrealistic view of trading, overshadowing the reality that genuine success is defined by hard work and learning from mistakes. When he was just starting out, his budget constraints forced him to limit his risk even more carefully. In his first month, he took major losses (nearly $10,000) primarily because he was trading too often. To prevent similar mistakes, Thomas introduced a rule to stop trading after three consecutive losses and began meticulously recording every trade, analyzing not just entry and exit times, but 15 different factors including trends and market conditions. That’s how he noticed that if he was trading against a certain trend on a specific time frame, his odds of losing were much higher. In those scenarios, he stopped trading altogether, thereby reducing his risk. Thomas also discovered that most of his losses happened on Fridays. He explains this by pointing out that Friday felt like a Saturday to him, after working twelve hours a day consecutively. He also set a rule to stop trading if he had more than three stop-outs in one day, because trying to continue after multiple losses usually led to even bigger losses, on average, up to seven losing trades in a single day. Thomas emphasizes that understanding how the “heart of the market” works is crucial, as countless factors can instantly derail even the most carefully planned strategies. Market panic triggers sudden price swings, and, in his words, “you feel like an idiot trying to keep up with it all”. In Thomas’s opinion, rules, insight, and the right perception of trading are key to coping with the market’s ups and downs. That’s exactly what he taught his students at the “University of Trading” and continues to teach in his Game Changer program. Beyond the necessary technical knowledge, he focuses on the psychological side of trading, helping his students to build resilience and manage their emotions amid market uncertainty. Thomas notes that this is the main problem with most trading courses today: they typically focus on creating an illusion of guaranteed success without giving students practical skills or teaching them how to handle the psychological challenges of trading. Reflections The Importance of Social Media In numerous interviews, Thomas is often asked what he would do if he had to start from scratch. His response is that, with his current level of knowledge, he would focus on social media, because in his view, people and the trust they place in you are the most valuable asset in the world. He believes that building an audience and earning trust through social platforms is the best way to launch a business today. Thomas sees people as a resource more valuable than money (or even Bitcoin) because, unlike other assets, people don’t simply disappear. Trust, genuine value, and the energy created within a community are, in his opinion, extraordinarily powerful. Thomas is convinced that if you manage to gather even a thousand dedicated followers, you already have a significant asset. Moreover, if you approach social media growth mindfully and base audience interactions on trust, expanding that audience becomes more natural and less difficult. Thomas is certain that if he had 1.5 million followers on Instagram, he could easily launch almost any business, which, if managed properly, would be both successful and profitable. He emphasizes that his own audience growth was largely organic. While he did invest considerable funds in advertising, he claims it played a secondary role to organic growth. The key factor, according to him, was high-quality content and building trusting relationships with his audience. Thomas credits his wife with encouraging him to realize his potential. At the time they met, she was already working as a blogger. She suggested he start his own venture, perhaps a hedge fund, and manage external capital. She recognized his untapped potential as a social figure, pointing out that he could use a social platform to grow and promote the hedge fund. This conversation, he says, was a crucial turning point in his journey. Thomas recalls replying to his wife, “Where am I going to find clients? I don’t know anyone”, and initially continued trading exclusively with his own funds. In response, she encouraged him to develop his social media presence. Taking her advice to heart, Thomas began putting serious effort into his online platforms. Over time, his work paid off: by the time he launched his own hedge fund, many people already knew who he was and trusted him, making it much easier to attract a significant number of investors. He says people want to invest in other people, not in “some random companies”. The Importance of Choosing the Right Partner In many interviews, Thomas stresses that meeting his wife, Sofia, had a profound impact on his life and personal growth. Thanks to her, he discovered the motivation and inner strength to evolve. He openly admits that at the start of their relationship, he behaved harshly and sometimes unfairly, which he attributes to his past experiences in failed relationships. He says he acted “like a jerk”, but Sofia continued to stand by him despite everything. Thomas recalls how he felt her genuine emotions and unwavering support and acknowledges that “it was something incredibly rare and beautiful”, something he was ready to do anything to hold onto. He’s endlessly grateful to Sofia not only for her role in his personal life, but also for the contributions she made to his professional development. Thomas points out that when choosing a life partner, it’s important to pay attention to her inner qualities, how she makes you feel, and how you feel around her. He remembers how Sofia supported him through the toughest times, staying by his side through his highs, lows, and difficult emotional challenges. On Fiat Money and the Banking System Thomas believes that fiat currencies and the traditional banking system have no future. He notes that Bitcoin tends to rise during every crisis, which he attributes to the public’s distrust of what he calls an outdated financial system. People begin to value truly scarce assets, and in his opinion, Bitcoin is the only asset that qualifies as genuinely scarce. Thomas also believes the global economy is on the brink of a severe recession that could be extremely challenging, one of the reasons he avoids investing in stocks, calling it a bad idea. Thomas advises keeping a close eye on Bitcoin’s movements, noting that it follows global liquidity trends. For example, if the U.S. withdraws liquidity from the market, but Japan and China inject it, the market still sees an influx. He references China, where citizens saved roughly $2.4–$2.6 trillion during lockdowns and can now invest in cryptocurrency again via Hong Kong. In countries hit by inflation and crises, such as Argentina, where interest rates reach 97%, Bitcoin is trading at historic highs with a significant premium. Thomas is sharply critical of fiat currencies, pointing out that none of them are backed by real assets. He calls the U.S. dollar “the biggest scam”, deeming it ironic that people call Bitcoin a scam, given that Bitcoin derives real value from its scarcity. Thomas says he has invested significant amounts in Bitcoin and is aware of the risks: if the cryptocurrency were to lose its value, he would face substantial losses. While he keeps a small portion of his funds in dollars, the majority of his capital is held in non-fiat assets, as he has no faith whatsoever in fiat currencies. Thomas notes that the U.S. dollar is losing ground as major nations (among them BRICS members as well as Saudi Arabia and the UAE) are distancing themselves from the United States. Many countries are beginning to use alternative currencies, recognizing the risks involved in relying on the dollar. For example, Saudi Arabia did not renew its agreement with the U.S. to exclusively sell oil in dollars, indicating a move toward de-dollarization. Moreover, BRICS countries are actively discussing the creation of a unified financial system that could reduce their dependence on the dollar. Thomas is convinced that Bitcoin and blockchain technology will play a huge role in the future of global finance. He adds that Ethereum is bound to become a key part of this transformation as well. Life in Dubai When asked about the advantages of living in Dubai, Thomas explains that he wants to live in a country where his money is truly at his disposal, rather than under the tight control of the banking system. He points to Europe as an example: if you transfer or withdraw more than 10,000 euros, banks ask you to explain how you plan to use the funds. In his view, this indicates a lack of liquidity in the system, stemming from the fact that banks simply don’t have the money and want to avoid a sudden outflow of deposits. He also highlights how Dubai’s economic system differs in that it’s more difficult to get mortgages and refinancing there than in the United States, which he believes makes the system more resilient. Thomas points out that, as of 2021, U.S. banks are allowed to hold 0% reserves, a practice he criticizes for weakening the banking sector. He takes issue with fractional-reserve banking, where a bank takes a customer’s million dollars, “multiplies” it by ten, and issues loans, effectively turning one million into ten million without any real backing. Thomas compares this system to a “biblical-level deception”, arguing that the money in such banks essentially “doesn’t exist”, it’s an artificial financial construct based on partial reserves and lacking true value. Initially, he encountered strict limitations from certain Dubai banks because of his cryptocurrency transactions, but he eventually found banks that handle this more flexibly. Now he can buy a Porsche GT3 RS or expensive watches with crypto, and when he sells large assets, he simply provides proof of sale and deposits the funds into the bank, without further scrutiny. In Europe, he notes, transactions of this nature could trigger serious consequences, up to and including arrest. Thomas believes this system puts financial freedom itself in jeopardy: in Europe and the U.S., both banks and governments monitor every step, from small transfers to very large ones, constraining even the wealthiest people. Thomas says he greatly enjoys living in Dubai because he sees plenty of opportunities for personal and professional growth there, and he feels the city provides a high level of security for his family. He contrasts this with Europe and the U.S., where, according to him, streets can feel far less safe. For instance, Thomas admits he wouldn’t feel comfortable letting his wife walk alone at night in London, whereas in Dubai he’s confident his loved ones are safe and secure. On the EVEDEX Project In his interviews, Thomas often brings up his project named “ EVEDEX ” (previously called Event Horizon), which he views as a crucial part of his growth and professional evolution. To him, this project isn’t just about business; it’s a means of putting his ideas into action and pushing himself to the next level, broadening his influence and sharing his knowledge. He describes EVEDEX as the product of a dedicated team that took the time to carefully analyze current user needs in this space. EVEDEX is a hybrid decentralized platform that combines the benefits of both centralized and decentralized exchanges, offering high levels of security, privacy, and transparency. It provides users with access to professional trading tools and strategies (such as futures contracts, copy trading, and P2P transactions) without requiring any KYC procedures. Thomas emphasizes that EVEDEX aims to offer equal opportunities to all market participants, regardless of their financial resources or geographic location. Thomas also mentions that the EVEDEX team actively engages with its community by hosting educational events, community calls, and AMA sessions with project representatives, partners, and industry experts. For example, through the Early Bird program, users can complete tasks and earn collectible Badges that grant access to the testnet. Additionally, EVEDEX features an educational center where people can learn about trading, cryptocurrencies, affiliate marketing, and more. According to Thomas, EVEDEX energizes him because he sees how important the team’s work is. He has invested millions of dollars in the project, noting that many of his partners have also committed funds. For him, it’s more than just a business, it's an opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the crypto market by offering users valuable tools and educational resources. Thomas acknowledges that building a platform like EVEDEX poses a major challenge, especially when going up against large, established players in the market. It’s a demanding path that requires constant improvement and the pursuit of unique solutions. Yet, he says this challenge inspires him and his team to innovate and keep evolving so that they can deliver a product capable of competing at a high level. From a Difficult Start Thomas Kralow’s story is one of persistence, determination, and continuous self-improvement. He was raised in a tough family situation and moved to the United States, where he had to earn money to cover his tuition. That necessity taught him to adapt quickly and spot opportunities that others might overlook. These life lessons led him first to buy and resell cars and electronics, and eventually into the trading world, where he encountered significant hurdles but developed a disciplined, calculated approach. Now an experienced trader and entrepreneur, Thomas is focused on building EVEDEX, a platform tailored to user needs and founded on principles of decentralization and security. His belief in the value of cryptocurrency and blockchain, along with his conviction about the importance of financial freedom, resonates in both his work and his broader outlook on life. Thomas stresses the vital role of trust and community, building his social media presence and staying connected with his audience, an approach that helps him to attract like-minded individuals and investors. For him, EVEDEX isn’t just a business endeavor; it’s a challenge and an opportunity to make a lasting impact by delivering high-quality tools and education that people need to succeed in a rapidly evolving financial landscape.

45461858,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69529,1748965017,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Ripple’s RLUSD Wins Crucial Approval,https://timestabloid.com/ripples-rlusd-wins-crucial-approval/,"Ripple’s enterprise-focused stablecoin, RLUSD, has taken another major step forward with regulatory clearance from Dubai’s top financial authority. This approval not only strengthens Ripple’s presence in the Middle East but also enhances the credibility of RLUSD as a globally recognized digital asset. Regulatory Green Light from the DFSA Ripple has received official approval for RLUSD from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA). This certification authorizes the stablecoin’s use within the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC), a key financial district that was established in 2004. Home to over 7,000 businesses, the DIFC is a prime location for global financial operations and innovation. The DFSA’s endorsement now means that RLUSD is legally permitted for use within this zone, marking a crucial step for Ripple in expanding its compliance-focused infrastructure across new jurisdictions. Enterprise-Grade Stablecoin with a Compliance-First Approach RLUSD, introduced by Ripple in December 2024, has been designed to meet the needs of institutional clients and regulated markets. From its inception, the stablecoin has been marketed as an enterprise-grade solution, underpinned by strong regulatory safeguards and a commitment to transparency. In a show of this commitment, RLUSD also secured approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) at the time of its launch, one of the most stringent financial regulators in the United States. This dual approval from both the NYDFS and the DFSA highlights Ripple’s efforts to ensure RLUSD is aligned with global compliance standards. Building on Ripple’s Licensing Milestone in Dubai Ripple’s achievement with RLUSD comes on the heels of a broader regulatory breakthrough in the UAE. Recently, the company became the first blockchain-focused firm to be licensed by the DFSA, establishing a regulated foundation for its activities in the region. Now, with RLUSD officially approved, Ripple is integrating the stablecoin directly into its licensed platform within the DIFC, allowing local and international businesses in the zone to access and utilize the digital asset legally and securely. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Opening New Avenues for Institutional Adoption The availability of RLUSD within the DIFC unlocks new opportunities for enterprises operating in the zone. These companies can now leverage a regulated, blockchain-based stablecoin for payments, settlements, and other financial operations. This development positions RLUSD as a competitive alternative in the stablecoin space, especially for institutions prioritizing regulatory clarity, enterprise-grade security, and cross-border utility. A Strategic Leap in Ripple’s Global Stablecoin Strategy Ripple’s latest success with RLUSD further cements its long-term strategy of bridging the gap between traditional finance and blockchain. With regulatory support from both New York and Dubai, RLUSD is carving out a unique niche as a globally trusted and compliant stablecoin solution. As more jurisdictions tighten scrutiny over digital assets, Ripple’s regulatory-first approach could set the standard for the future of institutional stablecoins. RLUSD’s approval in Dubai not only enhances its legitimacy but also reinforces Ripple’s growing role in shaping the next era of digital finance.

As market momentum builds, several undervalued cryptocurrencies are flashing bullish signals. Cardano (ADA) is eyeing the $1.50 mark, while Sui (SUI) is setting its sights on $5 — milestones that would represent major wins for holders. But they’re not alone. In this article, we spotlight five altcoins that are not only holding steady amid recent market turbulence but are also primed for explosive growth in Q3. From infrastructure giants to rising DeFi contenders, these coins could be the breakout stars of the upcoming rally. Cardano (ADA): Strength at Support and Poised for a Breakout Source: tradingview Cardano (ADA) continues to show resilience, trading in a stable range between $0.63 and $0.76, even as broader market volatility persists. While bulls are still working to decisively clear the $0.83 resistance, the price remains comfortably above the $0.58 support level — a key zone that has historically triggered rebounds. ADA has seen a modest pullback of nearly 9% in the past week, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) hovering in the neutral zone suggests there's still plenty of room for a bullish reversal. Should momentum build and ADA break past the $0.95 resistance, a 25% surge could materialize quickly. With a solid technical foundation and a loyal developer ecosystem, Cardano remains one of the top altcoins to watch for a breakout this quarter. Sui (SUI): Consolidating for a Move Toward $5 Source: tradingview Sui (SUI) is maintaining a strong technical structure, currently consolidating between $3.02 and $3.71. While it briefly slipped below its 10-day moving average of $3.32, the overall chart remains bullish, supported by a neutral RSI near 50 and a stochastic indicator that hints at a potential upward swing. The next resistance level at $4.08 marks a key breakout point — a move beyond that could trigger a rally to $4.78, representing over 20% upside from current prices. Traders are watching closely, and if momentum accelerates, the road to $5 becomes realistically achievable. With growing interest in scalable and efficient blockchain solutions, SUI could be one of Q3’s top performers. Uniswap (UNI): DeFi Leader Positioned for a Rally Source: tradingview Uniswap (UNI) has shown notable resilience, currently ranging between $5.50 and $7 after a healthy 25% rebound over the past month. While it has faced some pressure over the last six months, technical indicators now point to a recovery phase. Its moving averages are aligning positively, and the RSI remains below the overbought threshold, leaving room for additional upside. A break past the $8.50 resistance could open the door to $10, a move that would mark an increase of roughly 33% from current levels. As DeFi regains momentum and Uniswap continues to dominate the decentralized exchange landscape, UNI is well-positioned for a bullish breakout in Q3. Raydium (RAY): High Upside Potential from Current Levels Source: tradingview Raydium is presenting one of the most compelling risk-reward setups in the altcoin space. Despite a sharp weekly drop of nearly 23%, the token is stabilizing within the $2.14 to $3.16 range. The RSI remains steady at 56.03 — a level that often precedes upward momentum — while technical traders eye a breakout above the $3.78 resistance. A move past this level could ignite a rally toward $4.80, offering a potential gain of 53% from the lower end of its current range. With its deep integration into the Solana ecosystem and role in DeFi liquidity, Raydium is one to watch for explosive growth if market sentiment improves. Cosmos (ATOM): Building for a Comeback with Multi-Layer Resistance Source: tradingview Cosmos (ATOM) is navigating a key accumulation phase, currently trading in a tight range slightly above $4. While it’s faced a 50% decline over the last six months, recent price action shows stabilization, with a monthly gain of about 5%. The RSI and MACD both suggest emerging bullish divergence, indicating a shift in momentum could be near. Breaking through the first resistance just over $5 could result in a near 10% move, while a further rally beyond the $6 mark would deliver nearly 30% upside. With solid support levels at $3.90 and $2.50, and a growing ecosystem of interconnected blockchains, Cosmos is well-equipped to turn sentiment around and make major gains in Q3. Conclusion As the crypto market prepares for what could be a powerful Q3 rebound, these five altcoins stand out as high-potential movers. Cardano’s $1.50 target and Sui’s $5 ambition point to strong upside driven by growing utility and investor interest. Uniswap shows signs of regaining momentum, Raydium offers high-reward potential despite current pressure, and Cosmos may be nearing a breakout if key resistance levels fall. Combined, these projects represent a diverse mix of DeFi, smart contracts, and cross-chain innovation — making them strategic picks as altseason approaches. With volatility still offering prime entry points, keeping these assets on your radar could lead to substantial returns in the coming weeks.

This surge in transaction volume is reigniting speculation about TRON’s ability to break into the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap. As investors increasingly seek out high-utility, high-volume chains beyond Ethereum and Bitcoin, TRON is emerging as a top contender. In this article, we explore TRON's technical setup and its path to potentially joining the crypto elite, while also highlighting how its growing ecosystem might power its next big leap. TRON Price Stable with Potential for Growth Beyond Current Range Source: tradingview TRON (TRX) stands between $0.26 and $0.28, showing a stable path. The bulls are holding ground as the price sticks close to the 10-day and 100-day average of $0.27. The Relative Strength Index at nearly 58 points to moderate buying interest. Price could bounce past its nearest resistance at $0.29 and potentially reach $0.30. This would be an increase of almost 7% from the lower end of its current range. The Stochastic indicator at about 79 suggests a possible upward movement, but the 1-week decrease hints at recent struggles. Overall, TRON shows promise if it can break through resistance. Conclusion TRON's $121 billion monthly transfer volume is more than just a headline — it signals deep and growing user activity, real-world usage, and expanding investor confidence. As the 2024 bull market continues to unfold, TRON is well-positioned to challenge more established players and secure its place among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. With Bitcoin and Ethereum maintaining dominance, and networks like Binance Chain and Cardano advancing steadily, TRON’s sheer scale of on-chain transactions makes it a serious contender. If it can maintain this momentum and break key resistance levels, TRX might not just rise in price — it could rise in rank, entering a new era of recognition and growth.

Analysts See 70% Rocket Potential",https://bitzo.com/2025/06/pepe-floki-bonk-is-the-memecoin-bottom-in-analysts-see-70-rocket-potential,"Memecoins like PEPE , FLOKI , and BONK have captured attention again. Analysts are buzzing with predictions of a potential 70% surge. With investors keen on the next big move, these tokens might be ready for a significant rise. Which of these coins are poised for impressive growth? Dive in to uncover the prospects. Pepe (PEPE) Price Update: Surge, Decline, and Key Levels Analysis Pepe experienced a strong monthly gain of 54.66% alongside a notable six-month decline of 42.08%. The coin’s short-term performance revealed a drop of 8.76% over one week while the monthly surge captured positive momentum. Price fluctuations highlight a volatile behavior with periods of rapid recovery quickly challenged by longer-term downward pressure. The gap between the recent surge and steady decline illustrates market inconsistency over the examined periods. The current price trades between $0.00000726 and $0.00001639 with key levels clearly defined. A primary resistance exists at $0.00002113 while a secondary hurdle is set at $0.00003026, with solid support marked at $0.00000285. Technical indicators show minor bearish signals, reflecting slight negativity. An RSI reading of 51.79 suggests market balance with neither bulls or bears in control. Traders might consider initiating buys near support and selling as prices near resistance, aiming to capitalize on small swings. The absence of a definitive trend calls for cautious strategies while monitoring breakout potential. FLOKI Price Movement: Recent Gains Amid Extended Bearish Trends Last month saw a price surge of 12.35%, but it was against a backdrop of a 9.26% weekly decline. Over the past six months, the coin experienced a steep drop of 62.37%. Despite the ongoing long-term pressure, there has been some short-term recovery, showcasing mixed behavior. Recent weeks displayed a brief rally within the overall bearish momentum. This performance highlights the volatility in a market that continues to struggle under significant downward forces. Currently, FLOKI is trading within a range of $0.000063 to $0.000115. Immediate resistance stands near $0.000145, with a secondary barrier at $0.000196, while the nearest support is around $0.000041. The market remains unsettled, showing mild bearish dominance as the RSI hovers at 46.59. The lack of a clear trend suggests caution for traders. Ideas include targeting support levels for potential entry while watching for a breakout above resistance zones to confirm a bullish push. Active monitoring of momentum levels is advised, with selective trading positions around these key zones to manage risk. Bonk Token Market Overview Amid Shifting Trends Price raised 5.82 percent in one month while falling 58.32% across six months. Price performance fluctuated with short-term recovery attempts amid a long-term downturn. A modest monthly gain highlights temporary bullish pushes that have not reversed the broad, steep decline witnessed over the half-year. The coin’s journey has featured sporadic rallies that briefly alleviated pressure before the dominant selling force reasserted itself, emphasizing a period marked by high volatility and market uncertainty. BONK currently trades between $0.00001271 and $0.00002312, maintaining a narrow trading range. Immediate resistance is at $0.00002967, with support at $0.00000885. Recent technical readings reveal the Relative Strength Index at 44.74, with negative signals from the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator. A one-week price drop of 12.58% suggests bears hold some control, though the monthly gain of 5.82 percent indicates intermittent bullish efforts. Traders might consider watching for a break above $0.00002967 for renewed bullish strength, while prices below $0.00000885 could trigger further selling. Conclusion The potential for a significant increase in value for PEPE , FLOKI , and BONK is on the radar of many analysts. They see a possible 70% rise in these memecoins. This could suggest that the market has already reached its lowest point. Investors are keeping a close watch for any signs of upward movement.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-etfs-shifted-in-ethereums-favorite-way-11-day-entry-series-recorded-here-are-the-details/,"On June 2, 2025, Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced a net outflow of $268 million. This development was recorded as the third consecutive day of outflows from Bitcoin ETFs. Bitcoin Spot ETFs Continue Three-Day Streak of Highs, Ethereum ETFs Continue 11-Day Streak of Highs On the other hand, the picture is moving in the opposite direction for Ethereum spot ETFs. Ethereum ETFs, which recorded a net inflow of $78.17 million on the same day, recorded an inflow for the 11th day in a row. This shows that investors' interest in Ethereum continues and that it has caught a different momentum than Bitcoin. In the crypto market, ETFs play an important role in the buying and selling preferences of institutional investors, especially after receiving approval in the US. While outflows on the Bitcoin side are interpreted as a sign of profit taking or market uncertainty, uninterrupted inflows on the Ethereum side are associated with confidence in the network’s upgrades and potential use cases. This divergence between the two major cryptocurrencies in terms of investor interest could lead to further strategic repositioning in the coming days. *This is not investment advice.

The Democratic Party candidate appeared in front of cameras outside his home in Gyeyang-gu, Incheon, with his wife, Kim Hye-kyung, where he said, “It is still too early to say anything because the vote count is still in progress, but if the results are confirmed as they are, I pay tribute to the great decision of our people.” Hours before, Lee had said, “I will do my best to fulfill the great responsibility and mission given to me so as not to disappoint the people’s expectations.” What made Lee’s win different from past elections was what he campaigned on. The 60-year-old politician promised to introduce a stablecoin backed by the Korean won, aiming to stop what he called a steady “leak” of national wealth to foreign stablecoins and tokens. “We need to establish a won-backed stablecoin market to prevent national wealth from leaking overseas,” Lee said during a policy discussion just days before the final vote. Lee wants pension funds in crypto and spot ETFs legal Lee also backed the legalization of spot crypto ETFs, saying he believes major institutional players should be allowed to get in. He specifically mentioned the National Pension Fund as one body he would support entering the market. “I will create a safe investment environment so that young people can build assets and plan for the future,” he said, pushing a policy angle that focuses on long-term wealth building through crypto investments under regulated conditions. His opponent, Kim Moon-soo of the People Power Party, was also vocal about his stance on crypto. Kim supported the same move on spot ETFs and also wanted pension bodies like the National Pension Service to be given the green light to invest in tokens. Where Kim differed was in regulation. He took aim at Korea’s current “one-exchange-one-bank” rule, which forces every crypto exchange to work with only one local bank for real-name account verification. Kim’s team argued the rule blocks new exchanges and stops smaller platforms from growing due to limited banking access. That rule was part of a larger set of restrictions that began in January 2018, when the South Korean government first began tightening its grip on crypto trading. Back then, all traders were required to open real-name bank accounts that matched their exchange information. Banks had to verify every trader’s identity, and foreigners and minors were completely banned from trading crypto. The main purpose was to stop money laundering and criminal activity tied to anonymous wallets. A month later, in February 2018, the then-chief of the Financial Supervisory Service, Choe Heung-sik, announced the government was ready to support “normal” crypto trading and called on banks to work with exchanges instead of avoiding them. His comments opened the door for more structured collaboration between platforms and financial institutions. New rules legalized crypto and added compliance layers The next big move came on March 5, 2020, when Korea’s National Assembly passed a new amendment to the Act on the Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Transaction Information. Often called the March 2020 Amendment, it gave crypto legal status and created the full framework for how exchanges and other companies had to operate in Korea. The law officially went into effect in March 2021. Under that law, all virtual asset service providers were required to follow four major rules. First, they had to register bank accounts that were authorized and linked to real-name users, just like the 2018 system. Second, they had to get Information Security Management System (ISMS) certification from the Korea Internet Security Agency (KISA) to show their platforms were secure. Third, every company had to submit detailed business and account information to the Korea Financial Intelligence Unit (KoFIU). And fourth, they had to roll out strict Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies that covered both users and internal staff. That meant full transparency, traceable records, and zero tolerance for shady trading behavior. Even now, the government hasn’t stopped trying to pin down crypto. The Ministry of Economy and Finance is still reviewing updates to the tax code. The aim is to bring crypto gains into the tax net while making sure the system is fair. There’s no final timeline, but tax on crypto remains a top issue as trading volumes in Korea continue to rise.

The flagship cryptocurrency has started the new month shrouded in uncertainty, with market watchers unsure where the market will head. BTC had plunged to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday before rebounding to reclaim $105,000 and move to its current level of $105,980. Strategy To Raise $250M To Buy More Bitcoin Michael Saylor’s Strategy plans to raise $250 million through an initial public offering of a new class of perpetual preferred stock to fund additional Bitcoin purchases. The company will issue 2.5 million shares of its 10% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock at $100 per share. Proceeds from the raise will be used to fund future Bitcoin purchases and provide working capital. Perpetual preferred stocks pay fixed dividends indefinitely with no maturity date and typically get priority over common stock in payouts. Strategy released a statement announcing its decision, “Strategy (Nasdaq: MSTR; STRK; STRF) today announced that subject to market and other conditions, it intends to conduct an initial public offering registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), of 2,500,000 shares of Strategy’s 10.00% Series A Perpetual Stride Preferred Stock (STRD). Strategy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of bitcoin and for working capital.” The offering gives Strategy a new avenue to raise funds for Bitcoin purchases. The company primarily funded Bitcoin acquisitions through common stock and convertible note offerings. Strategy has become the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin holder with 580,955 BTC worth over $67.7 billion. The $250 million from its latest offering will allow the firm to purchase 2,351.8 BTC at current prices. 21Shares Announces Share Split For Spot Bitcoin ETF 21Shares has announced a 3-for-1 share split for its flagship ARK 21Shares spot Bitcoin ETF, ARKB. The move aims to make the fund more accessible to retail investors and will take effect at market opening on June 16. The split will triple the number of shares available and reduce the price per share without impacting the fund’s value. ARKB will continue to trade under its current sticker. “21Shares US LLC (21Shares), an affiliate of 21Shares AG, one of the world’s largest issuers of crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs), today announced a 3-for-1 share split for its flagship fund ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB). This move is designed to make shares more accessible to a broader base of investors and enhance trading efficiency. The share split is expected to be effective at market open on June 16, 2025.” The fund is a physically backed spot Bitcoin ETF tracking the New York Variant of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CF Bitcoin Reference Data, providing investors with direct access to Bitcoin in a regulated investment environment. Matador Technologies Listed On The Frankfurt Stock Exchange Bitcoin-focused Matador Technologies has announced it will begin trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The listing adds a key European listing to its existing US and Canadian markets. The listing aligns with Matador’s goal of offering round-the-clock trading access to its shares, modeled on Bitcoin’s 24/7 trading schedule. Matador Technologies CEO Deven Soni stated, “This listing completes a key part of our global capital markets strategy. It enables European investors to participate more easily in our growth story.” Matador has branded itself as a Bitcoin ecosystem company focusing on building a Bitcoin-backed treasury and fintech platform. Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally up during the ongoing session as it struggles to cross the 20-day SMA. The flagship cryptocurrency faces rejection around the $105,000 level, with subdued price action indicating risk-off sentiment. Markets are jittery thanks to renewed trade tensions between the US and China, geopolitical tensions, and continuous outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Risk-on sentiment took a beating as tensions escalated in the Middle East after Israeli soldiers opened fire on people who strayed from a designated route to a food distribution site. Apart from escalating tensions in the Middle East, the Russia-Ukraine war has also seen an increase in hostilities. Institutional demand has also weakened, with data from SoSoValue highlighting outflows of $267 million from spot Bitcoin ETFs on Monday. While the outflows are relatively lower compared to February, an increase could lead to a substantial decline in BTC’s price. Despite trading in positive territory, markets remain cautious, expecting more geopolitical volatility. According to the Kobeissi Letter, markets are pricing out the Ukraine-Russia peace deal, stating, “This is effectively the market pricing out the Russia-Ukraine peace deal that President Trump has been working on for 3+ months. However, we have yet to receive a single comment from the US or President Trump. Clearly, something is going on behind the scenes. How will the US respond?” BTC registered a sharp drop on Friday (May 23), falling nearly 4% to $107,356. Despite overwhelming selling pressure, BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to reclaim $109,000 and settle at $109,103. The price continued to push higher on Monday, registering a marginal increase, but was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% to $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell 1.03% to $107,834. Source: TradingView Selling pressure intensified on Thursday as BTC fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. Price action remained bearish on Friday as BTC fell 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. BTC recovered over the weekend, rising 0.69% on Saturday and nearly 1% on Sunday to reclaim $105,000 and settle at $105,775. BTC fell to an intraday low of $103,734 on Monday as selling pressure returned. However, it rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $105,903. The current session sees BTC up almost 1%, trading around $106,743, as buyers look to build momentum and push towards $110,000. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Over the past few days, on-chain data has shown BlackRock gradually liquidating portions of its Bitcoin holdings via the Coinbase Prime institutional platform. The trend of BlackRock’s BTC sales picked up on June 2 at 10:56 UTC, when it moved 300 BTC worth $31.3 million to Coinbase. For context, prior to this transaction, the last outflow to Coinbase was three weeks ago.BlackRock went on to offload a total of 5,362 BTC through a series of transactions: multiple 300 BTC batches, one transaction of 212 BTC, and another of 49 BTC. Altogether, the prominent asset manager dumped Bitcoin worth $561 million.Interestingly, while offloading BTC on Coinbase, BlackRock was simultaneously acquiring Ethereum. During this period, the firm withdrew 27,241 ETH from Coinbase, valued at $69.25 million. Snapshot of BlackRock Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions Why Is BlackRock Selling Bitcoin?Notably, the amount of Bitcoin BlackRock sold aligns almost perfectly with the outflow figures recorded by its iShares Bitcoin Trust over the past two days. On Monday, BlackRock’s Bitcoin spot ETF posted a $130.4 million outflow. On Friday, May 30, it recorded a $430.8 million outflow, bringing the two-day total to $561 million.During this same period, the overall U.S. Bitcoin spot ETF market experienced consecutive daily outflows starting last Thursday, totaling a $1.23 billion net drain.These negative trends followed ten consecutive days of positive flows into U.S. Bitcoin ETFs. The shift coincided with Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of approximately $112,000 in May before undergoing a retracement.Amid this retrace, investors grew cautious and began offloading their positions, as evidenced by outflows from BlackRock and other ETF managers. Notably, BTC’s price dipped to around $103,000 before rebounding slightly to $106,600 at press time, up 2.5% over the past 24 hours.Despite BlackRock liquidating over half a billion dollars' worth of Bitcoin in two days, its total Bitcoin spot ETF flows since inception remain strong at $48.439 billion. Meanwhile, its entire BTC holdings stand at 661,142 tokens, worth approximately $70 billion.Ethereum ETFs Remain PositiveWhile the Bitcoin spot ETF market has recently seen heavy outflows, Ethereum ETFs have shown a different trend. Ethereum spot ETFs have now maintained 11 consecutive days of positive inflows, led entirely by BlackRock.Yesterday, total Ethereum ETF inflows stood at $78.2 million, with BlackRock contributing $48.4 million and Fidelity adding $29.8 million. All other Ethereum issuers reported zero flows. Historically, inflows into Ethereum spot ETFs have largely come from BlackRock and Fidelity, with occasional contributions from Bitwise and Grayscale.",Market|Trending Now|Latest Bitcoin (BTC) News Today|Latest Ethereum (ETH) News Today,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET,"{'name': 'The Crypto Basic', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/thecryptobasic.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",thecryptobasic,2025-06-03 15:54:07

Amid this backdrop, two projects, Wall Street Ponke (WPonke) and Solaxy, are catching investor attention. Their unique offerings and successful presale performances have made them standout contenders in an increasingly crowded space. As traders regain confidence, both projects are seizing the momentum to offer something fundamentally new: AI-powered trading intelligence from WPonke and a Layer-2 scalability solution from Solaxy. Solaxy’s Layer-2 Vision for Solana’s Future Solaxy was created as a Layer-2 blockchain to solve the ongoing scalability issues of Solana. Due to the rapid expansion of Solana’s ecosystem, there have been delays and congestion that have affected performance. Solaxy intends to solve this problem by introducing improved Layer-2 structures designed to speed things up and support non-fungible tokens. The project has already raised over $40 million in presale funding, signalling strong early investor interest. Its goal is not only to support faster transactions but also to expand NFT capabilities across platforms. WPonke: AI Meets Meme Coin for Safer Trading On the other hand, Wall Street Ponke (WPonke) is updating the idea of what a meme coin can achieve. Starting as a community breakaway from Ponke, WPonke hopes to reassure the crypto community by using artificial intelligence to fight fraud. The WPonke platform includes an advanced system that uses AI to monitor the market. It examines new tokens being listed, checks the integrity of their smart contracts, their liquidity and safety in real-time. WPonke’s presale has currently raised $335,179.67 out of a target goal of $703,424. The presale price is set at $0.000264 per token, with early purchasers able to earn extra rewards by staking their tokens. Welcome to Wall Street Ponke . WITH THE $WPONKE TRADING PLATFORM YOU’RE NOT JUST TRADING, YOU’RE TRADING SMARTER SAFER AND WITH PEACE OF MIND #WPONKE $WPONKE 🔗: https://t.co/lQk6PYik7O pic.twitter.com/30dUCoIcsU — Wall Street Ponke (@Wallstreetponke) May 14, 2025 Tokenomics: WPonke’s Balanced Distribution Model Tokenomics in WPonke promote both the growth of the ecosystem and keep the value high over time. Marketing gets an additional 25% of the total supply, 15% is reserved for liquidity, and the rest is shared between development and staking rewards, at 10% each. This breakdown shows a deliberate focus on both growth and sustainability. How to Buy WPonke in the Presale Buying a WPonke product is easy and suitable for anyone new to the process. You must first have a digital wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet. After making your wallet safe, transfer ETH, BNB or USDT from a crypto exchange like Binance or Coinbase. After you fund your wallet, connect it to the WPonke presale dashboard. Select your preferred method to pay, type in the amount, and check the final details before you proceed. Upon conclusion of the presale, you can store your WPonke tokens in your preferred wallet. Participating in the presale by staking your tokens can give you more rewards and increase the value of your early participation. Roadmap: What Lies Ahead for WPonke The roadmap for WPonke includes four sturdy phases. In Phase 1 (Q1–Q2 2025), the platform will complete smart contract development and introduce its AI-enabled detector. Phase 2, in Q3 2025, will see the release of the beta trading platform and some early learning tools. In Phase 3 (Q4 2025), WPonke aims to start trading activities and introduce e-learning to its platform, in addition to privacy features. The fourth phase, in 2026, is designed to support multiple chains, boost AI capabilities and handle governance through a DAO system.

While DOGE continues to hold ground, its upside may be limited compared to newer assets with more aggressive roadmaps. Leading the charge are Shiba Inu (SHIB), now growing beyond its meme status with Shibarium and DeFi utility, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a new crypto coin currently in presale that’s catching eyes for its innovative lending protocol and projected high ROI. These tokens are gaining traction in lists of the best cryptos to buy now and may be better positioned than DOGE to capture explosive gains in the next major rally. For investors wondering what’s the best cryptocurrency to invest in ahead of the market’s next move, these three deserve a serious look. DOGE and SHIB: Evaluating Their Bull Run Potential in 2025 Dogecoin (DOGE) costs $0.1893, showing a decline of about 7.4% over today’s period. Despite the decrease in price, members of the crypto community still show interest in DOGE and more investors are attracted to it. Also, SHIB which belongs to Shiba Inu (SHIB), is currently priced at $0.00001256 and has dropped by 6% in the last day. Analysts forecast that because of its active user base and meme coin power, SHIB could reach $0.000016 by 2036. Because it is simple to start and potentially very profitable, many people pick DOGE or SHIB when joining the crypto world. There is also growing interest in Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a recently launched altcoin, because of its potential to perform well in the crypto market. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged. The stablecoin is built to avoid depeg risks. Thanks to the safe, open and Certik-audited nature of this project, blockchain investors enjoy stability. Through the merger of modern finance tech and powerful infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is turning the future of decentralized finance upside down. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Still in presale, Mutuum Finance has already surpassed more than $9.8 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,600 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. Early Investors Rewarded, Community Continues to Grow As the platform gains traction, Mutuum Finance continues to reward its early backers. Ten lucky investors will be selected to share a $100,000 prize, each receiving $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens as a thank-you for supporting the project early on. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) which has raised $9.8 million in its presale and now has nearly 11,600 investors, is not just acting like another presale project, it’s doing great in the race to secure big returns in 2025. While both DOGE and SHIB continue to have followers and ambitious long-term goals, MUTM gives early investors an unusual opportunity to earn much more, with 2x ROI set before launch. Because of its DeFi lending system, fully backed stablecoin and Certik verification, MUTM stands to bring significant change to decentralized finance. Now is when you should act, take part in the Mutuum Finance presale before all the spots are gone.

A source familiar with the trade talks said Trump is “obsessed” with having a direct phone call with Xi. Trump believes he can resolve the deep trade disputes between the world’s two largest economies one-on-one with Xi. But that approach ignores the challenges the U.S. faces in trying to force China to fundamentally restructure their roughly $600 billion trade relationship. It also raises the question of what Trump’s ultimate goal is in this trade war. Related News: Whales Are Highly Active Today: Here Are Their Transactions and the Altcoins They Are Focusing On The source said that China’s blocking of critical mineral exports to the US has increased the pressure on Washington. It is stated that China has taken a tough stance on the export of rare earth elements and magnetics, which are used in many areas from automotive and electronics production to the defense industry. The source said, “It is clear that Xi is not very keen on exporting these substances to the US. However, it is still highly likely that he will pick up the phone to listen to Trump.” A former Trump official close to the White House said Trump believed a direct meeting between the leaders would cut through the noise of the process and get to the heart of the matter. *This is not investment advice.
