This comes after a similar investigation was launched against Elon Musk’s X last month, making these the first DSA enforcement actions by the Irish regulator. Ireland investigates TikTok and LinkedIn According to a Bloomberg report, Ireland’s media regulator investigations into TikTok and LinkedIn are happening over potential flaws in their content reporting mechanisms. The probes will focus on ascertaining whether the platforms’ systems for users to report suspected illegal content are adequately accessible, user-friendly, and anonymous, as required by the DSA. Providers need to “have reporting mechanisms, that are easy to access and user-friendly, to report content considered to be illegal,” said John Evans, Digital Services Commissioner at the regulator. The European Commission is the main European Union enforcer against very large online platforms. However, some aspects of the law — including the reporting mechanism — fall under the jurisdiction of the national regulator of the EU country where a platform is headquartered. Companies found to be in violation of Europe’s digital rules, as determined by Ireland’s media regulator, can be fined as much as 6% of the company’s annual global sales. This is not the first time the Irish regulators have targeted a social media platform. TikTok was also caught in its crossfire and got slammed with a €530 million penalty for violating the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2025, while LinkedIn also got fined about €310 million for various regulatory breaches. Ireland’s media regulator is also after X The current investigations into TikTok and LinkedIn are coming weeks after the same regulator opened an investigation into Elon Musk’s social media platform X, with claims that the company is failing to remove content users report as illegal. According to Virkkunen, the Executive Vice-President of the European Commission for Technological Sovereignty, Security, and Democracy, while the DSA requires platforms to enforce content moderation, it also requires them to have effective internal complaint-handling systems, where users have the right to appeal content moderation decisions. “While automated moderation is allowed, online platforms must be transparent about its use and accuracy,” Virkkunen added . Investigations by Coimisiún na Meán seek to determine if X’s internal complaint handling system is up to par with the DSA’s regulatory standard or is in violation of it. The investigation is backed by various sources, and a nonprofit HateAid, which had previously made legal moves against X on behalf of a researcher who was repeatedly banned from the platform. The investigation was the first under DSA by the Coimisiún na Meán, and violations could result in almost 6% of the company’s turnover. It is also not the first time X has attracted scrutiny from official bodies in Europe. Earlier this year, the platform was investigated by the EU over whether it breached the bloc’s content laws. Experts believe the scrutiny could inspire broader changes in X’s operational and content moderation policies. Meanwhile, the recent investigations are a clear indicator of how far the EU is willing to go when it comes to holding social media platforms accountable and ensuring that user protection measures are robust and enforceable.

Early Indicators Point to Yes (Bitfinex Alpha),https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-near-a-bottom-early-indicators-point-to-yes-bitfinex-alpha/,"The recent market downtrend has left many bitcoin investors and market enthusiasts in confusion. This is because predictors and a few factors point to a further downtrend, while some claim that the world’s leading crypto sits at a powerful support zone. Obviously, BTC witnessed a significant price recovery last week, jumping by about 15% to surpass $93,000. However, this move was short-lived, as it plunged by $84,000 on Monday amid heavy selling by many holders, setting the new week off to a rough start. Deleveraging and Capitulation Considering factors such as capitulation, deleveraging, and seller exhaustion, the latest Bitfinex Alpha release suggests bitcoin is very close to a bottom, marking its lowest point of this cycle before recovering to hit new highs. One factor hinting at a bottom is extreme deleveraging. Undoubtedly, thousands of speculators and leverage traders have been forcibly thrown out of the market, starting with the October 10 crash that resulted in over $19 billion in liquidations. After this flush of risky traders, the crypto market is expected to become more stable and healthier for investors and long-term holders. This also aligns with a recent prediction from Fundstrats’ Tom Lee, who noted that once the market has completed this flushing, it could hit new highs. In addition to extreme deleveraging, short-term holder capitulation is another factor hinting at a bitcoin bottom. Many retail traders, weekend FOMO buyers, and new and nervous investors have reacted emotionally to the market dip, panic-selling their holdings in shock. Hence, Entity-Adjusted Realised Losses have reached a peak of over $400 million, surpassing losses during previous major market lows. This rate of losses suggests that capitulation is nearing an end, and once selling pressure is no longer there, the bitcoin price stabilizes. Seller Exhaustion A close look at bitcoin’s price chart over the past few days hints at seller exhaustion, as it is filled with many small candlesticks, suggesting that panic and fear have almost burned out, and selling pressure has reduced. Thus, the conclusion that bitcoin is near a bottom. Meanwhile, some institutional investors have not let the downtrend blur their bullish expectations. This is evident in the massive four-day inflow streak on the U.S.-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The post Is Bitcoin Near a Bottom?

Prosecutors are asking that Tokyo Electron be fined several million dollars for its alleged role in the theft of TSMC’s trade secrets. Taiwanese prosecutors have filed criminal charges against the Taiwan unit of Tokyo Electron (TEL), the Japanese chip equipment supplier. The charges allege that the company had a role in the theft of trade secrets from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). Tokyo Electron’s Taiwan unit sees legal trouble The charges against the department were announced on Tuesday, December 2, 2025, and are being pursued under both Taiwan’s Trade Secrets Act and the powerful National Security Act. This case is the first in which a corporation in Taiwan will be indicted under the National Security Act for the alleged theft of “national core critical technology trade secrets.” The prosecutors are seeking a fine of up to NT$120 million (around $3.8 million) against the Tokyo Electron unit if it is convicted. The main accusation is that the company allegedly failed to prevent the crime. Prosecutors pointed out that Tokyo Electron has internal rules, and still the unit “lacked evidence of concrete preventive or managerial measures” to stop the theft. Therefore, they argue the company must face corporate criminal liability. In August 2025, a former TSMC employee, surname Chen, who later worked for the Tokyo Electron Taiwan unit, and two current TSMC engineers were indicted. Chen is accused of using his connections to convince his former colleagues to share confidential information about TSMC’s 2-nanometer (2nm) chip process technology. The motivation for the theft was reportedly to help Tokyo Electron improve its etching equipment and secure valuable contracts for TSMC’s most advanced manufacturing line. Tokyo Electron has stated it is cooperating with the investigation and also previously denied any organizational involvement in the alleged theft, saying the company does not tolerate staff misconduct. TSMC’s legal battles TSMC has taken steps to protect its intellectual property recently, including filing a lawsuit against its former senior vice president, Wei-Jen Lo, who retired in July 2025 and joined the rival company Intel Corp. as an executive vice president. TSMC’s lawsuit, which was filed in November, alleges that there is a “high probability” that Lo will “use, leak, disclose, deliver, or transfer TSMC’s trade secrets and confidential information to Intel,” violating his non-compete agreement and the Trade Secrets Act. Lo had stated he would join an “academic institution” upon departure, but that turned out to be false. Taiwanese prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into Lo’s case, seizing computers and other digital evidence from his homes and suggesting he is suspected of violating the National Security Act. Intel’s CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, dismissed the allegations as speculation and stated that Intel “respects intellectual property rights” and has strict policies to prevent the use of third-party confidential information.

This move adds fuel to a bullish XRP price prediction as institutional adoption across the globe seems to be rising rapidly. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expanded the scope of Ripple’s license to operate in the country as a Major Payment Institution (MPI). This allows the company to “broaden its regulated payment offerings and deliver greater value to customers in Singapore.” Huge news from Singapore: https://t.co/KVxTs7IEKc The @MAS_sg has approved an expanded scope of payment activities for our Major Payment Institution license – enabling us to deliver end-to-end, fully licensed payment services to our customers in the region. — Ripple (@Ripple) December 1, 2025 In a press release published on Monday, Ripple emphasized three benefits of using its payment solution in this country. The most prominent of those is the ability to settle payments almost instantly through the use of RLUSD – the network’s native stablecoin. By securing this expanded license, the demand for RLUSD could skyrocket. Now banks and other financial institutions can tap XRP and RLUSD to settle crypto transfers from apps and similar solutions. XRP Price Prediction: If Support Holds, Big Rally to $3 Level Could be Next XRP has managed to stay above $2 despite yesterday’s strong pullback. Trading volumes jumped to 3% of the token’s circulating supply, reflecting the strength of the buying pressure. Source: TradingView Staying above $2 is critical for XRP’s long-term outlook. The token has dropped below this area multiple times already, but has recovered every time so far. Despite the latest drops, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that negative momentum is decelerating as a bullish divergence has popped up. If the $2 level holds, a bullish breakout of XRP’s descending channel should confirm a bullish XRP price prediction. Although XRP may not rise by 100x this year, this latest news could help the token recover from its latest drop. Hence, it may still make a new all-time high at least before the year ends. Rising institutional adoption of blockchain-based solutions across the globe seems to be benefiting top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as well. This project has raised nearly $28 million in its ongoing presale to launch its ambitious Solana-based Bitcoin L2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Could Kickstart a New Era for Bitcoin Applications Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is getting ready to launch its Solana-based scaling solution for the Bitcoin blockchain and has raised a significant amount from investors in its ongoing presale. BTC holders will now be able to generate passive income on their investment without leaving the top crypto’s native blockchain. The Hyper Bridge will safely store BTC tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain and mint the corresponding amount on the Hyper L2 to access a suite of powerful decentralized apps. From making payments to earning yield, a whole new universe of possibilities will open up for BTC investors with the launch of this solution. As top wallets and exchanges embrace the L2, the demand for $HYPER could skyrocket. To buy $HYPER before the next price increase, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet .

Yesterday, investors had witnessed steep losses as they braced themselves for the possibility that the Federal Reserve would not cut rates next week , with stock markets also suffering falls . However, some analysts still believe that the Fed will deliver a rate cut via its upcoming FOMC meeting, something which could send prices rising again from next week. This will be good for oversold major tokens, but it could also be a major boon for new cryptos, with this article taking a closer look at our best altcoin to buy today, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) . PEPENODE has been holding its presale over the past few weeks, and its launch could coincide with a big resurgence for the market, helping it to surge when it lists. Best Altcoin to Buy Today – 2 December At last count, PEPENODE has raised more than $2.2 million in its ongoing sale, which has been gaining considerable momentum since November. And that’s because PEPENODE isn’t simply another Pepe-themed meme coin, but also an innovative mining platform that aims to make mining accessible for the average retail investor. The PEPENODE presale is live. Buy Nodes. Build Your Server Room. Combine Nodes For Huge Bonuses. Do it all here https://t.co/d1JAronqiv pic.twitter.com/60uLhEoukP — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 10, 2025 In contrast to traditional Bitcoin mining, which now requires some very expensive machines housed in large facilities, PEPENODE makes mining much easier and cheaper. It enables users to build and operate virtual mining rigs, which they can make larger and more productive by spending PEPENODE tokens on new virtual nodes. By adding more nodes, miners will earn more rewards, which the platform will pay out in external tokens, including Fartcoin and Pepe. Users can also sell off their own nodes to other miners, assuming that they want to cease mining or streamline their own operations. This system introduces a huge incentive to acquire more PEPENODE, creating demand that could push the new token’s price up consistently over the long haul. Demand will also come from staking, with PEPENODE currently providing a yield of 578% APY, making it one of the more rewarding altcoins in the market. PEPENODE Is Launching Soon: Here’s How to Buy Early These features help to explain why PEPENODE’s presale has been gaining steam recently, and why it’s our best altcoin to buy today. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, of which it has allocated 35% to its treasury, 7.5% to node rewards, 15% to marketing and infrastructure, 35% to development, and 7.5% to listings and liquidity. New investors can join its sale by going to the PEPENODE website and connecting a wallet, with the token purchasable using ETH, USDT, BNB, and fiat. Its current price is $0.0011731, although this will rise later today, and will rise every three days until the sale enters its final phase. This means interested buyers should act quickly, so as to lock in the biggest possible gains. PEPENODE is one to watch for 2026, with its unique platform giving it strong prospects for standing out in a sea of pretenders.

The analyst, Don, shared this view on X, stating that XRP’s long-term structure remains constructive even though the asset has declined by roughly 1.4% over the past week and 13.68% over the past month. Market Structure Suggests a Pre-Breakout Phase Don’s analysis centers on a formation visible on XRP’s daily chart. According to him, the asset has been consolidating within a downward-sloping channel, a pattern that historically precedes upward expansions for XRP. This structure began to form after the July peak near $3.67, followed by a sequence of lower highs and lower lows. $XRP easy $4 pic.twitter.com/Z5BV8PN7fW — Don (@DonaldsTrades) December 2, 2025 Although the asset has experienced several moments that appeared to signal a breakdown, such as the August low around $2.72 and a brief liquidity-driven drop to $0.77 on Binance in October, XRP has consistently reclaimed its structure and maintained support along the lower boundary of the channel. The latest rejection at approximately $2.27 pushed XRP lower once again, positioning it for another test of the support zone. Don views this consolidation as part of a typical accumulation cycle. His argument rests on the idea that prolonged compression within a defined range has historically preceded strong momentum shifts for XRP, especially when similar patterns have appeared earlier in the cycle. Insight From Previous Market Behavior A comparable technical setup occurred earlier in the year. Between January and early July, XRP traded within another descending channel after reaching a local high near $3.40. That high followed a significant surge in late 2024, after which the market transitioned into a corrective period. During that earlier consolidation, XRP repeatedly tested the channel boundaries but maintained its overall structure. Once the asset approached the resistance line in early July and stabilized near that area, it staged a notable breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A modest gain on July 9 triggered a rapid upward extension, propelling the price from around $2.31 to $3.67 in a short period. Don believes the present market cycle closely mirrors that earlier movement and could produce a similar reaction once XRP challenges the upper line of the current channel. Analysts Outline Potential Targets Beyond $4 Don considers $4 to be a straightforward and conservative milestone once a breakout occurs. From the current price area around $2.15 , this would reflect an approximate doubling in value. Other analysts share comparable expectations. Anticipates that once XRP exits its consolidation phase, it could advance toward the $4.50 region. A more aggressive projection comes from Egrag Crypto, which argues that a successful breakout may not stall near $4 and could extend toward significantly higher valuations, including levels near $27. The prevailing analysis suggests that XRP continues to form a technical base consistent with historical patterns that have preceded sharp upward movements. While no projection is guaranteed, multiple analysts agree that a breakout from the current channel could place the $4 range within reach. Further price expansion would depend on market conditions, momentum, and whether traders interpret the breakout as a signal for larger accumulation.

This decision follows its mainnet launch just last year, leaving many to wonder about the underlying challenges in this innovative sector. What does this shutdown reveal about the practical hurdles of building decentralized infrastructure? What exactly was the Celestia-based shared sequencer Astria? To understand the significance of this shutdown, we must first grasp what Astria was building. A shared sequencer acts as a neutral, decentralized layer that orders transactions before they are finalized on a blockchain. Astria built this service specifically on top of Celestia, a network designed for data availability. The goal was ambitious: to provide a scalable, trust-minimized sequencing layer that multiple “rollup” blockchains could use, rather than each building their own. This Celestia-based shared sequencer model promised greater efficiency and interoperability for the entire modular blockchain ecosystem. Why did the Astria sequencer cease operations? The official announcement, reported by The Block, did not provide a specific reason for the shutdown. However, the timeline offers crucial clues. The project halted product development and stopped operating its Celestia validator node earlier this year. These were clear warning signs. Potential reasons could include: Technical Complexity: Building robust, decentralized sequencing is a formidable engineering challenge. Economic Viability: The business model for a shared sequencer service might not have proven sustainable. Competitive Landscape: The space for Celestia-based shared sequencer solutions is becoming crowded, with other teams exploring similar concepts. Strategic Pivot: The team may have decided resources were better allocated elsewhere in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. The lack of detailed communication from the Astria team, both now and during earlier halts, has unfortunately left more questions than answers for its community and observers. What are the implications for modular blockchain development? Astria’s shutdown is a sobering moment, but it is not a verdict on the entire modular thesis. Innovation inherently involves trial and error. This event highlights several key lessons for builders and investors in the space. First, infrastructure projects require immense long-term commitment and capital. Second, clear communication with the community is paramount, especially during difficult decisions. Finally, the failure of one Celestia-based shared sequencer does not invalidate the core need for shared sequencing solutions. Other projects will undoubtedly learn from Astria’s journey. What’s next for shared sequencing and Celestia? The demand for efficient transaction ordering in a multi-rollup world remains strong. Celestia’s data availability layer continues to see significant adoption, proving the foundational value of its technology. The concept of a Celestia-based shared sequencer is still compelling. Therefore, we can expect other teams to continue exploring this architecture, potentially with different technical or economic approaches. Astria’s story serves as a crucial case study in the gritty reality of bringing groundbreaking crypto infrastructure to life. In conclusion, the shutdown of the Astria Celestia-based shared sequencer is a poignant reminder of the high stakes in crypto development. While it marks the end of one project’s journey, it provides invaluable data points for the entire industry. The pursuit of scalable, modular blockchains will continue, forged by both successes and setbacks like this one. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What was Astria? A: Astria was a project building a shared sequencer network, a service to order transactions for multiple blockchains, built using Celestia’s technology. Q: Why did Astria shut down? A: The team did not disclose a specific reason. The shutdown followed earlier pauses in development and node operations, suggesting significant technical or strategic challenges. Q: Does this mean shared sequencers are a bad idea? A: Not necessarily. Astria’s shutdown highlights the implementation challenges, but the core problem of efficient transaction ordering for rollups remains unsolved, so other teams will continue working on it. Q: How does this affect Celestia? A: Celestia is a separate data availability network. While one project using its technology has ended, Celestia itself continues to operate and is adopted by many other projects. Q: Can users who interacted with Astria recover funds? A: Astria was infrastructure, not typically a custodial service for user funds. Users should always ensure their assets are in self-custodied wallets they control, not reliant on any single project’s continued operation. Q: Where can I learn more about shared sequencing? A: To learn more about the latest modular blockchain and shared sequencing trends, explore our article on key developments shaping the future of Ethereum scalability and rollup technology.

Lynch also inquired about the Fed’s role in advancing crypto regulatory requirements, while also highlighting confusion regarding the definition of stablecoins. Lynch confronts Fed on crypto oversight and stablecoin definitions During an oversight hearing , Lynch cited Bowman’s comments at the November Santander International Banking Conference, where she expressed support for banks “[engaging] fully” with digital assets. Bowman clarified that her comments applied broadly to digital assets, rather than specifically to cryptocurrencies. Lynch pressed her on the distinction between digital assets and stablecoins, and the discussion shifted. Bowman replied that Congress, through the GENIUS Act—a law regulating payment stablecoins—has authorised the Fed to develop a framework for digital asset activities. “The GENIUS Act requires us to promulgate regulations to allow these types of activities,” Bowman said. Though the price of several digital assets can be volatile, stablecoins, like those pegged to the US dollar, are generally “stable,” as the name suggests. While there have been some occasions where some coins have depegged from their respective currencies, like the crash of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin some three years ago, the overwhelming majority of stablecoins do not fluctuate past 1% of their peg. Bowman earlier noted that staff at the Fed should be allowed to hold small “amounts of crypto or other types of digital assets” to grasp better how the technology works. FDIC prepares national stablecoin framework under GENIUS Act Travis Hill, acting chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was also present at Tuesday’s hearing. The government agency is one of many responsible for implementing the GENIUS Act, which US President Donald Trump signed into law in July. According to Hill, the FDIC will propose a stablecoin framework “later this month,” which will include requirements for supervising issuers. In a few weeks, the legislative Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will release its first set of proposed guidelines under the GENIUS Act. This represents a significant step forward for the US in its efforts to establish a legislative framework for stablecoins. According to Hill, the proposal will explain how stablecoin issuers linked to FDIC-insured banks are regulated and monitored nationwide, moving away from the current system of fragmented, state-by-state monitoring. That’s only part of a broader effort by regulators to make clearer how traditional banking authorities monitor digital assets such as stablecoins and tokenized deposits. The FDIC’s plan follows President Donald Trump’s signing of a law in July that, for the first time, establishes national requirements for US stablecoins. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US stablecoins (GENIUS) Act establishes the first government rules for payment stablecoins. It assigns tasks to the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to ensure the law is carried out. These agencies recently informed the House Financial Services Committee about their plans. This means that the law would eliminate the need for different state systems and establish a single national standard for issuer licensing and supervision. According to the framework, federal prudential regulators will be responsible for bank-linked issuers; however, states will still be responsible for non-bank businesses unless new rules expand the federal reach. The acting chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation noted that the FDIC will directly oversee the subsidiaries of FDIC-insured banks that want to issue stablecoins. Before a bank’s subsidiary launches a stablecoin, it must submit a formal application. The FDIC will then scrutinize the bank’s business strategies, risk management practices, and compliance procedures. The first rule this month will establish the application framework for issuers connected to banks. A second proposal, scheduled for release early next year, will establish capital, liquidity, and reserve asset norms for payment stablecoin issuers. These will be the main regulatory protections for this group. Get seen where it counts.

55274338,638308,1764720002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55274338.jpeg,Solana Integration Boosts Kalshi’s Push Into Tokenized Event Contracts and Crypto Liquidity,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-integration-boosts-kalshis-push-tokenized/,"Kalshi has taken a major step in restructuring how prediction markets operate by moving its event contracts onto the Solana blockchain. The transition brings U.S.-regulated prediction markets directly into decentralized finance, positioning the platform to compete more closely with its on-chain rival, Polymarket, while targeting deeper liquidity and broader user access. Prediction Contracts Move On-Chain Kalshi’s event markets now operate as Solana-based SPL tokens rather than entries on a centralized exchange. Through an integration with Solana protocols DFlow and Jupiter, users can trade “yes” and “no” positions via crypto wallets, tap automated liquidity, and settle outcomes through on-chain logic. The shift enables contracts to be traded, borrowed, lent, or used as collateral within DeFi systems. Kalshi is supporting developer participation with a $2 million grants program and a new Builder Codes system that rewards teams for driving trading volume through custom applications. Executives describe tokenization as the platform’s long-term strategy, arguing that on-chain access offers speed, transparency, and programmability while preserving Kalshi’s CFTC-regulated framework. The hybrid model links decentralized liquidity with an off-chain matching engine. Will the Move Capture Liquidity and Challenge Polymarket? Prediction-market activity has surged in 2025, with sector-wide volume nearing $28 billion by late October. November saw Kalshi record $5.8 billion in trading, while Polymarket handled $3.7 billion following rulings that reopened U.S. access. Liqudity has become the core competitive factor. By issuing markets as standard Solana tokens, Kalshi expects automated market makers, trading bots, and cross-protocol liquidity systems to tighten spreads and improve pricing accuracy. Enhanced privacy is another draw, with tokenized markets offering wallet-based trading rather than identity-verified accounts. Industry analysts note that the move puts Kalshi in direct competition with Polymarket’s fully on-chain model. Solana Expands Multi-Chain Prediction Economy Kalshi believes Solana is the first step toward a broader on-chain architecture. The company plans to add EVM-compatible networks and deeper integrations with DeFi protocols to build a multi-chain forecasting ecosystem. Additional partnerships, including earlier collaborations with Zero Hash and stablecoin custody support from Coinbase, reflect an effort to streamline global accessibility. With its valuation recently rising to $11 billion after a major funding round, the company is signaling confidence that tokenized prediction markets will become a standard format for forecasting and derivatives tied to real-world events. As prediction markets evolve toward decentralized models, Kalshi’s Solana rollout marks a turning point in how regulated platforms interact with crypto liquidity and sets the stage for intensified competition across the sector.

The recent drop has pushed investors into defensive mode, with some analysts now openly discussing the possibility of a broader bear market emerging. Selling pressure has intensified across spot and derivatives markets, and volatility continues to rise as traders struggle to identify a reliable support zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Largest Hidden-Buying Spike of the Cycle Despite Losing $90K Level A new CryptoQuant report by Darkfost highlights one of the most alarming developments: Ethereum’s open interest on Binance has been steadily collapsing for more than three months. After reaching an all-time high of $12.6 billion on August 22, open interest has now been cut in half. Nearly $6.4 billion in derivative positions have evaporated, bringing ETH’s open interest down to $6.2 billion, a steep 51% decline. While this appears to be an extraordinary contraction, Darkfost notes that open interest has only just slipped below the previous all-time high of $7.7 billion. This underscores how speculative and overstretched the 2025 derivatives market had become — and suggests that Ethereum may be undergoing a much deeper structural reset than most expected. Speculation Unwinds Across Exchanges as Ethereum Enters Deep Reset Phase Darkfost emphasizes that 2025 has been the most speculative phase in Ethereum’s history, fueled by aggressive leverage, rapid inflows, and a market structure that proved far less solid — and far less sustainable — than it appeared during the rally. The collapse in open interest on Binance is only part of the story. The same pattern is unfolding across major derivatives platforms, revealing a broader structural unwind rather than an exchange-specific phenomenon. On Gate.io, ETH open interest has fallen from $5.2 billion to $3.5 billion. On Bybit, the drop is even more severe, plunging from $6.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This synchronized contraction shows how aggressively speculative positions have been flushed out. Meanwhile, the ongoing correction has dragged Ethereum’s price from $4,830 to $2,800, marking a steep 43% decline from the highs. This widespread reduction in leverage suggests the market is undergoing a deeper reset than typical corrections. Investors are not rushing to re-enter positions, especially as liquidations continue to stack up across exchanges. While shrinking open interest weighs on short-term momentum and sentiment, Darkfost notes that such aggressive deleveraging may ultimately help rebuild a healthier market foundation — one capable of supporting a durable bottom for ETH. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Distribution Continues: Whale Sends Another 5,000 ETH To Binance ETH Loses Key Trend Support as 3-Day Structure Turns Fully Bearish Ethereum’s 3-day chart shows a decisive breakdown in structure, with price now firmly below the 50 SMA, 100 SMA, and 200 SMA for the first time since late 2024. The rejection from the $3,600–$3,800 region triggered a strong impulse to the downside, sending ETH directly through all major moving averages and confirming a shift toward a higher-timeframe downtrend. The current trading zone around $2,800 reflects a critical test of former support, but momentum remains weak. The 50 SMA has now crossed below the 100 SMA, while both are beginning to converge downward toward the 200 SMA — a configuration that typically precedes sustained corrections. Volume has increased on red candles, showing that sellers remain dominant, and there is little evidence of aggressive dip-buying. The most recent candle wick toward $2,700 highlights vulnerability rather than strength, suggesting buyers are hesitant to defend this level with conviction.

From a niche digital experiment, it has developed into a financial market measured in trillions of dollars. Although the industry has faced periods of volatility, many analysts believe global adoption remains in an early phase, leaving room for significant long-term expansion. Long-Term Growth of the Digital Asset Market A review of market data highlights how quickly the crypto economy has expanded. According to TradingView, the global crypto market was valued at only $5.66 billion in early December 2015. Bitcoin represented nearly the entire market at the time, accounting for approximately 99% of total capitalization. The environment today is markedly different. As of now, the total crypto market cap stands at roughly $2.85 trillion. While the sector has declined by about 28% over the past two months, the current valuation still reflects major growth over the past decade. Bitcoin’s share of the market has also fallen to around 59%, reflecting the rise of alternative assets. The increase in market share held by altcoins, including Ethereum, XRP, and others, has reshaped the overall market structure. These assets have continued to attract users and institutional interest, contributing to broader market diversification. A Path Toward a $100 Trillion Crypto Market Several market commentators have presented forecasts suggesting that the crypto sector could expand far beyond current levels. Raoul Pal, founder of Global Macro Investor, proposed that the global crypto market could reach $100 trillion between 2032 and 2034. A similar estimate was shared by Julien Bittel, Global Macro Investor’s Macro Research Head, in mid-2025. A more aggressive projection came from MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor, who argued in a 2021 CNBC interview that Bitcoin alone might eventually reach a valuation near $100 trillion. Although this outlook is widely debated, many analysts believe that even a fraction of this figure would represent large increases relative to today’s market size. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Estimating XRP’s Value in a $100 Trillion Market If the broader market were to expand to $100 trillion, the value of XRP would depend heavily on whether it preserves its current level of market influence. At present, XRP holds a dominance of roughly 4.223%, supported by a market capitalization of approximately $120.34 billion. This is well below its highest recorded dominance of 31% in May 2017, but still notable given the size of today’s market. If the total market capitalization reached $100 trillion and XRP retained its 4.223% share, XRP’s valuation would rise to about $4.233 trillion. With a circulating supply of roughly 60.25 billion tokens, this would correspond to an XRP price of around $70. This projected valuation represents a substantial increase compared to the current trading price of $2. Such a scenario would dramatically reshape the value of mid-sized retail portfolios. Data from the XRP Rich List indicates that nearly 600,000 wallets contain between 1,000 and 5,000 XRP. At present, 5,000 XRP is worth around $10,000. Under a $70 price estimate, that same amount would be valued at approximately $350,000, an increase of about $340,000. The future value of XRP will depend on several interacting factors, including overall crypto-market expansion, sustained demand for efficient settlement networks, and XRP’s ability to preserve or increase its share of the market. If the global crypto market were ever to reach the $100 trillion range, even a stable dominance level could translate into a substantial increase in XRP’s valuation.

Onchain data reveals a new address, suspected to be linked to the cryptocurrency mining entity Bitmine, received a colossal 18,345 ETH—worth approximately $55.25 million—from the institutional custodian BitGo. This Bitmine-linked address transaction immediately raises critical questions about institutional movement and market sentiment in the crypto space. What Does This Massive ETH Transfer to a Bitmine-linked Address Mean? The transaction, first flagged by Onchain Lens, involves the address ‘0xA79d…’ receiving funds directly from BitGo, a trusted name in digital asset security. When such a large sum moves from a regulated custodian to a private address, it signals significant activity. This could point to several scenarios, including strategic treasury management, preparation for staking, or a major capital reallocation by a key industry player. Therefore, analyzing these flows is crucial for understanding underlying market forces. Large transfers often precede notable price movements or signal confidence from major holders. Why Are On-Chain Analysts Watching This Bitmine-linked Address? On-chain transparency allows us to track whale movements in real-time. The link to Bitmine, a known player in crypto mining and infrastructure, adds a layer of context. Here are the key aspects analysts are scrutinizing: Source Credibility: The funds originated from BitGo, a licensed custodian, suggesting this is a legitimate institutional move rather than an exchange withdrawal. Timing and Scale: A $55 million transfer is not routine. It occurs within a specific market context, potentially indicating accumulation or strategic positioning. Destination Behavior: The future activity of this Bitmine-linked address will be telling. Will the ETH be held, staked, or moved to a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol? How Could This Impact Ethereum and Broader Market Sentiment? Transactions of this magnitude can influence market psychology. A withdrawal of this size from a custodian into a private wallet is often interpreted as a long-term holding signal, which can be bullish. It reduces immediately sellable supply on exchanges. However, the true impact depends on the holder’s intent. Moreover, it highlights the growing scale of institutional involvement. When entities move tens of millions effortlessly on-chain, it demonstrates the maturity of Ethereum’s infrastructure for handling serious capital. What Are the Practical Takeaways for Crypto Observers? For investors and enthusiasts, this event is a masterclass in on-chain intelligence. It underscores the importance of monitoring blockchain explorers and understanding transaction narratives. The movement to this Bitmine-linked address isn’t just a number; it’s a story about capital allocation, institutional strategy, and network confidence. Actionable insight: Pay attention to subsequent transactions from this address. Its next move could provide even clearer signals about the holder’s strategy and outlook on Ethereum’s future. Conclusion: A Signal in the Noise The $55.25 million ETH transfer to a suspected Bitmine-linked address is a powerful reminder of the dynamic, transparent nature of blockchain economies. It represents more than wealth transfer; it signifies strategic action by sophisticated players. While the exact purpose remains private, the transaction itself bolsters the narrative of Ethereum as a robust settlement layer for institutional-scale finance. Watching how this story unfolds on-chain will provide valuable clues for the market’s next chapter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “Bitmine-linked address”? A: It refers to a blockchain wallet address that on-chain analysts and heuristics suggest is associated with the cryptocurrency mining and infrastructure company Bitmine, based on transaction patterns and sourcing. Q2: Why is a transfer from BitGo significant? A: BitGo is a regulated, institutional-grade custodian. A transfer from them typically indicates action by a serious corporate or institutional entity, not an individual retail trader. Q3: Could this large ETH transfer affect the price? A: Indirectly, yes. Large withdrawals from custodial services to private wallets are often seen as reducing immediate selling pressure on exchanges, which can be a supportive factor for price.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has climbed five points to a score of 28, officially moving the market out of the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. This shift is a crucial psychological milestone that often precedes changing market dynamics. But what does this mean for your portfolio, and is it time to adjust your strategy? What Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Now? Compiled by data provider Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a vital tool for gauging market emotion. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed.’ A reading of 28, while still in the ‘Fear’ category, marks a clear departure from the depths of pessimism that have characterized recent months. This improvement suggests a thaw in investor anxiety, potentially opening the door for more sustained positive price action. How Is This Critical Index Calculated? Understanding the components behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reveals why this move is meaningful. The index isn’t a guess; it’s a data-driven composite of several market factors: Volatility (25%): Measures price swings, with high volatility often associated with fear. Market Volume (25%): Tracks trading activity. Sustained volume on upswings can indicate growing confidence. Social Media (15%): Analyzes the tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polls market participants for their direct sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Shifts can signal risk-on or risk-off behavior. Google Trends (10%): Monitors search interest for cryptocurrency terms. The rise to 28 indicates positive momentum across several of these metrics, providing a more robust signal than price action alone. Why Should You Care About Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number. It acts as a contrarian indicator at its extremes. Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have often presented buying opportunities for long-term investors, while periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ have signaled potential market tops. Moving out of extreme territory suggests the market is finding a healthier equilibrium. However, it’s crucial to remember this is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball. It should inform your decisions alongside fundamental and technical analysis. Actionable Insights from the Current Reading So, the index is at 28 and rising. What’s a smart investor to do? First, recognize this as a sign of decreasing panic, not a signal for reckless buying. Consider these steps: Review Your Portfolio: Assess if your asset allocation still matches your risk tolerance. Plan Your Entries: If you’ve been waiting for fear to subside to deploy capital, this shift warrants a review of your buy-list. Stay Disciplined: Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Use dollar-cost averaging to build positions gradually. Monitor the Trend: Watch if the index continues its climb toward ‘Neutral’ (around 50) or stalls. The key is to use this improving sentiment as context, not as your sole trigger for action. Conclusion: A Sigh of Relief, Not a Victory Lap The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 28 is an encouraging development that breaks a prolonged spell of extreme pessimism. It reflects a measurable improvement in market psychology across volatility, volume, and social metrics. For investors, this reduces the emotional weight of ‘extreme fear’ and allows for more rational decision-making. While challenges remain, this shift marks a meaningful step toward a healthier, less panic-driven market environment. The path forward will depend on sustained positive fundamentals, but for now, the market has taken a vital breath of fresh air. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 28 mean? A score of 28 places the market in the ‘Fear’ zone, but it represents a move away from the more severe ‘Extreme Fear’ category (0-25). It indicates that investor sentiment is improving, though caution still prevails. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on market emotion. You can check the current reading on Alternative.me’s website. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy/sell signal? It is best used as a contrarian indicator at extreme values (below 10 or above 90). At a moderate score like 28, it’s more useful for confirming a shift in market mood rather than giving a direct trading signal. Does the index apply to all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin? While several of its components (like volatility and dominance) are heavily influenced by Bitcoin, the index is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Can the index predict a bull market? Not directly. A rising index shows improving sentiment, which is a necessary ingredient for a bull market, but not sufficient on its own. Sustained positive fundamentals and adoption are required for a full bull run. Where can I see the historical data for this index? Historical charts and data are available on the Alternative.me website, allowing you to compare current readings to past market cycles.

The protocol announced plans to distribute a staggering 17.13 BTC—valued at approximately $1.578 million—directly to its loyal veYB token holders. This strategic initiative not only shares substantial value but also fundamentally realigns incentives within the YieldBasis ecosystem. What Is the New YieldBasis Fee Distribution Mechanism? The core of this announcement is the introduction of a transparent and direct fee distribution mechanism . Simply put, a portion of the fees generated by the YieldBasis platform will now be systematically collected and distributed to users who lock their YB tokens to receive veYB. This model, often called vote-escrowed, rewards long-term commitment. The first major distribution, sourced from already secured funds, involves over $1.5 million in Bitcoin, demonstrating immediate, tangible value for participants. Why Is This a Game-Changer for veYB Holders? This new system transforms veYB from a simple governance token into a powerful income-generating asset. Holders benefit in two key ways: Direct Profit Sharing: They receive a real share of the protocol’s revenue, paid in high-value assets like Bitcoin. Enhanced Tokenomics: It incentivizes long-term locking, which can reduce circulating supply and promote ecosystem stability. Therefore, this fee distribution mechanism directly ties a user’s reward to the platform’s success, creating a powerful alignment of interests. How Does the $1.5M Bitcoin Distribution Work? The planned distribution of 17.13 BTC is not a future promise but an action on secured capital. YieldBasis has already acquired the Bitcoin, ensuring the funds are ready for distribution. This approach removes uncertainty and builds immense trust. The distribution will be proportional, meaning the amount of Bitcoin each veYB holder receives depends on their share of the total locked value. This fair and automated fee distribution mechanism ensures everyone gets their rightful slice of the $1.5 million pie. What Challenges Could This Model Face? While innovative, this model’s success hinges on the sustained generation of protocol fees. Furthermore, the value of distributed Bitcoin is subject to market volatility. However, by distributing a premier asset like BTC, YieldBasis mitigates some of the risks associated with its own token’s price swings, offering holders a diversified reward. What Are the Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors? For investors and DeFi users, this announcement highlights a critical trend: protocols that share revenue directly with their community are gaining traction. When evaluating similar platforms, look for: Transparency in the fee distribution mechanism . The quality and stability of the assets being distributed. The long-term sustainability of the protocol’s fee generation. YieldBasis’s move sets a compelling precedent, putting substantial capital directly back into the hands of its supporters. A Compelling Summary of the YieldBasis Move YieldBasis has masterfully executed a confidence-boosting strategy. By launching a robust fee distribution mechanism and backing it with an immediate, sizable Bitcoin airdrop, the protocol does more than just announce a feature—it delivers proven value. This action strengthens holder loyalty, attracts new capital seeking yield, and positions YieldBasis as a serious, user-centric player in the competitive DeFi landscape. The message is clear: commit to the ecosystem, and you will be rewarded handsomely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is veYB? A1: veYB stands for “vote-escrowed YB.” It’s a token you receive when you lock your YB tokens for a set period, granting you governance rights and, now, a share of protocol fees. Q2: How do I qualify for the Bitcoin distribution? A2: You must be a veYB holder at the time of the distribution snapshot. The amount you receive is proportional to your veYB balance relative to the total. Q3: Will there be more distributions after this $1.5M one? A3: Yes, this is the inaugural distribution under the new permanent fee distribution mechanism . Future distributions will depend on ongoing protocol fee revenue. Q4: Is the Bitcoin distribution automatic? A4: Yes, the process is designed to be automatic and trustless for eligible veYB holders, based on the smart contracts governing the system. Q5: What does this mean for the price of YB token? A5: While not a guarantee, the mechanism incentivizes locking YB (reducing sell pressure) and attracts users seeking yield, which can positively influence token economics. Q6: Can I withdraw my locked YB after receiving Bitcoin? A6: Your YB remains locked for the duration you initially chose. Receiving Bitcoin rewards does not change your lock-up period.

The PLUME network announced its launch on Circle’s Arc testnet while simultaneously securing a spot on Coinbase’s listing roadmap. This dual announcement signals growing institutional interest in compliant blockchain solutions for real-world assets. What is Plume Blockchain and Why Does It Matter? Plume represents a specialized blockchain designed specifically for tokenizing real-world assets. Unlike general-purpose chains, Plume focuses on compliance-first infrastructure that bridges traditional finance with decentralized technology. The platform enables assets like real estate, commodities, and intellectual property to exist as digital tokens while maintaining regulatory compliance. The recent developments position Plume at the intersection of two powerful trends: institutional blockchain adoption and the growing RWA market. With traditional financial giants increasingly exploring digital assets, Plume’s compliance-focused approach addresses key concerns around regulation and security. Circle’s Arc Testnet: A Strategic Launchpad for Plume Plume’s launch on Circle’s Arc testnet represents more than just technical integration. Arc serves as Circle’s proprietary Layer 1 network specifically optimized for USDC-based payments and transfers. This specialization makes it an ideal environment for RWA applications that require stable, predictable transaction environments. The Arc network boasts an impressive partner list that includes: Societe Generale – Major European financial institution Visa – Global payments technology company BlackRock – World’s largest asset manager Over 100 additional traditional financial firms This ecosystem provides Plume with immediate access to established financial infrastructure and potential integration points with traditional systems. The testnet phase allows developers to experiment with Plume’s RWA capabilities in a controlled environment before mainnet deployment. Coinbase Roadmap Addition: What It Means for PLUME The simultaneous addition of PLUME to Coinbase’s listing roadmap represents a vote of confidence from one of cryptocurrency’s most influential exchanges. Coinbase’s roadmap typically signals assets under consideration for future listing, though final decisions depend on technical and compliance reviews. This development matters for several reasons: Increased visibility – Coinbase’s 100+ million users gain awareness of Plume Liquidity potential – Future listing could provide significant trading access Credibility boost – Coinbase’s vetting process adds legitimacy Market validation – Signals institutional interest in RWA solutions The dual announcement timing suggests coordinated strategy between Plume’s development team and their institutional partners. Such coordination often indicates well-planned market entry strategies rather than opportunistic developments. The Real-World Assets Revolution: Why Now? Real-world asset tokenization represents one of blockchain’s most promising use cases beyond cryptocurrency trading. By converting physical assets into digital tokens, blockchain enables fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and transparent tracking of asset provenance. Plume’s approach addresses several traditional barriers to RWA adoption: Regulatory compliance built into protocol design Integration with established financial partners Focus on USDC stability for asset pricing Developer-friendly tools for asset issuers The current market environment particularly favors RWA solutions. With increasing institutional adoption and regulatory clarity emerging in key jurisdictions, compliant platforms like Plume stand to benefit from first-mover advantages. Challenges and Considerations for Plume’s Future Despite promising developments, Plume faces several challenges common to RWA platforms. Regulatory landscapes vary significantly across jurisdictions, requiring adaptable compliance frameworks. Technical integration with legacy financial systems presents another hurdle, though partnerships with established firms like those on Arc’s network help address this. Market adoption represents the ultimate test. While institutional interest grows, actual asset tokenization volumes remain modest compared to traditional markets. Plume must demonstrate practical utility beyond theoretical advantages to achieve meaningful scale. Security considerations also remain paramount. Real-world assets involve substantial value, making robust security protocols essential. Plume’s testnet phase provides crucial opportunity to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before mainnet launch. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment for Asset Tokenization Plume’s simultaneous launch on Circle’s Arc testnet and addition to Coinbase’s roadmap signals accelerating institutional adoption of blockchain for real-world assets. These developments position Plume at the forefront of a potentially transformative shift in how traditional assets are owned, traded, and managed. The coming months will prove crucial as Plume moves from testnet to mainnet and potentially to exchange listings. Success could validate the RWA thesis and inspire further innovation at the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology. For investors and developers, Plume represents both opportunity and responsibility. The opportunity lies in participating in early-stage infrastructure for a potentially massive market. The responsibility involves contributing to secure, compliant systems that earn lasting trust from traditional financial participants. Frequently Asked Questions What is Plume blockchain’s main purpose? Plume blockchain specializes in tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) with built-in compliance features. It enables traditional assets like real estate and commodities to exist as digital tokens on a secure, regulated blockchain platform. Why is launching on Circle’s Arc testnet significant? Circle’s Arc network is specifically designed for USDC payments with over 100 traditional financial partners. This gives Plume immediate access to established financial infrastructure and potential integration with major institutions like Visa and BlackRock. Does Coinbase roadmap addition guarantee listing? No, Coinbase roadmap indicates assets under consideration for potential listing. Final decisions depend on technical reviews, compliance checks, and market factors. However, roadmap inclusion signals serious evaluation and potential future listing. What types of real-world assets can Plume tokenize? Plume can potentially tokenize various assets including real estate, commodities, intellectual property, art, and other valuable physical assets. The platform focuses on compliance-friendly tokenization suitable for regulated markets. How does Plume ensure regulatory compliance? Plume builds compliance features directly into its protocol design, working with regulatory frameworks from the ground up. This includes identity verification, transaction monitoring, and integration with existing financial compliance systems. When will Plume launch on mainnet? The testnet phase typically precedes mainnet launch by several months. Exact timing depends on test results, security audits, and development progress. The Arc testnet launch represents a crucial step toward mainnet deployment. Share This Insight Found this analysis valuable?

Ethereum still has trouble closing above the $3,000 mark but is forming some better-looking price action. The story repeats for Solana, but the harshly rejected crypto is showing signs of life, breaking its past week's descending price action and testing the $140 level. By Elior Manier Cryptocurrencies are finally bouncing from their relative lows, with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) reclaiming the $90,000 level after bottoming near $80,500 on Friday, November 21. Traders are scared, and for good reason: elevated valuations and an ecstatic mood in early autumn had led to extreme positioning, which consequently triggered a cascade of liquidations and stops. The first major crack appeared shortly after Bitcoin reached its new record at $126,400 in mid-October, where a dark weekly closure led to a gigantic flash crash. After that, the recovery was swift but proved temporary, materializing into a consistent, progressive selloff that dragged on all the way to the final week of November. Low volumes are now the norm in this scarred market, but with selling flows largely reducing, some bottoms may have finally formed. The question remains: Are the recent lows dips to buy or traps to avoid? Current Session in Cryptos – Green throughout but some mid-day profit-taking – December 2, 2025 (12:01).

Market sentiment is still weak, but the daily session is a strong one. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is now hanging around $3,000 again, and Bitcoin is holding $90,000, recovering even after a terrible monthly open yesterday caused by Strategy's ( MSTR ) investor panic - likely fueled by fears over its collapsing premium and leverage sustainability.

According to Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary, the answer is a resounding ‘no’ for the Bitcoin price . The billionaire investor recently made a bold prediction, stating that even if the Fed holds rates steady in December, it will have little effect on BTC’s trajectory. This perspective clashes with mainstream market expectations, making it a crucial insight for every crypto holder. What Did Kevin O’Leary Actually Say About the Bitcoin Price? Kevin O’Leary, a prominent venture capitalist, shared his analysis with Cointelegraph. He expressed strong doubt that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its December meeting. More importantly, he argued this potential decision is almost irrelevant for Bitcoin. O’Leary believes the Bitcoin price is not poised for a significant drop from current levels, regardless of the Fed’s action. His specific forecast is remarkably narrow. He anticipates BTC will trade within a tight band, fluctuating only plus or minus 5% around the $91,000 mark for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, he sees no major catalysts on the horizon that could trigger a substantial rally, painting a picture of short-term stability. Why Is the Market Betting Against O’Leary’s Fed Call? O’Leary’s skepticism about a December rate cut puts him at odds with the dominant sentiment in traditional finance. The widely followed CME FedWatch Tool tells a different story. Currently, it shows traders are pricing in an overwhelming 89.2% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the December FOMC meeting. This creates a fascinating disconnect. On one side, you have a major investor downplaying the impact of a key macroeconomic event on crypto. On the other, the broader market is almost certain that event will happen. This divergence highlights a critical question for investors: Should Bitcoin be viewed through a traditional macroeconomic lens, or is it developing its own independent market drivers? What Does This Mean for Your Bitcoin Strategy? O’Leary’s comments offer actionable insights beyond mere price prediction. They suggest a shift in how seasoned investors perceive Bitcoin’s relationship with classic financial levers like interest rates. Reduced Macro Sensitivity: The analysis implies Bitcoin’s price may be becoming less reactive to every Fed whisper, signaling potential maturation. Range-Bound Trading: Prepare for possible consolidation. A ±5% range around $91,000 indicates volatility could decrease, favoring different trading strategies. Patience Over Hype: With ‘no major triggers for a significant rally’ cited, it tempers expectations for a sudden, news-driven moonshot and emphasizes long-term fundamentals. Therefore, if O’Leary’s view holds, constantly watching the Fed for Bitcoin price cues might be less productive than focusing on crypto-specific developments like adoption, regulation, and technological upgrades. The Bottom Line: Stability Over Speculation Kevin O’Leary’s forecast delivers a compelling narrative of unexpected stability. While the market hangs on the Fed’s every word, a influential voice argues that the Bitcoin price has entered a phase of resilient consolidation. The stunning part isn’t the lack of a rate cut prediction, but the assertion that it simply doesn’t matter much for Bitcoin right now. This perspective encourages investors to look past daily macroeconomic noise and assess Bitcoin’s value based on its own evolving role in the global financial system. Whether this stability is a calm before a storm or a sign of growing strength remains the ultimate question. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Kevin O’Leary’s main prediction for Bitcoin? A1: O’Leary predicts the Bitcoin price will remain stable, trading in a narrow range of ±5% around $91,000, and sees little impact from whether the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in December or not. Q2: Does the market agree with O’Leary on a December rate cut? A2: No. While O’Leary is skeptical, the CME FedWatch Tool shows an 89.2% probability that traders are expecting a 25-basis-point rate cut in December. Q3: Why would a Fed rate cut theoretically affect Bitcoin? A3: Traditionally, lower interest rates can weaken the US dollar and make riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive. However, O’Leary’s view suggests this relationship may be weakening. Q4: What should an investor take away from this analysis? A4: The key takeaway is that Bitcoin may be developing price independence from certain macroeconomic events, suggesting investors should also focus on crypto-specific fundamentals like adoption and regulation. Q5: Is O’Leary bullish or bearish on Bitcoin? A5: His comments suggest a neutral to cautiously stable outlook in the short term. He is not predicting a crash but also sees no immediate catalyst for a major rally. Found this analysis of Bitcoin price dynamics insightful?

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a significant player in the rapidly growing list of cryptocurrencies under $1 because of its early adoption, rapidly growing base of loyal followers, and strong performance in its current presale. Although it costs merely $0.035, MUTM is increasingly emerging as the best crypto to invest in, as identified by analysts, in the list of cryptocurrencies that could potentially reach $1 in the next market boom based on its strong DeFi model based on lending, borrowing, and interest-bearing tokens. Early presale performance in MUTM has already raised close to $19.05 million, with Phase 6 nearing expiry because of support from close to 18,270 buyers in advance of the forthcoming V1 rollout of Mutuum Finance. In comparison, many current big players such as Cardano (ADA) face challenges in both speed and structure, thereby making early-stage performance and utility-centric design in Mutuum Finance particularly appealing to buyers looking at cryptos that offer high-end returns. This makes MUTM the next crypto to hit $1 for those aiming for maximum early gains. Cardano Strongly Resisted at Support Levels as Bulls Ready to Make Breakthrough towards $0.50 Cardano (ADA) is consolidating around $0.40 with strength, as buyers are able to mark out the latest strong level of support in the chart, setting the stage to form the bull base that will carry the price towards $0.50, assuming market sentiment stays positive and the selling pressure dissipates. Although there is such positive news in the ADA market, many individual investors are looking at other promising projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the best crypto to invest in right now. MUTM Presale Spark Record Interest Mutuum Finance (MUTM) seems to be rapidly rising in the list of DeFi projects in 2025. With presale phase 6 costing $0.035, this final stage offers early buyers the chance to invest after which phase 7 raises the cost to $0.04. Services such as direct Credit & Debit Card purchases are now enabled in the platform, reducing any customary barrier to investing that new or experienced buyers alike face in accessing such technologies. Mutuum Finance offers twin lending, which has attracted increased investor attention due to its scalable nature and potentially high-growth prospects in the crypto market. The liquidity pool allows for smooth connectivity between lenders and borrowers, hence attractive yields and optimal resource use. Over $19.05 million in funds has already been raised from in excess of 18,270 participants in the current presale, thus showing signs of widespread interest in the development of the platform. MUTM stands out as the best crypto to invest in that offers actual utility, benefits, and innovation in the DeFi market. Investors eyeing under-$1 projects with high potential are now watching MUTM as the next crypto to hit $1. Transparency and sustainability are at the core of MUTM’s presale process. From the total 4 billion tokens, 1.82 billion tokens (45.5%) are allocated in the presale distribution, and in excess of 795 million tokens have already been sold. With card purchases having been incorporated, there has been easier accessibility of the tokens to all manner of investors, regardless of whether they are experienced or not. It is in Q4 of 2025 that MUTM has emerged as the most promising crypto initiative and the best crypto to invest in for early-stage exposure. Roadmap Progress Mutuum Finance is at the moment in Phase 2: Building Mutuum, which concentrates on technology development. It covers the final coding of smart contracts, internal testing, front-end & back-end DApp development, and the addition of sophisticated functionalities & risk management modules. The following phase 3: Finalizing Mutuum Finance will comprise Sepolia Testnet beta releases and security audit work in order to ensure the readiness of the Mutuum Finance DeFi platform towards the V1 mainnet network launch in Sepolia. All these combined aspects ensure that the MUTM network creates a scalable DeFi ecosystem. At the current price of $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appears to be an emerging favorite in the list of cryptos that are likely to follow through at $1 in the future. Their phase 6 presale campaign is nearing completion, having raised $19.05M from over 18,270+ buyers. It is building a DeFi ecosystem where users can lend, borrow, and stake tokens after the development phase, giving it actual usability compared to slower movers such as Cardano (ADA). For phase 7, the price will go up to $0.04, further cementing MUTM as the best crypto to invest in and the next crypto to hit $1 for ambitious investors.

How Will Bitcoin Perform In December? Sharing a year-to-date chart on X, trader Daan Crypto Trades highlighted a recurring pattern in 2025: Bitcoin often sets its monthly extreme early. “We know by now that the first move does often create the monthly high or low within the first ~12 days,” he wrote. “This happens about 80% of the months.” His chart marks how February’s low, March’s high, April’s low, May’s low, July’s inflection, and the key October and November pivots all occurred within that window, with June and August flagged as exceptions. December, so far, is conforming in form if not yet in outcome. “Price has taken a quick dive straight from the candle open so far in December, leaving no wick above either,” Daan noted. “This doesn’t make for the strongest high.” That kind of immediate one-sided move, he argues, is often revisited: “Good to watch closely in the 1–2 weeks ahead. Often these instant moves from the open, do end getting retested. October was a good example of that recently.” Related Reading: $56,000 Bitcoin Bottom? Burniske Thinks The Market Still Has To Break Zooming in, Daan’s second chart sets out the key levels. After bottoming near $80,714 on November 21, Bitcoin staged roughly a +15% relief rally into a thick prior support-turned-resistance zone in the low-$93,000s. That first test failed, with price rejected and rolling back over. “BTC rejecting from the previous support & resistance area,” he wrote. “Not something you want to see as a bull. Price saw a decent +15% relief rally but has lost steam again after a week already.” On that same chart he plots a short-term Fibonacci retracement from the $93,175 local high down to the $80,714 low. The 0.786 retracement level sits around $83,381, close to spot at the time of posting. “It is early in the week/month,” he added, “and we do often see sharp moves straight from that new monthly candle. These often aren’t the strongest highs/lows set straight at the start of a new month. So good to watch in the days ahead. (You guys also know I love my .786 fib retests so watching closely around this area).” That leaves a clear tactical map: immediate downside levels around the 0.786 retrace and the prior low, with upside conviction only returning if price can re-enter and reclaim the mid-to-high-$80,000s former support zone. A separate post from Daan situates this setup within December’s broader historical profile. Sharing a Coinglass table of Bitcoin’s monthly returns from 2013 onward, he described December as “pretty mixed but [one that] has seen some big outliers with a lot of volatility.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Largest Hidden-Buying Spike of the Cycle Despite Losing $90K Level The data support that: past Decembers range from large gains above 30–40% to deep drawdowns exceeding -30%. The average December return sits in modest positive territory (+4.75%), while the median is slightly negative (-3.22%), underscoring that there is no simple “Santa rally” effect; instead, dispersion and volatility dominate. For Daan, part of that behaviour is structural. “Don’t be surprised if you see some weird flows at the end and start of the year,” he warned. “Generally this is a period where large holders/funds and such rebalance their books. We might also see the effect of tax loss harvesting at some point.” Those portfolio adjustments and tax-driven trades can magnify moves in both directions, particularly in an asset that still trades with pockets of thin liquidity. His practical takeaway is deliberately conservative: “Good to just be allocated in a way that feels comfortable for you. Whatever the end of 2025 and start of 2026 will bring.” At press time, BTC traded at $87,323.

55274308,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=225685,1764723612,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crucial Shift: Altcoin Season Index Plummets to 20, Signaling Bitcoin Dominance",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-falls-bitcoin-dominance/,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Shift: Altcoin Season Index Plummets to 20, Signaling Bitcoin Dominance Has the altcoin rally run out of steam? A key market indicator just flashed a significant warning. The widely watched Altcoin Season Index has plunged five points to a score of just 20, its lowest level in recent memory. This sharp decline suggests a powerful shift in investor sentiment is underway, with capital potentially flowing back toward the original cryptocurrency. For traders and long-term holders alike, understanding this metric is critical for navigating the volatile crypto landscape. What Does the Falling Altcoin Season Index Actually Mean? First, let’s break down what this index measures. Created by CoinMarketCap, the Altcoin Season Index tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over a 90-day window. The core question it answers is simple: are alternative cryptocurrencies, or ‘altcoins,’ outperforming the market leader? The index operates on a clear threshold. When 75% of these top altcoins beat Bitcoin’s returns over three months, an “altcoin season” is declared, and the index score moves closer to 100. Conversely, a score like 20 indicates the opposite—a strong “Bitcoin season” where BTC is leading the pack. This recent five-point drop is a clear signal that Bitcoin’s dominance is intensifying. Why Is Bitcoin Outperforming Altcoins Right Now? Several factors could be driving this shift. Market cycles often see capital rotate between Bitcoin and altcoins. After a period of altcoin speculation, investors frequently seek the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin, especially during times of broader market uncertainty. Consider these potential drivers behind the low Altcoin Season Index : Risk-Off Sentiment: Investors may be moving to Bitcoin as a less volatile store of value within the crypto ecosystem. Macroeconomic Pressures: Interest rate fears or inflation data can dampen appetite for speculative altcoin bets. Cycle Maturation: Historical patterns show altcoin seasons often follow major Bitcoin rallies, and we may be in a consolidation phase. Liquidity Preference: In tighter markets, liquidity flows to the largest, most-traded asset first. How Should You Interpret This Index for Your Portfolio? While a low Altcoin Season Index suggests caution for altcoin investments, it’s not a sell-everything signal. Instead, view it as a crucial dashboard gauge for market structure. A reading of 20 tells you the current wind is blowing strongly in Bitcoin’s favor. This might be a time to reassess your allocation, ensuring your portfolio isn’t overexposed to high-risk altcoins that could underperform if the trend continues. However, remember that this is a lagging indicator based on 90-day performance. A sudden surge in altcoin prices could reverse the trend quickly. Therefore, use it for context, not as a standalone trading trigger. The key is to combine this data with other on-chain metrics and fundamental research. The Bottom Line: Navigating the Current Crypto Climate The dramatic fall in the Altcoin Season Index to 20 is a stark reminder of Bitcoin’s enduring dominance. It highlights a market choosing relative stability over high-risk, high-reward altcoin plays for now. For savvy investors, this period can be an opportunity to accumulate strong fundamental projects at lower prices or to strengthen a core Bitcoin position. The crypto market is cyclical, and today’s Bitcoin season will eventually give way to the next altcoin rally. Your strategy should be ready for both. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is a score of 20 on the Altcoin Season Index bad for crypto? A: Not necessarily “bad,” but it indicates a specific market phase. It means Bitcoin is significantly outperforming most altcoins, which is a normal part of market cycles. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins when this index is low? A: A reactive sell-off is rarely a good strategy. Use the index as one of many tools. Consider rebalancing or focusing on altcoins with strong fundamentals that may be undervalued during this phase. Q: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A> The index is typically updated daily, tracking the rolling 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin. Q: What score indicates a true “Altcoin Season”? A> A true altcoin season is officially declared when the index score surpasses 75. This means more than 75% of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the prior quarter. Q: Can Bitcoin and altcoins rise at the same time? A> Absolutely. A rising Altcoin Season Index doesn’t mean Bitcoin is falling. It means altcoins are rising faster . Both asset classes can appreciate simultaneously in a bull market.

55274340,638192,1764723637,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55274340.jpeg,Old Bitcoin Moves Spike: 3–5 Year Dormant Coins Wake Up Again,https://bitcoinist.com/old-bitcoin-moves-3-5-year-dormant-coins-wake-up/,"Bitcoin has fallen back below the $90,000 level after another wave of selling pressure and leveraged long liquidations, signaling that the market remains firmly on the defensive. Each attempt to stabilize has failed, with sellers quickly overwhelming buyers and forcing price into lower ranges. Fear and uncertainty continue to dominate sentiment, and traders increasingly prepare for the possibility of a deeper continuation of the downtrend as volatility accelerates. Amid this weakness, a new signal has started to attract the attention of analysts. According to Maartunn, one of the market’s most respected on-chain researchers, old coins are waking up again. Dormant Bitcoin—specifically coins held for 3 to 5 years—has begun to move on-chain in noticeable spikes. Historically, this type of activity often reflects structural shifts in holder behavior, appearing during periods of stress, capitulation, or preparation for major market pivots. While the direction of these moves is not always immediately clear, rising activity among long-dormant coins adds another layer of complexity to an already fragile market. As Bitcoin continues to struggle below $90K, the behavior of these older coins could help determine whether the current decline deepens—or sets the stage for a larger transition ahead. Old Coins Start Moving as Macro Fear Collides With Policy Shifts Maartunn highlights a notable rise in activity from 3–5 year-old Bitcoin, a cohort that typically remains dormant unless underlying conditions begin to shift. The Spent Output Age Bands show a sharp increase, jumping from 2,030 BTC earlier today to 3,475 BTC now. These spikes rarely happen randomly. Maartunn believes that “something’s stirring beneath the surface,” suggesting that long-term holders may be reacting to mounting market stress—or positioning ahead of a potential macro inflection. This awakening of older coins comes at a moment filled with conflicting signals. Fear around Tether’s reserves has resurfaced, sparking concerns over liquidity stability across exchanges. At the same time, renewed headlines about a supposed China Bitcoin ban have circulated again, despite offering no new policy information. These narratives have added yet another layer of anxiety to an already fragile market. Yet the macro backdrop also contains reasons for cautious optimism. The Federal Reserve is expected to bring its quantitative tightening (QT) program to an end, and markets are increasingly pricing in a potential interest rate cut this December. Such shifts historically improve liquidity conditions and support risk assets. As long-term coins begin to move and macro forces pull in opposite directions, Bitcoin enters a complex environment—one that could precede either deeper volatility or the early stages of a larger transition. Bitcoin Struggles to Recover as Daily Trend Remains Firmly Bearish Bitcoin’s 1-day chart continues to reveal a market trapped in a strong downtrend, with price failing to reclaim the key moving averages that define higher-timeframe momentum. After breaking down from the $115,000 region, BTC plunged directly through the 50 SMA, 100 SMA, and 200 SMA, creating a steep momentum shift that sellers still control. The current price action around $86,000–$88,000 shows hesitation and a lack of follow-through from bulls, even after several attempts to rebound. The 50 and 100 SMAs both slope sharply downward, confirming a bearish trend structure. Meanwhile, the 200 SMA has flattened and now sits far above price, highlighting just how aggressive and extended the selloff has been. BTC continues to print lower highs and lower lows, a clear signal that the market has not yet found a stable bottom. Volume spikes on major red candles suggest a mix of forced liquidations and panic-driven exits, while green candles remain smaller and less convincing. The lack of strong buy volume shows that investors remain cautious despite the magnitude of the correction. If Bitcoin fails to break back above $92,000–$95,000, the market risks another leg lower. The next major supports sit between $80,000 and $78,000, levels that align with previous consolidation zones. For now, the bears still control the daily trend.

In a significant move, the Aave community is now actively debating a proposal to streamline its operations by potentially terminating its Aave multichain services on less profitable networks. This discussion marks a pivotal moment, highlighting a mature shift towards sustainability and efficient resource allocation within one of crypto’s leading lending protocols. What Are the Proposed Changes to Aave Multichain Services? According to a report from The Block, the proposal suggests a clear, revenue-focused strategy. It aims to end support for blockchain networks that generate low annual revenue for the protocol. Networks specifically mentioned include zkSync, Metis, and Soneium. The plan sets a firm benchmark: only networks contributing at least $2 million in annual revenue would continue to receive support. This temperature check, a preliminary discussion phase, has already seen overwhelming consensus, receiving 100% approval in a recent Snapshot vote. Why Is the Aave Community Considering This Move? This potential pivot reflects a broader trend in DeFi towards operational efficiency and treasury management. Maintaining Aave multichain services across numerous networks isn’t free; it involves ongoing development, security audits, and community management costs. The core rationale is straightforward: resources should flow to where they create the most value for the Aave ecosystem and its token holders. Focus on Sustainability: Prioritizing high-revenue networks ensures the protocol’s long-term financial health. Reduced Complexity: Streamlining operations can minimize security risks and development overhead. Enhanced User Experience: Concentrating liquidity and attention on core networks can improve service quality for the majority of users. What Does This Mean for the Future of DeFi? The Aave community’s discussion is a bellwether for the entire decentralized finance sector. After years of aggressive multichain expansion, protocols are now making calculated decisions about where to deploy capital and effort. This isn’t necessarily a retreat but a strategic consolidation. It signals that the era of ‘deploy everywhere’ is giving way to a more nuanced ‘deploy where it matters’ approach. For users on affected chains, liquidity may become less accessible, potentially pushing activity towards the protocol’s stronger, more profitable markets. What Are the Potential Challenges of This Strategy? While the logic is sound, this strategy isn’t without its hurdles. Abandoning networks could be perceived as contradicting DeFi’s permissionless and accessible ethos. Furthermore, it might stifle innovation on newer, emerging chains that have yet to reach the $2 million revenue threshold. The community must carefully weigh these factors against the clear financial benefits. The final decision will set a powerful precedent for how major DeFi protocols balance idealism with pragmatic business sense. Conclusion: A Mature Step for Aave and DeFi The debate over Aave multichain services represents a coming-of-age moment for decentralized governance. It moves beyond technical deployment to grapple with real-world economics and strategic prioritization. By openly discussing profitability, the Aave community is demonstrating a sophisticated, responsible approach to managing a leading financial protocol. This focus on sustainability, rather than sheer growth, could ultimately make the entire ecosystem more resilient and attractive to institutional participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Which Aave multichain services are proposed to be shut down? A: The proposal specifically mentions ending support on the zkSync, Metis, and Soneium networks due to their low annual revenue generation for the protocol. Q: Has the decision to shut down these services been finalized? A> No, it has not. The proposal is currently in a ‘temperature check’ or preliminary discussion phase. While a Snapshot vote showed 100% approval, this is a non-binding signal to gauge community sentiment before any on-chain governance vote. Q: What is the revenue threshold for a network to keep Aave services? A: The proposal sets a benchmark of $2 million in annual revenue. Networks generating less than this amount would be candidates for service termination under the current plan. Q: Will this affect the price of the AAVE token? A: While not directly stated, the market often views strategic moves towards profitability and efficiency positively. A more sustainable protocol with better-managed resources could be seen as a bullish long-term signal for the AAVE token. Q: Can users on affected chains still access their funds? A> Yes. If services are terminated, it would typically involve a graceful wind-down process. Users would be given ample notice and clear instructions to withdraw their funds from the protocol on that specific chain before support ends. Q: Does this mean Aave is giving up on its multichain strategy? A> Not at all. This is a refinement, not an abandonment. Aave will continue to operate on major, profitable chains like Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. The strategy shifts from being everywhere to being strategically everywhere.
