This comes after a similar investigation was launched against Elon Musk’s X last month, making these the first DSA enforcement actions by the Irish regulator. Ireland investigates TikTok and LinkedIn According to a Bloomberg report, Ireland’s media regulator investigations into TikTok and LinkedIn are happening over potential flaws in their content reporting mechanisms. The probes will focus on ascertaining whether the platforms’ systems for users to report suspected illegal content are adequately accessible, user-friendly, and anonymous, as required by the DSA. Providers need to “have reporting mechanisms, that are easy to access and user-friendly, to report content considered to be illegal,” said John Evans, Digital Services Commissioner at the regulator. The European Commission is the main European Union enforcer against very large online platforms. However, some aspects of the law — including the reporting mechanism — fall under the jurisdiction of the national regulator of the EU country where a platform is headquartered. Companies found to be in violation of Europe’s digital rules, as determined by Ireland’s media regulator, can be fined as much as 6% of the company’s annual global sales. This is not the first time the Irish regulators have targeted a social media platform. TikTok was also caught in its crossfire and got slammed with a €530 million penalty for violating the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in May 2025, while LinkedIn also got fined about €310 million for various regulatory breaches. Ireland’s media regulator is also after X The current investigations into TikTok and LinkedIn are coming weeks after the same regulator opened an investigation into Elon Musk’s social media platform X, with claims that the company is failing to remove content users report as illegal. According to Virkkunen, the Executive Vice-President of the European Commission for Technological Sovereignty, Security, and Democracy, while the DSA requires platforms to enforce content moderation, it also requires them to have effective internal complaint-handling systems, where users have the right to appeal content moderation decisions. “While automated moderation is allowed, online platforms must be transparent about its use and accuracy,” Virkkunen added . Investigations by Coimisiún na Meán seek to determine if X’s internal complaint handling system is up to par with the DSA’s regulatory standard or is in violation of it. The investigation is backed by various sources, and a nonprofit HateAid, which had previously made legal moves against X on behalf of a researcher who was repeatedly banned from the platform. The investigation was the first under DSA by the Coimisiún na Meán, and violations could result in almost 6% of the company’s turnover. It is also not the first time X has attracted scrutiny from official bodies in Europe. Earlier this year, the platform was investigated by the EU over whether it breached the bloc’s content laws. Experts believe the scrutiny could inspire broader changes in X’s operational and content moderation policies. Meanwhile, the recent investigations are a clear indicator of how far the EU is willing to go when it comes to holding social media platforms accountable and ensuring that user protection measures are robust and enforceable.

Early Indicators Point to Yes (Bitfinex Alpha),https://cryptopotato.com/is-bitcoin-near-a-bottom-early-indicators-point-to-yes-bitfinex-alpha/,"The recent market downtrend has left many bitcoin investors and market enthusiasts in confusion. This is because predictors and a few factors point to a further downtrend, while some claim that the world’s leading crypto sits at a powerful support zone. Obviously, BTC witnessed a significant price recovery last week, jumping by about 15% to surpass $93,000. However, this move was short-lived, as it plunged by $84,000 on Monday amid heavy selling by many holders, setting the new week off to a rough start. Deleveraging and Capitulation Considering factors such as capitulation, deleveraging, and seller exhaustion, the latest Bitfinex Alpha release suggests bitcoin is very close to a bottom, marking its lowest point of this cycle before recovering to hit new highs. One factor hinting at a bottom is extreme deleveraging. Undoubtedly, thousands of speculators and leverage traders have been forcibly thrown out of the market, starting with the October 10 crash that resulted in over $19 billion in liquidations. After this flush of risky traders, the crypto market is expected to become more stable and healthier for investors and long-term holders. This also aligns with a recent prediction from Fundstrats’ Tom Lee, who noted that once the market has completed this flushing, it could hit new highs. In addition to extreme deleveraging, short-term holder capitulation is another factor hinting at a bitcoin bottom. Many retail traders, weekend FOMO buyers, and new and nervous investors have reacted emotionally to the market dip, panic-selling their holdings in shock. Hence, Entity-Adjusted Realised Losses have reached a peak of over $400 million, surpassing losses during previous major market lows. This rate of losses suggests that capitulation is nearing an end, and once selling pressure is no longer there, the bitcoin price stabilizes. Seller Exhaustion A close look at bitcoin’s price chart over the past few days hints at seller exhaustion, as it is filled with many small candlesticks, suggesting that panic and fear have almost burned out, and selling pressure has reduced. Thus, the conclusion that bitcoin is near a bottom. Meanwhile, some institutional investors have not let the downtrend blur their bullish expectations. This is evident in the massive four-day inflow streak on the U.S.-listed Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The post Is Bitcoin Near a Bottom?

Prosecutors are asking that Tokyo Electron be fined several million dollars for its alleged role in the theft of TSMC’s trade secrets. Taiwanese prosecutors have filed criminal charges against the Taiwan unit of Tokyo Electron (TEL), the Japanese chip equipment supplier. The charges allege that the company had a role in the theft of trade secrets from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). Tokyo Electron’s Taiwan unit sees legal trouble The charges against the department were announced on Tuesday, December 2, 2025, and are being pursued under both Taiwan’s Trade Secrets Act and the powerful National Security Act. This case is the first in which a corporation in Taiwan will be indicted under the National Security Act for the alleged theft of “national core critical technology trade secrets.” The prosecutors are seeking a fine of up to NT$120 million (around $3.8 million) against the Tokyo Electron unit if it is convicted. The main accusation is that the company allegedly failed to prevent the crime. Prosecutors pointed out that Tokyo Electron has internal rules, and still the unit “lacked evidence of concrete preventive or managerial measures” to stop the theft. Therefore, they argue the company must face corporate criminal liability. In August 2025, a former TSMC employee, surname Chen, who later worked for the Tokyo Electron Taiwan unit, and two current TSMC engineers were indicted. Chen is accused of using his connections to convince his former colleagues to share confidential information about TSMC’s 2-nanometer (2nm) chip process technology. The motivation for the theft was reportedly to help Tokyo Electron improve its etching equipment and secure valuable contracts for TSMC’s most advanced manufacturing line. Tokyo Electron has stated it is cooperating with the investigation and also previously denied any organizational involvement in the alleged theft, saying the company does not tolerate staff misconduct. TSMC’s legal battles TSMC has taken steps to protect its intellectual property recently, including filing a lawsuit against its former senior vice president, Wei-Jen Lo, who retired in July 2025 and joined the rival company Intel Corp. as an executive vice president. TSMC’s lawsuit, which was filed in November, alleges that there is a “high probability” that Lo will “use, leak, disclose, deliver, or transfer TSMC’s trade secrets and confidential information to Intel,” violating his non-compete agreement and the Trade Secrets Act. Lo had stated he would join an “academic institution” upon departure, but that turned out to be false. Taiwanese prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation into Lo’s case, seizing computers and other digital evidence from his homes and suggesting he is suspected of violating the National Security Act. Intel’s CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, dismissed the allegations as speculation and stated that Intel “respects intellectual property rights” and has strict policies to prevent the use of third-party confidential information.

This move adds fuel to a bullish XRP price prediction as institutional adoption across the globe seems to be rising rapidly. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) expanded the scope of Ripple’s license to operate in the country as a Major Payment Institution (MPI). This allows the company to “broaden its regulated payment offerings and deliver greater value to customers in Singapore.” Huge news from Singapore: https://t.co/KVxTs7IEKc The @MAS_sg has approved an expanded scope of payment activities for our Major Payment Institution license – enabling us to deliver end-to-end, fully licensed payment services to our customers in the region. — Ripple (@Ripple) December 1, 2025 In a press release published on Monday, Ripple emphasized three benefits of using its payment solution in this country. The most prominent of those is the ability to settle payments almost instantly through the use of RLUSD – the network’s native stablecoin. By securing this expanded license, the demand for RLUSD could skyrocket. Now banks and other financial institutions can tap XRP and RLUSD to settle crypto transfers from apps and similar solutions. XRP Price Prediction: If Support Holds, Big Rally to $3 Level Could be Next XRP has managed to stay above $2 despite yesterday’s strong pullback. Trading volumes jumped to 3% of the token’s circulating supply, reflecting the strength of the buying pressure. Source: TradingView Staying above $2 is critical for XRP’s long-term outlook. The token has dropped below this area multiple times already, but has recovered every time so far. Despite the latest drops, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows that negative momentum is decelerating as a bullish divergence has popped up. If the $2 level holds, a bullish breakout of XRP’s descending channel should confirm a bullish XRP price prediction. Although XRP may not rise by 100x this year, this latest news could help the token recover from its latest drop. Hence, it may still make a new all-time high at least before the year ends. Rising institutional adoption of blockchain-based solutions across the globe seems to be benefiting top crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as well. This project has raised nearly $28 million in its ongoing presale to launch its ambitious Solana-based Bitcoin L2. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) Could Kickstart a New Era for Bitcoin Applications Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is getting ready to launch its Solana-based scaling solution for the Bitcoin blockchain and has raised a significant amount from investors in its ongoing presale. BTC holders will now be able to generate passive income on their investment without leaving the top crypto’s native blockchain. The Hyper Bridge will safely store BTC tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain and mint the corresponding amount on the Hyper L2 to access a suite of powerful decentralized apps. From making payments to earning yield, a whole new universe of possibilities will open up for BTC investors with the launch of this solution. As top wallets and exchanges embrace the L2, the demand for $HYPER could skyrocket. To buy $HYPER before the next price increase, simply head to the official Bitcoin Hyper website and link up a compatible wallet like Best Wallet .

Yesterday, investors had witnessed steep losses as they braced themselves for the possibility that the Federal Reserve would not cut rates next week , with stock markets also suffering falls . However, some analysts still believe that the Fed will deliver a rate cut via its upcoming FOMC meeting, something which could send prices rising again from next week. This will be good for oversold major tokens, but it could also be a major boon for new cryptos, with this article taking a closer look at our best altcoin to buy today, PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) . PEPENODE has been holding its presale over the past few weeks, and its launch could coincide with a big resurgence for the market, helping it to surge when it lists. Best Altcoin to Buy Today – 2 December At last count, PEPENODE has raised more than $2.2 million in its ongoing sale, which has been gaining considerable momentum since November. And that’s because PEPENODE isn’t simply another Pepe-themed meme coin, but also an innovative mining platform that aims to make mining accessible for the average retail investor. The PEPENODE presale is live. Buy Nodes. Build Your Server Room. Combine Nodes For Huge Bonuses. Do it all here https://t.co/d1JAronqiv pic.twitter.com/60uLhEoukP — PEPENODE (@pepenode_io) September 10, 2025 In contrast to traditional Bitcoin mining, which now requires some very expensive machines housed in large facilities, PEPENODE makes mining much easier and cheaper. It enables users to build and operate virtual mining rigs, which they can make larger and more productive by spending PEPENODE tokens on new virtual nodes. By adding more nodes, miners will earn more rewards, which the platform will pay out in external tokens, including Fartcoin and Pepe. Users can also sell off their own nodes to other miners, assuming that they want to cease mining or streamline their own operations. This system introduces a huge incentive to acquire more PEPENODE, creating demand that could push the new token’s price up consistently over the long haul. Demand will also come from staking, with PEPENODE currently providing a yield of 578% APY, making it one of the more rewarding altcoins in the market. PEPENODE Is Launching Soon: Here’s How to Buy Early These features help to explain why PEPENODE’s presale has been gaining steam recently, and why it’s our best altcoin to buy today. It will have a max supply of 210 billion PEPENODE, of which it has allocated 35% to its treasury, 7.5% to node rewards, 15% to marketing and infrastructure, 35% to development, and 7.5% to listings and liquidity. New investors can join its sale by going to the PEPENODE website and connecting a wallet, with the token purchasable using ETH, USDT, BNB, and fiat. Its current price is $0.0011731, although this will rise later today, and will rise every three days until the sale enters its final phase. This means interested buyers should act quickly, so as to lock in the biggest possible gains. PEPENODE is one to watch for 2026, with its unique platform giving it strong prospects for standing out in a sea of pretenders.

The analyst, Don, shared this view on X, stating that XRP’s long-term structure remains constructive even though the asset has declined by roughly 1.4% over the past week and 13.68% over the past month. Market Structure Suggests a Pre-Breakout Phase Don’s analysis centers on a formation visible on XRP’s daily chart. According to him, the asset has been consolidating within a downward-sloping channel, a pattern that historically precedes upward expansions for XRP. This structure began to form after the July peak near $3.67, followed by a sequence of lower highs and lower lows. $XRP easy $4 pic.twitter.com/Z5BV8PN7fW — Don (@DonaldsTrades) December 2, 2025 Although the asset has experienced several moments that appeared to signal a breakdown, such as the August low around $2.72 and a brief liquidity-driven drop to $0.77 on Binance in October, XRP has consistently reclaimed its structure and maintained support along the lower boundary of the channel. The latest rejection at approximately $2.27 pushed XRP lower once again, positioning it for another test of the support zone. Don views this consolidation as part of a typical accumulation cycle. His argument rests on the idea that prolonged compression within a defined range has historically preceded strong momentum shifts for XRP, especially when similar patterns have appeared earlier in the cycle. Insight From Previous Market Behavior A comparable technical setup occurred earlier in the year. Between January and early July, XRP traded within another descending channel after reaching a local high near $3.40. That high followed a significant surge in late 2024, after which the market transitioned into a corrective period. During that earlier consolidation, XRP repeatedly tested the channel boundaries but maintained its overall structure. Once the asset approached the resistance line in early July and stabilized near that area, it staged a notable breakout. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A modest gain on July 9 triggered a rapid upward extension, propelling the price from around $2.31 to $3.67 in a short period. Don believes the present market cycle closely mirrors that earlier movement and could produce a similar reaction once XRP challenges the upper line of the current channel. Analysts Outline Potential Targets Beyond $4 Don considers $4 to be a straightforward and conservative milestone once a breakout occurs. From the current price area around $2.15 , this would reflect an approximate doubling in value. Other analysts share comparable expectations. Anticipates that once XRP exits its consolidation phase, it could advance toward the $4.50 region. A more aggressive projection comes from Egrag Crypto, which argues that a successful breakout may not stall near $4 and could extend toward significantly higher valuations, including levels near $27. The prevailing analysis suggests that XRP continues to form a technical base consistent with historical patterns that have preceded sharp upward movements. While no projection is guaranteed, multiple analysts agree that a breakout from the current channel could place the $4 range within reach. Further price expansion would depend on market conditions, momentum, and whether traders interpret the breakout as a signal for larger accumulation.

This decision follows its mainnet launch just last year, leaving many to wonder about the underlying challenges in this innovative sector. What does this shutdown reveal about the practical hurdles of building decentralized infrastructure? What exactly was the Celestia-based shared sequencer Astria? To understand the significance of this shutdown, we must first grasp what Astria was building. A shared sequencer acts as a neutral, decentralized layer that orders transactions before they are finalized on a blockchain. Astria built this service specifically on top of Celestia, a network designed for data availability. The goal was ambitious: to provide a scalable, trust-minimized sequencing layer that multiple “rollup” blockchains could use, rather than each building their own. This Celestia-based shared sequencer model promised greater efficiency and interoperability for the entire modular blockchain ecosystem. Why did the Astria sequencer cease operations? The official announcement, reported by The Block, did not provide a specific reason for the shutdown. However, the timeline offers crucial clues. The project halted product development and stopped operating its Celestia validator node earlier this year. These were clear warning signs. Potential reasons could include: Technical Complexity: Building robust, decentralized sequencing is a formidable engineering challenge. Economic Viability: The business model for a shared sequencer service might not have proven sustainable. Competitive Landscape: The space for Celestia-based shared sequencer solutions is becoming crowded, with other teams exploring similar concepts. Strategic Pivot: The team may have decided resources were better allocated elsewhere in the rapidly evolving crypto landscape. The lack of detailed communication from the Astria team, both now and during earlier halts, has unfortunately left more questions than answers for its community and observers. What are the implications for modular blockchain development? Astria’s shutdown is a sobering moment, but it is not a verdict on the entire modular thesis. Innovation inherently involves trial and error. This event highlights several key lessons for builders and investors in the space. First, infrastructure projects require immense long-term commitment and capital. Second, clear communication with the community is paramount, especially during difficult decisions. Finally, the failure of one Celestia-based shared sequencer does not invalidate the core need for shared sequencing solutions. Other projects will undoubtedly learn from Astria’s journey. What’s next for shared sequencing and Celestia? The demand for efficient transaction ordering in a multi-rollup world remains strong. Celestia’s data availability layer continues to see significant adoption, proving the foundational value of its technology. The concept of a Celestia-based shared sequencer is still compelling. Therefore, we can expect other teams to continue exploring this architecture, potentially with different technical or economic approaches. Astria’s story serves as a crucial case study in the gritty reality of bringing groundbreaking crypto infrastructure to life. In conclusion, the shutdown of the Astria Celestia-based shared sequencer is a poignant reminder of the high stakes in crypto development. While it marks the end of one project’s journey, it provides invaluable data points for the entire industry. The pursuit of scalable, modular blockchains will continue, forged by both successes and setbacks like this one. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What was Astria? A: Astria was a project building a shared sequencer network, a service to order transactions for multiple blockchains, built using Celestia’s technology. Q: Why did Astria shut down? A: The team did not disclose a specific reason. The shutdown followed earlier pauses in development and node operations, suggesting significant technical or strategic challenges. Q: Does this mean shared sequencers are a bad idea? A: Not necessarily. Astria’s shutdown highlights the implementation challenges, but the core problem of efficient transaction ordering for rollups remains unsolved, so other teams will continue working on it. Q: How does this affect Celestia? A: Celestia is a separate data availability network. While one project using its technology has ended, Celestia itself continues to operate and is adopted by many other projects. Q: Can users who interacted with Astria recover funds? A: Astria was infrastructure, not typically a custodial service for user funds. Users should always ensure their assets are in self-custodied wallets they control, not reliant on any single project’s continued operation. Q: Where can I learn more about shared sequencing? A: To learn more about the latest modular blockchain and shared sequencing trends, explore our article on key developments shaping the future of Ethereum scalability and rollup technology.

Lynch also inquired about the Fed’s role in advancing crypto regulatory requirements, while also highlighting confusion regarding the definition of stablecoins. Lynch confronts Fed on crypto oversight and stablecoin definitions During an oversight hearing , Lynch cited Bowman’s comments at the November Santander International Banking Conference, where she expressed support for banks “[engaging] fully” with digital assets. Bowman clarified that her comments applied broadly to digital assets, rather than specifically to cryptocurrencies. Lynch pressed her on the distinction between digital assets and stablecoins, and the discussion shifted. Bowman replied that Congress, through the GENIUS Act—a law regulating payment stablecoins—has authorised the Fed to develop a framework for digital asset activities. “The GENIUS Act requires us to promulgate regulations to allow these types of activities,” Bowman said. Though the price of several digital assets can be volatile, stablecoins, like those pegged to the US dollar, are generally “stable,” as the name suggests. While there have been some occasions where some coins have depegged from their respective currencies, like the crash of Terra’s algorithmic stablecoin some three years ago, the overwhelming majority of stablecoins do not fluctuate past 1% of their peg. Bowman earlier noted that staff at the Fed should be allowed to hold small “amounts of crypto or other types of digital assets” to grasp better how the technology works. FDIC prepares national stablecoin framework under GENIUS Act Travis Hill, acting chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was also present at Tuesday’s hearing. The government agency is one of many responsible for implementing the GENIUS Act, which US President Donald Trump signed into law in July. According to Hill, the FDIC will propose a stablecoin framework “later this month,” which will include requirements for supervising issuers. In a few weeks, the legislative Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will release its first set of proposed guidelines under the GENIUS Act. This represents a significant step forward for the US in its efforts to establish a legislative framework for stablecoins. According to Hill, the proposal will explain how stablecoin issuers linked to FDIC-insured banks are regulated and monitored nationwide, moving away from the current system of fragmented, state-by-state monitoring. That’s only part of a broader effort by regulators to make clearer how traditional banking authorities monitor digital assets such as stablecoins and tokenized deposits. The FDIC’s plan follows President Donald Trump’s signing of a law in July that, for the first time, establishes national requirements for US stablecoins. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US stablecoins (GENIUS) Act establishes the first government rules for payment stablecoins. It assigns tasks to the FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) to ensure the law is carried out. These agencies recently informed the House Financial Services Committee about their plans. This means that the law would eliminate the need for different state systems and establish a single national standard for issuer licensing and supervision. According to the framework, federal prudential regulators will be responsible for bank-linked issuers; however, states will still be responsible for non-bank businesses unless new rules expand the federal reach. The acting chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation noted that the FDIC will directly oversee the subsidiaries of FDIC-insured banks that want to issue stablecoins. Before a bank’s subsidiary launches a stablecoin, it must submit a formal application. The FDIC will then scrutinize the bank’s business strategies, risk management practices, and compliance procedures. The first rule this month will establish the application framework for issuers connected to banks. A second proposal, scheduled for release early next year, will establish capital, liquidity, and reserve asset norms for payment stablecoin issuers. These will be the main regulatory protections for this group. Get seen where it counts.

55274338,638308,1764720002,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55274338.jpeg,Solana Integration Boosts Kalshi’s Push Into Tokenized Event Contracts and Crypto Liquidity,https://bitcoinist.com/solana-integration-boosts-kalshis-push-tokenized/,"Kalshi has taken a major step in restructuring how prediction markets operate by moving its event contracts onto the Solana blockchain. The transition brings U.S.-regulated prediction markets directly into decentralized finance, positioning the platform to compete more closely with its on-chain rival, Polymarket, while targeting deeper liquidity and broader user access. Prediction Contracts Move On-Chain Kalshi’s event markets now operate as Solana-based SPL tokens rather than entries on a centralized exchange. Through an integration with Solana protocols DFlow and Jupiter, users can trade “yes” and “no” positions via crypto wallets, tap automated liquidity, and settle outcomes through on-chain logic. The shift enables contracts to be traded, borrowed, lent, or used as collateral within DeFi systems. Kalshi is supporting developer participation with a $2 million grants program and a new Builder Codes system that rewards teams for driving trading volume through custom applications. Executives describe tokenization as the platform’s long-term strategy, arguing that on-chain access offers speed, transparency, and programmability while preserving Kalshi’s CFTC-regulated framework. The hybrid model links decentralized liquidity with an off-chain matching engine. Will the Move Capture Liquidity and Challenge Polymarket? Prediction-market activity has surged in 2025, with sector-wide volume nearing $28 billion by late October. November saw Kalshi record $5.8 billion in trading, while Polymarket handled $3.7 billion following rulings that reopened U.S. access. Liqudity has become the core competitive factor. By issuing markets as standard Solana tokens, Kalshi expects automated market makers, trading bots, and cross-protocol liquidity systems to tighten spreads and improve pricing accuracy. Enhanced privacy is another draw, with tokenized markets offering wallet-based trading rather than identity-verified accounts. Industry analysts note that the move puts Kalshi in direct competition with Polymarket’s fully on-chain model. Solana Expands Multi-Chain Prediction Economy Kalshi believes Solana is the first step toward a broader on-chain architecture. The company plans to add EVM-compatible networks and deeper integrations with DeFi protocols to build a multi-chain forecasting ecosystem. Additional partnerships, including earlier collaborations with Zero Hash and stablecoin custody support from Coinbase, reflect an effort to streamline global accessibility. With its valuation recently rising to $11 billion after a major funding round, the company is signaling confidence that tokenized prediction markets will become a standard format for forecasting and derivatives tied to real-world events. As prediction markets evolve toward decentralized models, Kalshi’s Solana rollout marks a turning point in how regulated platforms interact with crypto liquidity and sets the stage for intensified competition across the sector.

The recent drop has pushed investors into defensive mode, with some analysts now openly discussing the possibility of a broader bear market emerging. Selling pressure has intensified across spot and derivatives markets, and volatility continues to rise as traders struggle to identify a reliable support zone. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Largest Hidden-Buying Spike of the Cycle Despite Losing $90K Level A new CryptoQuant report by Darkfost highlights one of the most alarming developments: Ethereum’s open interest on Binance has been steadily collapsing for more than three months. After reaching an all-time high of $12.6 billion on August 22, open interest has now been cut in half. Nearly $6.4 billion in derivative positions have evaporated, bringing ETH’s open interest down to $6.2 billion, a steep 51% decline. While this appears to be an extraordinary contraction, Darkfost notes that open interest has only just slipped below the previous all-time high of $7.7 billion. This underscores how speculative and overstretched the 2025 derivatives market had become — and suggests that Ethereum may be undergoing a much deeper structural reset than most expected. Speculation Unwinds Across Exchanges as Ethereum Enters Deep Reset Phase Darkfost emphasizes that 2025 has been the most speculative phase in Ethereum’s history, fueled by aggressive leverage, rapid inflows, and a market structure that proved far less solid — and far less sustainable — than it appeared during the rally. The collapse in open interest on Binance is only part of the story. The same pattern is unfolding across major derivatives platforms, revealing a broader structural unwind rather than an exchange-specific phenomenon. On Gate.io, ETH open interest has fallen from $5.2 billion to $3.5 billion. On Bybit, the drop is even more severe, plunging from $6.1 billion to $2.3 billion. This synchronized contraction shows how aggressively speculative positions have been flushed out. Meanwhile, the ongoing correction has dragged Ethereum’s price from $4,830 to $2,800, marking a steep 43% decline from the highs. This widespread reduction in leverage suggests the market is undergoing a deeper reset than typical corrections. Investors are not rushing to re-enter positions, especially as liquidations continue to stack up across exchanges. While shrinking open interest weighs on short-term momentum and sentiment, Darkfost notes that such aggressive deleveraging may ultimately help rebuild a healthier market foundation — one capable of supporting a durable bottom for ETH. Related Reading: Massive Ethereum Distribution Continues: Whale Sends Another 5,000 ETH To Binance ETH Loses Key Trend Support as 3-Day Structure Turns Fully Bearish Ethereum’s 3-day chart shows a decisive breakdown in structure, with price now firmly below the 50 SMA, 100 SMA, and 200 SMA for the first time since late 2024. The rejection from the $3,600–$3,800 region triggered a strong impulse to the downside, sending ETH directly through all major moving averages and confirming a shift toward a higher-timeframe downtrend. The current trading zone around $2,800 reflects a critical test of former support, but momentum remains weak. The 50 SMA has now crossed below the 100 SMA, while both are beginning to converge downward toward the 200 SMA — a configuration that typically precedes sustained corrections. Volume has increased on red candles, showing that sellers remain dominant, and there is little evidence of aggressive dip-buying. The most recent candle wick toward $2,700 highlights vulnerability rather than strength, suggesting buyers are hesitant to defend this level with conviction.

From a niche digital experiment, it has developed into a financial market measured in trillions of dollars. Although the industry has faced periods of volatility, many analysts believe global adoption remains in an early phase, leaving room for significant long-term expansion. Long-Term Growth of the Digital Asset Market A review of market data highlights how quickly the crypto economy has expanded. According to TradingView, the global crypto market was valued at only $5.66 billion in early December 2015. Bitcoin represented nearly the entire market at the time, accounting for approximately 99% of total capitalization. The environment today is markedly different. As of now, the total crypto market cap stands at roughly $2.85 trillion. While the sector has declined by about 28% over the past two months, the current valuation still reflects major growth over the past decade. Bitcoin’s share of the market has also fallen to around 59%, reflecting the rise of alternative assets. The increase in market share held by altcoins, including Ethereum, XRP, and others, has reshaped the overall market structure. These assets have continued to attract users and institutional interest, contributing to broader market diversification. A Path Toward a $100 Trillion Crypto Market Several market commentators have presented forecasts suggesting that the crypto sector could expand far beyond current levels. Raoul Pal, founder of Global Macro Investor, proposed that the global crypto market could reach $100 trillion between 2032 and 2034. A similar estimate was shared by Julien Bittel, Global Macro Investor’s Macro Research Head, in mid-2025. A more aggressive projection came from MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor, who argued in a 2021 CNBC interview that Bitcoin alone might eventually reach a valuation near $100 trillion. Although this outlook is widely debated, many analysts believe that even a fraction of this figure would represent large increases relative to today’s market size. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Estimating XRP’s Value in a $100 Trillion Market If the broader market were to expand to $100 trillion, the value of XRP would depend heavily on whether it preserves its current level of market influence. At present, XRP holds a dominance of roughly 4.223%, supported by a market capitalization of approximately $120.34 billion. This is well below its highest recorded dominance of 31% in May 2017, but still notable given the size of today’s market. If the total market capitalization reached $100 trillion and XRP retained its 4.223% share, XRP’s valuation would rise to about $4.233 trillion. With a circulating supply of roughly 60.25 billion tokens, this would correspond to an XRP price of around $70. This projected valuation represents a substantial increase compared to the current trading price of $2. Such a scenario would dramatically reshape the value of mid-sized retail portfolios. Data from the XRP Rich List indicates that nearly 600,000 wallets contain between 1,000 and 5,000 XRP. At present, 5,000 XRP is worth around $10,000. Under a $70 price estimate, that same amount would be valued at approximately $350,000, an increase of about $340,000. The future value of XRP will depend on several interacting factors, including overall crypto-market expansion, sustained demand for efficient settlement networks, and XRP’s ability to preserve or increase its share of the market. If the global crypto market were ever to reach the $100 trillion range, even a stable dominance level could translate into a substantial increase in XRP’s valuation.

Onchain data reveals a new address, suspected to be linked to the cryptocurrency mining entity Bitmine, received a colossal 18,345 ETH—worth approximately $55.25 million—from the institutional custodian BitGo. This Bitmine-linked address transaction immediately raises critical questions about institutional movement and market sentiment in the crypto space. What Does This Massive ETH Transfer to a Bitmine-linked Address Mean? The transaction, first flagged by Onchain Lens, involves the address ‘0xA79d…’ receiving funds directly from BitGo, a trusted name in digital asset security. When such a large sum moves from a regulated custodian to a private address, it signals significant activity. This could point to several scenarios, including strategic treasury management, preparation for staking, or a major capital reallocation by a key industry player. Therefore, analyzing these flows is crucial for understanding underlying market forces. Large transfers often precede notable price movements or signal confidence from major holders. Why Are On-Chain Analysts Watching This Bitmine-linked Address? On-chain transparency allows us to track whale movements in real-time. The link to Bitmine, a known player in crypto mining and infrastructure, adds a layer of context. Here are the key aspects analysts are scrutinizing: Source Credibility: The funds originated from BitGo, a licensed custodian, suggesting this is a legitimate institutional move rather than an exchange withdrawal. Timing and Scale: A $55 million transfer is not routine. It occurs within a specific market context, potentially indicating accumulation or strategic positioning. Destination Behavior: The future activity of this Bitmine-linked address will be telling. Will the ETH be held, staked, or moved to a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol? How Could This Impact Ethereum and Broader Market Sentiment? Transactions of this magnitude can influence market psychology. A withdrawal of this size from a custodian into a private wallet is often interpreted as a long-term holding signal, which can be bullish. It reduces immediately sellable supply on exchanges. However, the true impact depends on the holder’s intent. Moreover, it highlights the growing scale of institutional involvement. When entities move tens of millions effortlessly on-chain, it demonstrates the maturity of Ethereum’s infrastructure for handling serious capital. What Are the Practical Takeaways for Crypto Observers? For investors and enthusiasts, this event is a masterclass in on-chain intelligence. It underscores the importance of monitoring blockchain explorers and understanding transaction narratives. The movement to this Bitmine-linked address isn’t just a number; it’s a story about capital allocation, institutional strategy, and network confidence. Actionable insight: Pay attention to subsequent transactions from this address. Its next move could provide even clearer signals about the holder’s strategy and outlook on Ethereum’s future. Conclusion: A Signal in the Noise The $55.25 million ETH transfer to a suspected Bitmine-linked address is a powerful reminder of the dynamic, transparent nature of blockchain economies. It represents more than wealth transfer; it signifies strategic action by sophisticated players. While the exact purpose remains private, the transaction itself bolsters the narrative of Ethereum as a robust settlement layer for institutional-scale finance. Watching how this story unfolds on-chain will provide valuable clues for the market’s next chapter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is a “Bitmine-linked address”? A: It refers to a blockchain wallet address that on-chain analysts and heuristics suggest is associated with the cryptocurrency mining and infrastructure company Bitmine, based on transaction patterns and sourcing. Q2: Why is a transfer from BitGo significant? A: BitGo is a regulated, institutional-grade custodian. A transfer from them typically indicates action by a serious corporate or institutional entity, not an individual retail trader. Q3: Could this large ETH transfer affect the price? A: Indirectly, yes. Large withdrawals from custodial services to private wallets are often seen as reducing immediate selling pressure on exchanges, which can be a supportive factor for price.

The widely watched Crypto Fear & Greed Index has climbed five points to a score of 28, officially moving the market out of the ‘Extreme Fear’ zone. This shift is a crucial psychological milestone that often precedes changing market dynamics. But what does this mean for your portfolio, and is it time to adjust your strategy? What Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Telling Us Now? Compiled by data provider Alternative.me, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a vital tool for gauging market emotion. It operates on a simple scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents ‘Extreme Fear’ and 100 signifies ‘Extreme Greed.’ A reading of 28, while still in the ‘Fear’ category, marks a clear departure from the depths of pessimism that have characterized recent months. This improvement suggests a thaw in investor anxiety, potentially opening the door for more sustained positive price action. How Is This Critical Index Calculated? Understanding the components behind the Crypto Fear & Greed Index reveals why this move is meaningful. The index isn’t a guess; it’s a data-driven composite of several market factors: Volatility (25%): Measures price swings, with high volatility often associated with fear. Market Volume (25%): Tracks trading activity. Sustained volume on upswings can indicate growing confidence. Social Media (15%): Analyzes the tone and volume of conversations on platforms like Twitter and Reddit. Surveys (15%): Polls market participants for their direct sentiment. Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Shifts can signal risk-on or risk-off behavior. Google Trends (10%): Monitors search interest for cryptocurrency terms. The rise to 28 indicates positive momentum across several of these metrics, providing a more robust signal than price action alone. Why Should You Care About Market Sentiment? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index is more than just a number. It acts as a contrarian indicator at its extremes. Historically, periods of ‘Extreme Fear’ have often presented buying opportunities for long-term investors, while periods of ‘Extreme Greed’ have signaled potential market tops. Moving out of extreme territory suggests the market is finding a healthier equilibrium. However, it’s crucial to remember this is a sentiment tool, not a crystal ball. It should inform your decisions alongside fundamental and technical analysis. Actionable Insights from the Current Reading So, the index is at 28 and rising. What’s a smart investor to do? First, recognize this as a sign of decreasing panic, not a signal for reckless buying. Consider these steps: Review Your Portfolio: Assess if your asset allocation still matches your risk tolerance. Plan Your Entries: If you’ve been waiting for fear to subside to deploy capital, this shift warrants a review of your buy-list. Stay Disciplined: Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out). Use dollar-cost averaging to build positions gradually. Monitor the Trend: Watch if the index continues its climb toward ‘Neutral’ (around 50) or stalls. The key is to use this improving sentiment as context, not as your sole trigger for action. Conclusion: A Sigh of Relief, Not a Victory Lap The rise of the Crypto Fear & Greed Index to 28 is an encouraging development that breaks a prolonged spell of extreme pessimism. It reflects a measurable improvement in market psychology across volatility, volume, and social metrics. For investors, this reduces the emotional weight of ‘extreme fear’ and allows for more rational decision-making. While challenges remain, this shift marks a meaningful step toward a healthier, less panic-driven market environment. The path forward will depend on sustained positive fundamentals, but for now, the market has taken a vital breath of fresh air. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does a Crypto Fear & Greed Index score of 28 mean? A score of 28 places the market in the ‘Fear’ zone, but it represents a move away from the more severe ‘Extreme Fear’ category (0-25). It indicates that investor sentiment is improving, though caution still prevails. How often is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index updated? The index is updated daily, providing a near real-time pulse on market emotion. You can check the current reading on Alternative.me’s website. Is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index a reliable buy/sell signal? It is best used as a contrarian indicator at extreme values (below 10 or above 90). At a moderate score like 28, it’s more useful for confirming a shift in market mood rather than giving a direct trading signal. Does the index apply to all cryptocurrencies or just Bitcoin? While several of its components (like volatility and dominance) are heavily influenced by Bitcoin, the index is designed to reflect sentiment across the broader cryptocurrency market. Can the index predict a bull market? Not directly. A rising index shows improving sentiment, which is a necessary ingredient for a bull market, but not sufficient on its own. Sustained positive fundamentals and adoption are required for a full bull run. Where can I see the historical data for this index? Historical charts and data are available on the Alternative.me website, allowing you to compare current readings to past market cycles.

The protocol announced plans to distribute a staggering 17.13 BTC—valued at approximately $1.578 million—directly to its loyal veYB token holders. This strategic initiative not only shares substantial value but also fundamentally realigns incentives within the YieldBasis ecosystem. What Is the New YieldBasis Fee Distribution Mechanism? The core of this announcement is the introduction of a transparent and direct fee distribution mechanism . Simply put, a portion of the fees generated by the YieldBasis platform will now be systematically collected and distributed to users who lock their YB tokens to receive veYB. This model, often called vote-escrowed, rewards long-term commitment. The first major distribution, sourced from already secured funds, involves over $1.5 million in Bitcoin, demonstrating immediate, tangible value for participants. Why Is This a Game-Changer for veYB Holders? This new system transforms veYB from a simple governance token into a powerful income-generating asset. Holders benefit in two key ways: Direct Profit Sharing: They receive a real share of the protocol’s revenue, paid in high-value assets like Bitcoin. Enhanced Tokenomics: It incentivizes long-term locking, which can reduce circulating supply and promote ecosystem stability. Therefore, this fee distribution mechanism directly ties a user’s reward to the platform’s success, creating a powerful alignment of interests. How Does the $1.5M Bitcoin Distribution Work? The planned distribution of 17.13 BTC is not a future promise but an action on secured capital. YieldBasis has already acquired the Bitcoin, ensuring the funds are ready for distribution. This approach removes uncertainty and builds immense trust. The distribution will be proportional, meaning the amount of Bitcoin each veYB holder receives depends on their share of the total locked value. This fair and automated fee distribution mechanism ensures everyone gets their rightful slice of the $1.5 million pie. What Challenges Could This Model Face? While innovative, this model’s success hinges on the sustained generation of protocol fees. Furthermore, the value of distributed Bitcoin is subject to market volatility. However, by distributing a premier asset like BTC, YieldBasis mitigates some of the risks associated with its own token’s price swings, offering holders a diversified reward. What Are the Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors? For investors and DeFi users, this announcement highlights a critical trend: protocols that share revenue directly with their community are gaining traction. When evaluating similar platforms, look for: Transparency in the fee distribution mechanism . The quality and stability of the assets being distributed. The long-term sustainability of the protocol’s fee generation. YieldBasis’s move sets a compelling precedent, putting substantial capital directly back into the hands of its supporters. A Compelling Summary of the YieldBasis Move YieldBasis has masterfully executed a confidence-boosting strategy. By launching a robust fee distribution mechanism and backing it with an immediate, sizable Bitcoin airdrop, the protocol does more than just announce a feature—it delivers proven value. This action strengthens holder loyalty, attracts new capital seeking yield, and positions YieldBasis as a serious, user-centric player in the competitive DeFi landscape. The message is clear: commit to the ecosystem, and you will be rewarded handsomely. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is veYB? A1: veYB stands for “vote-escrowed YB.” It’s a token you receive when you lock your YB tokens for a set period, granting you governance rights and, now, a share of protocol fees. Q2: How do I qualify for the Bitcoin distribution? A2: You must be a veYB holder at the time of the distribution snapshot. The amount you receive is proportional to your veYB balance relative to the total. Q3: Will there be more distributions after this $1.5M one? A3: Yes, this is the inaugural distribution under the new permanent fee distribution mechanism . Future distributions will depend on ongoing protocol fee revenue. Q4: Is the Bitcoin distribution automatic? A4: Yes, the process is designed to be automatic and trustless for eligible veYB holders, based on the smart contracts governing the system. Q5: What does this mean for the price of YB token? A5: While not a guarantee, the mechanism incentivizes locking YB (reducing sell pressure) and attracts users seeking yield, which can positively influence token economics. Q6: Can I withdraw my locked YB after receiving Bitcoin? A6: Your YB remains locked for the duration you initially chose. Receiving Bitcoin rewards does not change your lock-up period.

The PLUME network announced its launch on Circle’s Arc testnet while simultaneously securing a spot on Coinbase’s listing roadmap. This dual announcement signals growing institutional interest in compliant blockchain solutions for real-world assets. What is Plume Blockchain and Why Does It Matter? Plume represents a specialized blockchain designed specifically for tokenizing real-world assets. Unlike general-purpose chains, Plume focuses on compliance-first infrastructure that bridges traditional finance with decentralized technology. The platform enables assets like real estate, commodities, and intellectual property to exist as digital tokens while maintaining regulatory compliance. The recent developments position Plume at the intersection of two powerful trends: institutional blockchain adoption and the growing RWA market. With traditional financial giants increasingly exploring digital assets, Plume’s compliance-focused approach addresses key concerns around regulation and security. Circle’s Arc Testnet: A Strategic Launchpad for Plume Plume’s launch on Circle’s Arc testnet represents more than just technical integration. Arc serves as Circle’s proprietary Layer 1 network specifically optimized for USDC-based payments and transfers. This specialization makes it an ideal environment for RWA applications that require stable, predictable transaction environments. The Arc network boasts an impressive partner list that includes: Societe Generale – Major European financial institution Visa – Global payments technology company BlackRock – World’s largest asset manager Over 100 additional traditional financial firms This ecosystem provides Plume with immediate access to established financial infrastructure and potential integration points with traditional systems. The testnet phase allows developers to experiment with Plume’s RWA capabilities in a controlled environment before mainnet deployment. Coinbase Roadmap Addition: What It Means for PLUME The simultaneous addition of PLUME to Coinbase’s listing roadmap represents a vote of confidence from one of cryptocurrency’s most influential exchanges. Coinbase’s roadmap typically signals assets under consideration for future listing, though final decisions depend on technical and compliance reviews. This development matters for several reasons: Increased visibility – Coinbase’s 100+ million users gain awareness of Plume Liquidity potential – Future listing could provide significant trading access Credibility boost – Coinbase’s vetting process adds legitimacy Market validation – Signals institutional interest in RWA solutions The dual announcement timing suggests coordinated strategy between Plume’s development team and their institutional partners. Such coordination often indicates well-planned market entry strategies rather than opportunistic developments. The Real-World Assets Revolution: Why Now? Real-world asset tokenization represents one of blockchain’s most promising use cases beyond cryptocurrency trading. By converting physical assets into digital tokens, blockchain enables fractional ownership, increased liquidity, and transparent tracking of asset provenance. Plume’s approach addresses several traditional barriers to RWA adoption: Regulatory compliance built into protocol design Integration with established financial partners Focus on USDC stability for asset pricing Developer-friendly tools for asset issuers The current market environment particularly favors RWA solutions. With increasing institutional adoption and regulatory clarity emerging in key jurisdictions, compliant platforms like Plume stand to benefit from first-mover advantages. Challenges and Considerations for Plume’s Future Despite promising developments, Plume faces several challenges common to RWA platforms. Regulatory landscapes vary significantly across jurisdictions, requiring adaptable compliance frameworks. Technical integration with legacy financial systems presents another hurdle, though partnerships with established firms like those on Arc’s network help address this. Market adoption represents the ultimate test. While institutional interest grows, actual asset tokenization volumes remain modest compared to traditional markets. Plume must demonstrate practical utility beyond theoretical advantages to achieve meaningful scale. Security considerations also remain paramount. Real-world assets involve substantial value, making robust security protocols essential. Plume’s testnet phase provides crucial opportunity to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before mainnet launch. Conclusion: A Transformative Moment for Asset Tokenization Plume’s simultaneous launch on Circle’s Arc testnet and addition to Coinbase’s roadmap signals accelerating institutional adoption of blockchain for real-world assets. These developments position Plume at the forefront of a potentially transformative shift in how traditional assets are owned, traded, and managed. The coming months will prove crucial as Plume moves from testnet to mainnet and potentially to exchange listings. Success could validate the RWA thesis and inspire further innovation at the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology. For investors and developers, Plume represents both opportunity and responsibility. The opportunity lies in participating in early-stage infrastructure for a potentially massive market. The responsibility involves contributing to secure, compliant systems that earn lasting trust from traditional financial participants. Frequently Asked Questions What is Plume blockchain’s main purpose? Plume blockchain specializes in tokenizing real-world assets (RWA) with built-in compliance features. It enables traditional assets like real estate and commodities to exist as digital tokens on a secure, regulated blockchain platform. Why is launching on Circle’s Arc testnet significant? Circle’s Arc network is specifically designed for USDC payments with over 100 traditional financial partners. This gives Plume immediate access to established financial infrastructure and potential integration with major institutions like Visa and BlackRock. Does Coinbase roadmap addition guarantee listing? No, Coinbase roadmap indicates assets under consideration for potential listing. Final decisions depend on technical reviews, compliance checks, and market factors. However, roadmap inclusion signals serious evaluation and potential future listing. What types of real-world assets can Plume tokenize? Plume can potentially tokenize various assets including real estate, commodities, intellectual property, art, and other valuable physical assets. The platform focuses on compliance-friendly tokenization suitable for regulated markets. How does Plume ensure regulatory compliance? Plume builds compliance features directly into its protocol design, working with regulatory frameworks from the ground up. This includes identity verification, transaction monitoring, and integration with existing financial compliance systems. When will Plume launch on mainnet? The testnet phase typically precedes mainnet launch by several months. Exact timing depends on test results, security audits, and development progress. The Arc testnet launch represents a crucial step toward mainnet deployment. Share This Insight Found this analysis valuable?

Ethereum still has trouble closing above the $3,000 mark but is forming some better-looking price action. The story repeats for Solana, but the harshly rejected crypto is showing signs of life, breaking its past week's descending price action and testing the $140 level. By Elior Manier Cryptocurrencies are finally bouncing from their relative lows, with Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) reclaiming the $90,000 level after bottoming near $80,500 on Friday, November 21. Traders are scared, and for good reason: elevated valuations and an ecstatic mood in early autumn had led to extreme positioning, which consequently triggered a cascade of liquidations and stops. The first major crack appeared shortly after Bitcoin reached its new record at $126,400 in mid-October, where a dark weekly closure led to a gigantic flash crash. After that, the recovery was swift but proved temporary, materializing into a consistent, progressive selloff that dragged on all the way to the final week of November. Low volumes are now the norm in this scarred market, but with selling flows largely reducing, some bottoms may have finally formed. The question remains: Are the recent lows dips to buy or traps to avoid? Current Session in Cryptos – Green throughout but some mid-day profit-taking – December 2, 2025 (12:01).

Market sentiment is still weak, but the daily session is a strong one. Ethereum ( ETH-USD ) is now hanging around $3,000 again, and Bitcoin is holding $90,000, recovering even after a terrible monthly open yesterday caused by Strategy's ( MSTR ) investor panic - likely fueled by fears over its collapsing premium and leverage sustainability.

According to Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary, the answer is a resounding ‘no’ for the Bitcoin price . The billionaire investor recently made a bold prediction, stating that even if the Fed holds rates steady in December, it will have little effect on BTC’s trajectory. This perspective clashes with mainstream market expectations, making it a crucial insight for every crypto holder. What Did Kevin O’Leary Actually Say About the Bitcoin Price? Kevin O’Leary, a prominent venture capitalist, shared his analysis with Cointelegraph. He expressed strong doubt that the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its December meeting. More importantly, he argued this potential decision is almost irrelevant for Bitcoin. O’Leary believes the Bitcoin price is not poised for a significant drop from current levels, regardless of the Fed’s action. His specific forecast is remarkably narrow. He anticipates BTC will trade within a tight band, fluctuating only plus or minus 5% around the $91,000 mark for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, he sees no major catalysts on the horizon that could trigger a substantial rally, painting a picture of short-term stability. Why Is the Market Betting Against O’Leary’s Fed Call? O’Leary’s skepticism about a December rate cut puts him at odds with the dominant sentiment in traditional finance. The widely followed CME FedWatch Tool tells a different story. Currently, it shows traders are pricing in an overwhelming 89.2% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the December FOMC meeting. This creates a fascinating disconnect. On one side, you have a major investor downplaying the impact of a key macroeconomic event on crypto. On the other, the broader market is almost certain that event will happen. This divergence highlights a critical question for investors: Should Bitcoin be viewed through a traditional macroeconomic lens, or is it developing its own independent market drivers? What Does This Mean for Your Bitcoin Strategy? O’Leary’s comments offer actionable insights beyond mere price prediction. They suggest a shift in how seasoned investors perceive Bitcoin’s relationship with classic financial levers like interest rates. Reduced Macro Sensitivity: The analysis implies Bitcoin’s price may be becoming less reactive to every Fed whisper, signaling potential maturation. Range-Bound Trading: Prepare for possible consolidation. A ±5% range around $91,000 indicates volatility could decrease, favoring different trading strategies. Patience Over Hype: With ‘no major triggers for a significant rally’ cited, it tempers expectations for a sudden, news-driven moonshot and emphasizes long-term fundamentals. Therefore, if O’Leary’s view holds, constantly watching the Fed for Bitcoin price cues might be less productive than focusing on crypto-specific developments like adoption, regulation, and technological upgrades. The Bottom Line: Stability Over Speculation Kevin O’Leary’s forecast delivers a compelling narrative of unexpected stability. While the market hangs on the Fed’s every word, a influential voice argues that the Bitcoin price has entered a phase of resilient consolidation. The stunning part isn’t the lack of a rate cut prediction, but the assertion that it simply doesn’t matter much for Bitcoin right now. This perspective encourages investors to look past daily macroeconomic noise and assess Bitcoin’s value based on its own evolving role in the global financial system. Whether this stability is a calm before a storm or a sign of growing strength remains the ultimate question. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Kevin O’Leary’s main prediction for Bitcoin? A1: O’Leary predicts the Bitcoin price will remain stable, trading in a narrow range of ±5% around $91,000, and sees little impact from whether the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates in December or not. Q2: Does the market agree with O’Leary on a December rate cut? A2: No. While O’Leary is skeptical, the CME FedWatch Tool shows an 89.2% probability that traders are expecting a 25-basis-point rate cut in December. Q3: Why would a Fed rate cut theoretically affect Bitcoin? A3: Traditionally, lower interest rates can weaken the US dollar and make riskier assets like Bitcoin more attractive. However, O’Leary’s view suggests this relationship may be weakening. Q4: What should an investor take away from this analysis? A4: The key takeaway is that Bitcoin may be developing price independence from certain macroeconomic events, suggesting investors should also focus on crypto-specific fundamentals like adoption and regulation. Q5: Is O’Leary bullish or bearish on Bitcoin? A5: His comments suggest a neutral to cautiously stable outlook in the short term. He is not predicting a crash but also sees no immediate catalyst for a major rally. Found this analysis of Bitcoin price dynamics insightful?

Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has emerged as a significant player in the rapidly growing list of cryptocurrencies under $1 because of its early adoption, rapidly growing base of loyal followers, and strong performance in its current presale. Although it costs merely $0.035, MUTM is increasingly emerging as the best crypto to invest in, as identified by analysts, in the list of cryptocurrencies that could potentially reach $1 in the next market boom based on its strong DeFi model based on lending, borrowing, and interest-bearing tokens. Early presale performance in MUTM has already raised close to $19.05 million, with Phase 6 nearing expiry because of support from close to 18,270 buyers in advance of the forthcoming V1 rollout of Mutuum Finance. In comparison, many current big players such as Cardano (ADA) face challenges in both speed and structure, thereby making early-stage performance and utility-centric design in Mutuum Finance particularly appealing to buyers looking at cryptos that offer high-end returns. This makes MUTM the next crypto to hit $1 for those aiming for maximum early gains. Cardano Strongly Resisted at Support Levels as Bulls Ready to Make Breakthrough towards $0.50 Cardano (ADA) is consolidating around $0.40 with strength, as buyers are able to mark out the latest strong level of support in the chart, setting the stage to form the bull base that will carry the price towards $0.50, assuming market sentiment stays positive and the selling pressure dissipates. Although there is such positive news in the ADA market, many individual investors are looking at other promising projects such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM), the best crypto to invest in right now. MUTM Presale Spark Record Interest Mutuum Finance (MUTM) seems to be rapidly rising in the list of DeFi projects in 2025. With presale phase 6 costing $0.035, this final stage offers early buyers the chance to invest after which phase 7 raises the cost to $0.04. Services such as direct Credit & Debit Card purchases are now enabled in the platform, reducing any customary barrier to investing that new or experienced buyers alike face in accessing such technologies. Mutuum Finance offers twin lending, which has attracted increased investor attention due to its scalable nature and potentially high-growth prospects in the crypto market. The liquidity pool allows for smooth connectivity between lenders and borrowers, hence attractive yields and optimal resource use. Over $19.05 million in funds has already been raised from in excess of 18,270 participants in the current presale, thus showing signs of widespread interest in the development of the platform. MUTM stands out as the best crypto to invest in that offers actual utility, benefits, and innovation in the DeFi market. Investors eyeing under-$1 projects with high potential are now watching MUTM as the next crypto to hit $1. Transparency and sustainability are at the core of MUTM’s presale process. From the total 4 billion tokens, 1.82 billion tokens (45.5%) are allocated in the presale distribution, and in excess of 795 million tokens have already been sold. With card purchases having been incorporated, there has been easier accessibility of the tokens to all manner of investors, regardless of whether they are experienced or not. It is in Q4 of 2025 that MUTM has emerged as the most promising crypto initiative and the best crypto to invest in for early-stage exposure. Roadmap Progress Mutuum Finance is at the moment in Phase 2: Building Mutuum, which concentrates on technology development. It covers the final coding of smart contracts, internal testing, front-end & back-end DApp development, and the addition of sophisticated functionalities & risk management modules. The following phase 3: Finalizing Mutuum Finance will comprise Sepolia Testnet beta releases and security audit work in order to ensure the readiness of the Mutuum Finance DeFi platform towards the V1 mainnet network launch in Sepolia. All these combined aspects ensure that the MUTM network creates a scalable DeFi ecosystem. At the current price of $0.035, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) appears to be an emerging favorite in the list of cryptos that are likely to follow through at $1 in the future. Their phase 6 presale campaign is nearing completion, having raised $19.05M from over 18,270+ buyers. It is building a DeFi ecosystem where users can lend, borrow, and stake tokens after the development phase, giving it actual usability compared to slower movers such as Cardano (ADA). For phase 7, the price will go up to $0.04, further cementing MUTM as the best crypto to invest in and the next crypto to hit $1 for ambitious investors.

How Will Bitcoin Perform In December? Sharing a year-to-date chart on X, trader Daan Crypto Trades highlighted a recurring pattern in 2025: Bitcoin often sets its monthly extreme early. “We know by now that the first move does often create the monthly high or low within the first ~12 days,” he wrote. “This happens about 80% of the months.” His chart marks how February’s low, March’s high, April’s low, May’s low, July’s inflection, and the key October and November pivots all occurred within that window, with June and August flagged as exceptions. December, so far, is conforming in form if not yet in outcome. “Price has taken a quick dive straight from the candle open so far in December, leaving no wick above either,” Daan noted. “This doesn’t make for the strongest high.” That kind of immediate one-sided move, he argues, is often revisited: “Good to watch closely in the 1–2 weeks ahead. Often these instant moves from the open, do end getting retested. October was a good example of that recently.” Related Reading: $56,000 Bitcoin Bottom? Burniske Thinks The Market Still Has To Break Zooming in, Daan’s second chart sets out the key levels. After bottoming near $80,714 on November 21, Bitcoin staged roughly a +15% relief rally into a thick prior support-turned-resistance zone in the low-$93,000s. That first test failed, with price rejected and rolling back over. “BTC rejecting from the previous support & resistance area,” he wrote. “Not something you want to see as a bull. Price saw a decent +15% relief rally but has lost steam again after a week already.” On that same chart he plots a short-term Fibonacci retracement from the $93,175 local high down to the $80,714 low. The 0.786 retracement level sits around $83,381, close to spot at the time of posting. “It is early in the week/month,” he added, “and we do often see sharp moves straight from that new monthly candle. These often aren’t the strongest highs/lows set straight at the start of a new month. So good to watch in the days ahead. (You guys also know I love my .786 fib retests so watching closely around this area).” That leaves a clear tactical map: immediate downside levels around the 0.786 retrace and the prior low, with upside conviction only returning if price can re-enter and reclaim the mid-to-high-$80,000s former support zone. A separate post from Daan situates this setup within December’s broader historical profile. Sharing a Coinglass table of Bitcoin’s monthly returns from 2013 onward, he described December as “pretty mixed but [one that] has seen some big outliers with a lot of volatility.” Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Largest Hidden-Buying Spike of the Cycle Despite Losing $90K Level The data support that: past Decembers range from large gains above 30–40% to deep drawdowns exceeding -30%. The average December return sits in modest positive territory (+4.75%), while the median is slightly negative (-3.22%), underscoring that there is no simple “Santa rally” effect; instead, dispersion and volatility dominate. For Daan, part of that behaviour is structural. “Don’t be surprised if you see some weird flows at the end and start of the year,” he warned. “Generally this is a period where large holders/funds and such rebalance their books. We might also see the effect of tax loss harvesting at some point.” Those portfolio adjustments and tax-driven trades can magnify moves in both directions, particularly in an asset that still trades with pockets of thin liquidity. His practical takeaway is deliberately conservative: “Good to just be allocated in a way that feels comfortable for you. Whatever the end of 2025 and start of 2026 will bring.” At press time, BTC traded at $87,323.

55274308,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=225685,1764723612,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Crucial Shift: Altcoin Season Index Plummets to 20, Signaling Bitcoin Dominance",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/altcoin-season-index-falls-bitcoin-dominance/,"BitcoinWorld Crucial Shift: Altcoin Season Index Plummets to 20, Signaling Bitcoin Dominance Has the altcoin rally run out of steam? A key market indicator just flashed a significant warning. The widely watched Altcoin Season Index has plunged five points to a score of just 20, its lowest level in recent memory. This sharp decline suggests a powerful shift in investor sentiment is underway, with capital potentially flowing back toward the original cryptocurrency. For traders and long-term holders alike, understanding this metric is critical for navigating the volatile crypto landscape. What Does the Falling Altcoin Season Index Actually Mean? First, let’s break down what this index measures. Created by CoinMarketCap, the Altcoin Season Index tracks the performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies (excluding stablecoins and wrapped tokens) against Bitcoin over a 90-day window. The core question it answers is simple: are alternative cryptocurrencies, or ‘altcoins,’ outperforming the market leader? The index operates on a clear threshold. When 75% of these top altcoins beat Bitcoin’s returns over three months, an “altcoin season” is declared, and the index score moves closer to 100. Conversely, a score like 20 indicates the opposite—a strong “Bitcoin season” where BTC is leading the pack. This recent five-point drop is a clear signal that Bitcoin’s dominance is intensifying. Why Is Bitcoin Outperforming Altcoins Right Now? Several factors could be driving this shift. Market cycles often see capital rotate between Bitcoin and altcoins. After a period of altcoin speculation, investors frequently seek the perceived safety and liquidity of Bitcoin, especially during times of broader market uncertainty. Consider these potential drivers behind the low Altcoin Season Index : Risk-Off Sentiment: Investors may be moving to Bitcoin as a less volatile store of value within the crypto ecosystem. Macroeconomic Pressures: Interest rate fears or inflation data can dampen appetite for speculative altcoin bets. Cycle Maturation: Historical patterns show altcoin seasons often follow major Bitcoin rallies, and we may be in a consolidation phase. Liquidity Preference: In tighter markets, liquidity flows to the largest, most-traded asset first. How Should You Interpret This Index for Your Portfolio? While a low Altcoin Season Index suggests caution for altcoin investments, it’s not a sell-everything signal. Instead, view it as a crucial dashboard gauge for market structure. A reading of 20 tells you the current wind is blowing strongly in Bitcoin’s favor. This might be a time to reassess your allocation, ensuring your portfolio isn’t overexposed to high-risk altcoins that could underperform if the trend continues. However, remember that this is a lagging indicator based on 90-day performance. A sudden surge in altcoin prices could reverse the trend quickly. Therefore, use it for context, not as a standalone trading trigger. The key is to combine this data with other on-chain metrics and fundamental research. The Bottom Line: Navigating the Current Crypto Climate The dramatic fall in the Altcoin Season Index to 20 is a stark reminder of Bitcoin’s enduring dominance. It highlights a market choosing relative stability over high-risk, high-reward altcoin plays for now. For savvy investors, this period can be an opportunity to accumulate strong fundamental projects at lower prices or to strengthen a core Bitcoin position. The crypto market is cyclical, and today’s Bitcoin season will eventually give way to the next altcoin rally. Your strategy should be ready for both. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Is a score of 20 on the Altcoin Season Index bad for crypto? A: Not necessarily “bad,” but it indicates a specific market phase. It means Bitcoin is significantly outperforming most altcoins, which is a normal part of market cycles. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins when this index is low? A: A reactive sell-off is rarely a good strategy. Use the index as one of many tools. Consider rebalancing or focusing on altcoins with strong fundamentals that may be undervalued during this phase. Q: How often is the Altcoin Season Index updated? A> The index is typically updated daily, tracking the rolling 90-day performance of the top 100 cryptocurrencies against Bitcoin. Q: What score indicates a true “Altcoin Season”? A> A true altcoin season is officially declared when the index score surpasses 75. This means more than 75% of the top altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin over the prior quarter. Q: Can Bitcoin and altcoins rise at the same time? A> Absolutely. A rising Altcoin Season Index doesn’t mean Bitcoin is falling. It means altcoins are rising faster . Both asset classes can appreciate simultaneously in a bull market.

55274340,638192,1764723637,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55274340.jpeg,Old Bitcoin Moves Spike: 3–5 Year Dormant Coins Wake Up Again,https://bitcoinist.com/old-bitcoin-moves-3-5-year-dormant-coins-wake-up/,"Bitcoin has fallen back below the $90,000 level after another wave of selling pressure and leveraged long liquidations, signaling that the market remains firmly on the defensive. Each attempt to stabilize has failed, with sellers quickly overwhelming buyers and forcing price into lower ranges. Fear and uncertainty continue to dominate sentiment, and traders increasingly prepare for the possibility of a deeper continuation of the downtrend as volatility accelerates. Amid this weakness, a new signal has started to attract the attention of analysts. According to Maartunn, one of the market’s most respected on-chain researchers, old coins are waking up again. Dormant Bitcoin—specifically coins held for 3 to 5 years—has begun to move on-chain in noticeable spikes. Historically, this type of activity often reflects structural shifts in holder behavior, appearing during periods of stress, capitulation, or preparation for major market pivots. While the direction of these moves is not always immediately clear, rising activity among long-dormant coins adds another layer of complexity to an already fragile market. As Bitcoin continues to struggle below $90K, the behavior of these older coins could help determine whether the current decline deepens—or sets the stage for a larger transition ahead. Old Coins Start Moving as Macro Fear Collides With Policy Shifts Maartunn highlights a notable rise in activity from 3–5 year-old Bitcoin, a cohort that typically remains dormant unless underlying conditions begin to shift. The Spent Output Age Bands show a sharp increase, jumping from 2,030 BTC earlier today to 3,475 BTC now. These spikes rarely happen randomly. Maartunn believes that “something’s stirring beneath the surface,” suggesting that long-term holders may be reacting to mounting market stress—or positioning ahead of a potential macro inflection. This awakening of older coins comes at a moment filled with conflicting signals. Fear around Tether’s reserves has resurfaced, sparking concerns over liquidity stability across exchanges. At the same time, renewed headlines about a supposed China Bitcoin ban have circulated again, despite offering no new policy information. These narratives have added yet another layer of anxiety to an already fragile market. Yet the macro backdrop also contains reasons for cautious optimism. The Federal Reserve is expected to bring its quantitative tightening (QT) program to an end, and markets are increasingly pricing in a potential interest rate cut this December. Such shifts historically improve liquidity conditions and support risk assets. As long-term coins begin to move and macro forces pull in opposite directions, Bitcoin enters a complex environment—one that could precede either deeper volatility or the early stages of a larger transition. Bitcoin Struggles to Recover as Daily Trend Remains Firmly Bearish Bitcoin’s 1-day chart continues to reveal a market trapped in a strong downtrend, with price failing to reclaim the key moving averages that define higher-timeframe momentum. After breaking down from the $115,000 region, BTC plunged directly through the 50 SMA, 100 SMA, and 200 SMA, creating a steep momentum shift that sellers still control. The current price action around $86,000–$88,000 shows hesitation and a lack of follow-through from bulls, even after several attempts to rebound. The 50 and 100 SMAs both slope sharply downward, confirming a bearish trend structure. Meanwhile, the 200 SMA has flattened and now sits far above price, highlighting just how aggressive and extended the selloff has been. BTC continues to print lower highs and lower lows, a clear signal that the market has not yet found a stable bottom. Volume spikes on major red candles suggest a mix of forced liquidations and panic-driven exits, while green candles remain smaller and less convincing. The lack of strong buy volume shows that investors remain cautious despite the magnitude of the correction. If Bitcoin fails to break back above $92,000–$95,000, the market risks another leg lower. The next major supports sit between $80,000 and $78,000, levels that align with previous consolidation zones. For now, the bears still control the daily trend.

The Kyobo Life Insurance initiative could pave the way for the entire sector. What Are the Challenges and Opportunities? While the vision is compelling, the path has hurdles. Regulatory clarity, especially in South Korea’s evolving digital asset landscape, remains paramount. Furthermore, integrating legacy systems with new blockchain networks presents significant technical challenges that the Arc testnet is designed to uncover. However, the opportunities are transformative. Imagine a world where an insurance payout is triggered automatically by a verifiable event and settled instantly via stablecoin, anywhere in the world. This pilot by Kyobo Life Insurance on Circle’s platform is a crucial first step toward that reality. It builds trust and provides real-world data for regulators and other institutions watching closely. A Compelling Summary of a Financial Crossroads The decision by Kyobo Life Insurance to join Circle’s Arc testnet is a landmark moment. It transcends a simple technology trial; it’s a declaration that forward-thinking institutions are actively preparing for a digital-first financial ecosystem. The success of this Kyobo Life Insurance Arc testnet exploration could accelerate the adoption of stablecoins in mainstream finance, making processes faster, cheaper, and more transparent for millions of customers. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is the Arc testnet? The Arc testnet is a sandbox environment created by Circle where institutions can experiment with stablecoin and blockchain infrastructure without using real funds or affecting live systems. Why would an insurance company use stablecoins? Insurance companies handle vast sums of money in premiums and payouts. Stablecoins offer the potential for near-instant, global, and low-cost settlement of these transactions compared to traditional banking systems. Is Kyobo Life Insurance launching a cryptocurrency? No. The current involvement is strictly a technical feasibility study on Circle’s infrastructure. They are testing the use of existing stablecoins like USDC, not creating a new token. What are the benefits for policyholders? In the long term, policyholders could benefit from faster claim settlements, potentially lower premiums due to operational efficiencies, and access to new, more flexible insurance products. How does this relate to USDC? Circle is the issuer of USDC. The Arc network is built to support the compliant and efficient movement of USDC and other digital dollars. Kyobo’s test likely involves transacting with USDC on this new network. Is this a common trend? While other financial institutions are exploring blockchain, a major life insurer publicly joining a stablecoin testnet is a pioneering and significant step, setting a precedent for the industry.

In a significant move, the Aave community is now actively debating a proposal to streamline its operations by potentially terminating its Aave multichain services on less profitable networks. This discussion marks a pivotal moment, highlighting a mature shift towards sustainability and efficient resource allocation within one of crypto’s leading lending protocols. What Are the Proposed Changes to Aave Multichain Services? According to a report from The Block, the proposal suggests a clear, revenue-focused strategy. It aims to end support for blockchain networks that generate low annual revenue for the protocol. Networks specifically mentioned include zkSync, Metis, and Soneium. The plan sets a firm benchmark: only networks contributing at least $2 million in annual revenue would continue to receive support. This temperature check, a preliminary discussion phase, has already seen overwhelming consensus, receiving 100% approval in a recent Snapshot vote. Why Is the Aave Community Considering This Move? This potential pivot reflects a broader trend in DeFi towards operational efficiency and treasury management. Maintaining Aave multichain services across numerous networks isn’t free; it involves ongoing development, security audits, and community management costs. The core rationale is straightforward: resources should flow to where they create the most value for the Aave ecosystem and its token holders. Focus on Sustainability: Prioritizing high-revenue networks ensures the protocol’s long-term financial health. Reduced Complexity: Streamlining operations can minimize security risks and development overhead. Enhanced User Experience: Concentrating liquidity and attention on core networks can improve service quality for the majority of users. What Does This Mean for the Future of DeFi? The Aave community’s discussion is a bellwether for the entire decentralized finance sector. After years of aggressive multichain expansion, protocols are now making calculated decisions about where to deploy capital and effort. This isn’t necessarily a retreat but a strategic consolidation. It signals that the era of ‘deploy everywhere’ is giving way to a more nuanced ‘deploy where it matters’ approach. For users on affected chains, liquidity may become less accessible, potentially pushing activity towards the protocol’s stronger, more profitable markets. What Are the Potential Challenges of This Strategy? While the logic is sound, this strategy isn’t without its hurdles. Abandoning networks could be perceived as contradicting DeFi’s permissionless and accessible ethos. Furthermore, it might stifle innovation on newer, emerging chains that have yet to reach the $2 million revenue threshold. The community must carefully weigh these factors against the clear financial benefits. The final decision will set a powerful precedent for how major DeFi protocols balance idealism with pragmatic business sense. Conclusion: A Mature Step for Aave and DeFi The debate over Aave multichain services represents a coming-of-age moment for decentralized governance. It moves beyond technical deployment to grapple with real-world economics and strategic prioritization. By openly discussing profitability, the Aave community is demonstrating a sophisticated, responsible approach to managing a leading financial protocol. This focus on sustainability, rather than sheer growth, could ultimately make the entire ecosystem more resilient and attractive to institutional participants. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Which Aave multichain services are proposed to be shut down? A: The proposal specifically mentions ending support on the zkSync, Metis, and Soneium networks due to their low annual revenue generation for the protocol. Q: Has the decision to shut down these services been finalized? A> No, it has not. The proposal is currently in a ‘temperature check’ or preliminary discussion phase. While a Snapshot vote showed 100% approval, this is a non-binding signal to gauge community sentiment before any on-chain governance vote. Q: What is the revenue threshold for a network to keep Aave services? A: The proposal sets a benchmark of $2 million in annual revenue. Networks generating less than this amount would be candidates for service termination under the current plan. Q: Will this affect the price of the AAVE token? A: While not directly stated, the market often views strategic moves towards profitability and efficiency positively. A more sustainable protocol with better-managed resources could be seen as a bullish long-term signal for the AAVE token. Q: Can users on affected chains still access their funds? A> Yes. If services are terminated, it would typically involve a graceful wind-down process. Users would be given ample notice and clear instructions to withdraw their funds from the protocol on that specific chain before support ends. Q: Does this mean Aave is giving up on its multichain strategy? A> Not at all. This is a refinement, not an abandonment. Aave will continue to operate on major, profitable chains like Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. The strategy shifts from being everywhere to being strategically everywhere.

For the first time ever, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) recorded more trading activity for ETH futures than for BTC. This milestone signals a profound change in how major financial players view the second-largest cryptocurrency. Let’s explore what this means for Ethereum’s future and the broader crypto landscape. What Does This Surge in Ethereum Futures Trading Volume Mean? The CME is a titan of traditional finance. When its Ethereum futures trading volume eclipses Bitcoin’s, it’s not a minor blip. This development, first reported by Markets.com, represents a clear vote of confidence from institutional investors. These are the hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations that move markets. Their growing preference for Ethereum contracts suggests a strategic pivot. They are likely positioning for what analysts see as an imminent uptrend for ETH. This volume milestone follows a similar precedent set in July. At that time, Ethereum’s futures open interest—the total number of outstanding contracts—also surpassed Bitcoin’s on the CME. Therefore, this isn’t an isolated event. It’s part of a consistent trend of growing institutional engagement with Ethereum’s derivatives market. Why Are Institutions Betting on Ethereum Now? Several powerful factors are driving this institutional frenzy. First, the long-awaited Ethereum 2.0 upgrade has successfully transitioned the network to a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This change addresses critical issues like high energy consumption and scalability. Consequently, it makes Ethereum a more sustainable and efficient platform for large-scale adoption. Second, Ethereum’s core utility in decentralized finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) provides a fundamental use case that extends beyond digital gold. Institutions see value in a blockchain that powers a vast ecosystem of applications. Key drivers include: Network Utility: Ethereum is the foundational layer for thousands of dApps. Regulatory Clarity: Growing discussion of ETH as a commodity, not a security. Staking Yields: The merge allows ETH holders to earn rewards, appealing to yield-seeking capital. Upcoming Upgrades: Continued development (like proto-danksharding) promises lower fees and higher throughput. How Could This Impact Ethereum’s Price and Market Position? Increased Ethereum futures trading volume from institutions typically leads to greater market liquidity and stability. However, it also introduces new dynamics. Large futures positions can increase short-term volatility around contract expiry dates, known as ‘witching hours’. More importantly, sustained high volume validates Ethereum’s maturity as an asset class. It attracts more traditional finance products, like Ethereum-based ETFs, which would funnel even more capital into the ecosystem. This creates a positive feedback loop: more products bring more investors, which in turn justifies further product development. The result could be a significant re-rating of ETH’s value relative to other crypto assets. What Are the Challenges and Risks to Consider? While this milestone is bullish, savvy investors must remain cautious. The derivatives market itself can be a double-edged sword. High leverage used in futures trading can amplify price swings in both directions. A sudden market downturn could trigger a cascade of liquidations, leading to a sharp, exaggerated price drop. Furthermore, Ethereum still faces technical hurdles. Network congestion and high gas fees during peak demand periods remain a concern. The success of future scalability solutions is not guaranteed. Therefore, while institutional interest is a powerful tailwind, it does not eliminate Ethereum’s inherent execution risks. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto Markets The day Ethereum futures trading volume outpaced Bitcoin on the CME marks a historic inflection point. It underscores a market narrative that is gradually shifting from ‘digital gold’ to ‘programmable money and digital infrastructure.’ For investors, this signals that institutional capital is beginning to appreciate Ethereum’s unique value proposition beyond mere store of value. This milestone is a potent indicator of shifting tides, suggesting that Ethereum’s journey is entering a new, more mature phase defined by utility and widespread financial adoption. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is the CME and why is it important? A: The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) is one of the world’s largest and most regulated financial derivatives exchanges. When it lists a crypto futures product, it signals legitimacy and provides a trusted venue for large institutions to gain exposure. Q: Does high futures volume guarantee an Ethereum price increase? A> Not necessarily. High volume shows strong interest and liquidity, which is generally positive. However, the price direction depends on whether the volume is primarily from buyers (longs) or sellers (shorts). The current analysis suggests it is bullish, but it’s not a guarantee. Q: How is futures trading volume different from open interest? A: Trading volume measures the total number of contracts traded in a period (a flow). Open interest measures the total number of active, unsettled contracts at a point in time (a stock). High volume with rising open interest often confirms a strong trend. Q: Should retail investors change their strategy based on this news? A> This news reinforces Ethereum’s growing institutional adoption, which is a key long-term fundamental. Retail investors should consider it within their overall research and risk tolerance, not as a sole reason to buy or sell. Q: Could Bitcoin futures volume reclaim the lead? A> Absolutely. Crypto markets are highly competitive. While this is a significant milestone for Ethereum, Bitcoin remains the dominant crypto asset. Market leadership in derivatives can shift based on news, macroeconomic conditions, and technological developments for both networks.

According to Bullock, the bank is prepared to act if the increase begins again. The Governor’s remarks suggest that officials might consider implementing stricter policies again. Following concerns raised about the central bank’s move, Bullock shared a statement dated Wednesday, December 3, noting that if consumer prices continue to escalate gradually, which will be revealed in the next couple of months, it will imply that demand pressures remain high. She made this argument during a parliamentary hearing in Canberra. Sources commented on the argument, highlighting that these results could impact future monetary policy decisions. Respondingly, Bullock acknowledged that as they await inflation to decline, they are fully knowledgeable about the likelihood that inflation pressures may be increasing. If this occurs, the governor assured that the board would take the necessary action. Bullock raises concerns about inflation In reaction to Bullock’s remarks , traders decided to adjust their forecasts for a surge in the RBA rate to August next year. This new prediction suggests a 50% chance of the increase occurring, differing from their estimate made in November. Moreover, recently released reports have noted that three-year government bond yields, which are sensitive to policy changes, have risen slightly. Bullock’s statements come just before the a nnouncement of third-quarter gross domestic product data, which is expected to show that the economy grew by 0.7% compared to the previous quarter. This growth will mark the fastest expansion since late 2022. On the other hand, the sources mentioned that the RBA’s monetary policy board will hold a crucial meeting next week. During this meeting, analysts expect the officials to maintain interest rates unchanged at 3.6%. When reporters reached out to Bullock to comment on the country’s economic progress, the governor stated that it is currently difficult to determine whether the economy is performing better than anticipated. However, she expressed her belief that the output gap has been filled. This meant that an unexpected rise in demand could swiftly result in price hikes. “If we are already balanced and demand rises more sharply than we thought, it could create some upward inflation pressure,” Bullock explained. Regarding the RBA’s decision on interest rates, economists shared different viewpoints. Several of them believe that another rate cut will occur next year, while some anticipate that the central bank will maintain its rates unchanged. Others speculate about a rate hike in the near future, aligning their viewpoint with that of the market. The central bank’s decision on interest rates raises debates among individuals Reports from reliable sources indicate that the RBA has lowered its key interest rate three times since February of this year. These reductions have lowered this rate to its lowest point since April 2023. The bank also adopted a data-driven approach after inflation for the third quarter exceeded its target range of 2-3%. It happened despite the job market remaining competitive. Even with this finding, recent data demonstrates that the economy is displaying signs of strength. According to the released information, home prices continued to rise in November, business investments proved better than anticipated for the three months ended in September, and household spending has remained strong.

This substantial creation of new stablecoins immediately raises questions about market dynamics and future price action. For anyone tracking digital asset liquidity, understanding why such a large amount of USDC was minted is crucial. What Does It Mean When USDC Is Minted? When we say 250 million USDC was minted, we refer to the creation of new USDC stablecoin tokens. Circle, the company behind USDC, generates these tokens in response to demand. Essentially, someone deposited $250 million worth of assets (typically U.S. dollars) into Circle’s reserves, and in return, they received newly created USDC tokens on the blockchain. This process directly increases the total supply of USDC in circulation. This event is significant for several reasons. First, it indicates strong institutional or whale-level interest in acquiring stablecoin liquidity. Second, such a large mint often precedes major moves in the cryptocurrency markets, as entities prepare capital for trading, lending, or providing liquidity on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms. Why Would Someone Mint 250 Million USDC? The minting of 250 million USDC doesn’t happen without purpose. Large players, often called “whales” in crypto parlance, typically initiate such transactions for specific strategic reasons. Let’s explore the most common motivations behind this whale-sized move. Market Preparation: Entities may mint USDC to have ready capital for purchasing other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, especially if they anticipate a price surge. DeFi Operations: The funds could be destined for decentralized finance protocols to earn yield through lending, liquidity provision, or staking. Institutional Requirements: Financial institutions or trading firms often need large stablecoin positions to facilitate settlements, margin requirements, or client services. Liquidity Management: Exchanges or payment processors might mint USDC to ensure they have sufficient stablecoin liquidity to meet user withdrawal demands. While we don’t know the exact identity behind this particular 250 million USDC minted transaction, the scale suggests institutional rather than retail involvement. The timing of such mints can sometimes correlate with broader market movements, making them valuable indicators for attentive investors. How Does a Large USDC Mint Affect Crypto Markets? The injection of 250 million USDC into the ecosystem has tangible effects on market dynamics. Stablecoins like USDC serve as the primary on-ramps and off-ramps between traditional finance and cryptocurrencies. Therefore, a significant mint influences several areas. Firstly, it increases overall market liquidity. More USDC in circulation means more capital is available for trading across various cryptocurrency pairs. This can lead to reduced slippage on large orders and potentially more stable prices. Secondly, it signals confidence in the stablecoin ecosystem. A mint of this magnitude demonstrates that large players trust the USDC system enough to lock substantial fiat equivalents within it. However, it’s important to maintain perspective. While 250 million USDC minted is a notable event, USDC’s total market capitalization is in the tens of billions. This mint represents a percentage increase rather than a market-altering flood of new capital. The real impact depends on how quickly this newly minted USDC enters active circulation through trading or DeFi protocols. What Should Crypto Investors Watch Next? For investors and traders, the key question is: what happens after 250 million USDC is minted? Monitoring where this capital flows provides valuable insights. Watch for large stablecoin transfers to centralized exchanges, which often precede buying pressure. Alternatively, track deposits into major DeFi lending platforms or liquidity pools, which indicate a yield-seeking strategy rather than immediate speculation. Remember, not every large mint leads to dramatic price action. Sometimes it represents routine treasury management or the prefunding of known obligations. The crucial insight comes from combining on-chain data like this mint with other market indicators such as exchange flows, futures market positioning, and broader economic trends. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The report of 250 million USDC minted serves as a powerful reminder of the scale at which institutional players operate in cryptocurrency markets. While the immediate market impact might be subtle, this event underscores the growing maturity of stablecoin infrastructure and its critical role in digital asset liquidity. For savvy observers, such on-chain signals form part of a broader mosaic for understanding market sentiment and potential directional moves. Ultimately, the minting of substantial USDC amounts reflects ongoing confidence in the crypto economy’s plumbing. It shows that major participants continue to utilize blockchain-based dollar equivalents for efficiency and transparency, reinforcing stablecoins’ position at the heart of modern digital finance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What does “minting” mean in cryptocurrency? A: Minting refers to the creation of new tokens on a blockchain. For stablecoins like USDC, minting occurs when a user deposits fiat currency (like U.S. dollars) with the issuing company, which then creates and sends an equivalent amount of stablecoin tokens to the user’s blockchain address. Q: Who can mint USDC? A: Any individual or institution can mint USDC by going through Circle’s approved partners and processes, which involve identity verification and depositing U.S. dollars. The 250 million USDC minted likely involved a large institutional player due to the transaction size. Q: Does minting USDC increase its supply permanently? A: Not necessarily. USDC can also be “burned” or destroyed when users redeem their tokens for U.S. dollars. The total supply fluctuates based on minting and redemption activity. The 250 million USDC minted increases supply unless an equivalent redemption occurs. Q: How is minting different from mining? A: Mining involves validating transactions and securing a proof-of-work blockchain (like Bitcoin) through computational effort, often receiving new coins as a reward. Minting is the direct creation of tokens, typically by a centralized issuer for stablecoins or through pre-defined rules in some decentralized systems. Q: Where can I track USDC minting and burning events? A: Blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based USDC and on-chain analytics platforms such as Whale Alert (which reported this event) track large minting and burning transactions in real-time. Q: Could a large USDC mint indicate market manipulation? A: While possible, a single mint event alone doesn’t indicate manipulation. Large mints are common for institutional operations. Market manipulation would involve a pattern of coordinated minting, trading, and other activities designed to distort prices unfairly.

The pattern remains strong, but the market is signaling that a major move is imminent. Everything now hinges on a single trendline break, one that will determine whether LINK is ready to reverse higher or sink into a deeper correction. B-Wave Extension Back In Focus: Is The Triangle Still Intact? According to crypto analyst More Crypto Online in a recent update on Chainlink, it is crucial to step back and examine the bigger picture of the asset’s price action. The analyst believes the market is likely still extending the yellow B-wave correction. At the moment, the analyst is considering that this B-wave may be unfolding as a complex triangle pattern, as seen in the “yellow scenario.” Related Reading: Chainlink’s Next Major Move Comes After This Range, Analyst Says Despite the triangle hypothesis, the analyst emphasizes that there is currently no evidence that a definitive low has formed. To confirm a structural reversal, LINK requires a clear 1-2 setup to the upside, which would signal the start of a new impulsive trend. As stated in previous updates, a confirmed bottom hinges on a break above the first yellow trendline. The triangle pattern, which typically unfolds as a 5-wave structure (A–B–C–D–E), remains valid for now, without a confirmed low. This pattern suggests that the price will continue to consolidate sideways, trapping both bulls and bears. More Crypto Online defined the critical invalidation point for the primary count. If the price were to break below the Monday, April 4th, low at $10.20, the current triangle microstructure would be entirely invalidated. Meanwhile, the broader B-wave correction would still be theoretically possible, but would likely unfold in a different structural path. Critical Support Cluster: $10.70, $8.94, And $6.90 In Focus More Crypto Online went further to highlight the next crucial support levels if the current triangle structure fails, which are located at $10.70, $8.94, and $6.90. The analyst cautioned that a definitive break below the $6.90 mark would significantly increase the probability of an alternative scenario for Chainlink: the unfolding of a larger degree Wave 4. Related Reading: Chainlink Maintains Its Base, But One Push Could Flip Sentiment Fast For now, the immediate focus is on how the price reacts within the key Fibonacci support zone defined by the boundaries of $6.90 and $10.70. The analyst concluded by stating the necessary condition for a structural low: the earliest sign of a reversal would be a break above the yellow trendline. Until that happens, the trendline continues to act as firm resistance, keeping the local downtrend structurally intact and signaling that caution remains necessary.

However, some analysts have shared that this will not happen in a straight line. But rather, there will be short relief rallies that send the price higher before moving into the next phase of the bear market. One of these analysts is TradingShot, who has shared what they refer to as ‘realistic’ price targets that the Bitcoin price can still hit before slipping fully into the bear market. Bitcoin’s Tendency To Recover TradingShot’s analysis does not go against the idea of a bear market, but rather points to the fact that Bitcoin is yet to enter a new Bull Cycle. The analysis focuses on the sell-offs that the cryptocurrency has suffered since hitting its all-time high, pushing it into a bearish leg. The analyst draws similarities between the current market structure and what was seen in the market decline between January 20 and April 7, showing that they are both part of a “Channel Up” formation. Another interesting fact about the current trend is the fact that, just like the January-April trend, it has also completed a 1-Day MACD Bullish Cross. This was a formation that led to a brief recovery back in March, and the same could be the case this time around. Such a rally, the analyst explains, is known as a counter-trend rally, and another one could be underway. If this is the case, then the Bitcoin price could be gearing up to retest the Lower Highs trendline, putting the contact points at significantly higher price levels than Bitcoin is currently trending at. The Targets That Could Materialize In the event that this Bitcoin price counter-trend rally does play out, TradingShot outlines two major targets that the cryptocurrency could hit. The first of these lies at $95,850 , which coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci level. This level is the rejection point for the April 2025 rally, making it an important play . Above this first target lies the second and final target of $106,450. This target, interestingly, lies outside of the Lower Highs trendline, but remains a viable option. It would occur in a situation where the Bitcoin price makes contact with the 1D MA200. The analyst explains that “This is where the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level is, which was also Target 2 for the April fractal and where the second consolidation took place.”",Bitcoin|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-03 02:00:49

This bold declaration forces investors to confront a critical question about the true value and future of their crypto portfolios. What Did Gary Gensler Actually Say About Crypto? During a recent Bloomberg TV interview, Gary Gensler, the former head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, drew a sharp line in the sand. He acknowledged the public’s global fascination with crypto but urged deep scrutiny. His core argument was that investors must seriously question the fundamental value of any digital asset that isn’t Bitcoin. According to Gensler, the allure of innovation shouldn’t overshadow basic investment principles. Why Are Cryptocurrencies Except Bitcoin Seen as So Risky? Gensler’s warning stems from a regulatory perspective focused on investor protection. From this viewpoint, many altcoins and tokens share characteristics with traditional securities but operate without the same disclosure rules and oversight. This creates a landscape where: Speculation Drives Value: Prices may be fueled more by hype and market sentiment than tangible utility or cash flow. Regulatory Uncertainty Looms: Many projects exist in a legal gray area, facing potential future crackdowns. Centralization Creeps In: Gensler noted that finance naturally trends toward centralization, suggesting the ‘decentralized’ promise of many projects may be fleeting. Is Bitcoin Really the Only Safe Haven? Gensler’s framing positions Bitcoin uniquely, primarily due to its established history, widespread recognition, and its original characterization as a commodity rather than a security. However, it’s crucial to understand that labeling Bitcoin as the exception does not make it ‘safe’ in a traditional sense. It remains a volatile asset. The distinction Gensler makes is about the nature of the risk and the perceived legitimacy of the asset’s foundational premise compared to thousands of other tokens. What Does This Mean for the Future of Crypto Investing? Gensler emphasized that cryptocurrency regulation is not a partisan issue but a matter of protecting the integrity of U.S. capital markets. His comments signal a continued tough regulatory stance. For investors, this translates to a need for heightened due diligence. The era of easy gains may be giving way to a period where understanding a project’s legal standing, utility, and long-term viability is paramount. The message is clear: navigate the world of cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin with extreme caution. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors Today Faced with this stark warning, what should an investor do? First, do not panic-sell based on a single opinion. Instead, use this as a catalyst to audit your portfolio. Ask hard questions about each asset you hold. Does it have clear, long-term utility? What is its regulatory status? Is its community and development team robust? Diversification remains key, but informed diversification is critical. Treat investments in cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin as high-risk venture capital, not stable savings. Gary Gensler’s comments serve as a powerful reality check for the crypto ecosystem. While innovation continues at a breakneck pace, his warning underscores that the market is maturing under the watchful eye of global regulators. The ultimate takeaway is not to abandon altcoins entirely, but to approach them with a sober understanding of the significant risks involved. The future will belong to investors who can separate genuine technological promise from mere speculative noise. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Did Gary Gensler say Bitcoin is a safe investment? A: No. Gensler described all cryptocurrencies except Bitcoin as highly speculative and risky. He did not label Bitcoin as ‘safe.’ He distinguished it based on its different regulatory treatment and perception, but Bitcoin itself remains a volatile asset. Q: Why does Gensler single out Bitcoin? A: Primarily due to its regulatory classification. U.S. authorities, including the SEC under Gensler, have largely treated Bitcoin as a commodity (like gold) rather than a security. This places it under different oversight, typically by the CFTC, and stems from its decentralized creation and operation. Q: Should I sell all my altcoins based on this warning? A: Not necessarily. This is a regulatory opinion and a risk warning, not financial advice. It should prompt you to research your holdings more thoroughly. Assess each project’s fundamentals, team, utility, and regulatory compliance before making decisions. Q: Does this mean all other cryptocurrencies will be banned? A: Unlikely. The goal of regulators like the SEC is typically to bring assets under existing securities frameworks, requiring registration and disclosure. This would change how they operate and are traded, not necessarily ban them outright, though some may fail to comply. Q: How can I identify which cryptocurrencies might be considered securities? A> While the legal tests are complex, key indicators include: a central developing company, an expectation of profit primarily from the efforts of others, and fundraising through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or similar sale. The Howey Test is the legal standard used in the U.S. Found this breakdown of Gensler’s crypto warning helpful? The regulatory landscape is constantly shifting.

This collaboration represents a significant step toward integrating real-time market sentiment into mainstream news programming. But what does this mean for viewers, investors, and the future of financial journalism? What does the Kalshi and CNN partnership mean for news? The core of this agreement centers on data integration. CNN will utilize information from Kalshi’s platform during its news production. This means producers and anchors can reference real-time probabilities on economic events, election outcomes, and policy decisions. Consequently, news segments gain an additional layer of quantitative insight beyond traditional expert commentary. This partnership signals a growing acceptance of prediction markets as tools for gauging public sentiment and forecasting. For CNN, it’s an innovation play to enhance content credibility and engagement. For Kalshi, it’s monumental validation and exposure to millions of viewers. How will prediction markets change financial news coverage? Traditional financial news often relies on retrospective analysis and expert opinions. The integration of Kalshi’s data introduces a forward-looking, crowd-sourced perspective. Imagine a segment on inflation where, alongside economist interviews, a graphic shows the market’s real-time probability of the CPI exceeding a certain threshold. Enhanced Context: Data provides a tangible “wisdom of the crowd” metric. Dynamic Storytelling: News can track how probabilities shift with breaking events. Transparent Forecasting: Moves beyond vague predictions to quantified odds. However, challenges exist. Journalists must clearly explain what prediction market probabilities represent—they are not certainties but aggregated beliefs. The partnership’s success hinges on this educational component. Why is the Kalshi and CNN deal a milestone for prediction markets? Prediction markets have operated in niche financial and tech circles for years. A partnership with a mainstream institution like CNN catapults them into the public eye. This endorsement can drive broader understanding and participation. It demonstrates a shift in how major media entities value alternative data sources. Moreover, it sets a precedent. Other networks may seek similar partnerships, accelerating the adoption of prediction data across media. For the average viewer, it demystifies a complex financial tool, making market mechanics more accessible. What are the actionable insights from this media innovation? This development offers clear takeaways for different audiences. For investors, it highlights the growing influence of alternative data in shaping narratives and potentially moving markets. Watching how CNN utilizes this data can provide early signals on market sentiment toward specific themes. For content creators, it’s a case study in innovation through collaboration. Leveraging specialized platforms can add unique value and differentiate content in a crowded landscape. The key is integration that serves the story, not overwhelms it. In summary, the partnership between Kalshi and CNN is more than a data deal. It’s a pioneering fusion of finance and media that could redefine how we consume news about the economy and future events. By bringing the collective intelligence of prediction markets to prime time, it makes forecasting a participatory, transparent element of public discourse. This collaboration may well be remembered as the moment prediction markets stepped out of the shadows and onto the main stage. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What is Kalshi? Kalshi is a regulated prediction market platform where users can trade on the outcome of future events, from economics to politics, by buying “Yes” or “No” shares. What will CNN do with Kalshi’s data? CNN will incorporate Kalshi’s real-time probability data into its news programming, using it to inform discussions, create graphics, and provide a crowd-sourced perspective on upcoming events. Is this partnership legal? Yes. Kalshi is a CFTC-regulated exchange, making it distinct from unregulated gambling platforms. Its partnership with a major news network underscores its regulatory compliance and legitimacy. How accurate are prediction markets? Prediction markets aggregate information from many participants who have financial incentives to be correct. Historically, they have often been remarkably accurate at forecasting event probabilities, though they are not infallible. Can I trade on Kalshi because of CNN? The partnership does not change who can use Kalshi’s trading platform. You must still be eligible according to Kalshi’s terms, which include being 18+ and a U.S. resident in eligible states. Will this make news more speculative? The intent is to add a data-driven layer to analysis, not speculation. Responsible journalism will involve explaining the data’s meaning and limitations clearly to viewers. Found this insight into the fusion of finance and media fascinating?

This single transaction, worth a quarter of a billion dollars, is more than just a number on a screen. It represents a significant injection of liquidity into the digital asset ecosystem and sparks crucial questions about market dynamics and future trends. Let’s dive into what this event truly means. What Does It Mean When USDC Is Minted? First, let’s break down the basics. When we say USDC was minted , it means the entity behind the stablecoin, Circle, has created new tokens. This process is not done arbitrarily. For every new USDC token entering circulation, an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars (or highly liquid assets) is deposited and held in reserve. Therefore, this 250 million USDC mint event signals that a substantial amount of capital, likely from an institutional player or exchange, has moved into the system to be converted into crypto-ready dollars. Why Would Someone Mint 250 Million USDC? Such a colossal mint typically points to anticipated demand. Think of it as a bank printing more cash because it expects people to make large withdrawals. In the crypto world, this massive USDC minted transaction often precedes major market activity. Here are the most common reasons: Exchange Liquidity: A major cryptocurrency exchange may need to bolster its USDC reserves to facilitate large customer trades, withdrawals, or new trading pairs. Institutional Entry: A hedge fund, trading firm, or corporation could be preparing to execute a large buy order for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other cryptocurrencies, using USDC as the on-ramp. DeFi Preparation: The capital could be destined for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols to be used for lending, yield farming, or providing liquidity in pools that require massive stablecoin deposits. The Ripple Effect: How a Major USDC Mint Impacts the Market This isn’t an event that happens in a vacuum. A 250 million USDC minted announcement acts as a powerful signal. For traders and analysts, it’s a bullish indicator of incoming buying pressure. It suggests that sophisticated entities are positioning themselves with significant capital, often leading to increased market confidence. Moreover, it directly enhances liquidity, making large transactions smoother and potentially reducing price slippage for everyone in the market. Should Retail Investors Be Excited or Cautious? For the everyday crypto holder, this news is generally positive but requires context. The minting itself doesn’t guarantee a price pump, but it highlights robust underlying demand and institutional participation. However, it’s crucial to remember that this capital can also be used for short-selling or market-making. Therefore, while it’s a strong sign of a healthy, active ecosystem, it should be one piece of your market analysis puzzle, not the sole reason for an investment decision. Conclusion: Decoding the Signal in the Noise The report of 250 million USDC minted is a classic example of on-chain data telling a story. It underscores the growing maturity of crypto markets, where significant capital movements are visible and analyzable. This transparency allows all market participants, from whales to retail investors, to better understand the flow of funds. While the exact destination of this capital remains to be seen, its very presence is a testament to the deepening liquidity and institutional intrigue surrounding the digital asset space. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does minting new USDC cause inflation? A: No, unlike printing fiat currency, each USDC is fully backed by cash and cash equivalents held in reserve. Minting new tokens requires depositing an equal dollar value, so it does not dilute the value of existing USDC. Q: Who has the authority to mint USDC? A> Only the issuer, Circle, can mint and burn USDC tokens through its smart contracts, a process triggered by authorized financial partners when dollars are deposited or redeemed. Q: Is a large USDC mint always bullish for Bitcoin? A> Not always, but it often is. It indicates capital preparing to enter the crypto market, which frequently flows into major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the capital could also be used for other purposes like DeFi or trading stablecoin pairs. Q: How can I track mints and burns like this myself? A> You can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan for Ethereum-based USDC or follow social media accounts of tracking services like Whale Alert, which monitor large transactions in real-time. Q: What’s the difference between ‘minting’ and ‘buying’ USDC? A> “Minting” is the creation of new tokens by the issuer. “Buying” is what users do on an exchange—acquiring already-existing USDC from another seller. A large mint often supplies the tokens that are later bought in bulk. Did this breakdown of the major 250 million USDC mint help you understand on-chain signals better?

Why? A wallet address linked to the popular platform Pump.fun has made another massive move. According to on-chain data from EmberCN, the Pump.fun team address deposits another 75 million USDC to the Kraken exchange. This single transaction has sent shockwaves through the market, raising critical questions about intent and market stability. What Do the Latest Pump.fun Team Address Deposits Reveal? This recent transfer is not an isolated event. It is part of a much larger pattern that began on November 15. The latest $75 million deposit brings the total amount moved from this specific address to a staggering 555 million USDC. Each transaction fuels the ongoing narrative of a potential cash-out, a claim the team has consistently denied. However, the sheer scale and frequency of these movements make the situation impossible to ignore for any serious market observer. On-chain analytics provide transparency but not always clarity. We can see the funds moving, but the ultimate purpose remains shrouded in mystery. This ambiguity is a powerful force in crypto markets, where perception often drives price action as much as fundamentals. Why Is This Causing So Much Market Speculation? The core of the speculation hinges on a simple, urgent question: Is this strategic treasury management or a prelude to a sell-off? Let’s break down the key points driving the debate: Scale and Speed: Moving over half a billion dollars in stablecoins to a major exchange in a short period is highly unusual for a project’s operational wallet. Market Impact: Large, concentrated sell orders from such a sum could create significant downward pressure on related assets or the broader market sentiment. Trust and Transparency: Despite denials, the lack of a detailed, proactive explanation from the team allows rumors to flourish, potentially eroding user trust. Therefore, the community is left reading the tea leaves of blockchain data. Each new deposit from the Pump.fun team address acts as a Rorschach test, with bulls and bears seeing very different pictures. What Could This Mean for the Average Crypto Investor? For the everyday investor, these massive movements are a crucial lesson in market dynamics. They highlight the outsized influence that major players, often called ‘whales,’ can have. While you may not control millions, understanding these flows helps you make informed decisions. Here are actionable insights to consider: Monitor Whale Activity: Use on-chain tracking tools to follow large transactions. Sudden inflows to exchanges can sometimes precede increased selling pressure. Diversify Your Holdings: Never over-concentrate in a single asset or project. Market-moving events from one team can have ripple effects. Separate Noise from Signal: Distinguish between confirmed facts (the deposit happened) and speculation (the reason why). Base your strategy on the former. Ultimately, the saga of the Pump.fun team address deposits is a masterclass in how crypto markets process information—or the lack thereof. It underscores the importance of due diligence beyond price charts. Conclusion: Navigating Uncertainty in a Transparent Ledger The blockchain ledger is transparent, but human intention is not. The repeated Pump.fun team address deposits to Kraken present a fascinating puzzle for the crypto ecosystem. While the team denies a cash-out, the market will likely remain skeptical until the capital’s destination or purpose becomes clear. This event reminds us that in the world of digital assets, watching where the money flows is just as important as watching where the prices go. Staying informed and rational is your best defense against market volatility driven by speculation. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Pump.fun? A1: Pump.fun is a platform known for facilitating the launch of new cryptocurrency tokens, often associated with the meme coin and speculative trading sector of the crypto market. Q2: Why is depositing USDC to an exchange significant? A2: Depositing a large sum of a stablecoin like USDC to a major exchange like Kraken is often interpreted as preparation to convert it into fiat currency (like USD or EUR) or to purchase other cryptocurrencies, which can signal selling intent. Q3: Has the Pump.fun team explained these transfers? A3: The team has previously denied that these transfers constitute a “cash-out,” but they have not provided a detailed public explanation for the specific purpose behind moving over $555 million to an exchange. Q4: How can I track these kinds of transactions myself? A4: You can use blockchain explorers and on-chain analytics platforms (like Arkham, Nansen, or Etherscan for Ethereum-based tokens) to track wallet activity by searching for the specific wallet address involved. Q5: Should I be worried about my investments because of this news? A5: It serves as a reminder to practice sound risk management. Avoid overexposure to any single project, conduct your own research, and avoid making impulsive decisions based purely on speculative news. Q6: Could this money be used for something other than cashing out? A6> Potentially, yes. Large exchanges are also used for OTC (over-the-counter) deals, providing liquidity, or securing banking partnerships. However, the pattern and scale have led the community to favor the cash-out theory. Found this breakdown of the Pump.fun team address deposits insightful?

The South Korean crypto exchange has announced a planned, temporary suspension of BABY deposits and withdrawals. This essential maintenance is scheduled to begin at 2:00 a.m. UTC on December 4th. If you use Bithumb for your BABY transactions, here’s everything you need to know to navigate this brief pause smoothly. Why is Bithumb Suspending BABY Transactions? Bithumb is proactively suspending BABY deposits and withdrawals to support a network upgrade for the Babylon project. Think of it like a scheduled power outage for a neighborhood so the utility company can install newer, more robust power lines. This temporary halt ensures the upgrade process happens securely and without any risk to user funds. Therefore, this is a standard operational procedure in the crypto world when a blockchain undergoes significant improvements. What Does This Mean for Your BABY Tokens? It’s crucial to understand the scope of this suspension. The temporary halt applies only to depositing and withdrawing BABY tokens to and from the Bithumb exchange. Trading is Unaffected: You can still buy, sell, and trade BABY tokens against other cryptocurrencies on Bithumb’s internal order book during this period. Your Funds Are Safe: The BABY tokens already in your Bithumb wallet remain secure and under your account ownership. Action Required: If you had plans to move BABY tokens, you must complete your deposit or withdrawal before the 2:00 a.m. UTC deadline on December 4th. Key Timeline and Action Steps for Users Mark your calendar and plan ahead. The suspension for Bithumb BABY deposits withdrawals starts precisely at 2:00 a.m. UTC on Wednesday, December 4th. Bithumb has not specified an end time, which is common. Upgrades can be complex, so exchanges often wait to confirm network stability before reopening services. However, these pauses typically last only a few hours. The best practice is to monitor Bithumb’s official announcement page for the “Service Resumption” notice. How Do Other Crypto Exchanges Handle Upgrades? Bithumb’s approach is standard industry practice. Major global exchanges like Binance and Coinbase regularly announce similar temporary suspensions for specific tokens during wallet maintenance or chain upgrades. This consistent protocol prioritizes fund security above all else. For instance, it prevents transactions from being lost if sent to an old wallet address during the upgrade transition. Consequently, this planned pause by Bithumb demonstrates their commitment to operational security for BABY deposits and withdrawals . Looking Beyond the Pause: What’s Next for BABY? While inconvenient for a short time, network upgrades are ultimately positive. They often introduce new features, enhance security, improve transaction speed, or reduce costs. Once the Bithumb BABY services resume, users should benefit from a more robust and efficient network. It’s a temporary step back for a significant leap forward. Keep an eye on official Babylon project channels after the upgrade to learn about any new functionalities or improvements now available on the mainnet. In summary, Bithumb’s temporary suspension of BABY deposit and withdrawal services is a routine and necessary step for a backend upgrade. Your trading ability and fund security are not compromised. By planning your token movements before the December 4th deadline and patiently waiting for the official resumption notice, you can ensure a seamless experience. This proactive maintenance underscores the evolving and maturing infrastructure of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Can I still trade BABY on Bithumb during the suspension? A: Yes. The suspension only affects moving BABY tokens into or out of your Bithumb wallet. All spot trading pairs for BABY will remain active. Q2: How long will the BABY deposit and withdrawal suspension last? A: Bithumb has not provided a specific end time. The duration depends on the upgrade’s complexity. It could be a few hours. Users should check Bithumb’s official announcements for the service resumption notice. Q3: Are my BABY tokens safe on Bithumb during this time? A: Absolutely. The tokens in your Bithumb wallet are not affected. The suspension is a preventive measure to ensure the upgrade process does not interfere with transaction processing. Q4: What happens if I send BABY to my Bithumb deposit address during the suspension? A: It is highly recommended you do NOT do this. Transactions sent during the suspension may not be credited automatically and could require manual recovery by support, which can be a lengthy process. Always wait for the official “Service Resumed” announcement. Q5: Will other cryptocurrencies on Bithumb be affected? A: No. This suspension is specific only to the Babylon (BABY) token due to its particular network upgrade. All other crypto services on Bithumb will operate normally. Q6: Where can I get official updates on this situation? A: For the most accurate and timely information, always refer to the “Notice” or “Announcement” section on Bithumb’s official website or mobile app. Avoid relying on unofficial social media channels.

If you hold POL or GMT tokens, this announcement directly impacts your trading activities. The Upbit Polygon network suspension represents a proactive measure by the exchange to ensure security during an important blockchain upgrade. Let’s explore what this means for your assets and when normal operations will resume. What Triggered the Upbit Polygon Network Suspension? Upbit made the decision to temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals for cryptocurrencies on the Polygon network due to an upcoming hard fork. A hard fork represents a significant upgrade to a blockchain’s protocol that creates a permanent divergence from the previous version. Exchanges typically pause services during these events to prevent transaction errors and protect user funds. The Upbit Polygon network suspension will begin at 9:00 a.m. UTC on December 9, affecting specific assets until the network upgrade completes successfully. Which Assets Are Affected by This Temporary Halt? The suspension specifically impacts two major cryptocurrencies that utilize the Polygon network: POL – The native token of the Polygon ecosystem GMT – The STEPN governance token During the Upbit Polygon network suspension , users cannot deposit or withdraw these tokens. However, trading of these assets may continue normally on Upbit’s platform depending on market conditions and liquidity. The exchange recommends completing any necessary transfers before the suspension begins to avoid inconvenience. How Does the Polygon Network Hard Fork Impact Users? Polygon’s upcoming hard fork aims to improve network performance, security, or functionality. While technical upgrades benefit the ecosystem long-term, they require temporary service interruptions on exchanges. Upbit’s precautionary measure ensures that: No transactions get lost during the network transition User funds remain secure throughout the process The exchange can properly update its systems to support the new protocol This Upbit Polygon network suspension follows standard industry practice during significant blockchain events. Other exchanges supporting Polygon assets will likely announce similar measures as the hard fork approaches. What Should Upbit Users Do Before December 9? If you regularly transact with POL or GMT tokens, consider these actionable steps: Complete any planned deposits or withdrawals before 9:00 a.m. UTC on December 9 Monitor Upbit’s official announcements for updates on service restoration Check if other exchanges you use will implement similar suspensions Review your trading strategy to account for potential liquidity changes The temporary nature of this Upbit Polygon network suspension means normal operations should resume shortly after the hard fork completes successfully. Upbit typically provides updates through their official website and social media channels. Why This Temporary Suspension Actually Protects Your Assets While service interruptions can be inconvenient, they demonstrate responsible exchange management. Upbit’s decision to implement this Upbit Polygon network suspension prioritizes user security over uninterrupted service. The alternative—continuing operations during a network upgrade—risks transaction failures, double-spending issues, or fund losses. By proactively suspending services, Upbit ensures your POL and GMT tokens remain secure throughout the technical transition.

While temporarily affecting POL and GMT transactions starting December 9, this precaution protects user funds and ensures smooth network transition. Upbit’s transparent communication about the suspension allows users to plan accordingly. Remember that such temporary measures ultimately support the stability and security of the cryptocurrency ecosystem that benefits all participants. Frequently Asked Questions When will the Upbit Polygon network suspension begin? The suspension begins at 9:00 a.m. UTC on December 9, 2023. Which cryptocurrencies are affected by this suspension? The suspension specifically affects POL (Polygon’s native token) and GMT (STEPN governance token) on the Polygon network. Can I still trade POL and GMT on Upbit during the suspension? Trading may continue normally, but deposits and withdrawals for these tokens on the Polygon network will be temporarily unavailable. How long will the Upbit Polygon network suspension last? Upbit hasn’t specified an exact duration, but such suspensions typically last until the hard fork completes successfully and the exchange verifies network stability. Will other exchanges also suspend Polygon network services? Most exchanges implementing similar security measures during network upgrades, so check announcements from other platforms where you hold Polygon-based assets. What happens if I try to deposit POL or GMT during the suspension? Transactions attempted during the suspension period will likely fail or be delayed, so it’s best to wait until Upbit announces service restoration.

According to real-time data from Binance’s USDT market, Bitcoin is currently valued at $92,006.41. This remarkable rally signals a powerful shift in market sentiment and has investors worldwide asking one question: what’s driving this incredible surge? What’s Fueling This Massive BTC Price Rally? The sudden leap in the BTC price above $92,000 isn’t happening in a vacuum. Several key factors are converging to create this bullish momentum. First, increased institutional adoption is providing a solid foundation of demand. Moreover, recent macroeconomic developments, such as shifting monetary policy expectations, are making hard assets like Bitcoin more attractive to traditional investors. Therefore, we are witnessing a classic supply and demand squeeze. With the upcoming Bitcoin halving reducing new supply, steady demand from large buyers is creating upward pressure on the BTC price . This powerful combination is a primary driver behind today’s impressive breakout. Key Levels and Market Sentiment for Bitcoin Breaking the $92,000 level is a significant technical achievement. This price point acted as a strong resistance zone in previous market cycles. Consequently, a sustained move above it often opens the path toward higher targets. Market analysts are now closely watching the following indicators: Trading Volume: A surge in volume confirms the strength of the breakout. On-Chain Data: Metrics like exchange outflows suggest investors are moving BTC into long-term storage. Fear & Greed Index: This gauge of market emotion helps identify if the rally is becoming overextended. Currently, sentiment is optimistic but not yet in the extreme “greed” territory, which suggests there may be room for further BTC price appreciation. What Should Investors Do Now? Seeing the BTC price climb so rapidly can trigger both excitement and anxiety. For long-term holders, this rally validates the “hold” strategy. However, for new investors, the key is to avoid emotional decisions. Consider a disciplined approach like dollar-cost averaging to mitigate timing risk. Always remember that volatility is a core feature of cryptocurrency markets. Furthermore, this is an excellent time to review your portfolio allocation. Ensure your exposure to Bitcoin aligns with your overall risk tolerance and investment goals. Diversification remains a cornerstone of prudent investing, even during a powerful bull run. The Road Ahead for Bitcoin’s Value While celebrating the current BTC price milestone is exciting, the future path will likely include both advances and pullbacks. Key developments to monitor include regulatory clarity from major economies and the continued integration of Bitcoin into traditional finance. Each of these factors will play a crucial role in determining the next major resistance levels for the world’s premier cryptocurrency. In summary, Bitcoin’s surge past $92,000 marks a pivotal moment, driven by institutional demand and favorable macro conditions. This rally demonstrates the growing maturity and resilience of the crypto asset class. For savvy investors, it underscores the importance of a clear strategy and a focus on long-term fundamentals over short-term price noise. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused Bitcoin to rise above $92,000? The rally is driven by a combination of increased institutional buying, positive macroeconomic shifts, and technical breakout momentum following the recent halving event. Is it too late to buy Bitcoin at $92,000? While timing the market is difficult, many investors use strategies like dollar-cost averaging to build a position over time, regardless of short-term price fluctuations. Could the BTC price drop back down? Yes, volatility is inherent to crypto markets. Corrections are normal and healthy within a longer-term uptrend. What is the next major resistance level for Bitcoin? Analysts are now looking toward the $100,000 psychological level as the next significant benchmark, though the path may not be direct.

According to live data from Bitcoin World market monitoring, BTC is now trading firmly at this level on major exchanges like Binance’s USDT market. This Bitcoin price surge isn’t just a number—it’s a powerful signal of renewed bullish momentum and growing market confidence. But what’s fueling this impressive climb, and is this rally built to last? Let’s break down the action. What’s Driving the Current Bitcoin Price Surge? The journey past $93,000 is rarely driven by a single event. Instead, it’s typically the result of several converging factors creating a perfect storm of optimism. First, institutional adoption continues to gain steam, with major financial firms increasing their exposure. Second, macroeconomic conditions, such as concerns about inflation, often push investors toward assets perceived as stores of value. Finally, the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which reduces the rate of new coin creation, historically creates a narrative of scarcity that fuels pre-event rallies. This combination of fundamental and speculative interest is a classic recipe for a significant Bitcoin price surge . Key Takeaways for Investors and Traders For anyone watching the markets, this milestone offers crucial insights. However, navigating such volatility requires a clear strategy. Volatility is Inevitable: Sharp upward moves can be followed by equally sharp corrections. Setting clear entry and exit points is essential. Do Your Own Research (DYOR): Never invest based solely on price hype. Understand the underlying technology and market cycles. Consider Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA): This strategy involves investing a fixed amount regularly, which can smooth out the cost of entry during volatile periods. Remember, while the current Bitcoin price surge is exciting, sustainable growth is built on solid fundamentals, not just speculation. What Does Breaking $93,000 Mean for the Market? Crossing such a substantial price threshold acts as a major psychological boost. It often attracts media attention, drawing new investors into the crypto space. Furthermore, it can positively impact the broader altcoin market, as rising Bitcoin tides tend to lift most boats. This renewed confidence can lead to increased development activity and innovation across the entire blockchain ecosystem. Therefore, this isn’t just a win for Bitcoin holders; it’s a potential catalyst for wider industry growth and legitimacy. Challenges and Considerations Amid the Rally Despite the celebratory mood, it’s wise to acknowledge potential headwinds. Regulatory uncertainty remains a persistent cloud over the crypto landscape in many regions. Additionally, the very factors that drive a Bitcoin price surge —like leveraged trading—can also amplify downturns if sentiment suddenly shifts. The market is also watching energy consumption debates closely, which could influence public and institutional perception. A balanced view considers these challenges alongside the opportunities. Conclusion: A Milestone, Not a Finish Line Bitcoin’s ascent above $93,000 is a definitive milestone that underscores its resilience and growing adoption. This Bitcoin price surge reflects a complex interplay of institutional interest, macroeconomic factors, and market cycle dynamics. For investors, the key is to leverage the momentum with caution, prioritizing education and risk management over impulsive decisions. The path ahead will likely remain volatile, but today’s achievement solidifies Bitcoin’s position at the forefront of the digital asset revolution. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why did Bitcoin suddenly rise above $93,000? A1: The surge is likely due to a combination of factors, including increased institutional buying, positive market sentiment ahead of the halving, and broader macroeconomic trends pushing investors toward alternative assets. Q2: Is it too late to buy Bitcoin now? A2: Cryptocurrency investing always carries risk. While prices are high, strategies like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) can help mitigate the risk of buying at a peak. Always invest only what you can afford to lose. Q3: Will this price surge affect other cryptocurrencies? A3> Often, yes. A strong Bitcoin rally frequently leads to increased capital flowing into the broader crypto market, benefiting major altcoins. This is sometimes referred to as “altcoin season.” Q4: Could the price drop back down just as quickly? A4> Absolutely. Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Significant gains can be followed by sharp corrections, so investors should be prepared for potential downside movement. Q5: Where can I safely track the Bitcoin price? A5> Reputable tracking sites like Bitcoin World, CoinMarketCap, and CoinGecko provide real-time data from multiple exchanges, giving you a reliable view of the market price. Q6: What is the Bitcoin halving and how does it affect price? A6> The halving is a pre-programmed event that cuts the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks in half. It reduces the new supply of Bitcoin, and historically, this scarcity has been a major factor in preceding bull markets. Found this analysis of the Bitcoin price surge helpful?

As artificial intelligence continues to reshape industries, Amazon Web Services has unleashed a wave of innovations that promise to redefine how businesses leverage AI. From autonomous agents that work independently for days to groundbreaking AI chips, this year’s conference sets a new benchmark for enterprise AI capabilities. AWS re:Invent 2025: The AI Agent Revolution Takes Center Stage The opening keynote from AWS CEO Matt Garman set the tone for the entire conference, emphasizing that AI agents represent the “true value” of artificial intelligence investments. “AI assistants are starting to give way to AI agents that can perform tasks and automate on your behalf,” Garman declared during the December 2 keynote. This shift from passive assistants to active agents marks a pivotal moment in enterprise AI adoption, promising tangible business returns that have previously eluded many organizations. Trainium3: AWS’s Powerhouse AI Chip Breakthrough Amazon Web Services unveiled its latest AI training chip, Trainium3, alongside the UltraServer AI system designed to maximize its capabilities. The specifications are impressive: Feature Improvement Performance Gains Up to 4x for training and inference Energy Efficiency 40% reduction in power consumption Future Compatibility Trainium4 in development with Nvidia support This advancement represents Amazon’s commitment to competing in the high-stakes AI chip market while addressing growing concerns about energy consumption in data centers. The announcement that Trainium4 will work with Nvidia’s chips suggests a strategic shift toward interoperability rather than pure competition. Autonomous AI Agents: The Future of Enterprise Productivity The most compelling announcements at AWS re:Invent 2025 centered on what the company calls “Frontier agents” – autonomous AI systems designed to operate with minimal human intervention. Three standout agents include: Kiro Autonomous Agent: This coding assistant learns team workflows and can operate independently for hours or even days, writing and optimizing code based on organizational patterns Security Review Agent: Automates security processes including code reviews and vulnerability assessments DevOps Incident Prevention Agent: Monitors deployment pipelines to prevent incidents when pushing new code live These agents represent a significant evolution from traditional AI tools, moving beyond simple task completion to genuine workflow understanding and autonomous operation. Expanding AgentCore: Building Better AI Agents Amazon Web Services introduced substantial upgrades to its AgentCore AI agent building platform, focusing on three key areas: Policy Management: New Policy features allow developers to set clear boundaries and guidelines for AI agent behavior Memory and Logging: Agents can now remember user preferences and interactions, creating more personalized experiences Evaluation Systems: Thirteen prebuilt evaluation systems help organizations assess agent performance and effectiveness These enhancements address critical concerns about AI agent reliability and control, making them more suitable for enterprise deployment. Nova AI Models: Customization Meets Enterprise Needs The Nova AI model family expanded with four new models, including three text generators and one multimodal model capable of creating both text and images. More importantly, AWS introduced Nova Forge, a service that provides unprecedented flexibility: Access to pre-trained, mid-trained, or post-trained models Ability to fine-tune models with proprietary organizational data Customization options tailored to specific business requirements This approach acknowledges that one-size-fits-all AI solutions often fail to meet enterprise needs, offering instead a framework for building truly customized AI capabilities. Real-World Impact: Lyft’s AI Agent Success Story During AWS re:Invent 2025, Lyft demonstrated the practical benefits of AI agent implementation. Using Anthropic’s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock, Lyft created an AI agent that handles driver and rider inquiries with remarkable efficiency: Metric Improvement Resolution Time 87% reduction in average resolution time Driver Usage 70% increase in AI agent adoption This case study provides concrete evidence that AI agents can deliver measurable business value, addressing skeptics who question the practical applications of advanced AI systems. AI Factories: Bringing AWS AI to Private Data Centers In a move addressing data sovereignty concerns, Amazon announced “AI Factories” – systems that allow corporations and governments to run AWS AI infrastructure in their own data centers. Developed in partnership with Nvidia, these systems offer: Choice between Nvidia GPUs or Amazon’s Trainium3 chips Complete data control and sovereignty Enterprise-grade security and compliance features This initiative recognizes that many organizations, particularly in regulated industries and government sectors, cannot migrate sensitive data to public clouds, regardless of the AI capabilities available. The Enterprise AI Landscape Transformed AWS re:Invent 2025 marks a turning point in enterprise artificial intelligence. The conference announcements collectively address the most significant barriers to AI adoption: control, customization, energy efficiency, and data sovereignty. By focusing on AI agents that can operate autonomously while remaining within organizational boundaries, Amazon Web Services has positioned itself as a leader in practical, business-focused AI implementation. The implications extend beyond technical capabilities to fundamental changes in how organizations approach productivity, security, and innovation. As AI agents become more sophisticated and autonomous, businesses must reconsider workforce structures, operational processes, and competitive strategies. Frequently Asked Questions What are the key AI agent announcements from AWS re:Invent 2025? AWS introduced three “Frontier agents” including Kiro for autonomous coding, security review agents, and DevOps incident prevention agents. These represent a shift from AI assistants to true autonomous agents. How does Trainium3 compare to previous AWS AI chips? Trainium3 offers up to 4x performance improvement for both training and inference while reducing energy consumption by 40%. It represents significant progress in AWS’s custom silicon development. What companies presented AI success stories at the conference? Lyft presented compelling results using AI agents powered by Anthropic’s Claude model via Amazon Bedrock, showing 87% faster resolution times and 70% increased adoption. Who delivered the opening keynote at AWS re:Invent 2025? Matt Garman , CEO of Amazon Web Services, delivered the opening keynote emphasizing the transition from AI assistants to autonomous AI agents. What is the significance of AWS’s partnership with Nvidia? The partnership enables future Trainium4 chips to work with Nvidia technology and supports the AI Factory initiative for private data centers, combining AWS and Nvidia technologies for enterprise customers.

The major exchange Bithumb has announced it will list BOB and TRAC , adding two prominent digital assets to its KRW trading pairs. This strategic move, set for December 3, provides investors with fresh opportunities and underscores Bithumb’s role in shaping market access. Let’s break down what this listing means for traders and the projects involved. What Are the Details of the Bithumb BOB and TRAC Listing? The announcement is precise. Trading for the BOB token is scheduled to commence at 6:00 a.m. UTC on December 3. Following that, trading for OriginTrail (TRAC) will begin at 8:00 a.m. UTC. Both assets will be paired directly with the South Korean Won (KRW), simplifying the process for local investors. This sequential launch allows for focused market attention on each asset. For a platform of Bithumb’s stature, new listings are carefully vetted. The decision to list BOB and TRAC signals a belief in these projects’ utility and community strength. It also enhances liquidity and visibility for both tokens within a key Asian market. Why Is Bithumb Listing These Specific Tokens? Understanding the tokens themselves reveals the logic behind Bithumb’s choice. BOB (Build on Bitcoin) is a token native to the Stacks layer, which brings smart contracts and decentralized applications to the Bitcoin network. Its listing highlights growing interest in Bitcoin’s expanding ecosystem beyond simple store-of-value. OriginTrail (TRAC), on the other hand, powers the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph. This technology is crucial for supply chain transparency and verifying the authenticity of real-world assets. Therefore, Bithumb listing BOB and TRAC diversifies its offerings into both Bitcoin DeFi and enterprise-grade blockchain solutions. BOB (Build on Bitcoin): Connects to Bitcoin’s security and expands its functionality. OriginTrail (TRAC): Focuses on verifiable data and real-world asset tokenization.

The rulemaking package is expected to be submitted to the House Financial Services Committee before the end of December, marking a major step toward implementing the country’s new federal stablecoin framework. FDIC Nears First Draft of GENIUS Act Stablecoin Rules The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act (GENIUS Act) , signed into law in July, created a multi-agency oversight system for payment stablecoins. Under the law, only licensed issuers are allowed to offer stablecoins to U.S. users, with oversight divided between the FDIC, Federal Reserve, Treasury, and other regulators. Hill said the FDIC has been developing application procedures and prudential standards that will apply to stablecoin-issuing subsidiaries of FDIC-supervised institutions. These standards include capital requirements, liquidity expectations, and reserve asset diversification rules designed to ensure issuers can meet redemptions during periods of stress. The agency also expects to release a separate proposal early next year detailing the financial and operational requirements stablecoin issuers must meet once approved. Regulators Outline Broader Digital-Asset Responsibilities Hill noted that the FDIC has taken a cautious but constructive approach toward banks exploring digital-asset services, ensuring activities remain “safe and sound.” Part of the agency’s ongoing work includes responding to recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. One area receiving particular attention is tokenized deposits, digital representations of bank deposits issued on blockchain networks. Hill confirmed that new guidance is being drafted to clarify how these instruments fit within existing banking rules, reflecting growing industry interest in tokenization for payments and settlement. Other regulators are advancing their own responsibilities under the GENIUS Act . Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman stated that the central bank is collaborating with banking agencies to establish capital, liquidity, and diversification standards for stablecoin issuers. Treasury Continues Public Consultation Process The U.S. Department of the Treasury has also played a central role in implementing the GENIUS Act. In September, it released an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) seeking public feedback on its stablecoin oversight approach. The comment period, which ran through early November, invited input from industry participants, academics, and consumer groups. The Treasury stated that the consultation aims to strike a balance between innovation and financial stability concerns. Public submissions will help build the final proposals, which will govern non-bank stablecoin issuers and related digital asset activities.

This consistent positive momentum, culminating in a $58.01 million net inflow on December 2nd, signals a potentially transformative phase for Bitcoin’s integration into mainstream finance. Let’s unpack what this trend means for investors and the broader market. What Does This 5-Day Inflow Streak for US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Mean? The data reveals more than just a good week; it highlights a building trend. Five straight days of positive flows suggest that institutional money is not just testing the waters but establishing a steady presence. This pattern reduces volatility concerns and points toward a more mature, demand-driven market for Bitcoin exposure through regulated vehicles. The focus on US spot Bitcoin ETFs is crucial, as these funds directly hold Bitcoin, creating tangible buy-side pressure on the underlying asset. Breaking Down the Key Players and Flows Not all ETFs performed equally, offering insights into investor preference. According to data from Trader T, the leader was clear. BlackRock’s IBIT dominated with a substantial $119.66 million in net inflows. Fidelity’s FBTC followed with a solid $21.85 million. Bitwise’s BITB also attracted positive flows of $7.44 million. However, Ark Invest’s ARKB experienced significant net outflows of $90.94 million. This divergence shows investors are actively choosing between providers, likely based on factors like fees, brand trust, and liquidity. The overall net positive figure confirms that for the US spot Bitcoin ETFs universe, demand far outweighed the localized selling. Why Is This Sustained Demand So Significant? This isn’t a fleeting spike. A five-day inflow streak for US spot Bitcoin ETFs builds a compelling narrative. First, it demonstrates resilience. Even amid typical market fluctuations, institutional buy-in remained steady. Second, it validates the product structure itself. Financial advisors and larger funds appear increasingly comfortable allocating capital to this new asset class through a familiar, regulated wrapper. This consistent demand acts as a powerful price floor mechanism for Bitcoin. Actionable Insights for Crypto Observers What can you learn from this trend? Monitor the flow data. Sustained inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs are a leading indicator of institutional sentiment. A break in this streak could signal a shift, while its continuation would reinforce bullish fundamentals. Furthermore, watch the market share battle between issuers like BlackRock and Fidelity, as it will shape the competitive landscape and potentially drive down costs for investors. The Bottom Line: A Confidence Vote for Bitcoin’s Future The fifth consecutive day of net inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs is a robust vote of confidence. It moves beyond speculation and points to calculated, ongoing institutional adoption. This trend, led by giants like BlackRock, provides Bitcoin with a new source of structural demand that was absent just a year ago. While daily flows will vary, the establishment of this positive pattern is a fundamental development that every market participant should note. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What are US spot Bitcoin ETFs? A: They are exchange-traded funds approved in the United States that directly hold Bitcoin. This allows investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price through a traditional stock brokerage account. Q: Why are net inflows important? A: Net inflows mean more money is entering the ETF than leaving it. This requires the issuer to buy more Bitcoin, creating direct buy-side pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price. Q: What caused the outflows from Ark’s ARKB? A> Specific reasons can vary, including profit-taking, portfolio rebalancing by large holders, or a shift of assets to competing ETFs with different fee structures or perceived advantages. Q: Is this trend likely to continue? A> While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, a multi-day streak suggests a pattern, not an anomaly. Its continuation depends on broader market sentiment and Bitcoin’s price trajectory. Q: How can I track this data myself? A> Data is compiled by analysts like Trader T and published on various financial and crypto news platforms. Farside Investors is another common source for daily ETF flow information.

The operation took down a key domain, seized servers, and captured $29 million in Bitcoin that investigators say was tied to illicit flows. Related Reading: XRP Is About To Hit A Major Turning Point This Week, Analyst Says Europol And Swiss Authorities Act Based on reports, a joint action by Europol, Swiss, and German authorities took place between November 24 and November 28, 2025. During the operation, three servers located in Switzerland were seized, the domain Cryptomixer.io was disabled, and investigators recovered about 12 terabytes of data. According to officials, the service had been used since 2016 and is linked to roughly €1.3 billion in laundered Bitcoin over that time. The cash figure seized in the takedown was reported at close to $30 million in Bitcoin. How The Service Worked Reports have disclosed that the site operated as a hybrid mixer. That means it accepted funds on the regular web and used techniques to pool, jumble, and redistribute coins so the origin of funds became hard to trace. Criminals allegedly used the service to hide proceeds from activities such as drug sales, ransomware attacks, and fraud, according to investigators. By randomizing amounts and delaying payouts, mixers like this make the usual tracking tools much less effective. What The Seized Data Could Reveal Law enforcement officers say the 12 terabytes of material may hold leads that point to other illegal transfers and the people behind them. The data is now being examined, and it could make it easier to trace how money moved through the service. It is not yet clear whether arrests have been made. Experts warn that even with seized material, tracing every tainted coin will be difficult because of how mixing services scramble transaction records. Related Reading: ‘Saylor Is Finished’ – Peter Schiff Slams Bitcoin Tycoon Over $1.44B Reserve Build-Up Wider Impact On Crypto Crime Investigators argue the takedown is a major blow against online money laundering in Europe. Based on reports, crypto mixers of this size helped mask hundreds of millions, and in some cases billions, of dollars over years. The removal of one large service may slow some criminal flows, but analysts caution that operators and users can migrate to other services or new tools. Criminals often adapt quickly, which means the broader problem may continue unless follow-up actions and legal steps are taken.

In his latest video, he presents a detailed review of the general market environment, explaining why assets such as XRP, Bitcoin , and Ethereum are recovering after a period of volatility. The analyst’s explanation centers on macroeconomic developments and institutional activity that appear to be supporting the current move. Crypto market moving up nicely! Reasons explained… pic.twitter.com/Yyy9hUV5qX — Austin Hilton (@austinahilton) December 2, 2025 Market Conditions Improve After Volatility Hilton noted that multiple major assets posted strong gains. Bitcoin rose more than 6% to reclaim the $90,000 level, and Ethereum jumped over 7% toward $3,000. XRP recorded an increase of nearly 6%, while several mid-cap and smaller assets also saw notable upward movement. According to Hilton, this broad improvement reflects stabilization after the previous day’s turbulence, which was triggered by renewed concerns surrounding the long-standing Japanese yen carry trade. The analyst explained that the situation involves companies and institutions that have spent more than two decades borrowing yen at extremely low interest rates, taking advantage of periods when borrowing costs were effectively zero. With growing expectations of potential interest-rate adjustments in Japan , markets responded with caution. Hilton emphasized that the issue has existed for years. However, the latest gained significant attention across financial and crypto markets, contributing to the temporary downturn before conditions began to settle. Macroeconomic Factors Absorbed by the Market Hilton stated that investors appear to be processing the carry-trade concerns rather than reacting to them in a sustained way. He described the sell-off as a response to initial uncertainty, followed by a rebound once traders understood that the information was already priced in. He added that U.S. stock futures reflected similar stabilization, with indexes such as the Nasdaq and Dow registering gains. This correlation, he said, supports the idea that both crypto and equities are adjusting in tandem as macroeconomic pressures become clearer. The analyst also suggested that the limited downside among major cryptocurrencies backs the sense of temporary volatility rather than deeper structural weakness. Only a few assets showed moderate declines, while the overall market leaned decisively upward. Institutional Activity Adds Support Hilton highlighted an additional development that may be influencing sentiment: Vanguard’s decision to allow retirement accounts to trade crypto-focused ETFs . He described the firm as a major force in traditional finance, particularly in the retirement-fund sector. Because of this reputation, its decision to widen access to crypto-related products could indicate a shift in institutional readiness to engage more directly with the sector. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 According to Hilton, this move likely contributes to the current market strength, as it signals increased acceptance from a major financial institution. He believes this institutional involvement, combined with easing macroeconomic concerns, is helping reinforce the upward movement. A Constructive Move for XRP With XRP participating in the broader recovery, the analyst’s assessment suggests that the asset is benefiting from improving market sentiment, stronger equity performance, and emerging institutional developments. Hilton concluded that, for the moment, the environment looks more positive than the previous trading session. The market appears to be moving forward with renewed stability.

The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) has launched a formal protest against what it calls sensationalist and biased Bitcoin coverage from the ABC. This confrontation highlights a crucial battle for accurate cryptocurrency reporting worldwide. Why Is Accurate Bitcoin Coverage So Important? The ABIB’s complaint centers on a fundamental issue: media portrayal shapes public perception. When a respected public broadcaster like ABC presents Bitcoin coverage that focuses exclusively on criminal use cases, it creates several problems: It ignores Bitcoin’s technological innovation and potential benefits It misleads the public about legitimate cryptocurrency uses It could influence regulatory decisions based on misinformation The industry body argues this particular broadcast failed basic journalistic standards by presenting a one-sided narrative. Instead of balanced reporting, viewers received what amounted to a modern-day moral panic about digital currency. What Exactly Did the ABC Broadcast Get Wrong? According to the ABIB’s detailed complaint, the problematic Bitcoin coverage made several critical errors. First, it allegedly portrayed Bitcoin solely as a money laundering tool without acknowledging its legitimate uses. Second, the language used was unnecessarily sensationalist, designed to provoke fear rather than inform. Third, the program focused narrowly on price volatility and U.S. political connections while ignoring: Bitcoin’s underlying blockchain technology Its growing institutional adoption in Australia Legitimate use cases for everyday Australians This selective reporting creates what media experts call “confirmation bias” – reinforcing existing negative stereotypes while ignoring contradictory evidence. How Does Biased Reporting Affect Crypto Adoption? Poor Bitcoin coverage doesn’t just misinform viewers – it has real-world consequences. When mainstream media presents cryptocurrency exclusively through a criminal lens, several negative outcomes occur: Consumer hesitation : Potential users avoid legitimate cryptocurrency services Regulatory overreach : Policymakers may create restrictive laws based on fear Innovation slowdown Investment diversion : Capital flows to countries with more favorable media environments The ABIB’s protest represents a growing trend of cryptocurrency industries worldwide pushing back against what they see as irresponsible journalism. As digital assets become more mainstream, accurate reporting becomes increasingly crucial. What Should Balanced Bitcoin Coverage Include? Professional journalists covering cryptocurrency should strive for the same balance they apply to other complex topics. Good Bitcoin coverage would include: Both risks AND benefits of cryptocurrency technology Interviews with diverse stakeholders, not just critics Historical context about financial innovation Comparisons to early internet skepticism Australian-specific examples and case studies The ABIB isn’t asking for uncritical praise – they’re requesting fair, balanced reporting that acknowledges Bitcoin’s complexity rather than reducing it to a criminal caricature. What’s Next for Australian Bitcoin Regulation? This media controversy comes at a critical time for Australian cryptocurrency regulation. As policymakers consider new frameworks, balanced Bitcoin coverage becomes essential for informed decision-making. The ABIB’s protest serves as a reminder that media narratives can influence: Parliamentary committee recommendations ASIC enforcement priorities ATO taxation guidelines Consumer protection measures With proper context and accurate information, Australia could develop cryptocurrency regulations that protect consumers while fostering innovation. Sensationalist reporting makes this balanced approach more difficult to achieve. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Crypto Journalism The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body’s protest marks a significant moment in cryptocurrency’s maturation. No longer willing to accept sensationalist portrayals, industry leaders are demanding responsible Bitcoin coverage that reflects technological reality rather than journalistic fantasy. This push for accuracy benefits everyone – from curious consumers to seasoned investors to thoughtful policymakers. As digital assets continue evolving, media organizations face a choice: will they provide balanced reporting that educates the public, or will they default to fear-based narratives that distort reality? The ABIB’s letter to ABC suggests the Australian cryptocurrency community will continue holding media accountable until they choose the former. Frequently Asked Questions What specifically did the ABIB protest about ABC’s Bitcoin coverage? The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body protested that ABC’s broadcast portrayed Bitcoin exclusively as a criminal tool, used solely for money laundering. They criticized the sensationalist language, narrow focus on price volatility, and complete omission of Bitcoin’s technological value and legitimate uses. Why does media portrayal of Bitcoin matter so much? Media portrayal directly influences public perception, consumer adoption, and regulatory decisions. Biased reporting can lead to unnecessary restrictions, consumer fear, and capital flight to countries with more favorable media environments. Has ABC responded to the ABIB’s complaint? As of this writing, ABC has acknowledged receiving the complaint but hasn’t issued a formal public response. The broadcaster typically reviews such complaints through its internal editorial standards process. What constitutes balanced Bitcoin reporting? Balanced reporting includes both risks and benefits, interviews with diverse stakeholders, technological explanations, historical context about financial innovation, and local case studies relevant to the audience. How does this affect ordinary Australians interested in cryptocurrency? Sensationalist reporting may discourage legitimate exploration of cryptocurrency, create unnecessary fear about regulated exchanges, and potentially lead to overly restrictive regulations that limit consumer choice and innovation. Are other countries facing similar media challenges with Bitcoin coverage? Yes, cryptocurrency industries worldwide increasingly push back against sensationalist reporting. Similar controversies have occurred in the United States, United Kingdom, and several European nations as mainstream media grapples with covering complex financial technology.

Data reveals a net outflow of $10.7 million, marking a second straight day of investor withdrawals. This trend raises critical questions about the immediate appetite for these products and what it signals for the broader Ethereum market. Let’s dive into the numbers and unpack the story behind this US spot ETH ETFs activity. What Do the US Spot ETH ETFs Outflow Numbers Really Show? The data from TraderT for December 2nd paints a complex picture. While the headline shows a net withdrawal of $10.69 million from US spot ETH ETFs , the story is in the details. This wasn’t a uniform exit. Instead, it reveals a dramatic divergence in investor sentiment between the major fund providers. Understanding this split is key to gauging market confidence. BlackRock vs. Fidelity: A Tale of Two ETH ETF Strategies The outflow was primarily driven by one giant. BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) experienced a massive single-day withdrawal of $89.45 million. This staggering figure suggests some large investors are taking profits or repositioning shortly after the fund’s launch. However, this loss wasn’t universal across all US spot ETH ETFs . Fidelity’s FETH saw a net inflow of $50.65 million, indicating strong, continued belief from its investor base. Grayscale’s Mini ETH product also attracted $28.11 million in new capital. Therefore, the market is not rejecting Ethereum exposure outright. Instead, money appears to be rotating between different fund structures and managers based on specific factors like fees, liquidity, or brand trust. Why Are Investors Rotating Capital in US Spot ETH ETFs? This early volatility in US spot ETH ETFs is not entirely unexpected. New financial products often see turbulent trading as the market finds its equilibrium. Several factors could be at play: Profit-Taking: Early investors may be cashing out initial gains. Fee Arbitrage: Investors might be moving to lower-cost or more liquid ETF options. Portfolio Rebalancing: Large institutions often adjust holdings at month or quarter-end. Market Sentiment: Broader crypto market movements directly impact ETF flows. The key takeaway is that net outflow for a single day, or even two, does not define the long-term success of these instruments. The sustained inflows into Fidelity and Grayscale show underlying demand remains. What Does This Mean for the Future of Ethereum ETFs? For long-term observers, these flows are a fascinating real-time experiment in crypto asset adoption. The activity in US spot ETH ETFs provides a transparent window into institutional and sophisticated retail moves. While short-term outflows can cause concern, they are a normal part of a new asset’s lifecycle on Wall Street. The more critical metric to watch will be the cumulative net flows over the coming weeks and months as the novelty wears off. In conclusion, the recent $10.7 million net outflow from US spot ETH ETFs highlights the dynamic and sometimes contradictory nature of the crypto investment landscape. BlackRock’s significant withdrawal is counterbalanced by strong inflows elsewhere, proving that investor interest in Ethereum via regulated channels is alive, but selective. The journey for these US spot ETH ETFs is just beginning, and this early chapter of rotation and adjustment is a sign of a healthy, evolving market, not a failing one. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What caused the net outflow in US spot ETH ETFs? The net outflow was primarily caused by a very large $89.45 million withdrawal from BlackRock’s iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA). This was partially offset by inflows into funds from Fidelity and Grayscale. Is this a bad sign for Ethereum? Not necessarily. While a net outflow from ETFs can suggest selling pressure, the concurrent inflows into other funds show demand still exists. It may indicate profit-taking or rotation between funds rather than a loss of faith in Ethereum itself. Should I be worried about my Ethereum ETF investment? Short-term flows are common in new financial products. Focus on the long-term thesis for Ethereum and the convenience of the ETF structure. Daily flow data is more useful for traders than long-term investors. Which Ethereum ETF saw the most inflows? On December 2nd, Fidelity’s Ethereum Fund (FETH) saw the largest net inflow at $50.65 million, followed by Grayscale’s Mini Ethereum Trust at $28.11 million. How often is this flow data updated? Data providers like TraderT typically update ETF flow data daily, based on the previous trading day’s activity. Where can I track US spot ETH ETFs flows myself? You can track this data on financial data platforms like Bloomberg, Reuters, or dedicated crypto analytics websites that report on fund flows.

This single transaction, involving 30,278 ETH, is more than just a number on a screen—it’s a powerful signal interpreted by seasoned market watchers as a vote of confidence in Ethereum’s future. What Does This Major Ethereum Withdrawal Actually Mean? When large amounts of cryptocurrency move off centralized exchanges like Kraken, analysts typically see it as a shift from trading assets to holding them. This specific Ethereum withdrawal suggests the entity behind it is moving ETH into cold storage or a private wallet for safekeeping, a strategy often called ‘HODLing.’ Therefore, this action reduces the immediate selling pressure on the market. It indicates a long-term belief in the asset’s value, which can positively influence overall market sentiment. Why Are “Whale” Movements So Important to Watch? Large holders, often called ‘whales,’ can significantly impact market prices with their trades. Tracking their wallets provides invaluable insights. Here’s what this particular move tells us: Accumulation Phase: Moving funds off an exchange is a classic sign of accumulation, not distribution. Reduced Liquidity: With 30,278 ETH now potentially locked away, the available supply for quick trading on Kraken is lower. Sentiment Indicator: Such a confident move by a known entity can encourage smaller investors to also hold their assets. However, it’s crucial to remember that one transaction does not dictate the entire market’s direction. It is, however, a very strong bullish clue. How Can Everyday Investors Interpret Such News? You don’t need to be a whale to benefit from understanding these signals. For the average investor, news of a massive Ethereum withdrawal serves as an educational case study in on-chain analytics. First, it highlights the transparency of blockchain technology. Anyone can verify the transaction from the wallet address ‘0x52B7’. Second, it underscores a key investment principle: long-term conviction often precedes significant gains. While following whales blindly is not a strategy, recognizing patterns of accumulation can inform your own research and risk assessment. The Bigger Picture: What’s Next for Ethereum? This event fits into a broader narrative for Ethereum. The network continues to see growing institutional interest and fundamental upgrades. A strategic Ethereum withdrawal of this magnitude adds fuel to the thesis that savvy players are positioning themselves for the next phase of growth. It reflects a calculated bet on Ethereum’s utility beyond mere speculation—its role in decentralized finance, NFTs, and the broader Web3 ecosystem. When major players choose to hold rather than sell, it often signals they anticipate higher future demand. Conclusion: A Signal of Strength in a Volatile Market In summary, the $91.1 million Ethereum withdrawal from Kraken by a Bitmine-associated wallet is a noteworthy event that emphasizes holding over short-term trading. It demonstrates how on-chain data provides a real-time pulse on market sentiment. For investors, it’s a reminder of the importance of patience and conviction in the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Why is withdrawing crypto from an exchange considered bullish? A: Withdrawing to a private wallet usually means the holder intends to store the asset long-term, removing it from the immediate ‘for sale’ supply on the exchange, which is a bullish indicator. Q2: Who is Bitmine? A: Bitmine is a known entity in the cryptocurrency mining sector. Their involvement suggests the withdrawal was made by a sophisticated institutional player, not an individual retail trader. Q3: Can this single transaction make Ethereum’s price go up? A> While it creates positive sentiment and reduces sell-side liquidity, one transaction alone rarely moves the market significantly. It is a strong signal within a larger context of market factors. Q4: How can I track large transactions like this one? A: You can use on-chain analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Etherscan, or Nansen. These tools track wallet activity and label known entities, making large movements visible. Q5: Does this mean I should buy Ethereum now? A> This article provides market analysis, not financial advice. Always conduct your own research (DYOR) and consider your financial situation and risk tolerance before making any investment. Q6: What’s the difference between a withdrawal and a transfer? A> A withdrawal specifically refers to moving assets from an exchange platform to an external, user-controlled wallet. A transfer is a broader term for any movement of assets between two wallets. Share Your Thoughts Did this analysis help you understand the impact of major market movements?

The platform will resume these services following the upcoming Ethereum network hard fork, providing much-needed clarity for the community. What Does This Mean for Your UXLINK Withdrawals? Upbit has made a clear commitment to restoring UXLINK withdrawals once the Ethereum network completes its scheduled hard fork. The exchange will reinstate deposit and withdrawal services for all Ethereum-based assets simultaneously, ensuring a coordinated and secure reactivation process. This approach prioritizes network stability and user security above all else. Moreover, Upbit has extended the previously announced withdrawal support period for UXLINK. Originally set to conclude on December 3rd, this extension provides additional flexibility for users planning their transactions around the network upgrade timeline. Why the Ethereum Hard Fork Matters for Your Assets Ethereum network upgrades, commonly called hard forks, represent significant changes to the blockchain’s protocol. These upgrades can introduce new features, improve security, or enhance scalability. However, they also require temporary suspension of transaction services as exchanges and wallet providers update their systems to maintain compatibility. During such network events, exchanges typically: Pause deposits and withdrawals for affected assets Monitor network stability post-upgrade Conduct thorough testing before resuming services Communicate clear timelines to users Upbit’s announcement follows this industry-standard protocol, demonstrating their commitment to operational safety during critical network transitions. Practical Implications for UXLINK Traders If you hold UXLINK on Upbit, this announcement brings welcome certainty. The extension of the withdrawal support period means you have more time to plan your transactions without rushing decisions. This is particularly valuable given the volatility that sometimes accompanies major network upgrades. Remember that while UXLINK withdrawals will resume after the Ethereum hard fork, trading of UXLINK may continue normally on the exchange during this period. Always check Upbit’s official announcements for the most current status updates regarding specific services. Navigating Exchange Announcements with Confidence When exchanges make announcements about service changes, experienced traders know to look for specific information. Upbit’s communication provides several key details that help users make informed decisions: Clear trigger condition: Services resume after Ethereum hard fork completion Extended timeline: Withdrawal support period extended beyond December 3rd Comprehensive approach: All ETH-based assets handled together Proactive communication: Advance notice allows for planning This level of transparency helps build trust between exchanges and their users, especially during periods of network transition. Looking Ahead: What Comes After the Hard Fork? Once the Ethereum network upgrade completes successfully, users can expect Upbit to methodically restore services. The process typically involves several security checks and gradual reactivation to ensure everything functions correctly. While exact timing depends on network stability, Upbit’s announcement provides the framework for what to expect regarding your UXLINK withdrawals . This coordinated approach benefits all users by minimizing disruption while maintaining the highest security standards. The extended support period further demonstrates Upbit’s understanding that users need flexibility when managing their digital assets around significant network events. In conclusion, Upbit’s announcement brings clarity and reassurance to UXLINK holders. The exchange has established a clear path for resuming UXLINK withdrawals following the Ethereum hard fork while providing additional time through extended support. This balanced approach prioritizes both network security and user convenience during an important blockchain transition period. Frequently Asked Questions When exactly will UXLINK withdrawals resume on Upbit? Upbit will resume UXLINK withdrawals once deposit and withdrawal services for all Ethereum network-based assets are reinstated following the upcoming Ethereum hard fork. The exchange hasn’t provided an exact date but will communicate updates as the network upgrade progresses. What happens if I need to withdraw UXLINK before the hard fork? Upbit has extended the previously announced withdrawal support period, which was originally set to end on December 3rd. This extension provides additional time for users to complete withdrawals before the temporary suspension during the hard fork implementation. Will trading of UXLINK be affected during this period? Typically, exchange trading continues normally during network upgrades, while only deposits and withdrawals are temporarily suspended. However, always check Upbit’s official announcements for the most current information about specific service availability. Why do exchanges pause services during hard forks? Exchanges temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals during network upgrades to ensure transaction security and prevent potential issues like chain splits or transaction reversals. This precaution protects user funds during the transition to the upgraded network. How will I know when services have been restored? Upbit will make official announcements through their communication channels when services are fully restored. Users should monitor Upbit’s official website, app notifications, and social media channels for the latest updates. Are other Ethereum-based tokens affected similarly? Yes, Upbit’s announcement indicates that deposit and withdrawal services for all Ethereum network-based assets will be reinstated together following the hard fork, following the same timeline and process as UXLINK.

According to recent blockchain data, an address linked to the project team has deposited tokens worth over $100 million to various exchanges since July. This substantial activity naturally leads investors to wonder about the implications for the token’s future. What Do These PENGU Token Deposits Reveal? Blockchain analytics firm AmberCN reported that the PENGU deployer address has transferred 3.8811 billion PENGU tokens to exchanges. The total value of these transfers reaches approximately $108 million. The pattern shows consistent deposits of around $3 million every few days, with the most recent transaction of 230 million tokens occurring just hours before reports surfaced. In cryptocurrency markets, deposits to exchanges typically signal potential selling activity. When large holders move tokens from private wallets to exchanges, they often prepare to liquidate positions. However, this isn’t always the case—sometimes these movements represent strategic positioning or preparations for liquidity provision. How Might This Affect PENGU Token Investors? The consistent flow of PENGU tokens to exchanges creates several considerations for current and potential investors: Price pressure : Increased selling activity could potentially drive token prices downward if supply outpaces demand Liquidity changes : More tokens on exchanges might improve trading liquidity Investor sentiment : Large team movements often influence market psychology and trading decisions Transparency questions : The community may seek clearer communication about token distribution plans It’s worth noting that project teams sometimes sell tokens to fund development, marketing, or operational expenses. The key question becomes whether these sales are part of a planned, transparent strategy or represent unexpected activity. What Should Crypto Investors Consider Next? When facing significant token movements like these PENGU tokens transfers, experienced cryptocurrency investors typically: Monitor trading volumes and price action closely Look for official communications from the project team Consider the broader market context and sentiment Review their own investment thesis and risk tolerance The cryptocurrency market thrives on transparency and trust. Projects that communicate clearly about token economics and team movements generally maintain stronger community support. As the situation develops, market participants will watch for any statements from the Pudgy Penguins team regarding their token strategy. Conclusion: Navigating Token Movements in Volatile Markets The movement of over $100 million in PENGU tokens highlights the dynamic nature of cryptocurrency markets. While exchange deposits often precede selling, they don’t guarantee price declines. Savvy investors consider multiple factors including project fundamentals, market conditions, and team transparency. The coming weeks will reveal whether these token movements represent routine operations or signal more significant changes for the Pudgy Penguins ecosystem. Frequently Asked Questions Why would the Pudgy Penguins team deposit PENGU tokens to exchanges? Teams typically deposit tokens to exchanges for several reasons: to sell tokens for operational funding, to provide liquidity for trading, or as part of planned token distribution schedules. Without official confirmation, the specific reason remains speculative. Do exchange deposits always mean immediate selling? Not necessarily. While exchange deposits often precede selling, they can also represent preparations for liquidity provision, staking, or other platform integrations. The actual selling activity depends on subsequent trades from the deposited tokens. How can investors track PENGU token movements? Investors can use blockchain explorers like Etherscan to track token movements from known addresses. Analytics platforms and cryptocurrency news services also report on significant transactions involving major tokens. What impact might this have on PENGU token price? Large deposits could create selling pressure if tokens are liquidated, potentially affecting price. However, the actual impact depends on market demand, overall sentiment, and whether the selling occurs gradually or all at once. Has the Pudgy Penguins team commented on these transactions? As of this writing, no official statement has been released regarding these specific token movements. The cryptocurrency community typically looks for such communications following reports of significant address activity. Should investors be concerned about team token movements? Team token movements are common in cryptocurrency projects. While they warrant attention, they don’t automatically signal problems. Investors should consider them alongside other factors like project development, roadmap progress, and market conditions. Found this analysis helpful?

The latest data provides a jaw-dropping answer. According to blockchain analytics firm Glassnode, the current Bitcoin halving cycle has seen an unprecedented influx of capital, fundamentally reshaping the market’s foundation. A colossal $732 billion in new money has flowed into Bitcoin since 2022, painting a picture of a maturing asset class that is attracting serious institutional attention. What Does $732 Billion in New Capital Mean for Bitcoin? This staggering figure represents more than just a price increase. It signifies a profound shift in market structure and participant behavior. Glassnode’s analysis reveals that this massive capital inflow coincides with a significant decrease in market volatility. In fact, the one-year average realized volatility has nearly halved compared to previous cycles. This suggests the market is growing not just in value, but in stability and maturity. Why Is This Halving Cycle Different? The current Bitcoin halving cycle stands apart from its predecessors for several key reasons. The dramatic reduction in volatility is a primary indicator of change. Let’s break down the core factors driving this new era of calm, consistent growth: Institutional Onboarding: Major financial institutions, hedge funds, and publicly traded companies are now major holders, bringing disciplined, long-term capital. Regulatory Clarity: While evolving, frameworks in major economies provide a more predictable environment for large investors. Product Innovation: The advent of spot Bitcoin ETFs and sophisticated financial products has created accessible, regulated pathways for capital. Macro Recognition: Bitcoin is increasingly viewed as a legitimate digital store of value and a potential hedge against inflation. How Does Lower Volatility Benefit the Market? A calmer market is a more attractive market for the very capital driving this growth. High volatility often deters conservative institutional money and complicates long-term business planning. The near 50% drop in realized volatility signals that Bitcoin is shedding its ‘wild west’ image. This newfound stability encourages more strategic investment, corporate treasury allocation, and integration into traditional finance, creating a virtuous cycle of further growth and reduced price swings. What Are the Actionable Insights for Investors? Understanding the dynamics of this Bitcoin halving cycle is crucial for making informed decisions. The data points to a market that is being built on a broader, more resilient base. Therefore, investors should consider a long-term, strategic approach rather than short-term speculation. The increasing institutional participation suggests that Bitcoin’s correlation with traditional risk assets may evolve, impacting portfolio diversification strategies. Monitoring on-chain metrics like realized cap and exchange flows can provide deeper insights than price alone. The Future of Bitcoin: Built on a Broader Base The $732 billion influx is not just fuel for the current cycle; it’s the bedrock for the next. This capital represents a more permanent form of investment, much of which is unlikely to leave quickly. As the market cap grows and volatility subsides, Bitcoin strengthens its case as a mature financial asset. The next phase of the Bitcoin halving cycle will likely be defined by how this institutional framework interacts with the core, scarcity-driven Bitcoin narrative. In conclusion, the story of this halving cycle is one of monumental growth paired with surprising calm. The $732 billion in new capital is a testament to Bitcoin’s accelerating mainstream adoption. While challenges remain, the data clearly indicates a market that is growing up, attracting sophisticated players, and building a more stable future. This transformation from a volatile digital experiment to a cornerstone of modern portfolios is perhaps the most significant trend in finance today. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a Bitcoin halving cycle? A: A Bitcoin halving cycle refers to the approximately four-year period between events where the reward for mining new Bitcoin blocks is cut in half. This programmed scarcity is a core feature of Bitcoin’s monetary policy. Q: Does this $732 billion mean the price will keep rising? A> While massive capital inflow is a powerful bullish signal, it does not guarantee perpetual price increases. Markets are cyclical. However, it does indicate strong underlying demand and a more solid valuation floor. Q: How does lower volatility help Bitcoin? A> Lower volatility makes Bitcoin more attractive to institutional investors, corporations, and everyday users for savings and transactions. It reduces risk and enables more reliable financial planning around the asset. Q: Where is all this new capital coming from? A> The capital is coming from a mix of sources: institutional investments via funds and ETFs, corporate treasury allocations, high-net-worth individuals, and continued adoption by retail investors globally. Q: What is ‘realized volatility’ and why is it important? A> Realized volatility measures the actual price swings of an asset over a specific past period (like one year). A halving of this metric, as reported, shows the market is becoming significantly less erratic, which is a key sign of maturation. Q: Will the next halving have a similar effect? A> While each cycle is unique, the establishment of institutional infrastructure (like ETFs) suggests future cycles may continue to see large-scale capital inflows, though the specific drivers and magnitude may differ.

This urgent announcement follows confirmed security concerns, prompting immediate action from one of Asia’s leading trading platforms. If you hold BOA or are considering investing, understanding this Bithumb investment warning for BOA is absolutely essential for protecting your digital assets. What Triggered the Bithumb Investment Warning for BOA? Bithumb’s official statement reveals that the exchange identified security issues connected to Yearn.finance (YFI) that directly impact BOA tokens. The exchange confirmed these concerns through their security protocols, leading to their decisive action. Consequently, Bithumb has temporarily suspended all deposit and withdrawal services for BOA tokens on their platform. This precautionary measure aims to protect users while the situation undergoes thorough investigation. The timing of this announcement is particularly significant given the increasing regulatory scrutiny on cryptocurrency exchanges worldwide. Bithumb’s proactive approach demonstrates their commitment to user security, but it also raises important questions about token vulnerabilities. Investors now face crucial decisions regarding their BOA holdings and overall portfolio security. How Does This BOA Warning Affect Current Investors? If you currently hold BOA tokens on Bithumb, you need to understand the immediate implications. The temporary suspension means you cannot move your BOA tokens to or from the exchange. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean your assets are at immediate risk. Bithumb implemented these measures specifically to prevent potential security breaches during their investigation. Here are the key actions Bithumb has taken: Temporary suspension of BOA deposits Temporary suspension of BOA withdrawals Active investigation of related security concerns Public notification to all platform users For investors using other exchanges, this development serves as a crucial reminder to practice due diligence. The interconnected nature of DeFi protocols means security issues can have widespread implications across multiple platforms and tokens. What Should You Do Following This Investment Warning? First, avoid making panic-driven decisions. The Bithumb investment warning for BOA is a precaution, not necessarily an indication of permanent issues. However, you should take several proactive steps to protect your investments. Monitor official Bithumb communications for updates about when services might resume. Review your overall portfolio exposure to BOA and related DeFi tokens. Consider these protective measures: Enable all available security features on your exchange accounts Diversify your cryptocurrency holdings across different asset classes Research the specific connection between BOA and Yearn.finance security concerns Stay informed through official exchange channels rather than social media rumors Remember that exchanges issue investment warnings to protect users, not to create unnecessary fear. Bithumb’s transparent communication actually represents a positive development in exchange accountability and user protection standards. Why This BOA Situation Matters for the Broader Crypto Market This incident highlights several important trends in cryptocurrency security and regulation. First, it demonstrates how quickly exchanges must respond to potential threats in the fast-moving DeFi space. Second, it shows the growing responsibility exchanges feel toward user protection beyond mere compliance requirements. The Bithumb investment warning for BOA also underscores the importance of understanding token interconnections within the DeFi ecosystem. Many tokens rely on shared protocols and smart contracts, meaning vulnerabilities in one area can affect multiple assets. This interconnectedness requires investors to look beyond individual tokens and consider systemic risks. Finally, this situation may influence how other exchanges handle similar security concerns in the future. Bithumb’s approach could set a precedent for transparent communication and proactive protection measures across the industry. Key Takeaways from Bithumb’s BOA Announcement Bithumb’s investment warning serves as a crucial reminder that cryptocurrency investing requires constant vigilance. While the temporary suspension of BOA services may inconvenience some users, it ultimately represents responsible platform management. The exchange prioritized user security over uninterrupted service, which should reassure investors about Bithumb’s commitment to protection. This incident reinforces several fundamental principles of crypto investing: Security should always precede convenience Transparent communication builds trust between exchanges and users Understanding token relationships is as important as analyzing individual assets Proactive measures prevent larger problems As the investigation continues, investors should maintain balanced perspectives. Neither extreme optimism nor excessive pessimism serves your investment strategy well. Instead, focus on verified information from official sources and make decisions based on facts rather than speculation. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is the Bithumb investment warning for BOA? Bithumb issued an official warning about potential security concerns affecting BOA tokens, temporarily suspending deposits and withdrawals while they investigate issues related to Yearn.finance protocols. Can I still trade BOA on Bithumb? While Bithumb suspended deposits and withdrawals, trading functionality may still be available. However, you should check Bithumb’s official announcements for the most current status of BOA services. Is my BOA investment at immediate risk? Bithumb’s warning is precautionary. The exchange took these measures specifically to prevent potential security issues, so your assets are likely protected by these proactive steps. How long will the BOA suspension last? Bithumb hasn’t specified a timeline. The suspension will continue until their security investigation concludes and they determine it’s safe to resume normal services. Should I sell my BOA tokens because of this warning? Investment decisions should be based on your individual strategy and risk tolerance. The warning suggests increased caution but doesn’t necessarily mandate immediate selling. Will this affect BOA tokens on other exchanges? While the warning specifically addresses Bithumb, the underlying security concerns might affect BOA tokens across different platforms. Check with other exchanges where you hold BOA for their specific policies. Share This Important Security Update This Bithumb investment warning for BOA affects many cryptocurrency investors.

The platform will delist 15 spot trading pairs on December 5, 2024, at 3:00 AM UTC. This regular maintenance move affects several popular trading combinations, and understanding the implications is crucial for active market participants. Which Trading Pairs Will Binance Delist? Binance has provided a clear list of the affected spot trading pairs scheduled for removal. The exchange will discontinue the following combinations: ACH/BTC DENT/ETH EGLD/FDUSD HAEDAL/BNB INIT/FDUSD PORTAL/BNB PORTAL/BTC PROVE/FDUSD QTUM/BTC RIF/BTC SHELL/FDUSD STRAX/BTC TREE/FDUSD WAXP/BTC W/BTC Notice that most pairs involve Bitcoin (BTC) or FDUSD trading combinations. This pattern suggests Binance is streamlining its offerings to focus on more liquid and actively traded markets. Why Does Binance Delist Trading Pairs? You might wonder why exchanges like Binance regularly delist spot trading pairs . The primary reasons include low trading volume, poor liquidity, and evolving market dynamics. When pairs don’t generate sufficient activity, they become inefficient for the platform to maintain. Moreover, regulatory considerations and project developments sometimes influence these decisions. Binance typically reviews trading pairs periodically to ensure market quality and protect users from illiquid markets where price manipulation becomes easier. What Should Affected Traders Do Immediately? If you currently hold positions in any of these pairs, you need to take action before December 5. First, check your open orders and cancel any that involve these combinations. Second, consider closing your positions or transferring assets to different trading pairs that will remain active. Remember that while the spot trading pairs will disappear, the individual cryptocurrencies might still trade against other assets. For instance, if you trade WAXP/BTC, you could switch to WAXP/USDT if that pair remains available. Always verify alternative trading options on the platform. How Does This Affect the Cryptocurrency Market? When Binance decides to delist spot trading pairs , it often signals changing market preferences. Projects affected might experience temporary price volatility as traders adjust their positions. However, this doesn’t necessarily reflect on the fundamental value of the underlying assets. Historically, such delistings cause short-term price movements but rarely impact solid projects long-term. The cryptocurrency ecosystem constantly evolves, and exchanges must adapt their offerings to match user demand and regulatory requirements. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto Traders? This announcement serves as an important reminder about exchange risk management. Diversifying across multiple platforms and staying informed about exchange policies protects your investments. Regular delistings are normal in the crypto space, much like stock exchanges removing poorly performing companies. Successful traders monitor exchange announcements closely and maintain flexible strategies. They understand that platform changes create both challenges and opportunities in the dynamic cryptocurrency markets. Conclusion: Navigating Exchange Changes Successfully The decision to delist 15 spot trading pairs demonstrates Binance’s commitment to maintaining a healthy trading environment. While inconvenient for some users, such actions ultimately benefit the broader community by reducing clutter and focusing liquidity. Proactive traders who adjust their strategies accordingly will navigate this change smoothly. The cryptocurrency market continues maturing, and exchanges play a crucial role in shaping its development through thoughtful curation of available trading options. Frequently Asked Questions What happens to my assets after Binance delists these trading pairs? Your cryptocurrency holdings remain safe in your wallet. Only the specific trading pairs disappear, not the assets themselves. You can still trade the individual cryptocurrencies against other available pairs on Binance. Can I still withdraw the affected cryptocurrencies after December 5? Yes, withdrawal functionality for the individual tokens typically continues unaffected. The delisting only removes specific trading combinations from the spot market. Will Binance compensate users affected by the delisting? Exchanges generally don’t provide compensation for regular delistings. Users receive advance notice to manage their positions, which Binance has provided with this December 5 announcement. How often does Binance delist trading pairs? Binance conducts periodic reviews and typically announces delistings several times per year. The frequency depends on market conditions and trading volume across various pairs. Should I be concerned about other trading pairs I use? Not necessarily. Regular delistings target low-volume pairs. If you trade popular combinations with healthy liquidity, your pairs will likely remain available. However, monitoring exchange announcements is always wise. Where can I find alternative trading options for affected cryptocurrencies? Check Binance’s other available trading pairs for each token. Many will have USD, USDT, or other stablecoin pairs that remain active. You can also explore other reputable exchanges that might offer your preferred trading combinations.

According to Hayes, a roughly 30% drop in Tether’s BTC and gold holdings could erase the company’s equity and leave USDT vulnerable. His comments touched off fresh debate about how much of the company’s true financial strength is visible to the market. The Tether folks are in the early innings of running a massive interest rate trade. How I read this audit is they think the Fed will cut rates which crushes their interest income.

Reported Buffers According to Joseph’s calculations, Tether holds about $120 billion in US Treasuries that are earning roughly 4%, which he says could generate about $10 billion a year in net income. He also cited other corporate assets that are not part of public reserve snapshots — equity stakes, mining operations, and additional Bitcoin holdings — all of which, he argues, strengthen Tether’s overall capital position. Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO, has publicly cited roughly $30 billion in “group equity” as part of the firm’s buffer against shocks. re: Tether FUD From latest attestation announcement (Q3 2025): “Tether will continue to maintain a multi-billion-dollar excess reserve buffer and an overall proprietary Group equity approaching $30 billion.” Tether had (at end of Q3 2025) ~7B in excess equity (on top of the… — Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) November 30, 2025 Hayes’s Warning And The Transparency Question Hayes’s point, however, rests on a simple math worry: volatile assets can move fast, and marked declines would reduce the value of reserves. He framed Tether’s move into Bitcoin and gold as a macro hedge against expected rate cuts, but said that hedge could backfire under a sharp sell-off. Reports have noted that because attestations focus on backing for USDT supply, they may not reveal how much of the company’s other assets would be available in a crisis — a gap that keeps some investors uneasy. What The Debate Means For Markets The clash highlights two facts. One: there are sizable numbers involved — $120 billion in Treasuries, a roughly $30 billion equity figure cited by management, and the $50–$100 billion range estimated by Joseph. Two: the core issue is disclosure. If Tether’s broader holdings can be marshalled quickly in a stress event, the company may handle big swings. If not, volatility could create trouble for short-term liquidity even if long-term equity is large.

55280141,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=226053,1764734413,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Essential Innovation: Why South Korea Must Design, Not Ban, a Won-Denominated Stablecoin",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/design-not-ban-won-stablecoin/,"BitcoinWorld Essential Innovation: Why South Korea Must Design, Not Ban, a Won-Denominated Stablecoin Imagine a digital version of the Korean Won you can use globally in seconds. This is the promise of a won-denominated stablecoin , a topic sparking intense debate in Seoul. Instead of fearing this innovation, a key lawmaker argues South Korea should lead by designing it right. Let’s explore why a smart framework, not a ban, could be the nation’s best path forward. Why is a Won-Denominated Stablecoin So Crucial for South Korea? Democratic Party lawmaker Min Byeong-deok recently made a compelling case. At a seminar hosted by the party’s Digital Asset Task Force, he challenged the cautious stance of the Bank of Korea. His core argument? The absence of a domestic, regulated stablecoin is a bigger risk than creating one. Without a homegrown option, South Korean users and businesses might turn to unregulated foreign stablecoins. This could expose the economy to external volatility and reduce the central bank’s monetary policy influence. Therefore, a properly designed won-denominated stablecoin isn’t just an asset; it’s a tool for financial sovereignty. What Are the Real Risks of an Outright Ban? Lawmaker Min directly criticized a recent Bank of Korea report that highlighted stablecoin risks like runs and settlement failures. While these concerns are valid, his perspective adds crucial context. A ban doesn’t eliminate risk; it merely shifts it offshore and into the shadows. Consider the potential consequences of prohibition: Lost Competitive Edge: Other nations are advancing their digital currency projects. South Korea risks falling behind. Consumer Vulnerability: Citizens may use riskier, opaque international stablecoins without local consumer protections. Innovation Drain: Tech talent and blockchain startups may move to more supportive regulatory environments. The call is clear: proactive design beats reactive restriction. How Can South Korea Design a Secure Won-Denominated Stablecoin? The key lies in “proper design.” This means building a regulatory framework before the product, ensuring stability and trust from day one. A successful won-denominated stablecoin would likely need: Full Reserve Backing: Every digital won must be backed 1:1 by Korean Won or ultra-safe assets held in regulated custodians. Transparent Audits: Regular, public proof-of-reserves by independent auditors to maintain public confidence. Clear Issuer Rules: Strict licensing for issuers, focusing on financial stability and operational integrity. Interoperability: Design that works seamlessly with existing banking and payment systems. This approach transforms the stablecoin from a speculative asset into a reliable digital payment rail. What’s the Timeline for South Korea’s Digital Asset Laws? While the vision is clear, the legislative path remains under discussion. Kim Sung-jin, head of the Financial Services Commission’s Virtual Asset Division, provided an update. Authorities are “expediting” the bill for the second phase of the Digital Asset Act, which is expected to cover stablecoins. However, he declined to give a specific schedule. This indicates careful, albeit urgent, deliberation to get the rules right. The focus is on creating a lasting framework, not a rushed one. Conclusion: A Strategic Imperative, Not a Choice The debate over a won-denominated stablecoin is about more than cryptocurrency. It’s about South Korea’s future in the digital economy. Lawmaker Min’s stance highlights a strategic truth: in the race for financial innovation, you either design the future or get designed by it. By embracing responsible innovation, South Korea can protect its economy, empower its citizens, and secure its position as a global digital leader. The opportunity is here; it’s time to build. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: What is a won-denominated stablecoin? A: It’s a type of cryptocurrency designed to have a stable value, pegged 1:1 to the South Korean Won (KRW). It combines the benefits of digital currency—like fast, borderless transfers—with the price stability of traditional money. Q: Why does Lawmaker Min oppose a ban? A: He believes a ban would be counterproductive. It would push demand toward unregulated foreign stablecoins, creating greater systemic risk and reducing South Korea’s control over its own financial ecosystem. Q: What are the main risks of stablecoins? A: Key risks include a “run” on the stablecoin if users lose faith in its backing, the failure of the issuing entity, and potential disruptions to traditional financial systems if not properly integrated. Q: How would a designed stablecoin differ from existing ones like USDT? A: A state-sanctioned, Korean won-denominated stablecoin would operate under strict local regulations, require full transparency and auditing, and be integrated with national financial infrastructure, offering greater security and legal recourse for users. Q: When will South Korea’s stablecoin laws be ready? A: There is no official date. The Financial Services Commission has confirmed it is working to expedite the relevant legislation (the second phase of the Digital Asset Act), but the process is complex and ongoing. Q: Who would issue a won-denominated stablecoin? A: This is a key part of the design debate. Potential issuers could include licensed financial institutions, fintech companies, or a public-private partnership, all under the supervision of Korean regulators.

The market now watches closely to see whether this wave of forced selling will continue dragging Bitcoin lower or if the pressure is finally reaching exhaustion. Long Liquidations Dominate as Bitcoin Faces Renewed Downside Pressure Adler explains that the liquidation dominance oscillator measures the ratio between long and short liquidations across the derivatives market. When the indicator prints positive values, shown as green bars, long positions take the bulk of the damage. Negative values reflect a dominance of short liquidations. Bitcoin’s current reading of 32% stands out as one of the highest levels seen in the last three years, highlighting how aggressively bulls have been forced out during this correction. November illustrates this perfectly. The market saw three separate waves of long liquidations, each exceeding $400 million. Every one of those spikes aligned with a sharp acceleration in Bitcoin’s price decline, reinforcing how leveraged buyers repeatedly amplified downside momentum. Rather than stabilizing the market, each flush created more selling pressure and triggered deeper unwinding across futures platforms. The most recent liquidation wave reached $221 million, hitting the market right as Bitcoin attempted a short-term recovery. That flush immediately reversed the bounce and dragged BTC back down to the $86,000 region, erasing nearly all of last week’s gains. The persistent dominance of long liquidations shows that bulls remain under heavy stress—and until this dynamic eases, Bitcoin will struggle to build sustainable upside.

The price has dropped from the $115,000 region to the $86,000–$88,000 range, where it now interacts directly with the 100 SMA. This moving average has served as a key structural support in previous cycles, and Bitcoin’s current test of it will likely determine whether the broader uptrend holds or breaks down further. The recent candles highlight intense volatility. Bitcoin briefly dipped to nearly $84,000 before buyers stepped in, forming a lower wick that shows early attempts to defend this level. However, the rebound remains shallow, and the 50 SMA continues to slope downward — a sign that short- and mid-term momentum still favors sellers. For bulls to regain control, BTC needs to reclaim $95,000 on a weekly closing basis. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Break Key Supply Clusters To Regain ATH Momentum – Watch These Levels Volume adds weight to the bearish pressure. Selling spikes dominate recent weeks, revealing a mix of forced liquidations and fear-driven exits rather than healthy profit-taking. As long as BTC trades below the 50 SMA, the market remains vulnerable to deeper retracements. If the 100 SMA fails to hold, the next major liquidity zone sits near $70,000–$72,000, aligning with previous consolidation and the long-term 200 SMA. The next weekly close will be decisive.

The world’s largest cryptocurrency reclaimed the $90,000 handle in early trading, while futures on the Nasdaq and S&P 500 edged about 0.1% higher, signalling a calmer session ahead after Wall Street’s overnight rebound. Across equities, MSCI’s broad index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan gained around 0.3%, and Japan’s Nikkei 225 advanced 0.8%, recovering some of Monday’s losses. For many crypto-focused traders, the return of risk appetite in equities added a supportive backdrop for Bitcoin’s bounce. Market snapshot Bitcoin : $92,851, up 6.6% Ether : $3,040, up 8.3% XRP : $2.18, up 7.6% Total crypto market cap: $3.22 trillion, up 6.5% Akshat Siddant, lead quant analyst at Mudrex, said Bitcoin is seeing a strong V-shaped rebound as momentum returns. He noted that sentiment improved after the Fed ended quantitative tightening and injected $13.5b through overnight funding,” which lifted liquidity in short-term markets. US institutions have increased their use of repo facilities, adding support for risk assets. Siddant also pointed to Bitcoin exchange reserves falling to “multiyear lows of 2.19M BTC,” a trend that has strengthened buying pressure. Bitcoin has bounced back to $91.1K, and Ethereum just lifted above $3K. This has flipped the crowd narrative once again.

Early Week Turmoil From Bond And Crypto Selling Gives Way To Calmer Trading The improvement follows an “ugly” start to the week, when expectations of a looming rate hike in Japan triggered a global bond selloff and amplified a slide in cryptocurrencies, sending investors rushing out of risk assets. Moves in Japanese government bonds were more subdued on Wednesday, although yields stayed under pressure as markets continued to price in a Bank of Japan tightening later this month. With no major new data in Asia, attention shifted back to the Federal Reserve and a widely expected rate cut next week. December Strength And Fed Cut Hopes Lift Sentiment After Japan Shock December has often been a favourable month for stocks, and the prospect of easier US policy has helped sentiment after the earlier shock from Japan. Recent US numbers have pointed to a gradually cooling economy, while Fed officials had urged caution on cutting too quickly, warning that inflation pressures could return. Even so, remarks from several policymakers in recent days have reinforced expectations for a cut at the December meeting, and traders now see an 89.2% chance of a 25-basis-point move, up from about 63% a month ago, according to CME’s FedWatch Tool. US stocks finished higher on Tuesday, logging a sixth gain in seven sessions in relatively muted trade, driven by technology shares as rate cut hopes stayed elevated. Earlier in the week, equities sold off on softer manufacturing data, a jump in Treasury yields as Japanese bond yields surged, and a drop in Bitcoin and crypto-related stocks. The next key macro test comes on Friday, when the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, is due. That print could help cement expectations for the central bank’s decision next week. Markets Monitor Potential Successor To Powell As Trump Prepares A Decision Markets are also watching who may succeed Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term ends next year, with reports pointing to White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett as a leading contender. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would announce his choice early next year. Crypto traders remain cautious despite Bitcoin’s recovery. Samer Hasn, market analyst at XS.com, said Bitcoin’s recent stabilization is masking deeper fragility beneath the surface. “According to current market dynamics, whales continue to offload holdings, leverage reset remains incomplete, and no convincing signs of a bottom have emerged. The backdrop has also been clouded by the Bank of Japan’s tightening shock and rising concerns around Strategy’s balance-sheet risks, keeping downside pressure firmly in play,” he added.

His recent, stylized declaration on X—vowing to pursue his goals ‘by any means necessary’ with a Bitcoin symbol replacing the ‘B’—wasn’t just a post. It was a battle cry. This statement reinforces the relentless Michael Saylor Bitcoin strategy that has defined his and MicroStrategy’s journey, signaling an unwavering commitment that could reshape institutional crypto adoption. But what does this powerful phrase truly mean for investors and the market? What Is the Core of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy? To understand the pledge, we must first look at the track record. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy is not a casual investment thesis; it is a fundamental corporate transformation. Since August 2020, MicroStrategy has accumulated over 214,000 BTC, making it the world’s largest corporate Bitcoin treasury. Saylor views Bitcoin not as a speculative asset but as the superior property technology—a digital fortress against currency debasement. His approach is methodical and long-term. Therefore, the phrase ‘by any means necessary’ suggests this accumulation and advocacy will continue, regardless of market volatility or regulatory scrutiny. It’s a promise of persistence in the face of any challenge. Why Did Saylor Make This ‘Any Means Necessary’ Vow Now? Timing is everything. This declaration comes amid a significant Bitcoin price resurgence and increasing institutional interest through spot ETFs. Saylor’s message serves multiple purposes: Reaffirming Leadership: It solidifies his position as Bitcoin’s most vocal corporate champion. Signaling Resolve: It tells shareholders and the market that MicroStrategy’s course is absolute. Psychological Warfare: In a market driven by sentiment, such a definitive statement projects strength and conviction. Moreover, the stylized ‘B’ with the Bitcoin symbol is a masterclass in branding. It visually merges his mission with the asset itself, creating a powerful and memorable icon for his followers. What Could ‘Any Means Necessary’ Look Like in Action? This isn’t empty rhetoric. The Michael Saylor Bitcoin strategy has already employed creative financial engineering. Looking ahead, ‘any means necessary’ could involve: Leveraging Corporate Balance Sheets: Continued use of debt, equity, and cash flow to buy more Bitcoin. Product Innovation: Developing new MicroStrategy software or services that integrate Bitcoin technology. Regulatory and Political Advocacy: Doubling down on efforts to shape favorable crypto legislation in the US and abroad. Educational Onslaught: Expanding his ‘Bitcoin for Corporations’ initiative to onboard more CEOs. Essentially, it means exploring every legal and strategic avenue to advance Bitcoin adoption and, by extension, MicroStrategy’s value proposition as a Bitcoin proxy. What Are the Potential Risks of This Absolute Stance? While inspiring for Bitcoin maximalists, this uncompromising Michael Saylor Bitcoin strategy carries inherent risks. The primary concern is concentration risk. MicroStrategy’s fate is now inextricably linked to Bitcoin’s price. A prolonged bear market could strain its ability to service debt or maintain operations. Furthermore, regulatory crackdowns or technological challenges to Bitcoin could pose existential threats. Saylor’s vow assumes Bitcoin’s long-term supremacy, a bet that, while confident, is not without competitors in the digital asset space. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Bitcoin Advocacy Michael Saylor’s declaration is more than a tweet; it’s a manifesto. It crystallizes a Michael Saylor Bitcoin strategy built on absolute belief and aggressive action. For the crypto ecosystem, it provides a figure of unwavering conviction. For investors, it underscores the high-stakes, binary nature of MicroStrategy’s bet on a digital future. Saylor isn’t just investing in Bitcoin; he’s campaigning for it, and he’s just declared he will stop at nothing to win. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What did Michael Saylor actually say in his post? On X (formerly Twitter), Michael Saylor posted that he would act ‘by any means necessary,’ stylizing the text with a Bitcoin symbol (₿) in place of the letter ‘B’ in the word ‘by.’ How much Bitcoin does MicroStrategy own? As of the latest reports, MicroStrategy holds over 214,000 Bitcoin, making it the largest corporate holder of BTC in the world. What is the main goal of Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin strategy? The primary goal is to position MicroStrategy as a dominant holder of what Saylor calls ‘digital property,’ using Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset to hedge against inflation and generate long-term capital appreciation. Is MicroStrategy’s strategy risky? Yes, it carries significant risk due to its extreme concentration in a single, volatile asset. The company’s performance is now highly correlated with the price of Bitcoin. Can other companies follow this strategy? While possible, it requires a high-risk tolerance and a deep conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term thesis. Saylor’s approach is considered aggressive and is not typical corporate treasury management. What does this mean for Bitcoin’s price? Saylor’s continued advocacy and buying can create positive sentiment and reduce sell-side pressure, potentially providing support for Bitcoin’s price, especially during market dips.

55283432,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=226248,1764739510,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Transformative UK Law: Crypto as Property Now Officially Recognized,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/uk-law-crypto-as-property/,"BitcoinWorld Transformative UK Law: Crypto as Property Now Officially Recognized In a landmark move for the digital economy, the United Kingdom has officially passed legislation that legally classifies crypto as property . This transformative step moves beyond previous case law to provide a solid statutory foundation for digital assets. For investors and businesses, this clarity is a game-changer. What Does the UK’s Crypto as Property Bill Actually Do? The new Property Bill, which has received royal assent, provides a formal legal framework. Previously, UK courts treated digital assets like Bitcoin or NFTs as property on a case-by-case basis. However, the new law codifies this principle, offering much-needed certainty. The legislation specifically aims to clarify critical areas that have been gray zones for users and legal professionals alike. Therefore, proving ownership of your digital wallet’s contents becomes more straightforward under statute. Moreover, the process for recovering stolen or fraudulently obtained crypto assets gains a clearer legal pathway. This is a crucial development for victims of crypto scams. Why Is Classifying Crypto as Property So Important? Legal classification might sound technical, but its impact is profound. By defining crypto as property , the UK government provides a stable foundation for the entire ecosystem. Consider these key benefits: Ownership Proof: It establishes clear rules for proving who owns a digital asset, which is vital for disputes and transactions. Asset Recovery: Victims of theft have stronger legal grounds to pursue and reclaim their stolen crypto. Inheritance & Bankruptcy: The law clarifies how digital assets are handled when someone passes away or a company becomes insolvent. This means your crypto can be properly included in a will or estate. This move signals the UK’s commitment to becoming a hub for responsible crypto innovation. It gives businesses the confidence to operate and investors the assurance that their holdings are recognized and protected by law. What Are the Practical Implications for Crypto Holders? For the everyday crypto user in the UK, this law translates to tangible security and planning power. You can now approach financial planning with your digital portfolio in mind, knowing it has defined legal standing as property. For instance, when creating a will, you can explicitly list your crypto holdings alongside traditional assets like a house or stocks. In the unfortunate event of a hack, the legal process for recovery is more defined, potentially increasing the chances of a successful claim. This framework also encourages traditional financial institutions to develop products and services around digital assets, fostering greater mainstream integration. Conclusion: A Foundation for the Future The UK’s decision to legally recognize crypto as property is a transformative and forward-thinking step. It replaces uncertainty with clarity, fostering a safer and more predictable environment for innovation and investment. This legislation not only protects current holders but also paves the way for broader institutional adoption, solidifying the UK’s position in the global digital asset landscape. The future of crypto regulation is being written now, and the UK has made a compelling first chapter. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Does this mean my Bitcoin is now legally the same as my house? A> Not exactly. It classifies crypto as a form of personal property, similar to intellectual property or shares, which gives it legal recognition and protection, but it doesn’t equate it to real estate in all aspects. Q: How does this help if my crypto is stolen? A> The law provides a clearer statutory basis for you to pursue legal action to recover stolen assets. It defines them as your property, strengthening your claim in court. Q: Do I need to do anything with my crypto holdings because of this law? A> No immediate action is required. However, it’s a good prompt to ensure your estate planning (like your will) accounts for your digital assets and that your private keys and wallet information are securely stored for your beneficiaries. Q: Does this apply to all cryptocurrencies and NFTs? A> The bill uses the term “digital assets,” which is broad and is intended to cover a wide range of crypto-assets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, as well as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Q: How does this affect crypto taxes in the UK? A> The tax treatment (Capital Gains Tax) was already in place. This law doesn’t directly change tax rules but reinforces the underlying principle that crypto is an asset subject to ownership rules, which supports the existing tax framework. Q: Is the UK the first country to do this? A> No, other jurisdictions have taken similar steps. However, the UK’s approach through primary legislation is particularly significant due to its global financial influence and the comprehensive nature of the bill.

ABIB also claims there was a breach in editorial standards and demanded specific corrections. The ABC now has 60 days to respond before the case can be escalated to the media regulator. ABIB Disputes ABC Report on Bitcoin The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body (ABIB) lodged a formal complaint against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), accusing the public broadcaster of publishing an article that misrepresented Bitcoin and breached editorial standards. According to ABIB, the article relied on outdated narratives, portrayed Bitcoin as primarily a tool for criminals, and ignored a wide range of positive use cases, including its role in energy-grid efficiency and humanitarian efforts. The group said the coverage “misrepresented Bitcoin’s purpose, conflated it with criminal activity,” and failed to reflect that widely available data that contradicts the article’s claims. ABIB argues that the ABC piece used sensational language rather than actual evidence and overlooked both global and local examples of Bitcoin being used legitimately. It also outlined specific corrections it wants the ABC to make, along with the sections of the broadcaster’s code of conduct it believes were violated. Under ABC’s code of practice, the broadcaster has 60 days to respond. If it does not, or if ABIB is dissatisfied with the reply, the matter can be escalated to the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), which has the power to investigate and issue enforcement actions. A core issue that was raised by ABIB involves the article’s portrayal of Bitcoin as widely used by criminals. The group pointed to a 2024 report from Chainalysis showing that only 0.14% of on-chain Bitcoin transactions were linked to possible criminal activity. This amount was drastically lower than the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s estimate that criminal proceeds represent 3.6% of global GDP, most of which flows through the traditional financial system. (Source: Chainalysis ) ABIB also disputed ABC’s claims that Bitcoin failed to fulfil its goals to act as a store of wealth. In fact, iInstitutional adoption accelerated quite a bit, with publicly traded companies, funds and governments now holding more than 3.7 million BTC, worth over $341 billion. Once-skeptical financial institutions have also started to engage with the sector, including Vanguard, which this week reversed its long-held position by allowing customers to trade crypto ETFs on its platform. The complaint was made during a time of growing frustration in the Australian crypto sector over how digital assets are portrayed in mainstream media. A July report from intelligence firm Perception found that 28% of crypto articles across 18 major outlets were negative, compared with 31% positive and 41% neutral. ABIB said members of the public regularly contact the organisation about misleading or outdated coverage, especially from publicly funded institutions.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-03 05:30:00

This isn’t just a minor price bump; analysis points to a fundamental shift in market structure and investor behavior. Let’s break down what this powerful move means and where XRP could be headed next. What Does the XRP Uptrend Breakthrough Mean? Breaking a key resistance level like $2.1 is a major technical event. It signifies that buying pressure has overwhelmingly overcome selling pressure at that price point. According to a Coindesk analysis, this move completes a multi-day consolidation pattern, effectively turning previous resistance into new support. The surge is backed by a near doubling of the 24-hour average trading volume, a strong indicator that this is driven by substantial capital inflow, potentially from institutional players rather than retail traders alone. Key Drivers Fueling the Rally Several factors are converging to strengthen this XRP uptrend . First, there’s been a notable spike in activity on the XRP Ledger network itself, suggesting increased utility and transaction flow. More importantly, data shows sustained accumulation by large-scale investors, often called ‘whales.’ This type of buying typically has a longer-term horizon and provides a solid foundation for price appreciation. Technical Breakout: The clean break above $2.1 resolves a period of uncertainty. Volume Surge: High volume confirms the strength and legitimacy of the move. Whale Accumulation: Large holders are increasing their positions, signaling confidence. Network Activity: Rising usage of the XRP Ledger adds fundamental support. Where is the XRP Uptrend Heading Next? With the breakout confirmed, analysts are mapping the potential path forward. The current price action places XRP at the top of a bullish structure. Technical indicators like the Stochastic RSI are flashing patterns reminiscent of those seen before previous major rallies. The immediate target is a clear break above the $2.18 resistance zone. If achieved, the next logical targets lie in the $2.33 to $2.40 range. On the flip side, any pullbacks are now expected to find strong structural support around the $2.00 level, which was the previous resistance. This creates a clearer risk-reward framework for traders. The market sentiment has clearly shifted from cautious consolidation to confident bullish momentum. Actionable Insights for Investors Understanding the XRP uptrend is one thing; knowing how to respond is another. For existing holders, this breakout validates a holding strategy. For those considering an entry, any retest of the new support zone near $2.05-$2.10 could present an opportunity, though this is not guaranteed. Always remember that cryptocurrency markets are volatile. Therefore, it’s crucial to: Conduct your own research beyond this analysis. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. Consider using stop-loss orders to manage risk below key support levels. Conclusion: A New Chapter for XRP The breakthrough above $2.1 marks a pivotal moment for XRP. It’s a move backed by volume, investor accumulation, and positive technical structure. While the journey may see volatility, the breakout has undeniably opened the door for a stronger, sustained XRP uptrend . The coming days will be critical to see if the momentum can push prices toward the next targets and solidify this new, higher trading range. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q: Why is breaking $2.1 so important for XRP? A: The $2.1 level was a major psychological and technical resistance point. Breaking it signals strong buyer conviction and often leads to a rapid price move as selling pressure at that level dissipates. Q: Is the XRP uptrend sustainable? A> Sustainability depends on continued buying pressure and fundamental developments. The high volume and whale accumulation are positive signs, but the market must hold above the new support level near $2. Q: What is the next major resistance after $2.18? A> Analysts identify the $2.33 to $2.40 range as the next significant resistance zone if the price clears the $2.18 area. Q: Should I buy XRP now after the breakout? A> Investment decisions are personal. This analysis highlights a bullish structure, but entering after a sharp rise carries risk. Some traders wait for a pullback to new support, while others see breakout momentum as the signal. Always assess your own risk tolerance. Q: What happens if XRP falls back below $2.1? A> A fall back below $2.1, especially on high volume, could invalidate the breakout and signal a ‘false breakout,’ potentially leading to a deeper correction toward the $2 support.

Glassnode and Fasanara Capital, in their Q4 Digital Assets Report, say the structure of the market has shifted meaningfully as larger investors deepen their presence. The report estimates that Bitcoin has absorbed about $732B in new capital this cycle, a level of inflow that has arrived alongside a sharp drop in volatility. One-year realized volatility has nearly halved, suggesting a market that is growing both in size and in stability as institutional players take a larger role. Bitcoin has added $732B in new capital this cycle, with 1YR realized volatility nearly halved. The market is trading calmer, larger, and more institutional. Our Q4 Digital Assets Report with @FasanaraDigital breaks down the structural shifts. https://t.co/sqkr0PO6am pic.twitter.com/3akvmDzyeM — glassnode (@glassnode) December 3, 2025 Bitcoin Settlement Hits $6.9T As Activity Rivals Visa And Mastercard Settlement volumes remain a key sign of scale. Glassnode says Bitcoin settled roughly $6.9T over the past 90 days, placing it on par with or above payment giants Visa and Mastercard. Even as more activity moves off-chain into ETFs and brokerage channels, Bitcoin and stablecoins continue to dominate value transfer on public ledgers. Flows into ETFs have reshaped the way capital enters and exits the asset. The shift toward regulated wrappers is steering large volumes through traditional market rails, which has contributed to steadier liquidity conditions and reduced the frequency of large swings in spot trading. Tokenized Funds Gain Momentum As Asset Managers Explore New Distribution Models At the same time, tokenization has become one of the fastest-growing themes in digital assets. Tokenized real-world assets have expanded from $7B to $24B in a single year, marking their strongest phase of institutional adoption. Glassnode notes that tokenized funds in particular are gaining traction as asset managers search for new distribution models and investors seek simpler access to traditional instruments. Image Source: Glassnode/ Fasanara Digital The expansion of tokenized RWAs reflects broader interest from pension funds, hedge funds and corporates that want on-chain exposure without taking directional bets on major cryptocurrencies. This segment has been drawing consistent inflows through 2025 as platforms improve custody, compliance and settlement infrastructure. Glassnode Sees A More Mature Market Defined By Stability And Scale Glassnode adds that market structure is both larger, and calmer. Lower volatility, deeper liquidity and a growing share of institutional flows have reduced some of the extremes that defined earlier cycles. The firm describes the market as trading “calmer, larger, and more institutional,” a theme echoed across derivatives, spot markets and on-chain data. Despite the calmer backdrop, activity has not faded. Stablecoins continue to serve as the main bridge between traditional and digital markets, and settlement demand remains heavy across both centralized and decentralized venues. The report suggests this dual-rail structure is now a feature of the ecosystem rather than a temporary bridge. Tokenized RWAs Accelerate Market Evolution And Broaden Investor Participation ETF demand has also encouraged more market-making and arbitrage participation from traditional firms, which in turn has tightened spreads and reduced dislocations during selloffs. Glassnode says this feedback loop is contributing to a more resilient market than in prior cycles. As 2025 progresses, analysts expect institutional involvement to deepen further, particularly as tokenized funds see broader adoption. With growing comfort around regulated access points and more on-chain representations of traditional assets, the divide between digital and conventional markets is narrowing. Glassnode’s report frames the current cycle as a turning point in market composition.

The new collection of indices offers pricing references and volatility metrics for major tokens, giving institutional traders access to tools similar to those long used in equities, commodities and other financial markets. CME confirmed the suite covers leading cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether, Solana and XRP. Volatility Benchmarks Take Center Stage A key element of the rollout is the addition of Bitcoin volatility benchmarks designed to measure expectations of future price swings. These benchmarks track implied volatility drawn from Bitcoin options markets, including contracts tied to Micro Bitcoin futures. CME describes the product as serving a similar function to the VIX in equity markets, offering an estimate of how much movement traders anticipate over the next 30 days. While the volatility benchmarks are not tradable products on their own, they provide a unified reference point that traders can use for risk management, options pricing and portfolio adjustments. Why the New Benchmarks Matter Volatility indices play a major role in global financial markets, and their introduction to crypto reflects the maturity of digital-asset derivatives. They allow analysts and traders to quantify uncertainty more precisely. They help identify when markets may be preparing for sharper swings. And they underpin advanced strategies that depend on expectations of future volatility rather than price direction. The CME benchmarks are intended to standardize these processes in crypto markets, which until now have used fragmented data from multiple exchanges. Institutional Activity Continues to Grow Demand from institutions has expanded steadily in recent years as crypto derivatives gained traction alongside the growth of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds. Even before the ETF era, institutions were active in crypto futures and options, but the arrival of regulated spot products has accelerated interest in complementary hedging tools. CME reported that the third quarter delivered a significant milestone as combined futures and options trading volume across its crypto products surpassed $900 billion. Average daily open interest reached more than $31 billion during the period, marking a fresh record and signaling consistent capital participation. Open interest represents contracts that remain active rather than closed or rolled over, making it a useful measure of conviction and liquidity. Broader Derivatives Market Expands Institutional derivatives activity also broadened beyond Bitcoin. Ether and Micro Ether futures saw substantial increases in trading volume, suggesting a wider set of market participants are engaging with alternative crypto assets through CME-regulated products. The growth helps reinforce the need for standardized reference rates that align with the level of institutional involvement. A Step Toward Market Maturity CME’s move reflects a long-term trend toward the professionalization of crypto trading infrastructure. As more institutions incorporate digital assets into multi-asset strategies, demand grows for familiar analytical tools that reduce uncertainty and support risk-adjusted decision-making. The new benchmarks offer a consistent measurement framework that may help strengthen confidence in crypto derivatives as the asset class continues evolving.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|SOL|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-12-03 05:51:24

According to the Justice Department, authorities say the site was intended to fool Americans with false investment returns and attract victims into installing scam-linked mobile apps. According to the DOJ, the domain tickmilleas.com was controlled from the Tai Chang property, also known as Casino Kosai, in Kyaukhat, and was set up to appear to be a legitimate trading platform. The Justice Department report stated that Scammers allegedly gave victims instructions on how to deposit money while displaying fictitious balances and impressive-looking profits. DOJ exposes Tai Chang’s elaborate crypto scam network According to the affidavit submitted in support of the domain seizure, Tai Chang is associated with the Burmese group, a Trans Asia International Holding Group Thailand Company Limited (Trans Asia), and the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army (DKBA). The affidavit revealed that the two Burmese groups were designated by the Department of the Treasury, among others, as specifically designated nationals (SDNs) on November 12. Additionally, the designation of the two groups was due to their connections to Chinese organized crime and the growth of scam centers in Southeast Asia. According to the DOJ report, victims who utilized the web domain reported to the FBI that the website displayed supposed deposits made by scammers to their “accounts”. The report further revealed that scammers led victims through fraudulent trades and offered handsome returns on what they thought were their investments. The DOJ stated that the FBI had already found many victims who utilized the domain in the last month and were defrauded out of their investments, despite the seized domain being registered in early November 2025. According to the DOJ, a splash screen on the tickmilleas.com website alerts victims who have been routed to the domain that it has been seized by law enforcement. The alerts thereby stopped the intended CIF scam activity and related money laundering. The affidavit submitted in support of the seizure revealed that the tickmilleas.com site instructed users to download mobile apps connected to the scam from Google Play and the Apple App Store. The FBI notified Google and Apple of the fraudulent apps, and several of the applications have been voluntarily withdrawn. Notably, based on information provided by the FBI regarding the Tai Chang fraud compound, Meta detected and voluntarily erased more than 2,000 accounts from their network of social media platforms. Interpol warns of expanding global crypto scam networks In 2024 alone, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) received more than 41,000 reports, reporting about $5.8 billion in damages from CIF schemes. The DOJ claimed that these CIF scams usually start with unwanted contact from strangers via text messages, social media, messaging apps, and dating apps. The DOJ explained that these strangers develop intimate virtual relationships with their victim targets, encourage them to make purported investments in or utilize cryptocurrencies. Additionally, these strangers advise victims on how to obtain and invest in cryptocurrency using fraudulent domains and applications that appear authentic. According to the DOJ, the domain seizure comes less than three weeks after the announcement of the creation of the Scam Center Strike Force and the seizure of two additional domains similarly utilized by the Tai Chang scam compound for CIF frauds. Last month, a report released by the Interpol General Assembly stated that crypto fraud is at the heart of the expanding scam-compound industry. Cryptopolitan reported that Interpol claimed that victims are frequently trafficked into compounds under the guise of attractive jobs abroad, where they are forced to participate in illegal schemes like voice phishing, romance scams, and investment fraud. According to Interpol, the victims are also compelled to participate in cryptocurrency scams targeting individuals worldwide. Interpol claimed the groups operating these scam centers employ new technologies “to deceive victims and mask their operations” with the cross-border criminal networks functioning with a “highly adaptive nature.” Sign up to Bybit and start trading with $30,050 in welcome gifts",News|DKBA|DOJ|FBI,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|REGULATION|TRADING|DIGITAL ASSET TREASURY|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-03 05:52:42

On December 3rd, SUI stunned observers with a nearly 29% surge, riding the wave of a broader market recovery spearheaded by Bitcoin. This dramatic move has reignited interest and optimism around the token’s potential. But what’s truly driving this impressive rally for the SUI cryptocurrency? What Sparked the SUI Cryptocurrency Rally? According to a Bitcoin World market analysis, the SUI cryptocurrency’s price jumped to approximately $1.74, marking a significant 28.75% increase. This surge is not happening in isolation. It is part of a wider market rebound, suggesting a renewed confidence flowing back into digital assets. However, specific catalysts for SUI appear to be amplifying its gains beyond the general market trend. A major development fueling this optimism was the recent announcement from Coinbase. The prominent exchange confirmed it would support SUI trading for its users in New York, a key regulatory jurisdiction. This kind of institutional endorsement provides crucial liquidity and accessibility, often acting as a powerful catalyst for price appreciation. Therefore, the SUI cryptocurrency is benefiting from both macro tailwinds and project-specific positive news. How Does Broader Market Sentiment Affect SUI? It’s impossible to discuss the SUI cryptocurrency’s performance without acknowledging Bitcoin’s role. As the market leader, Bitcoin often sets the tone for investor sentiment across the entire crypto space. Its current recovery is pulling many altcoins, including SUI, upward. This correlation highlights a fundamental truth: while individual project news is vital, the overall health of the crypto market remains a dominant force. For investors, this creates a layered opportunity. The SUI cryptocurrency is demonstrating: Resilience: Recovering strongly from recent market pressures. Fundamental Strength: Gaining validation through major exchange support. Market Synergy: Moving in concert with a recovering broader ecosystem. What Are the Key Takeaways for Crypto Investors? The dramatic rise of the SUI cryptocurrency offers several actionable insights. First, it underscores the importance of monitoring both macro trends and micro-developments. A project can have strong fundamentals, but a bearish market can suppress its price. Conversely, a market recovery can lift all boats, especially those with recent positive news. Second, exchange listings, particularly in strict regions like New York, are more than just logistical updates. They are strong signals of a project’s compliance and long-term viability, which can attract a new wave of institutional and retail investors. For the SUI cryptocurrency, this has translated into immediate and substantial buying pressure. Conclusion: A Promising Sign in a Recovering Market The nearly 29% surge in the SUI cryptocurrency is a compelling narrative of recovery and validation. It showcases how a combination of broader market optimism and specific, positive project developments can create powerful momentum. While cryptocurrency investments are inherently volatile, moves like this highlight the dynamic opportunities within the space. The SUI cryptocurrency’s performance is a beacon, suggesting that well-positioned projects can thrive as market sentiment improves. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How much did the SUI cryptocurrency price increase? On December 3rd, the SUI cryptocurrency surged approximately 29%, reaching a price of around $1.74. What caused the SUI price to surge? The surge was driven by a combination of a broader cryptocurrency market recovery led by Bitcoin and a specific announcement that Coinbase would support SUI trading for users in New York. Is SUI’s recovery sustainable? Sustainability depends on continued positive market sentiment and further development of the SUI network’s ecosystem and adoption. While the current rally is strong, investors should always be aware of market volatility. What does Coinbase supporting SUI mean? It means increased accessibility and liquidity for the SUI cryptocurrency, as users on a major, regulated exchange can now easily trade it. This is often seen as a sign of credibility and can attract more investors. Should I invest in SUI after this surge? This article provides information, not financial advice. Any investment decision should be based on your own research, risk tolerance, and understanding of the cryptocurrency market’s volatility. Where can I track the price of the SUI cryptocurrency?

The platform has temporarily suspended Bithumb DIS withdrawals , citing ongoing network issues with the DisChain protocol. This development raises important questions for investors and highlights how major exchanges manage technical challenges. Why Did Bithumb Suspend DIS Withdrawals? Bithumb announced the temporary suspension of Bithumb DIS withdrawals due to what they describe as “network issues” affecting the DisChain (DIS) protocol. The exchange has not provided a specific timeline for resolution, but they emphasize this is a precautionary measure to protect user funds. When blockchain networks experience instability, exchanges often pause transactions to prevent: Failed transactions that could result in lost funds Double-spending risks during network consensus problems Wallet synchronization issues that could compromise transaction accuracy This proactive approach demonstrates Bithumb’s commitment to security, though it understandably causes concern among DIS holders awaiting access to their assets. What Does This Mean for DIS Investors? If you hold DIS tokens on Bithumb, you might wonder how this affects your investment strategy. First, understand that Bithumb DIS withdrawals being suspended doesn’t mean your tokens are lost or inaccessible for trading. Typically in these situations: Trading continues normally – You can still buy, sell, or trade DIS on Bithumb’s platform Deposits may also be affected – Often, exchanges pause both deposits and withdrawals during network issues Internal transfers remain available – Moving DIS between your Bithumb accounts usually continues uninterrupted The temporary nature of this suspension means Bithumb’s technical team is likely working directly with DisChain developers to resolve the underlying network problems. However, the lack of a specific restoration timeline requires patience from users. How Do Major Exchanges Handle Technical Issues? Bithumb’s handling of Bithumb DIS withdrawals suspension follows industry-standard protocols for managing blockchain network problems. Major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken have similar procedures when facing technical challenges: Immediate communication through official channels and user notifications Precautionary measures to protect user funds from potential loss Technical collaboration with the affected blockchain’s development team Regular updates as the situation progresses toward resolution This incident serves as a reminder that cryptocurrency investments carry technical risks beyond market volatility. Blockchain networks, especially newer ones like DisChain, can experience growing pains that temporarily affect functionality on exchanges. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors When exchanges announce suspensions like Bithumb DIS withdrawals , savvy investors take specific steps to protect their interests. Consider these practical actions: Monitor official channels – Follow Bithumb’s announcements for restoration updates Verify information sources – Avoid rumors on social media; stick to official statements Review your security – Ensure your exchange account has two-factor authentication enabled Diversify storage – Consider using hardware wallets for long-term holdings once withdrawals resume Remember that temporary suspensions, while inconvenient, often prevent more serious problems like irreversible transaction failures. The exchange’s priority is protecting your assets, even when that means restricting access temporarily. Conclusion: Patience During Technical Resolutions The temporary suspension of Bithumb DIS withdrawals represents a standard security response to blockchain network instability. While frustrating for users needing immediate access to their DIS tokens, this precautionary action ultimately serves to protect investor funds. Bithumb’s transparent communication about the network issues provides reassurance that technical teams are working toward a solution. As the cryptocurrency ecosystem matures, such incidents highlight the importance of exchange reliability and the complex technical infrastructure supporting digital assets. Frequently Asked Questions Can I still trade DIS on Bithumb during the withdrawal suspension? Yes, typically trading continues normally even when withdrawals are suspended. You can buy, sell, and trade DIS tokens on Bithumb’s platform throughout this period. How long will Bithumb DIS withdrawals remain suspended? Bithumb has not provided a specific timeline. The duration depends on how quickly the DisChain network issues are resolved. The exchange will announce when withdrawals resume. Are my DIS tokens safe on Bithumb during this suspension? Yes, your tokens remain secure in Bithumb’s custody. The suspension is a precautionary measure to prevent potential transaction problems, not an indication of security breaches. Should I be worried about my DIS investment? Temporary withdrawal suspensions are common in cryptocurrency exchanges when blockchain networks experience technical issues. This doesn’t necessarily reflect on DIS’s long-term value, only current network stability. Will Bithumb compensate users for the inconvenience? Exchanges rarely provide compensation for technical suspensions unless they result from exchange errors rather than blockchain network issues. Check Bithumb’s official announcements for any compensation programs. Can I withdraw DIS to another exchange once withdrawals resume? Yes, once Bithumb restores DIS withdrawal functionality, you can transfer your tokens to any compatible wallet or exchange that supports DisChain deposits. Found this breakdown helpful?

Strategy T-Rex ETFs Plummet Nearly 85% NewsBTC reported that the company’s CEO, Phong Le, suggested the possibility of selling some of their Bitcoin holdings in light of the current market conditions. Alongside this, the company’s leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also faced substantial losses, intensifying worries about Strategy’s financial health. Reuters highlighted that Strategy’s leveraged ETFs, which are designed to magnify returns on the firm’s stock, have been among the largest casualties of this year’s cryptocurrency slump. Related Reading: You Won’t Believe How Much Bitcoin Companies Now Hold, What % Of Supply Do They Control? Two specific ETFs, the T-Rex 2X Long MSTR Daily Target ETF and the Defiance Daily Target 2x Long MSTR ETF, have seen dramatic declines, losing nearly 85% of their value this year. Additionally, the T-Rex 2X Inverse MSTR Daily Target ETF has dropped by 48% in the same time frame. In this environment, shares of Strategy, MSTR, have fallen more than 40% this year, driven primarily by Bitcoin’s price crash. Investor attention is now focused on Strategy’s “mNAV” (market net asset value) metric, which compares the company’s enterprise value to its Bitcoin holdings. Following Le’s comments, where he mentioned the firm might consider selling cryptocurrencies if the mNAV drops below 1, concerns grew about the firm’s long-term outlook. Current estimates place this ratio around 1.1, according to calculations by Reuters. Analysts Remain Optimistic Mike O’Rourke, the chief market strategist at JonesTrading, noted that Le’s remarks diminish the company’s message of steadfastness in holding Bitcoin, even amid market volatility. The company has also revised its full-year outlook, warning of a potential profit ranging from $6.3 billion to a loss of $5.5 billion, a stark adjustment from its earlier forecast of $24 billion in net profit. This prior estimate, made on October 30, anticipated Bitcoin reaching $150,000 by year-end. Commenting on the shifting strategies within the firm, Vincenzo Vedda, chief investment officer at DWS, remarked, “Great strategy from Strategy, while prices go up. When they go down, well, the strategic options left to the company are limited.” Related Reading: Here’s What To Expect If The XRP Price Holds $2 Since entering the Nasdaq 100 index, Strategy’s shares have dropped more than 70% from their peak in November 2024, more than halving in value over the year. Despite this dismal performance, analyst sentiments remain relatively optimistic; of the 16 brokerages monitoring Strategy, 10 recommend it as a “buy” while four suggest a “strong buy,” with an overall median price target of $485, reflecting a potential 183% increase over the next year based on LSEG data.

55284742,638127,1764741646,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55284742.jpeg,"Grayscale Rejects 4-Year Cycle Thesis, Says Bitcoin Could Hit New ATH In 2026",https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-4-year-thesis-bitcoin-hit-new-ath-2026/,"Grayscale Research has gone against the grain, rejecting Bitcoin’s popular 4-year cycle thesis and saying new highs could be possible next year. Grayscale Research Doesn’t Believe A Prolonged Bitcoin Decline Is Coming Yet In a new report , Grayscale Research has discussed what the latest pullback in the market could mean for Bitcoin. This drawdown, which began in early October and lasted until two-thirds of the way into November, resulted in a price decrease of about 32% from peak to trough. While the scale of the drop hasn’t been small, Grayscale has noted that it has still been close to the historical average for bull market drawdowns. “Since Bitcoin’s price bottomed in November 2022, it has declined at least 10% nine times,” said the crypto asset manager’s research arm. “It has been a bumpy ride, but not atypical for a Bitcoin bull market.” 2026 will mark four years since the 2022 bear market. Among BTC traders, there is a popular idea that the cryptocurrency’s price cycles run over a length of roughly four years. According to this thesis, the next year could see the asset go down, as it has now enjoyed three years of appreciation. The 4-year cycle thesis originates from the fact that Bitcoin Halving events are spaced apart by approximately four years. During such an event, BTC’s block subsidy, a fixed reward that miners receive for adding the next block to the chain, is slashed in half. As the block subsidy is the only way to mint more of the cryptocurrency, Halvings have a direct effect on its supply growth. This scarcity effect of the Halving is what has made many in the community believe that the event sits in the center of bullish phases. Historically, Bitcoin has seen large drawdowns about every four years, which has strengthened the belief in the idea of a cycle being four years in length. Grayscale doesn’t think that the current cycle will go the same way, however. “Although the outlook is uncertain, we believe the four-year cycle thesis will prove to be incorrect, and that Bitcoin’s price will potentially make new highs next year,” explained the report. Grayscale Research has given three reasons for this expectation. The first is the fact that the latest BTC cycle hasn’t seen any phase of parabolic price increase, as the below chart highlights. The second is that Bitcoin has seen a shift this cycle, with instruments like exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and digital asset treasuries (DATs) bringing in fresh capital. Before, BTC relied on inflows through retail exchanges. Lastly, Grayscale has pointed out that the macro market backdrop is still looking favorable for cryptocurrencies; the potential for lower interest rates and continued progress on bipartisan digital asset legislation could drive institutional investment. BTC Price At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $87,000, unchanged from one week ago.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|btc|BTCUSDT|Grayscale|Grayscale Bitcoin|Grayscale Research,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-03 06:00:46

A newly referenced projection from Google Gemini provides fresh clarity on where XRP could end the year, presenting a data-based assessment rather than relying on social sentiment or speculative narratives. With market uncertainty still shaping investor expectations, this new information from Google Gemini adds a measurable reference point for analyzing XRP’s outlook heading into the final months of 2025. Understanding the Context Behind the New Projection XRP continues to be a closely monitored asset due to its established role in high-liquidity markets, ongoing institutional interest, and its relevance in discussions around next-generation settlement infrastructure. Market participants have been reevaluating their expectations as XRP trades within a narrow range. Against this backdrop, a structured forecast such as the one provided by Google Gemini offers a clearer framework for interpreting XRP’s possible year-end performance. Google Gemini’s Price Projection for Year-End 2025 According to Google Gemini, XRP is projected to reach a range of $2.80 to $3.20 by December 31, 2025. This forecast is based on assumptions regarding a moderate market recovery, stable liquidity conditions, and a gradual return of confidence among both retail and institutional participants. Google Gemini emphasizes that its estimate reflects a balanced expectation—not heavily leaning toward optimism or pessimism, but acknowledging the combined impact of current market pressures and steady underlying demand. How the Projection Compares With Broader Market Analysis The price range identified by Google Gemini aligns with several mid-level forecasts that suggest XRP may experience measured progress if the broader market stabilizes. Other analysts have pointed to potential year-end ranges between $2.40 and $2.70 under neutral conditions, while more bullish studies anticipate possible movement above $3.00 if catalysts materialize. The $2.80 to $3.20 range, therefore, places Google Gemini’s view slightly above conservative expectations but still within realistic bounds based on recent market behavior. Recent Developments That Could Influence the Outlook Several ongoing developments may impact the accuracy of Google Gemini’s projection. One important element is the recent decline in XRP supply on exchanges , which has reduced readily available liquidity and increased sensitivity to changes in market demand. Combined with the long-standing structure in which a significant portion of XRP remains in escrow, this supply contraction makes short- and medium-term price movements more responsive to buying activity. If demand strengthens, particularly from institutional or high-volume traders, the reduced exchange float could provide conditions that support upward price movement. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory conditions also remain a central influence. While recent months have not delivered disruptive rulings, regulatory clarity continues to evolve across multiple regions. Any advancement that enables banks, payment companies, or fintech platforms to deepen their involvement with blockchain-based settlement tools could enhance confidence in related assets. The Role of Market Sentiment Even with structured projections, sentiment-driven behavior continues to influence short-term volatility. Whales, leveraged traders, and algorithmic market participants can create rapid price swings, particularly as the year draws to a close and liquidity fluctuates across exchanges. Google Gemini’s projection assumes a relatively stable environment, but unexpected movements driven by sentiment could push XRP outside the estimated range, either upward or downward.

The move comes less than two days after it dumped to $84,000 in the latest violent leverage flush. The asset has now recovered all losses from that drawdown and is sitting at a crucial resistance point. The move has also reignited market sentiment, which has turned bullish once again in this very unusual cycle. Analyst ‘Daan Crypto Trades’ observed the monthly candle sweep, stating, “whenever a new month instantly moves up or down, and leaves no wick or anything behind, these levels are often taken out. This was a very quick and clean example of that.” Total Market Cap Sweeps Lows He also observed that the total crypto market capitalization retook June lows, “and is showing some solid low time frame strength.” “For December to be able to show some further relief, you’d want to see this start making those higher lows and higher highs on the low time frame first. Breaking last week’s high would confirm such a local higher high.” $BTC There is the monthly candle high sweep already. That did not take long. As said before, whenever a new month instantly moves up or down, and leaves no wick or anything behind, these levels are often taken out. This was a very quick and cleann example of that. https://t.co/o2u4zdGcFP pic.twitter.com/wfCA071Xtk — Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) December 2, 2025 Total cap is currently $3.2 trillion, according to CoinGecko, down around 27% from its all-time high of $4.4 trillion in early October. Glassnode reported that “large short-liquidation clusters” were forming, but this is not necessarily a bad thing as “short liquidations can act as fuel for upside, as forced buyers amplify momentum.” Meanwhile, analyst ‘Sykodelic’ echoed the bullish sentiment, stating , “Everyone on the timeline was absolutely losing their minds yesterday with that dip. But it was exactly what we wanted to see.” However, analyst ‘CryptoCon’ wasn’t so bullish, labelling the latest move a bear trap. “On every price bump, you’ll see: ‘Bottom’s in, new ATHs soon.’ That’s the bear market trap,” he said before adding: “The bear market usually takes the full year to play out, so it’s a long, painful process.” Elsewhere on Crypto Markets Bitcoin’s rebound has been good for Ether, which shadowed it, reclaiming $3,000 once again. This is also a key resistance level for the asset, which needs to show strength above it to retake $3,400 next. Many of the altcoins were seeing greater gains, with Solana adding almost 10% to reach $140, Cardano up 12.5% to $0.44, and Chainlink surging 15% as it approached $14. Nevertheless, most altcoins have been battered so badly over the past month that these gains are still very minor.

Key Takeaways: The UK has formally recognized cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as legal property through a new Act of Parliament. The law confirms digital assets can be owned, inherited, and recovered. Industry groups say the change strengthens investor protection and supports Britain’s push to become a digital-finance hub. The Property (Digital Assets etc) Bill was granted royal assent this week, confirming it as law, after being announced in the House of Lords by John McFall. With the approval of King Charles, digital assets will now be protected under property law rather than being left in a gray area shaped mostly by court rulings. Industry Hails UK Crypto Property Law as ‘Massive Step Forward’ Industry groups welcomed the decision as a long-awaited breakthrough. Bitcoin Policy UK called the law “a massive step forward” for Bitcoin and other digital assets, while trade body CryptoUK said Parliament has now written into statute what judges had already been applying through individual cases. Until now, common law had often treated digital tokens as property, but only through scattered judgments. The new law follows advice issued in 2024 by the Law Commission of England and Wales, which urged lawmakers to classify crypto as a distinct form of personal property to avoid uncertainty around ownership disputes. Under UK law, personal property traditionally falls into two categories: physical objects, known as “things in possession,” and contractual rights, referred to as “things in action.” The problem, legal experts noted, was that crypto did not easily fit into either group. BREAKING: UK JUST OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED #BITCOIN AND CRYPTO AS PROPERTY UNDER LAW NATION STATE GAME THEORY PLAYING OUT pic.twitter.com/6wfAoFL5CJ — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 2, 2025 The new legislation resolves that ambiguity by confirming that “a thing that is digital or electronic in nature” can still be treated as personal property, even if it does not meet older definitions. CryptoUK said this change makes it easier for courts to settle disagreements involving stolen funds, inheritance cases or company failures involving digital holdings. “This gives digital assets a much clearer legal footing, especially for proving ownership or recovering tokens after fraud,” the group said in a statement. The government also views the change as part of a broader effort to make Britain a hub for digital finance. Data from the financial regulator shows around 12% of UK adults hold some form of cryptocurrency, a figure that has risen steadily in recent years. UK Weighs Ban on Crypto Donations As reported, the UK government is considering a ban on cryptocurrency donations to political parties, a move that could directly affect Reform UK, which recently became the first party in the country to accept digital assets. The proposal is under review as part of the upcoming Elections Bill, according to people familiar with internal discussions, though officials have yet to formally confirm the plan. The debate follows Reform UK’s push to present itself as Britain’s most crypto-friendly party under the leadership of Nigel Farage. Furthermore, the UK government has moved a step closer to overhauling how decentralized finance activity is taxed, backing a new framework that would spare users from triggering capital gains each time they deposit tokens into lending protocols or liquidity pools.

Two white Jaguar sedans weaved through a two-lane tunnel last September, switching lanes together in synchronized moves. Both were Waymo vehicles, the self-driving cars once famous for being overly careful on the road. Sophia Yen, who runs a startup and was driving behind them, couldn’t believe what she saw. “I had never seen anyone switch lanes in that tunnel,” she told Wall Street Journal. “It’s driving more like a taxi driver—an aggressive, New York taxi driver.” The change marks a big departure from how these cars used to operate. For years, Waymo vehicles were the most courteous drivers around San Francisco. Meet one at a stop sign and it would always wait for you to go first. The robot cars are now looking out for themselves first. They’re bending some traffic rules, showing less patience with people crossing streets, and acting on the belief that being too nice doesn’t work in city traffic. Waymo’s traffic violations and safety incidents emerge Police in San Bruno, California stopped a Waymo in September after watching it make an illegal U-turn. The same month, one of the vehicles struck and killed a well-known cat in San Francisco’s Mission neighborhood. On a recent Thursday, a Waymo at a four-way stop accelerated alongside another car instead of waiting its turn. Moments later, it changed lanes without signaling. A Waymo vehicle drove dangerously close to a police felony stop in downtown Los Angeles early one Sunday morning following a vehicle chase, creating a tense moment captured on video. The driverless car made a left turn and passed within feet of a white truck that police had pulled over at the corner. Several police cruisers had their lights flashing, and the suspected driver was face down on the street. The Los Angeles Police Department said the incident happened around 3:40 a.m. at Broadway and First Street, outside Times Mirror Square and downtown’s federal courthouse. The department said the vehicle’s closeness and failure to avoid the traffic stop didn’t change how officers handled the situation. Police temporarily shut down the intersection afterward, which is standard procedure. The police department’s Traffic Coordination Division develops protocols for driverless vehicles. It wasn’t clear if they would investigate. The division stays in regular contact with Waymo as the technology develops. Jennifer Jeffries, who’s 54 and lives in Pacific Heights, has spent almost 3,000 minutes riding in Waymo cars since May 2024. She used to avoid them for downtown trips because they couldn’t handle tight situations. Once she sat stuck for several minutes while a Waymo waited behind a double-parked car being used for furniture delivery. Now she has no concerns about taking them anywhere and thinks they handle as well as human rideshare drivers, possibly better. “They will go around a car or get closer to a car than a human driver would,” Jeffries said. “Sometimes I’ll be in the back seat and I’ll be like, ‘Ooh that was really close.'” She’s noticed one problem though. Like some rideshare drivers, they sometimes stop across the street from the pickup address, “which I don’t appreciate,” she said. Waymo defends “confidently assertive” strategy The company has been working to make its vehicles “confidently assertive,” according to Chris Ludwick, a senior director at Waymo , which is owned by Alphabet, Google’s parent company. “That was really necessary for us to actually scale this up in San Francisco, especially because of how busy it gets.” Ludwick explained that when the cars are too passive, they cause problems. Regular software updates keep them from becoming troublesome or causing disorder. While Ludwick wouldn’t discuss specific rule violations, he said the vehicles make practical choices that require balancing different priorities. “The driver is designed to respect the rules of the road,” Ludwick said. “However, sometimes this is a nuanced topic and road rules can even conflict with each other.” Don’t just read crypto news.

This currency split creates both danger and opportunity for cryptocurrency traders watching traditional finance markets for signals. The rupee’s plunge past 90 against the dollar marks a critical moment for emerging market currencies, while Australia’s economic resilience offers a contrasting narrative in the Asia-Pacific region. Indian Rupee Collapse: What’s Driving the Record Low? The Indian rupee has broken through the psychologically significant 90 level against the US dollar, reaching its weakest point in history. This dramatic move reflects multiple pressures converging on India’s currency: Dollar Strength: The US Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance continues to boost dollar demand globally Oil Price Pressure: India’s massive oil imports become more expensive as crude prices remain elevated Capital Outflows: Foreign investors are pulling funds from Indian markets amid global risk aversion Trade Deficit Concerns: India’s import-export imbalance puts persistent pressure on the currency Currency Pair Current Level Previous Record Year-to-Date Change USD/INR 90.25 89.95 (2023) +4.8% AUD/USD 0.6650 0.6600 (support) +2.3% Australian Dollar Defies Gravity with Strong GDP Performance While the Indian rupee struggles, the Australian dollar is showing remarkable strength following better-than-expected GDP data. Australia’s economy grew 0.6% in the latest quarter, exceeding market expectations of 0.4%. This resilience in the face of global economic headwinds has several implications: Commodity Support: Australia’s resource exports continue to benefit from strong global demand Interest Rate Differential: The Reserve Bank of Australia maintains relatively higher rates compared to other developed economies China Recovery: Improving economic conditions in China, Australia’s largest trading partner, provide tailwinds Risk Appetite: The AUD often serves as a proxy for global risk sentiment in currency markets Asia FX Markets: A Tale of Two Currencies The divergence between the Indian rupee and Australian dollar highlights the complex dynamics in Asia FX markets. Regional currencies are responding differently to common global factors: Common Pressures: US dollar strength across the board Global inflation concerns Central bank policy divergence Geopolitical tensions affecting trade flows Diverging Responses: Commodity exporters (AUD, MYR) showing resilience Net importers (INR, KRW) facing greater pressure Current account positions determining vulnerability Domestic economic fundamentals creating differentiation Forex Trading Implications for Cryptocurrency Investors These currency market movements have significant implications for cryptocurrency traders and investors. Traditional forex markets often provide early signals for digital asset movements: Key Connections: Dollar strength typically pressures Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies Emerging market currency weakness may drive capital toward crypto alternatives Risk-on/risk-off sentiment flows between traditional and digital assets Institutional positioning in forex often correlates with crypto market moves The Indian rupee’s collapse could potentially increase cryptocurrency adoption in India as citizens seek alternatives to preserve wealth. Meanwhile, Australian dollar strength might indicate improving risk appetite that could benefit crypto markets broadly. Actionable Insights for Market Participants What should traders and investors do in response to these Asia FX developments? For Forex Traders: Monitor RBI intervention levels for USD/INR Watch Australian employment data for AUD direction clues Consider carry trade opportunities in rate differentials Implement proper risk management given increased volatility For Cryptocurrency Traders: Watch dollar index (DXY) for broader market direction Monitor capital flow patterns from emerging markets Consider correlation patterns between traditional and digital assets Prepare for potential volatility spillovers FAQs: Understanding the Asia FX Market Moves What is causing the Indian rupee to hit record lows? The Indian rupee is facing multiple pressures including strong US dollar demand, elevated oil prices, capital outflows from Indian markets, and concerns about India’s trade deficit. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has limited intervention capacity given foreign exchange reserve considerations. Why is the Australian dollar strengthening despite global headwinds? The Australian dollar benefits from strong GDP growth, resilient commodity exports, relatively high interest rates compared to other developed economies, and improving economic conditions in China. The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) maintains a relatively hawkish stance compared to other central banks. How do these currency moves affect cryptocurrency markets? Traditional currency movements often influence cryptocurrency markets through several channels: risk sentiment transmission, capital flow patterns, and institutional positioning. Dollar strength typically pressures cryptocurrencies, while emerging market currency weakness may increase crypto adoption as an alternative store of value. What should traders watch next in Asia FX markets? Key indicators include: RBI intervention levels around 90-91 for USD/INR, Australian employment data, Chinese economic indicators, US Federal Reserve policy signals, and global risk sentiment measures. The US Federal Reserve decisions particularly impact all Asian currencies. Are other Asian currencies facing similar pressures? Yes, many Asian currencies are under pressure from dollar strength, but the degree varies. Commodity exporters like the Australian dollar and Malaysian ringgit show more resilience, while net importers like the Indian rupee, South Korean won, and Japanese yen face greater challenges. Conclusion: Navigating the Asia FX Divide The dramatic split between the collapsing Indian rupee and strengthening Australian dollar reveals the complex reality of today’s Asia FX markets. While common global forces affect all currencies, domestic fundamentals create crucial differentiation. For cryptocurrency participants, these traditional market movements offer valuable signals about risk appetite, capital flows, and broader financial market dynamics. The rupee’s record low represents both a warning about emerging market vulnerabilities and a potential catalyst for increased cryptocurrency adoption in affected regions.

At the moment, ADA appears to gain traction in reaching the price of $0.50. At the same time, another altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has its own strong demand wave taking place, with its Phase 6 presale close to being sold out. These two factors make up an attractive scenario for those looking for the best cryptos to invest in today, giving them both tried-and-true options for rebounding cryptos and innovative emerging cryptos with accelerated growth rates. Cardano Shows Strength with $0.50 Target The current display by Cardano (ADA) is one of strength as its price rises 3% to trade at $0.43. Notably, the price increase by ADA takes place when there has been considerable shift in market sentiment, especially in the derivative market. Information obtained shows that the market’s funding rate in ADA has turned positive, meaning that people who took long positions are essentially paying those who took short positions. Further evidence comes from the Chain data analysis that reveals big whale buying, as big wallets are increasingly holding long positions. Also, from the technical perspective, all signs appear positive, as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence indicator presents a buy signal indicator. With such a high level of social dominance at 9.6%, emphasizing the important role its presence plays in market chatter, Cardano seems poised towards further advances towards the important $0.50 level. Mutuum Finance Approaches Phase 7 Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a unique and urgent prospect in the list of the top cryptos to invest in today and gain exponential returns. Its ongoing presale has emerged as something of a phenomenon and has already managed to accumulate more than $19,050,000 from 18,270 unique holders in an impressively brief span of time. It is in phase 6 at the moment and sells MUTM tokens at $0.035, which is up by 250% from its original price in phase 1. The current stage of events establishes an urgent need to participate in this phase, as it is already above 95% capacity. It represents the last opportunity to invest at such low rates; after the completion of phase 6, phase 7 will follow with an increase of close to 20% to $0.040. At $0.06, the exchange launch price, players who invest at such low rates are projecting beyond 400% ROI, solidifying MUTM as the next big cryptocurrency to explode in the future. Pioneering Stablecoin Design In addition to the success in the presale stage, Mutuum Finance is building an intricately developed dual-market lending framework, in which its to-be-launched Over-Collateralized Stablecoin can definitely be considered to be the support backbone. The decentralized, $1 pegged digital stablecoin will be issued by borrowers who have provided the requisite list of support collaterals. Not only does it increase the diversity of collaterals in the system, but it will offer all users in the ecosystem a stable unit of account. The interest produced from the collaterals in the reserves will help feed the treasury in the project, making the whole ecosystem around the MUTM stable in nature and therefore useful to all users in the long run. Mutuum Finance with such innovation in stablecoins makes it attractive in the future defi crypto technology ecosystem. Final Investment Strategy To make the presale event even more appealing, Mutuum Finance has come up with an enormous giveaway of $100,000 in celebration of the support shown by its community. In this giveaway, ten lucky participants will win $10,000 in MUTM tokens. With the rapidly approaching presale deadline, an attractive roadmap including the testnet launch in Q4 of 2025, and strong community rewards, it presents an opportunity that can hardly be rivaled. For someone carefully evaluating where to invest in the crypto market today, the evidence is clear: MUTM presents a rare blend of low cost of entry, high future growth prospects, and actual product development. For people looking to invest in the best crypto to buy today, having MUTM tokens before phase 6 sell out offers the most advantageous opportunity.

Key Takeaways: Kalshi became CNN’s official prediction markets partner after raising $1B at an $11B valuation. CNN will display Kalshi’s real-time probabilities in broadcasts, including a live on-screen ticker. The funding round, led by Paradigm, signals strong investor confidence in prediction markets as a mainstream data source. Under the agreement , Kalshi’s real-time market data will be used inside CNN’s newsroom to support reporting on politics, economics, and major cultural events. CNN staff will have access to Kalshi’s probability data, which reflects how users price future outcomes based on trading activity. CNN to Launch Kalshi-Powered Live Prediction Ticker The network will also introduce a live, Kalshi-powered ticker during coverage segments that use market data. The integration will be overseen by CNN Chief Data Analyst Harry Enten, whose work focuses on applying data-driven insights to political and social reporting. Kalshi said the partnership is designed to provide viewers with clearer signals on emerging trends by showing how markets are reacting in real time. The announcement comes as Kalshi confirms a $1 billion Series E funding round led by crypto-focused investment firm Paradigm, with participation from Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, and ARK Invest. The round more than doubles Kalshi’s previous $5 billion valuation from an October raise. Kalshi chief executive Tarek Mansour said markets are becoming a new way to measure public expectations. “Kalshi is replacing debate and opinion with markets and accuracy,” he said, adding that users increasingly want information reflected through price action rather than speculation. Kalshi raised $1B at an $11B valuation. A decade ago, only a few thousand people knew what a prediction market was. Eighteen months ago, most prediction markets were banned – until we overcame the government to set them free.

According to Token Terminal data cited by the company, Kalshi posted record trading volume of $4.54 billion in November, beating October’s $4.49 billion. Kalshi said weekly volumes are now exceeding $1 billion, representing growth of more than 1,000% since 2024. Its closest competitor, Polymarket, also recorded a strong November, hitting a monthly total of $3.76 billion after crossing $3 billion in October. Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan recently said prediction markets are among the most reliable indicators for forecasting real-world outcomes. As reported, Mike Novogratz’s Galaxy Digital is in talks with Polymarket and Kalshi about becoming a liquidity provider, as on-chain betting on real-world events draws more attention from both retail traders and Wall Street. Galaxy, which has built its brand around providing crypto infrastructure and services to institutional clients, would act as a market-maker on the platforms, posting regular bids and offers to deepen trading. Meanwhile, Kalshi is currently facing a nationwide class action lawsuit alleging the platform operates like an unlicensed sportsbook and misrepresents pricing advantages versus traditional betting markets. The company has not admitted wrongdoing.

StraitsX said it’ll integrate its infrastructure within UPay’s broader payments ecosystem, which also includes Google Pay and Apple Pay, expanding the utility of its stablecoin assets. It’s a big deal for StraitsX, as UPay has developed a comprehensive and fast-growing digital finance platform spanning both cryptocurrency and traditional fiat services. Its main offering is its crypto credit card , which like other services of its nature, can be used to spend cryptocurrency directly out here in the real world at millions of merchants globally, without needing to exchange it first. Transactions simply convert the crypto into the equal amount of fiat, which is then sent straight to the merchant’s bank account. UPay’s services also expand to crypto loans, allowing people to deposit their crypto holdings as collateral to borrow other assets, plus a “savings” feature that uses staking to generate interest for savers. Singapore-based StraitsX should be a welcome addition to UPay’s ecosystem, for it’s the issuer of one of the most regulated stablecoins in the world in the shape of XUSD . It’s regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore and fully compliant with local regulations, which inspire confidence that XUSD is indeed pegged 1:1 with the U.S. dollar and backed by verified holdings of fiat and other liquid assets. Stressing that the partnership is an important one, UPay Chief Executive Owen Yang said it will expand his company’s capability to bridge the fiat monetary and cryptocurrency systems. “We are not just offering a payment card; we are offering a passport to the future of global finance, and StraitsX is the cornerstone of that bridge,” he promised. Under the collaboration, XUSD will become available in UPay’s wallet, with users able to spend it at more than 175 million merchants that accept VISA cards. It adds to XUSD’s growing utility, making it spendable in the real world, in addition to its status as a trusted stablecoin asset. StraitsX has gotten a lot of momentum in terms of partnerships lately. Earlier this month, it struck gold when it revealed it’s now partnering with delivery and ride-sharing giant Grab and Ant International. In the case of Grab, it’s working with GrabPay and Alipay+ on a new, low-cost and instant cross-border settlement service, which could integrate XSGD , StraitsX’s second stablecoin that’s pegged to the Singaporean dollar. Earlier this year, StraitsX said it’s working with RedotPay to support its collaboration with Visa on a new crypto credit card solution it plans to launch in Southeast Asia. StraitsX co-founder and Head of Partnerships Tianyao Liu said the partnership is about more than just real-world payments, for it also helps to lay the groundwork for a system that allows businesses and consumers alike to move value across borders without excessive costs or hassles. “We are laying down the tracks for a new financial future, built on trust and seamless accessibility,” he said.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|FIAT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-03 07:39:15

Speaking on Bloomberg TV this week, Phong Le, the company’s Chief Executive Officer, said the company could be forced to sell part of its stash if the market keeps dragging the stock price below the value of its Bitcoin. “We really don’t want to have to utilize that Bitcoin at times when our equity value goes below that of the Bitcoin holdings,” Phong said on Tuesday. “Our objective is to pay the dividend into perpetuity.” The warning from Phong followed a move by the company to raise $1.4 billion in cash reserves, funded through share sales. That money buys 21 months of breathing room, possibly up to two years, to continue paying out dividends and interest without dipping into the crypto holdings. The cash cushion is there to calm fears that the company might have to start selling off Bitcoin to cover its growing financial commitments. Strategy eyes token lending, considers last-resort sale But if things get worse, Phong didn’t deny that a Bitcoin sale is absolutely on the table. In a podcast last week, he made that clear, saying there’s a “mathematical side” and an “emotional side” to the decision, and that logic tends to win out. “There’s the mathematical side of me that says that would be absolutely the right thing to do, and there’s the emotional side of me, the market side of me, that says we don’t really want to be the company that’s selling Bitcoin. Generally speaking, for me, the mathematical side wins.” There’s another option on the table too. Strategy is now looking into lending out its Bitcoin, which is a major change from its original “buy and hold” approach. “When they [traditional finance firms] enter that space, and we have different counterparty, lending Bitcoin is something we would consider and I think we would be enthusiastic about,” Phong said . As you should know, Strategy was a software company until 2020, when Michael Saylor, the co-founder and current Chairman, made the call to start converting corporate cash into crypto, justified by concerns over inflation. Wall Street barely understood it at first, but investors chasing Bitcoin exposure quickly bought in. The stock took off, rallying more than 3,500% at its peak and beating every major index. But now that trade is unraveling. Strategy’s stock has dropped roughly 65% from its all-time high in November 2024, as the Trump-fueled post-election crypto euphoria faded. At the same time, more companies have jumped on the same crypto treasury model that Saylor pioneered, erasing the uniqueness that once gave Strategy its edge. The mNAV, which tracks how Strategy’s value compares to its Bitcoin holdings, is now 1.17, dangerously close to flipping negative. That scenario could easily trigger sales of Bitcoin, just to avoid being valued like a zombie stock. Earnings forecast swings between billions in losses or profits In October, Strategy told investors it expected Bitcoin to hit $150,000 by the end of 2025. That’s now been revised down to $85,000 to $110,000. Depending on where Bitcoin lands, operating income could end up being anywhere from a $7 billion loss to a $9.5 billion profit. The company says the wild swing is due to accounting rules that require it to value Bitcoin at market price at the end of each quarter. Net income could range from a $5.5 billion loss to a $6.3 billion gain, while diluted earnings per share may fall between a $17 per-share loss and a $19 profit. Investors are already reacting. Strategy’s stock jumped 8% on Tuesday, the same day Bitcoin rose 6.5% to around $92,000. That bounce followed a new purchase by the company; 130 Bitcoin for $11.7 million, bought using common shares. The buy came after a full week of no activity in its wallet. Still, the company is now dealing with the side effects of being a leveraged Bitcoin proxy. Index providers are watching. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase said Strategy could be dropped from major equity indexes, which would mean billions in outflows from passive funds.

The situation has created a historic valuation gap, meaning investors can effectively buy Strategy’s Bitcoin at a discount while getting its software business and operations for a negative price. A Bizarre Market Disconnect According to the financial commentary platform, The Kobeissi Letter, even after accounting for Strategy’s $8.2 billion debt load, its net BTC holdings are worth about $48.6 billion, meaning the market is assigning a negative value to everything else the company does. This inversion has deepened during a sharp stock sell-off. Since early October, MSTR shares have fallen roughly 57%, with analysts pointing to several compounding pressures. Research firm Bull Theory noted that JPMorgan had raised margin requirements for trading MSTR, short interest had grown, and a potential reclassification by index provider MSCI early next year threatens to trigger billions in institutional selling. “This does not look like regular market movement,” it posted. “It looks like large players actively pushing the stock lower.” That perspective was echoed and intensified by author Shanaka Anslem Perera, who framed the upcoming decision by the global index giant as a critical countdown. “MSCI decides whether Bitcoin treasury companies belong in stock indices. JPMorgan calculates $2.8 billion in forced selling if Strategy is removed. Index funds do not choose. They execute,” he stated. Both analyses reinforced the view that external market mechanics, rather than the company’s fundamentals, are behind the decline. Community Debate Over Strategy and Risk Meanwhile, Strategy had earlier moved to fortify its balance sheet in response to the market turbulence, announcing a new $1.44 billion cash reserve, funded by previous stock sales, that would specifically cover dividend and interest payments for at least 21 months. Although Executive Chairman Michael Saylor framed it as a step to “navigate short-term market volatility,” a comment made by CEO Phong Le about potentially liquidating portions of the firm’s stash to fund dividend payments below 1x mNAV elicited more reaction from the online BTC community. Critics claimed it contradicted Saylor’s long-standing mantra that the firm would “never sell,” while supporters viewed the cash reserve as a sign of strength. “Strategy just pulled off one of the cleanest liquidity pivots in modern corporate finance,” commented investor Adam Livingston, arguing the move protects the company from forced BTC sales. The intense focus has also raised concerns about concentration risk, as Strategy now controls over 3% of the total Bitcoin supply. Crypto commentator Ran Neuner expressed caution regarding the situation, stating, “We really don’t want MSTR buying more BTC at this stage… the concentration risk is VERY HIGH!” The post MSTR Stock Hits Record Discount as Bitcoin Holdings Outweigh Value appeared first on CryptoPotato .",AA News|Crypto News|Bitcoin|MicroStrategy,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-12-03 07:42:39

The surge marks a sharp reversal for the digital asset market, which rebounded last week after four straight weeks of steep outflows. The digital asset market staged a strong rebound as ETPs saw $1.07 billion in net inflows, signaling renewed investor confidence, improved sentiment, and a potential resurgence in crypto momentum after weeks of cautious trading. Notably, Bitcoin and Ethereum were the top beneficiaries of the market rebound. Bitcoin led with $464 million in inflows, reaffirming its role as the primary gateway for institutional crypto investment. Ethereum followed with $309 million, its strongest weekly inflow in weeks, reflecting optimism around upcoming network upgrades, potential ETF expansions, and improving macro conditions. XRP stole the spotlight with record-breaking inflows, signaling rising institutional interest and renewed confidence in its long-term potential. The magnitude of these inflows suggests XRP is emerging as a favored diversification asset in institutional portfolios. Well, the return of billion-dollar inflows into digital asset ETPs reflects shifting sentiment amid a stabilizing global macroeconomic environment. With cooling inflation and steadier interest rate expectations, investor appetite for risk-on assets, including crypto, has surged. This trend suggests digital assets may be entering a new accumulation phase as institutions position ahead of potential catalysts in early 2026. While it’s uncertain if these inflows will drive sustained price gains, their scale and timing send a strong signal to the market. XRP’s record-breaking weekly performance may be an early indicator of broader recovery and renewed institutional engagement. Conclusion CoinShares’ latest data highlight a resurgence in institutional appetite, with XRP leading the charge at a record $289M inflow amid a broader $1.07B weekly rebound in digital asset ETPs. Strong inflows into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP signal renewed investor confidence and suggest the crypto market may be approaching a pivotal turning point after weeks of caution.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-03 07:50:34

While the Indian rupee has plunged to a historic low beyond 90 against the US dollar, the Australian dollar is gaining significant ground following stronger-than-expected GDP data. This currency split reveals the complex dynamics shaping Asia FX markets and offers crucial insights for traders and investors monitoring regional economic health. Indian Rupee Hits Record Low: What’s Driving the Decline? The Indian rupee has breached the psychologically significant 90 level against the US dollar, marking a new all-time low for the currency. This development represents a critical moment for India’s economy and raises important questions about the country’s financial stability. Several factors are contributing to this downward pressure on the Indian rupee. Key factors affecting the Indian rupee: Rising US Treasury yields attracting capital away from emerging markets India’s widening trade deficit and current account imbalance Persistent inflationary pressures despite recent monetary tightening Global risk aversion affecting all emerging market currencies Foreign institutional investor outflows from Indian equity markets Currency Pair Current Level Change (24h) Year-to-Date Performance USD/INR 90.25 +0.85% -8.2% AUD/USD 0.6650 +0.65% +3.1% USD/JPY 148.20 -0.15% +12.5% Australian Dollar Gains Momentum on Strong Economic Data While the Indian rupee struggles, the Australian dollar is demonstrating remarkable resilience and strength. The currency’s recent gains are directly tied to Australia’s robust economic performance, particularly the latest GDP figures that exceeded market expectations. This positive development in the Australian dollar provides a contrasting narrative within the Asia FX landscape. The Australian economy expanded by 0.6% in the latest quarter, beating forecasts of 0.4% growth. This stronger-than-expected performance has several implications: Increased likelihood of further interest rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of Australia Improved investor confidence in Australia’s economic fundamentals Strong commodity exports supporting the currency despite global headwinds Resilient domestic consumption and employment figures Asia FX Markets: A Tale of Two Economies The divergence between the Indian rupee and Australian dollar highlights the broader trends shaping Asia FX markets. Currency movements across the region reflect varying economic fundamentals, monetary policy approaches, and external vulnerabilities. Understanding these dynamics is essential for anyone participating in currency markets or monitoring regional economic developments. Several Asian currencies are facing pressure similar to the Indian rupee, while others show resilience like the Australian dollar. The Chinese yuan remains relatively stable due to careful management by the People’s Bank of China, while Southeast Asian currencies exhibit mixed performance based on their individual economic circumstances and policy responses. Economic Indicators Driving Currency Movements Currency markets are fundamentally driven by economic indicators, and the current Asia FX movements provide a clear case study. The contrasting performance of the Indian rupee and Australian dollar demonstrates how different economic data points can lead to opposite currency outcomes. Monitoring these indicators is crucial for anticipating future currency movements. Key economic indicators affecting Asia FX markets: GDP growth rates and economic expansion data Inflation figures and central bank policy responses Trade balances and current account positions Foreign investment flows and capital movement trends Global commodity prices and their impact on export economies What Does This Mean for Forex Traders and Investors? The current Asia FX situation presents both challenges and opportunities for market participants. The record low in the Indian rupee suggests potential for further depreciation or a possible reversal if policy measures prove effective. Meanwhile, the Australian dollar’s strength may continue if economic data remains positive, though it faces headwinds from global risk sentiment and commodity price fluctuations. Actionable insights for market participants: Monitor Reserve Bank of India interventions for potential rupee support Watch Australian employment data for confirmation of economic strength Consider correlation between Asian currencies and global risk appetite Evaluate carry trade opportunities in higher-yielding Asian currencies Assess impact of currency movements on regional equity markets FAQs: Understanding the Asia FX Market Dynamics What is causing the Indian rupee to hit record lows? The Indian rupee is facing multiple pressures including capital outflows, a widening trade deficit, and global risk aversion. The Reserve Bank of India faces challenges balancing inflation control with currency stability. Why is the Australian dollar performing well despite global uncertainty? The Australian dollar benefits from strong domestic economic data, particularly GDP growth that exceeded expectations. The Reserve Bank of Australia’s relatively hawkish stance compared to other central banks also supports the currency. How do these currency movements affect cryptocurrency markets? Currency volatility in traditional markets often correlates with increased interest in cryptocurrencies as alternative assets. Significant movements in major fiat currencies can influence cryptocurrency trading volumes and price action. What role does the Reserve Bank of India play in currency management? The Reserve Bank of India actively manages the rupee through market interventions and policy measures. The central bank uses foreign exchange reserves to smooth volatility and maintain orderly market conditions. How does the Reserve Bank of Australia influence the Australian dollar? The Reserve Bank of Australia sets monetary policy that directly affects the Australian dollar. Interest rate decisions, forward guidance, and economic assessments all contribute to currency valuation. What impact do US Federal Reserve policies have on Asia FX markets? US monetary policy significantly influences Asia FX markets through interest rate differentials and capital flows. The Federal Reserve’s decisions affect the US dollar’s strength, which in turn impacts Asian currency pairs. Conclusion: Navigating Volatile Currency Waters The dramatic movements in Asia FX markets, with the Indian rupee hitting record lows and the Australian dollar gaining on strong economic data, highlight the complex interplay of global and domestic factors shaping currency valuations. These developments underscore the importance of monitoring economic indicators, central bank policies, and global risk sentiment when participating in currency markets. The divergence between these two major Asian currencies serves as a powerful reminder that regional economic fundamentals ultimately determine currency performance, even amid broader global trends.

55289350,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=871967,1764748811,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55289350.jpeg,Oracle’s bond-market stress climbs to a 16-year high,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/oracle-bond%e2%80%91market-stress-highest-16-years/,"Oracle just landed at the center of the AI debt fear storm. On Tuesday in New York, a key credit‑risk gauge tied to Oracle’s debt closed at its highest point since the global financial crisis. The cost to protect Oracle against default climbed to about 1.28 percentage points per year, the highest since March 2009, based on end‑of‑day credit derivative pricing from ICE Data Services. That reading jumped almost 0.03 percentage point in a single day and has now more than tripled from 0.36 percentage point in June. This spike followed a heavy wave of bond sales across the tech sector, with Oracle standing out due to both its volume of issuance and its weaker credit rating versus rival cloud giants. The company has issued tens of billions of dollars in bonds in recent months through its own note sales and through large projects it is backing. That combination has turned Oracle’s credit default swaps into a frontline hedge for investors positioning for a possible AI market crash. Debt sales surge and CDS trading explodes The rising price of default protection tracks growing fear over the wide gap between how much cash has already been poured into AI and when real gains in productivity and profits will actually show up. Hans Mikkelsen, a strategist at TD Securities, said the current surge carries echoes of past market manias. “We’ve had these kinds of cycles before,” he said in an interview. “I can’t prove that it’s the same, but it seems like what we’ve seen, for example, during the dot‑com bubble.” Morgan Stanley raised fresh alarms in late November, warning that Oracle’s growing debt pile could push its credit default swaps closer to 2 percentage points, just above the company’s 2008 record high. Tuesday’s reading marked the highest close since March 2009, when the gauge touched 1.30 percentage point. Oracle remains the lowest‑rated of the major hyperscalers. In September, the company sold $18 billion in U.S. high‑grade corporate bonds. Its data center expansion is also tied to the largest AI‑infrastructure deal yet to hit the market. The company’s AI push is closely linked to OpenAI , and the database firm is counting on hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue from OpenAI over the next several years. As of the end of August, Oracle carried about $105 billion in total debt, including leases, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Roughly $95 billion of that sits in U.S. bonds included in the Bloomberg U.S. Corporate Index. That makes Oracle the biggest issuer in the index outside the banking industry. Investor demand for protection has surged fast. Trading volume in Oracle’s CDS ballooned to about $5 billion in the seven weeks ended Nov. 14, according to an analysis of trade‑repository data by Barclays credit strategist Jigar Patel. That figure was just a little over $200 million in the same period last year. Bond supply expands as AI spending accelerates The AI buildout is not slowing. Spending to expand AI infrastructure and power capacity is expected to push deep into next year. TD’s Mikkelsen projects that U.S. investment‑grade corporate bond sales could reach a record $2.1 trillion in 2026. Issuance for this year already stands above $1.57 trillion, based on Bloomberg News data. Another wave of debt could stretch demand even further. If buyers get overwhelmed, issuers may need to offer higher yields to clear the market. Mikkelsen expects credit spreads to settle into a base range of 100 to 110 basis points above benchmarks in 2026, compared with 75 to 85 basis points in 2025. Heavy borrowing is not new. Other sectors have run massive debt cycles before. The healthcare industry spent years adding leverage last decade as it chased growth yet managed to keep spreads tighter than the broader index, according to Citigroup credit strategists Daniel Sorid and Mathew Jacob in a note dated Nov. 24. Still, those strategists spelled out the risk facing bond investors tied to AI. Corporate bond holders have limited upside if the AI boom takes off. If companies continue to pour money into artificial‑intelligence spending, the credit quality of those debt holdings could weaken. “Investors are becoming increasingly concerned about how much more supply may be on the horizon,” the Citigroup team wrote. “The impact of this hesitation on spreads for the sector has been quite notable.” If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

Bitcoin Has Seen A Flash Recovery Back To $92,000 Bitcoin suffered a blow on Monday as its price slipped under $84,000, but just as quickly as it had crashed, the cryptocurrency has made a swift recovery on Tuesday. Related Reading: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders See First Uptick Since April Lows: Bullish Sign? With the asset’s price now floating above $92,000, its price has surged by more than 8% over the last 24 hours. Like is usually the case, Bitcoin hasn’t been alone in this rally; the rest of the cryptocurrency market has also shot up alongside the number one digital asset. Some of the top altcoins have even managed to outperform BTC, with Ethereum (ETH) sitting in a profit of nearly 10% for the past day. The fresh wave of volatility in the sector has triggered a liquidation squeeze in the derivatives market. Crypto Liquidations Have Crossed $400 Million In Last 24 Hours According to data from CoinGlass, the cryptocurrency market as a whole has suffered over $410 million in liquidations during the past day. “Liquidation” here naturally refers to the forceful closure that any contract undergoes after it has amassed a certain percentage of loss (as defined by the platform). Considering that the price action in this window was majorly to the upside, it’s not surprising to see that short contracts made up for most of the derivatives flush. As is visible in the above table, $348 million in short positions found liquidation in the last 24 hours, equivalent to about 85% of the total flush. In terms of the individual symbols, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana were the top three contributors to the liquidation event with $196 million, $95 million, and $18 million in positions, respectively. Just $13 million of the Bitcoin liquidations involved long investors; the rest $182 million in liquidations struck the traders betting on a bearish outcome for the cryptocurrency. A mass liquidation event like this latest one is popularly known as a squeeze. Today’s squeeze involved shorts in an extreme majority, so the event will be termed a short squeeze. During a squeeze, a sharp swing in the price triggers a large derivatives flush, which only ends up feeding back into the price move. The amplified price swing then unleashes a further cascade of liquidations.

According to a company announcement and follow-up reports, the rollout is already live in more than 100 SPAR stores and is planned to expand to 300+ locations across the country. Stores Now Accept Crypto At the till, paying is simple. Customers scan a DFX.swiss “OpenCryptoQR” with a supported wallet such as Binance Pay, pick a cryptocurrency from a long list, and confirm the payment on their phone. Reports say the system supports 100+ cryptocurrencies and that DFX.swiss converts the payment into Swiss francs on the spot, so stores receive fiat rather than crypto. Merchants Stand To Cut Costs According to the rollout materials, stores could cut fees by roughly two-thirds compared with traditional card processing. Transactions are described as gas-free when using Binance Pay in the checkout flow, which supporters say makes the process affordable for retailers as well as quick for customers. Crypto Payments Now in the SPAR App! @SPARInt is officially rolling out Crypto Payments in their brand-new Swiss app! We’re very happy that SPAR has integrated our @OpenCryptoPay solution into their app, bringing crypto payments to everyone. Getting started is as easy as it… pic.twitter.com/wBM0k7mUKP — DFX (@DFX_swiss) December 1, 2025 Pilot Tested Bitcoin Lightning In Zug The wider effort follows tests earlier this year. Based on reports, SPAR first tried Bitcoin payments at a store in Zug, using the Lightning Network to make small payments instant and cheap. That pilot is cited as part of what convinced partners to move forward with a larger rollout.

MASSIVE pic.twitter.com/qZFbWTS5Zl — The Bitcoin Historian (@pete_rizzo_) December 1, 2025 How Shoppers Will Use It People who already hold crypto can now use it to buy everyday items like bread and milk. According to press material, shoppers need only a smartphone with a supported wallet app. For those who prefer stablecoins, the system supports major dollar- and euro-pegged coins, which are converted at checkout so the retailer avoids exposure to price swings. What To Watch In The Months Ahead Reports indicate the initial rollout covers more than 100 outlets and aims to cover the whole SPAR network of roughly 300 stores in Switzerland, but no single date for full completion has been given. Observers will likely track how many customers actually use crypto at the supermarket, how smoothly conversions to Swiss francs work in busy stores, and whether the lower fees translate into any savings for shoppers or improved margins for stores.

Xaif (@Xaif_Crypto), a well-known crypto proponent, shared a video of German analysts discussing the recent spot XRP ETFs. Xaif drew attention to the growing focus on these products. This coverage is proof that XRP has entered a new phase of global competition. Xaif suggested that this level of attention shows how fast interest is growing. Interest in XRP ETFs The analysts compared recent market volumes across major ETFs. They reported that XRP’s valuation reached approximately $289 billion, with Ethereum at roughly $312 billion. They also noted that the new XRP spot ETFs had already reached comparable levels to established ones. Their message was clear. The fresh fund is not lagging. It is moving into the same range as products with a strong market presence . The analyst in the video called the performance a “really great achievement.” He noted that a little more attention could bring even greater performance. Xaif pointed to this reaction as evidence that the market sees strength in XRP’s early ETF activity. German media is now updating the new XRP Spot ETFs live on air and they’re already saying the fresh XRP ETF is nearly on the same level as the established ones. It feels like the global race for XRP has officially begun ETFs launching, media tracking it https://t.co/jv4cPAE3g3 pic.twitter.com/20ETNxHwWn — Xaif Crypto | (@Xaif_Crypto) December 2, 2025 Why Xaif Believes This Moment Matters Mainstream validation is critical. When large media outlets track XRP ETFs on air, it indicates the asset has reached a new level of relevance. XRP’s early ETF performance has also reinforced the confidence of many market participants. The live coverage confirms that institutions and analysts treat XRP as a serious market asset. For Xaif, the message from the broadcast captured the current shift. The analysts did not describe XRP as a fringe product. They place it beside established ETFs. Their focus on volume showed that they think the current inflows and trading activity are substantial. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Growing Visibility for XRP Xaif’s message shows confidence in XRP’s direction. He said the growing coverage shows that the race for XRP exposure has started. His focus on the German broadcast supported that claim. The segment depicted XRP as a rising asset with ETF activity that sits near long-standing products. This signals a change in how the global market measures XRP in the financial system. Several spot XRP ETFs have launched in the U.S. in recent months. These include offerings from REX-Osprey, Canary Capital, Franklin Templeton, and more. These funds have outperformed expectations. There are also rumors that BlackRock and Fidelity plan to join the XRP ETF race . As the attention surrounding XRP grows, the existing funds might grow even faster.

However, the king of cryptocurrencies is not out of the woods yet. With the price currently up against horizontal resistance, and with the main down trend line overhead, there is still work to be done by the bulls. $10,000 surge running out of steam? Source: TradingView The Bitcoin bulls really pulled their weight on Tuesday which was exactly what the situation called for. At one point, the $BTC price had dipped below the major trendline, and it seemed that the previous $80,000 low may have been in danger. However, the bulls sprang into action and a $10,000 surge was the extremely quick result. The surge took the price back above the major trendline, through another descending trendline and resistances, until it perhaps ran out of steam at the $94,000 horizontal resistance. There is perhaps still some gas left in the tank to surmount this resistance and even retest the main downtrend line. That said, this was quite a powerful surge, and the shorter term momentum indicators are starting to reach their tops. Possibly the best scenario for the bulls from here would be for the price to chop sideways for a few days in order to achieve a reset. The opposite scenario would be for the price to fall back below the major trendline. W pattern confirmation next? Source: TradingView The daily chart shows that a W pattern is still playing out. As can be seen, the W has formed, and the $BTC price has come up past the neckline. The next logical move would be for the price to come back to the neckline to test it and confirm the pattern. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI is still looking positive. The indicator line broke through the downtrend line and has tested and confirmed the breakout. This is a very good sign for the price action, as this would normally follow the RSI. Is the $BTC price in a huge wedge pattern? Source: TradingView Looking at the weekly chart, and viewing the previous big patterns that have formed during this bull run, it can be seen that in the current price action there is the possibility of an even bigger wedge pattern than the previous one. Given that price will normally break out of these patterns before coming to the end of them, this allows the current wedge pattern to overlap the major ascending trendline. The price would normally break out to the upside from a falling wedge pattern. At the bottom of the chart, first the Stochastic RSI has its indicators crossed back to the upside, promising big price momentum if the indicator lines get above the 20.00 level. Then the Relative Strength Index is showing some concern. The indicator line has dipped below a line that is normally associated with bear market activity. If this is a fakeout, it is a big one, and the bulls will need to really get a rally going in order to bring this indicator line back above the key 44.00 support level. Other than that, things are still balanced nicely. Bitcoin has been walking the cliffedge, and a slip could still spell disaster. Nevertheless, things are looking ripe for a recovery and a potential surge back to a new all-time high is starting to look like a distinct possibility.

The drastic loss of more than 61 million tokens in circulation has inspired hopes of a price upswing, with experts targeting a breakout above the $0.000009 level. At the same time, while assets such as SHIB make waves in the market, another equally strong up-and-comer in the crypto market, whose name is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , has already started to make waves. Mutuum Finance has already emerged as a strong contender in the current presale phase. Shiba Inu’s Burn Mechanism Lights Up Market Hopes The drastic exchange in Shiba Inu prices can easily be related to the sharp increase in its “burn” rate. The destruction of millions of tokens every day impacts scarcity, thereby defining a basic economic fact since the removal of tokens precedes an increase in prices. Actually, the number of tokens burned in the past week stands at 99 million. The collective efforts have helped to support market sentiment and have thereby aided in keeping the value of SHIB strong. The current technical analysis shows a neutral to positive momentum; nevertheless, it appears that the market is extremely prone to the volatility exhibited by meme cryptocurrencies. Although its current performance in the market is remarkable, experienced traders are concurrently spreading their investments in other projects with superior grounds. Mutuum Finance Enters as a Leading Defi Investment in the Crypto Industry Although there is volatility in the price of Shiba Inu, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is already carving out a niche in the list of the top cryptocurrencies to invest in today. The current presale process of Mutuum Finance has gathered significant attention, showing immense investor confidence in the market, with $19,050,000 collected from 18,270 wallets. The current Phase 6, which offers tokens at $0.035, stands at 95% completion, giving prospective buyers a limited window of opportunity to invest in the tokens before costs rise. The phase gives investors the final chance to acquire the MUTM tokens at the current level because in the next phase, where there shall be a close to 20% jump in price to $0.040. Compared to the listing price of $0.06, current retail buyers are setting up for lucky returns that can easily breach 400% after listing. It cements its position as one of the cryptos to invest in today to gain fabulous gains. In addition, Mutuum Finance is celebrating its successful presale by giving out an monumental $100,000 giveaway, where ten lucky winners will receive $10,000. To make matters easier accessible to all buyers, they have included direct purchases using credit cards. For anyone who is undecided about which cryptocurrency to invest in in order to get the most out of both worlds, both in terms of advantages acquired in the presale process and benefits in terms of the protocol itself, Mutuum Finance definitely comes out tops. Establishing Oneself in a High-Growth Trajectory Mutuum Finance represents much more than another new cryptocurrency; it represents an organized DeFi project and has progressed towards the actual product offering. They have formally announced the development timeline where it plans to offer V1 protocol support on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. It represents an important phase where lending pool, collateral management, and other such operations would come into existence. Safety always comes first, and as such, there is an independent audit being led by Halborn Security of the lending and borrowing contracts. For any investor looking to know the next cryptocurrency to explode in today’s market, having all these aspects in place makes MUTM an exemplary choice when deciding which cryptocurrency to invest in today. With Phase 6 nearing completion, the need to invest in the next big cryptocurrency has never been so urgent. A Strategic Moment for Crypto Allocation The current state of the crypto market offers a story of two investments: the volatility in SHIB or other such tokens and the development of tokens in the presale stage like Mutuum Finance. Although the burning pace in the case of SHIB can be considered positive, its future can easily go up or down. In comparison, Mutuum Finance has already chalked out its future through the ongoing presale process and its ample financial support. For those who are investing in finding the most appropriate cryptocurrency in which to invest, MUTM offers an opportune and high-potential entrance into a development that has the potential to grow to drastic proportions.

Bitcoin’s negative futures curve and risk-off macro environment risk further downside, undermining EMPD’s investment case. I see no discount or compelling reason to own EMPD, given capital impairment risks and lack of management credibility. Empery Digital Inc. ( EMPD ) has taken a hit because of the declines in Bitcoin USD ( BTC-USD ). Based on the share repurchase that they've done since the close of books, they trade pretty close to NAV. The signals for Bitcoin in the futures market are simply bad. The futures curve shows an apprehensive market, and one must always remember that the dynamics of Bitcoin are that they only perform in risk-on environments. The economic setup means downside risk. We will not touch EMPD, and we want to remind you that a stock like this uses leverage to engage in crypto markets and carries serious capital impairment risks that any intelligent investor must take seriously. Latest Data and Results Let's start with a balance sheet snapshot to run through our logic. Balance Sheet (SEC.gov) As of September 30th, the net value on the balance sheet was around $440 million. Since then, the digital assets, which make up almost the entire assets of the company other than $19 million in cash, have gone down by around 25%. That means around $110 million in declines of the assets. On top of that, the company did a buyback at the unfortunate price of $6.99 , where the shares now trade at $4.8. This was for around $100 million of shares repurchased coming from a revolving credit facility. That means $100 million increase in debt. That repurchase has already lost 30% of its value with the decline to $4.8 from almost $7, so around another negative $30 million to the assets. With $100 million increase in liabilities since the end of the last quarter and around $140 million decline in assets, the net asset value declined by around $240 million. That puts it at around $200 million in NAV. The stock trades at around $213 million in market cap, which means EMPD trades at just about NAV. No discount to speak of as a newly formed Bitcoin treasury business. As a reminder from our previous coverage , this company used to be called Volcon, and they were trying to launch some powersports bikes that were pretty appealing, but they never got that business off the ground. They ""pivoted"" into being a Bitcoin treasury business with no prior interest, connection or exposure to Bitcoin. The fortunes of this stock are linked to Bitcoin from here on out, assuming the management doesn't poorly time leveraged share repurchases, amounting effectively to leveraged purchases of Bitcoin in a falling knife environment. Having done this the decline in Empery's stock since the close of books has been more severe than that of Bitcoin. Data by YCharts Bitcoin has performed poorly due to a general concern about tech valuations related to the AI bubble and an evident exodus of cash from the crypto world. Bitcoin futures expiring in 3 months' time are at a smaller premium to spot prices since at least a year signaling the bearish market outlook and lack of bottom-buying demand. Bitcoin is a terrible allocation in a risk-off environment and everyone who follows the market knows it. In the current environment characterised by a lower rate outlook associated with genuine growth concerns, enough apparently for markets to believe the current inflation would be derailed, constitutes an environment ripe for risk-off sentiment. Bottom Line We are not impressed by Bitcoin. The reason has always been related to pool mining administration defeating the appeal of decentralisation, and also the ongoing regulatory barriers and overall immorality associated with Bitcoin's illicit uses which lead to serious risks from a regulatory perspective in the long term. Some other cryptos have addressed these decentralisation concerns in different ways but Bitcoin being the crypto progenitor doesn't have these innovations and cannot later have them due to the nature of Blockchain design. With market indicators pointing negatively for Bitcoin in our view, and then the added layer that there is no reason to trust in EMPD management of a Bitcoin treasury business, we will likely never hazard money in this stock.",BTC-USD|EMPD,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-12-03 09:30:06

The leading South Korean cryptocurrency exchange has successfully restored all Upbit deposit and withdrawal services after a remarkably brief, planned suspension. This swift action highlights a proactive approach to platform security, a critical concern for every crypto trader. Let’s break down exactly what happened and why this temporary pause is actually a sign of strength for the exchange. What Caused the Upbit Service Suspension? Early today, Upbit users experienced a short interruption. The exchange temporarily suspended Upbit deposit and withdrawal services for some digital assets. However, this was not due to a hack or a system failure. Instead, it was a deliberate, scheduled action. The suspension lasted only four minutes, from 3:32 a.m. to 3:36 a.m. UTC. During this window, Upbit’s engineering team executed a comprehensive wallet system rebuild. This technical procedure is akin to reinforcing the foundation of a bank vault while it’s briefly closed for maintenance. Why Would Upbit Rebuild Its Wallet System? Think of a crypto exchange’s wallet system as the heart of its security and operations. Over time, even the best systems need upgrades to handle increased traffic, new asset types, and evolving security threats. Upbit’s decision to rebuild this core system demonstrates a commitment to long-term stability. The primary goals of such an operation are: Enhanced Security: Implementing the latest protocols to protect user funds from potential threats. Improved Stability: Ensuring the system runs smoothly during high-volume trading periods. Future-Proofing: Creating a scalable infrastructure to support new features and assets. Therefore, this brief pause in Upbit deposit and withdrawal services was a strategic investment in user safety and platform reliability. How Does This Compare to Other Exchange Outages? In the crypto world, exchange disruptions often cause panic. Lengthy, unexplained outages can signal deep technical problems or security incidents. Upbit’s handling of this event stands in stark contrast. The suspension was: Brief: A mere four-minute window. Communicated: The exchange provided a clear reason for the action. Planned: It was part of a scheduled upgrade, not an emergency response. This transparent and efficient management of core Upbit deposit and withdrawal services builds crucial trust with its user base. It shows the exchange prioritizes system integrity over avoiding any temporary inconvenience. What Should Upbit Users Do Now? With services fully restored, users can proceed with their transactions as normal. However, this event serves as a perfect reminder of essential crypto best practices: Verify Transactions: Double-check deposit and withdrawal addresses, especially after any service notice. Stay Informed: Follow official Upbit announcements for the most accurate information. Consider Self-Custody: For long-term holdings, moving assets to a personal hardware wallet reduces reliance on any single exchange’s operational status. The swift resolution means your access to Upbit deposit and withdrawal services is now more robust than before the upgrade. Conclusion: A Sign of Maturity, Not Malfunction The temporary halt of Upbit deposit and withdrawal services was a masterclass in proactive platform management. Rather than waiting for a problem to occur, Upbit’s team performed essential maintenance to fortify their systems. For the crypto industry, which constantly battles perceptions of instability, such disciplined operations are vital. They demonstrate that major exchanges are maturing, focusing on the unglamorous but critical work of infrastructure and security. This brief, planned suspension ultimately makes the platform more reliable for every user. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Was my crypto safe during the Upbit suspension? A1: Yes. The suspension was a planned technical upgrade to the wallet system, not a security breach. User funds remained secure in cold and hot wallets according to Upbit’s standard security protocols. Q2: Could I trade during the deposit and withdrawal suspension? A2: The notice specifically mentioned deposits and withdrawals for some assets. Spot trading for most pairs likely continued unaffected, but it’s always best to check the official announcement for exact details. Q3: How often does Upbit perform these kinds of maintenance upgrades? A3: While not frequent, reputable exchanges like Upbit periodically schedule major system upgrades to enhance security and performance. They typically announce these well in advance to minimize user impact. Q4: Should I be worried about future suspensions? A4: Short, planned maintenance suspensions are a normal part of running a secure tech platform. They are a positive sign that the exchange is actively improving its infrastructure. Unplanned, lengthy outages are more cause for concern. Q5: Did the suspension affect all cryptocurrencies on Upbit? A5: The announcement stated it affected “some digital assets.” Major assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum were likely included, but some smaller altcoins may not have been impacted. The exchange’s notice would have specified if certain assets were excluded. Q6: Where can I get official updates from Upbit? A6: Always rely on official channels. Check the “Notice” section on the Upbit website or app, or their verified social media accounts, for the most accurate and timely information.

After a turbulent November, XRP is clinging to key support levels, but sentiment is shifting as institutional investors diversify. While XRP remains a familiar portfolio anchor, growing attention is moving toward a new PayFi protocol seen by some analysts as an “XRP successor,” praised for enabling instant transactions that circumvent traditional banking barriers, something Ripple hasn’t fully delivered for everyday users. Meanwhile, CoinGlass data shows XRP’s open interest staying stable, even as on-chain activity surges for this rival network. Many investors are now favoring real-time usability over regulatory uncertainties. XRP Price Prediction: Will the RLUSD Stablecoin Trigger a Breakout? XRP is trying to recover the $2.00-$2.03 demand area following a steep pullback, yet the true test is yet to come as the price approaches the $2.18-$2.20 descending resistance that has been generating sell pressure consistently. Any rejection there would be an indication of another dip to the $2.03 level, and a clean breakout above $2.20 would be an indication of a potential target of $2.28. The most important invalidation is a decline of less than $2.00, which would destroy existing bullish action and indicate a shift back to the broader downside risk. Despite the lackluster short-term action, the long-term XRP price prediction remains positive. Yet, for those seeking the best crypto to invest in for immediate multipliers, XRP’s slow grind is frustrating. The opportunity cost of holding a stagnant asset while “XRP 2.0” competitors soar is driving a significant migration of capital. Unless a major catalyst like a full ETF approval occurs this week, the XRP price prediction is likely to remain neutral, forcing growth-focused investors to look elsewhere for the best crypto to invest in. Remittix (RTX): The “XRP 2.0” Taking the Market by Storm While the market debates the next XRP price prediction, Remittix is busy executing a takeover of the payments sector. This project has rapidly climbed the ranks to become the best crypto to invest in for 2025 because it solves the industry’s biggest headache: off-ramping. Unlike Ripple, which focuses on banks, Remittix focuses on you. With its wallet officially live on the Apple App Store, Remittix has moved from a roadmap promise to a tangible product, earning it the #1 Global Rank on CertiK for pre-launch tokens. Analysts are calling it “XRP 2.0” because it delivers on the promise of instant global payments without the red tape. Early buyers are already up significantly on paper as the presale smashes through the $28.4 million mark. The FOMO is palpable; whales are dumping stagnant legacy coins to load up on RTX, recognizing it as the best crypto to invest in before the public listings on BitMart and LBank send prices parabolic. Why Remittix Is The Superior Play: Wallet Live on App Store: Phase 1 is live and downloadable today, with real utility in your pocket.

The XRP price projection is limited to most analysts. Short term $1.50-$2.00, with limited upside relative to high-growth presales. Which cryptocurrency should one invest in? Remittix is the most promising crypto to invest in at the moment because of its live App Store wallet, number one CertiK rating, and colossal presale hype. Will Remittix be a better performer than XRP? Most analysts consider Remittix to be the most suitable crypto to invest in as a retail utility since it addresses off-ramping challenges that XRP fails to resolve for individual users.

Starting at 9:00 a.m. UTC on December 3, Bithumb will temporarily suspend all IP deposits and withdrawals. This proactive measure supports a necessary network upgrade for the Story token, ensuring its long-term stability and performance. If you use Bithumb for IP transactions, here is everything you need to know. Why is Bithumb Suspending IP Deposits and Withdrawals? Bithumb’s decision is a standard operational procedure in the cryptocurrency world. Exchanges often need to pause specific services to facilitate technical improvements. In this case, the suspension of IP deposits and withdrawals is directly tied to a planned network upgrade for the Story token itself. This is not a reaction to security issues or market volatility, but a scheduled maintenance step. The primary goal is to ensure a smooth and secure transition during the upgrade process. By temporarily halting the movement of IP tokens, Bithumb can: Prevent transaction errors or losses that could occur if the network changes mid-transfer. Synchronize its systems perfectly with the upgraded Story token protocol. Guarantee a seamless user experience once the upgrade is complete and services resume. What Does This Mean for Your IP Tokens? First and foremost, do not panic. A temporary suspension of IP deposits and withdrawals is a routine event. Your existing IP token balance in your Bithumb wallet remains safe and unaffected. You can still view your holdings, and the broader trading of IP tokens on the Bithumb spot market may continue as usual unless specified otherwise by the exchange. However, you will be unable to move IP tokens into or out of your Bithumb account during the maintenance window. Therefore, it is crucial to plan ahead. If you were considering a deposit or withdrawal of Story tokens around December 3, you should complete that transaction before 9:00 a.m. UTC or wait until Bithumb confirms the upgrade is finished. How Can You Stay Informed and Prepared? Staying updated is simple. Bithumb will communicate all details through its official channels. You should monitor the exchange’s website and official announcements page for the most accurate information. Specifically, look for two key updates: The official notice confirming the start of the suspension. The subsequent announcement confirming the successful completion of the upgrade and the resumption of all IP deposit and withdrawal services. This approach reflects Bithumb’s commitment to transparency and user security. By clearly communicating these planned technical pauses, they help users avoid confusion and manage their assets effectively. What Are the Broader Implications for the Story Token? Network upgrades are typically positive developments. For the Story (IP) token, this upgrade could introduce several benefits, such as: Enhanced transaction speed and lower fees . Improved security features and smart contract capabilities. Greater scalability to handle more users and transactions. While the temporary suspension of IP deposits and withdrawals on Bithumb is a minor inconvenience, it paves the way for a more robust and efficient network. This is a common growth step for any thriving blockchain project. Conclusion: A Brief Pause for Long-Term Gain In summary, Bithumb’s temporary halt on IP deposits and withdrawals is a standard, precautionary measure for a scheduled Story token network upgrade. It protects user assets and ensures a flawless technical transition. Your funds are secure, and the pause is expected to be short-lived. By planning your transactions around the December 3 window and following official Bithumb announcements, you can navigate this routine maintenance with ease. This upgrade ultimately strengthens the Story token’s infrastructure, benefiting all holders in the long run. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 1. Can I still trade IP tokens on Bithumb during the suspension? Typically, spot trading for the token continues unless Bithumb specifies otherwise. The suspension usually applies only to depositing to or withdrawing from the exchange’s wallets. Always check the official announcement for specific details. 2. Is my IP token balance on Bithumb safe during this time? Yes. The suspension affects the movement of tokens, not their storage. Your existing IP balance in your Bithumb account remains secure and untouched. 3. When will IP deposits and withdrawals resume? Bithumb has not announced a specific end time. The suspension begins at 9:00 a.m. UTC on Dec. 3 and will last until the network upgrade is successfully completed. The exchange will issue a new notice once services are restored. 4. What happens if I send IP tokens to my Bithumb deposit address during the suspension? This is not advised. Transactions sent during a suspension may not be credited automatically and could be lost or require manual recovery, which can be a lengthy process. Always ensure the service is active before making a deposit. 5. Does this suspension affect other cryptocurrencies on Bithumb? No. This announcement is specific to the Story (IP) token. Deposits and withdrawals for other cryptocurrencies on Bithumb should operate normally unless separate maintenance notices are posted. 6. Why doesn’t Bithumb do the upgrade without suspending services? Suspending deposits and withdrawals is a critical safety measure. It prevents transactions from being processed on an old version of the network while the exchange’s systems are updating to the new one, eliminating the risk of funds being sent to an incorrect or incompatible address.

This marks the ecosystem’s second major hard fork of 2025, following the Pectra upgrade that went live earlier this year. Data and Performance Improvements The update is scheduled for release at 21:49 UTC, introducing Peer Data Availability Sampling (PeerDAS) and increasing the network’s capacity to support high-throughput Layer 2 rollups. Tomorrow: Fusaka Ethereum’s second major upgrade this year. → Feature highlight: PeerDAS – Unlocking up to 8x data throughput. For rollups, this means cheaper blob fees and more space to grow. Learn more. https://t.co/3TOda5KjY2 pic.twitter.com/sEfeiTamy9 — Ethereum (@ethereum) December 2, 2025 The feature allows Ethereum validators to verify small, randomly selected portions of data instead of having to download entire blocks. This reduces bandwidth requirements by up to 85%, enabling an up to 8x increase in data throughput for Layer 2 networks that rely on the chain for settlement and security. To support this, Fusaka has included Blob Parameter Only (BPO) forks, which are small configuration changes that adjust the blob target, blob maximum, and fee update fraction. The upgrade also increases Ethereum’s block gas limit from 30 million to 150 million units, creating room for more transactions in each block. As a result, Layer 2 networks are expected to see a 40–60% drop in transaction fees, depending on overall chain activity and how quickly different rollups integrate the modifications. Fusaka further introduces EIP-7825, adding a per-transaction gas cap of about 16.78 million gas. This limit ensures that no single transaction can use an entire block’s capacity, reducing the risk of denial-of-service attacks and laying the groundwork for future execution improvements. Ethereum Rolls Out Second Major 2025 Hard Fork The update will be deployed to Ethereum’s mainnet following successful testnet activations on Hoodi, Sepolia, and Holesky. Fusaka is part of the chain’s broader modular roadmap, which aims to separate execution, data availability, and consensus layers to improve scalability without compromising decentralization. It is also the second major hard fork of 2025, following Pectra’s activation , and represents a coordinated improvement to the execution and consensus layers. Layer 2 networks such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and Base are expected to integrate PeerDAS in the coming weeks. These adoptions will allow them to post more data to Ethereum at lower cost, improving performance for end users and expanding the design space for decentralized applications. The next scheduled upgrade, Osaka, is expected in 2026 and will introduce blob streaming and stateless validator clients to further reduce costs and improve decentralization.

Despite growing expectations that the Bank of Japan might finally raise interest rates after years of ultra-loose policy, the yen has weakened to multi-decade lows against the US dollar. This unexpected divergence between monetary policy expectations and currency performance reveals deeper forces at play in global markets that could impact cryptocurrency valuations and trading strategies. Why Is the Japanese Yen Weakening Against All Odds? The Japanese yen’s depreciation presents a classic case of market forces overpowering central bank signals. While the Bank of Japan has hinted at potential policy normalization, several factors continue to weigh on the currency. The primary driver remains the massive interest rate differential between Japan and other major economies, particularly the United States. With the Federal Reserve maintaining higher rates to combat inflation, capital continues flowing out of yen-denominated assets into higher-yielding alternatives. Consider these key pressure points on the yen: Interest rate differentials with US Treasury yields exceeding 4% Japan’s persistent trade deficits reducing yen demand Global risk-on sentiment reducing safe-haven flows into yen Speculative positioning against the yen in forex markets Bank of Japan’s Dilemma: Rate Hike Expectations vs. Economic Reality The Bank of Japan faces a complex balancing act that makes aggressive rate hikes difficult. Despite inflation exceeding the 2% target, much of the price pressure comes from imported inflation rather than strong domestic demand. The central bank must consider Japan’s massive public debt, which stands at over 250% of GDP. Higher interest rates would dramatically increase debt servicing costs for the government. Factor Impact on Yen Bank of Japan Consideration Inflation above target Potentially supportive Mostly imported inflation Government debt levels Limiting factor for hikes 250%+ debt-to-GDP ratio Wage growth Key for sustainable inflation Remains modest Global monetary policy Creates divergence pressure Fed maintaining higher rates Forex Market Reactions to Yen Depreciation The forex market has responded to yen weakness with increased volatility and shifting currency correlations. Major currency pairs involving the yen have seen significant moves, with USD/JPY breaking through key psychological levels. This movement creates both risks and opportunities for traders. The yen’s role as a traditional safe-haven currency has diminished during this period, changing how markets respond to global risk events. Key observations from recent forex market behavior: USD/JPY breaking above 150 level, a critical threshold Reduced yen sensitivity to traditional safe-haven flows Increased correlation between yen pairs and global equity markets Growing intervention speculation from Japanese authorities Understanding Yen Depreciation: Beyond Simple Explanations Yen depreciation represents more than just interest rate differentials. Structural factors within Japan’s economy contribute to the currency’s weakness. Japan’s aging population and shrinking workforce create long-term demographic headwinds. The country’s manufacturing competitiveness has declined relative to neighbors like South Korea and China. Additionally, Japan’s energy import dependency has increased following the Fukushima nuclear disaster, creating persistent trade deficits that pressure the currency. Three structural challenges facing the yen: Demographic decline reducing domestic consumption and growth potential Energy import dependency creating chronic trade deficits Corporate governance issues limiting productivity growth Actionable Insights for Currency and Crypto Traders The yen’s unexpected weakness despite rate hike expectations offers valuable lessons for traders across asset classes. First, never underestimate the power of interest rate differentials in currency markets. Second, central bank forward guidance often matters less than actual policy implementation. Third, structural economic factors can override cyclical monetary policy changes. For cryptocurrency traders, understanding these forex dynamics can provide insights into broader market liquidity conditions and risk sentiment. Trading considerations in current environment: Monitor USD/JPY for intervention signals from Japanese authorities Watch for divergence between Bank of Japan rhetoric and action Consider yen weakness as indicator of global risk appetite Evaluate cryptocurrency correlations with yen during market stress FAQs: Japanese Yen Weakness and Monetary Policy What is causing the Japanese yen to weaken? The yen is weakening primarily due to interest rate differentials with other major economies, particularly the United States. Despite Bank of Japan rate hike expectations, actual Japanese rates remain near zero while US rates are significantly higher, driving capital outflows from yen assets. When might the Bank of Japan actually raise rates? Most analysts expect the Bank of Japan to proceed cautiously with rate hikes, potentially beginning in 2024. The timing depends on sustainable wage growth and inflation becoming domestically driven rather than imported. How does yen weakness affect global markets? Yen weakness affects global markets through several channels: it makes Japanese exports more competitive, impacts carry trade strategies, influences global liquidity conditions, and can signal broader risk sentiment in financial markets. What is the relationship between yen and cryptocurrency markets? The yen and cryptocurrency markets interact through several mechanisms. Yen weakness can indicate global risk appetite, which often correlates with cryptocurrency performance. Additionally, Japanese retail investors have been active cryptocurrency participants, creating direct demand connections. Could Japanese authorities intervene to support the yen? Yes, Japanese authorities have a history of currency intervention. The Ministry of Finance, which oversees currency policy, could authorize the Bank of Japan to intervene in forex markets if yen weakness becomes disorderly or threatens economic stability. The Japanese yen’s persistent weakness despite tightening expectations reveals the complex interplay between monetary policy, structural economic factors, and global market forces. While the Bank of Japan may eventually normalize policy, the currency faces headwinds that extend beyond interest rate differentials. For traders and investors, this situation underscores the importance of looking beyond central bank rhetoric to underlying economic realities and market positioning.

Key Takeaways: American Bitcoin shares plunged nearly 50% after newly unlocked stock hit the market following the lockup expiry. Eric Trump dismissed the selloff as expected and said he has no plans to sell his personal stake. Investor nerves remain high as ABTC is still down about 76% from its September peak despite strong earnings growth. Data from Google Finance showed ABTC plunged nearly 50% within the first hour of trading, falling to as low as $1.80 from a prior close of $3.58. The stock recovered modestly through the session but still ended the day down 38.83% at $2.19, highlighting the impact of newly unlocked shares hitting the market. Eric Trump Shrugs Off ABTC Selloff After Lockup Ends In a post on X, Eric Trump said the selloff was expected, noting that pre-merger private placement shares had just unlocked. He added that the company’s business remains strong and that he has no plans to sell his own holdings. American Bitcoin listed on Nasdaq in September after completing its merger with Gryphon Digital Mining. The sharp drop came despite solid financial results last quarter. In October, the company reported third-quarter revenue of $64.2 million, up from $11.6 million a year earlier, while net income swung to a $3.5 million profit from a $0.6 million loss. Chief executive Michael Ho said at the time the firm had more than doubled its mining capacity and improved margins, citing a seven-point increase quarter over quarter. Thanks @Coachjv_ . Today our pre-merger private placement shares unlocked — these early investors are freely available to cash in on their profits for the first time which is why we will see volatility. Our fundamentals are virtually unmatched and our differentiator: mining BTC… https://t.co/7h1Aqjt8iE — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) December 2, 2025 American Bitcoin has also been building its treasury. As of Nov. 13, the company said it held about 4,090 BTC, including coins kept in custody or pledged toward new mining equipment. Management has framed the strategy as a push to increase direct exposure to Bitcoin while also growing production volume. Even so, the recovery attempt failed to reverse a broader decline in the stock since its September peak of $9.31. Shares are now down roughly 76.5% from that high, reflecting investor caution around supply unlocks and volatility tied to early backers exiting positions. The selloff mirrors a wider slump in crypto-linked equities. Shares of Coinbase have fallen about 20% over the past month, while USDC issuer Circle is down 39%. Exchange operator Gemini has dropped 47% in the same period. Democrats Accuse Trump of Using Presidency to Enrich Family As reported, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee released a report accusing the Trump administration of using presidential authority to benefit the Trump family’s crypto businesses, claiming roughly $800 million was generated from token sales in early 2025. The report alleges the president blurred the line between public office and private profit, and estimates that Trump family crypto holdings could reach $11.6 billion, though exact values are difficult to verify. The findings raise concerns about foreign influence, focusing on investments in World Liberty Financial’s $WLFI token. Lawmakers highlight a reported $75 million investment by crypto figure Justin Sun while he faced regulatory scrutiny, and a separate $100 million purchase by an entity called Aqua 1 Foundation, which investigators say lacks clear corporate records. The fund’s leadership is also alleged to include figures tied to legal and geopolitical controversies.

In most jurisdictions, retail and institutional adoption was a major driver, while others cited the need to protect investors against growing losses. This prompted new legislation, accelerated the enforcement of existing laws, and brought markets closer to traditional finance. Currently, crypto exchanges and their promoters are required to obtain regulatory approval for licenses and financial disclosures. This article looks into how much the regulatory space has evolved, recent developments in the United States, European Union, and emerging markets, what’s in for traders, and future trends. The State of Global Regulation in 2025 The US Pivot: From “Enforcement” to “Framework” Globally, crypto regulations witnessed major headline shifts in the past year. In the United States, authorities moved from a regulation-by-enforcement to a clarity and stakeholder approach. President Trump’s first term and the Biden administration were riddled with fears, uncertain rules, and developers either threatened to or downright fled to friendlier jurisdictions. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed multiple cases against crypto exchanges like Binance, Coinbase for allegedly offering unregistered securities. One of the more popular and widely-followed cases was that against Ripple, which alleged that XRP was sold as securities in its initial sale. This was the kind of approach that the SEC under Gary Gensler preferred. This took a turn after President Trump courted the industry ahead of the 2024 elections, proposing clear rules and incentives. Once he won the elections and replaced the SEC’s Chairman with Paul Atkins, the institution has toned down its harsh policies and established a crypto task force. On regulations, the House passed the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act a year after the bipartisan approval of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT 21). Both bills seek to restructure the regulatory framework between the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC. Though not yet laws, they provide a perspective on the direction of crypto regulation in the future. The “MiCA Effect” in Europe: Full Implementation Europe led crypto exchange regulations with the implementation of the Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. But sentiment towards this bill remains mixed. Some hail it as a landmark regulatory development, while others view it as overextension and overregulation. In Q1 2025, multiple exchanges operating in the European Economic Area (EEA), including Binance, Kraken, and Bitstamp announced plans to delist Tether’s USDT stablecoin and other non-compliant assets. The full effect of the law mandates non-EU issuers to set up a legal entity within the EEA, among other requirements, not limited to reserves, audits, and reporting. Under MiCA, failure to satisfy ART/EMT licenses will prompt Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) to treat the asset as “non-compliant.” The strict application of these rules has led to major issuers and crypto firms seeking new licenses in France, Italy, and other EU countries. The “Travel Rule” Is Now Global Standard The Travel Rule requires CASPs, including exchanges and custodians, to collect and transmit certain information during digital asset transfers. This deepens crypto exchanges’ regulations, taking it closer to centralized finance standards. The long-standing Financial Action Task Force (FATF) directive on crypto was first introduced in 2019 and has since been fully adopted across jurisdictions. Generally, exchanges are required to provide the full legal name, blockchain wallet address, physical address, or ID number, and other information to prevent money laundering and sanction evasion. Originally intended to apply to transactions above $1,000, the EU and other jurisdictions have amended the threshold, making it applicable to smaller transactions (or at least requiring basic information). This strict application places retail traders under the umbrella but has created new privacy concerns. The global AML rule opens user information, creating centralized collection and linking identities to on-chain activities. Many argue that this defeats the purpose of blockchain transactions, as authorities and bad actors can trace a trader’s history. Key Regulatory Frameworks You Must Know United States: The Stablecoins and Digital Asset Acts The United States has passed key crypto regulations, with many still being amended in Congress. Notably, the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act ( GENIUS Act ) was signed into law in July. The federal law establishes a framework for stablecoin payments from issuance to settlements. Companies must meet reserve requirements, and it further clarifies that stablecoins are not treated as securities under US law. This clarity fueled big bank investments in the crypto market with many exploring stablecoin payment and custody options. Banks can now offer custody to institutional managers as rules clear up, a shift over the past year. Upcoming market structure rules like FIT21 and the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act show the direction of US regulators. European Union: Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) MiCA classifies stablecoins into Electronic Money Tokens (EMTs) and Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs) with an outright ban on algorithm-pegged assets. Stablecoin issuers are obligated to be licensed under these categories. Under MiCA, an EMT issuer must be a licensed e-money or credit institution, while ARTs must either be established within the jurisdiction or create a legal entity. To protect investors, stablecoins must be backed 1:1 with assets in regulated custodians, and reserves must be held separately from issuer funds. In addition to these, issuers must also redeem 1:1 back to fiat and offer regular disclosures. For “significant stablecoins,” assets with larger market caps, volume, and reserve size, stricter requirements are imposed. Stablecoin issues are also prevented from offering interests from holdings, making a clear distinction from bank holdings. Asia-Pacific: The “Sandbox” Leaders (Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan) Popular for emerging crypto regulations, these jurisdictions have driven the tokenization of Real World Assets (RWA). Hong Kong began exploring RWA frameworks in 2024. The Project Ensemble Sandbox allowed experiments in traditional financial assets, including tests in interbank settlements, etc. This year, a broader LEAP template under the Digital Asset Development Policy 2.0 supports a wide range of real-world assets. Similarly, Singapore has embraced these assets, creating an open system to boost tokenization. At the moment, RWA-backed products are essentially grouped as capital market products. Japan has taken a more institutional-based approach with large firms launching property tokenization. Recently, SBI Holdings partnered with Chainlink to build RWA infrastructure. Like stablecoins, tokenized RWAs are strictly monitored in terms of custody segregation and AML/KYC requirements. The Middle East (UAE/VARA): The Global Crypto Hub Crypto regulations in the Middle East are becoming more defined as institutional investors flood the scene. The United Arab Emirates is in the spotlight after launching a bold move to become the Global Crypto Hub. UAE’s crypto focus became prominent in 2022 after authorities formed the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) in Dubai. Designated to control blockchain activities, early successes were recorded, leading to the formation of other bodies across the region. In May, VARA 2.0 was released , clearly defining Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) in Dubai. Crypto firms are now tightly regulated in several areas including custody, brokerage, exchange services, transfer and settlement, lending, etc. In addition to clear regulations, Dubai has become more attractive to firms due to government incentives and long-term vision. Several firms have obtained VASPs licenses to launch crypto and tokenization services in the region. For Traders: How 2025 Crypto Regulations Affect Your Money The Evolution of KYC Requirements Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements are now taken more seriously across decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Recently, the US signed another law into effect, which differentiates between DeFi protocols and brokers, making it easier for these providers and no longer requiring them to pass mandatory KYC on their users. However, many international authorities treat the crypto market as a mature sector rather than an experimental technology. This comes on the back of trillions in institutional funds, global banking integrations payments flows. KYC laws are regarded as the base of regulation after adoption. Crypto exchanges are mandated to collect and verify data to prevent money laundering, sanction evasion, and ransomware payouts. To protect investors and prevent emerging scams, some regulators have implemented KYC and tightened monitoring from both centralized and decentralized exchanges. For enforcement, regulators treat access points as financial intermediaries targeting domain providers, among others, since smart contracts are autonomous. If a DEX interface allows it to trade and carry out financial services, it becomes subject to all reporting requirements. In a nutshell, DEX frontends are hosted by identifiable groups, leading to a change of enforcement procedure. While crypto is permissionless at the smart contract stage, front-end access points are strictly under the same rules as centralized financial intermediaries. If an interface onboards users and facilitates transactions, KYC is required. For many stakeholders, KYC requirements tightened due to massive adoption and not previous failures. The “Stablecoin Squeeze”: Which Coins are Safe To Hold? Generally, MiCA-compliant stablecoins are the safest assets to hold within the EU. Circle’s USD Coin (USDC) is tipped as widely regulated alongside euro-denominated assets. Stablecoins that are fully backed with confirmed reserves under MiCA and upcoming UK rules are safe to hold. Increased regulatory scrutiny has led to the exchange delisting of several stablecoins. Under MiCA, failure to meet EMTs and ARTs requirements prompts delisting. This year, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) warned issuers to become fully compliant. In Europe, authorities continue to cite domestic risks and cross-border regulatory arbitrage. This occurs when mixed issuers outside the EU are not subject to the base audits, reserves, and reporting requirements. Tax Reporting: The Era of Automated Data Sharing (DAC8 & 1099-DA) Crypto exchanges are required to report transactions to tax authorities automatically. Both DAC8 in Europe and 1099-DA in the United States introduced similar principles that are now being modeled by emerging markets. Exchanges and other platforms send user identity, cost basis, sale proceeds, and transaction IDs to the IRS. This model eliminates anonymous trading making each transaction tax compliant. Just like stocks, the revenue authority matches tax returns with reported data , a global shift in digital asset regulations. Non-compliant exchanges will face stiff penalties and could lose licenses and banking access. Furthermore, the OECD’s Crypto Asset Reporting Framework (CARF) causes countries to share tax information across borders. DAC8 & 1099-DA automates tax enforcement, imposing strict penalties for digital asset exchanges. Future Trends: What to Expect in 2026 Tokenized Securities and Real World Assets Tokenization is expected to dominate industry narratives in 2026 as analysts tip blockchain markets to become the operational infrastructure for centralized finance. So far, banks and other players have launched successful pilots with anticipation building towards issuance. Tokenization introduced instant settlement, atomic swaps, lower custody costs, and worldwide distribution without compliance. Blockchains are also expected to become the backend structure for traditional finance with collateral tokenization and settlement designated to on-chain rails. The biggest winners in this RWA boom are tokenized treasuries, compliant stablecoins, private credit RWAs, etc. Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) vs Private Stablecoins The power struggle between both CBDCs and stablecoins will become more intense as governments and private investors ramp up efforts. Both assets serve largely the same purposes in settlements; however, principles are sparking market debates. CBDCs are issued by central banks, essentially government-backed tokens. They allow programmable and traceable currency. Private stablecoins, on the other hand, are issued by firms like Circle, Tether, etc. Governments have pushed CBDCs, citing risks associated with private stablecoins. Authorities also want AML compliance and strict tax compliance, adding that private stablecoins can jeopardize national economic security. However, private assets are global and largely preferred to CBDCs. These assets work everywhere once given the regulatory light and can be seamlessly plugged into a cross-chain architecture. Some countries also back CBDCs because of the dominance of dollar-denominated stablecoins. In reality, both are likely to coexist in 2026 as central banks continue pilot phases. It should be noted that stablecoins are primed for massive adoption next year. This follows the over-the-top institutional investment in past months. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Is Binance legal in the US in 2025? The global Binance exchange is not legal in the United States following its 2019 ban for violating US federal law. However, Binance.US, a separate entity, is allowed to operate in the US but remains restricted in several regions. Currently, Binance.US is unavailable in Texas, Oregon, and Ohio, with new user onboarding paused in Michigan. Which countries have zero crypto taxes and clear regulations? Тhe United Arab Emirates (UAE), the Cayman Islands, and Singapore do not impose personal income or capital gains tax on cryptocurrencies. Apart from zero taxes, these countries have clear regulatory and licensing frameworks for virtual asset service providers, as well as free zones and crypto hubs. Can I trade crypto without KYC in 2025? It is still possible to trade crypto without KYC requirements in 2025 using decentralized and peer-to-peer platforms. However, it has become increasingly difficult because most regulated jurisdictions have blocked access points. Several institutions have also cut ties with non-KYC-compliant firms. What is the “Travel Rule” threshold for transfers? According to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines, the recommended baseline threshold for cryptocurrency transfers is USD/EUR 1,000 for cross-border transactions. It should be noted that some jurisdictions, like the EU, have scrapped the threshold for crypto assets. Virtual asset service providers are required to collect, store, and transmit specific originator and beneficiary information to combat fraud, money laundering, and sanctions evasion. Are algorithmic stablecoins illegal now? Algorithmic stablecoins are not globally illegal, but several jurisdictions have imposed strict guardrails around their use. In the US, the GENIUS Act effectively banned the use of algorithmic stablecoins, mirroring MiCA. It has become impossible to issue algorithmic stablecoins because assets are required to be backed 1:1. { ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""FAQPage"", ""mainEntity"": [ { ""@type"": ""Question"", ""name"": ""Is Binance legal in the US in 2025?"", ""acceptedAnswer"": { ""@type"": ""Answer"", ""text"": ""The global Binance exchange is not legal in the United States following its 2019 ban for violating US federal law.

55292755,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=226775,1764755411,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Taiwan’s Bold Move: First Regulated Stablecoin Targets 2026 Launch,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/taiwan-regulated-stablecoin-2026-launch/,"BitcoinWorld Taiwan’s Bold Move: First Regulated Stablecoin Targets 2026 Launch Taiwan is making a decisive leap into the future of finance. The island nation aims to issue its first Taiwan regulated stablecoin in the second half of 2026, marking a pivotal moment for cryptocurrency adoption in Asia. This move signals a shift from cautious observation to proactive, structured participation in the digital asset economy. What is Taiwan’s Stablecoin Roadmap? According to reports from CoinDesk, Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission (FSC) is actively preparing the necessary regulatory framework. Commission Chairman Peng Jin-long confirmed that a draft of the Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) Act has already passed a crucial cabinet review. The legislative process is now the key determinant of the timeline. If the bill successfully passes its third reading in the upcoming legislative session, specific rules governing stablecoins could be established within six months. This structured approach highlights Taiwan’s commitment to creating a secure and compliant environment for digital assets. Who Will Issue This Taiwan Regulated Stablecoin? A critical aspect of this plan is the intended issuers. Unlike many decentralized stablecoins, Taiwan’s first official digital currency is expected to be issued by established financial institutions, most likely banks. This choice prioritizes trust, stability, and integration with the existing financial system. However, a fundamental question remains unanswered: what will the stablecoin be pegged to? Authorities have not yet decided whether it will be anchored to the U.S. dollar, the New Taiwan dollar, or potentially another asset. This decision will significantly influence its use cases and appeal. U.S. Dollar Peg: Offers global familiarity and stability but may limit local monetary policy tools. New Taiwan Dollar Peg: Strengthens local currency digitization and control but may have less international appeal. Why is a Taiwan Regulated Stablecoin a Game-Changer? The introduction of an official, regulated digital currency brings several potential benefits. First, it provides a safe, government-backed alternative to volatile cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions and remittances. Second, it can enhance financial inclusion and modernize Taiwan’s payment infrastructure. Finally, it positions Taiwan as a forward-thinking regulator in the competitive Asian fintech landscape. Nevertheless, challenges exist. Regulators must balance innovation with risk management, ensuring consumer protection and preventing illicit finance. The success of this Taiwan regulated stablecoin will depend on public trust, technological robustness, and seamless integration with both local and global markets. What Does This Mean for the Global Crypto Landscape? Taiwan’s move is part of a broader global trend where nations are exploring Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and regulated stablecoins. By opting for a financial institution-issued model, Taiwan is charting a middle path that could serve as a blueprint for other economies seeking to embrace digital assets without ceding full control to central banks or unregulated entities. This development could accelerate institutional adoption of blockchain technology in Taiwan and stimulate local innovation in fintech and DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications built on a trusted stablecoin foundation. Conclusion: A Calculated Step into a Digital Future Taiwan’s plan to launch a regulated stablecoin by 2026 is a calculated and ambitious step. It reflects a mature understanding of both the opportunities and risks presented by cryptocurrency. By leveraging its existing financial institutions and building a clear regulatory framework, Taiwan aims to foster a secure and innovative digital asset ecosystem. The world will be watching closely as this Taiwan regulated stablecoin project develops, potentially offering valuable lessons for the future of national digital currencies. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: When exactly will Taiwan’s stablecoin launch? A: The target is the second half of 2026, but this depends on the passage of the VASP Act in the legislature. Q2: Will this be like a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC)? A: Not exactly. It is planned to be issued by commercial banks (financial institutions) under regulation, not directly by the central bank, though it may share similar goals. Q3: Can I use this stablecoin outside of Taiwan? A: Its international use will depend on its design, the chosen peg (USD vs. TWD), and how it integrates with global crypto exchanges and payment networks. Q4: How will this affect existing cryptocurrencies in Taiwan? A: It could legitimize the broader crypto space by providing a regulated on-ramp, potentially increasing overall adoption and forcing other service providers to comply with higher standards. Q5: What are the biggest hurdles for this project? A> Key challenges include finalizing the peg, ensuring technological security, gaining public trust, and creating regulations that prevent misuse without stifling innovation. Q6: Why is Taiwan doing this now? A> To modernize its financial system, position itself as a tech-forward economy, and provide a safe digital payment option amid growing global crypto adoption.

The project has seen regular price increases during its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1, 2025. Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market has made a stunning rebound after starting December in the red, with Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and other coins racking up sizable gains. Husky Inu (HINU) Set For $0.00023298 Husky Inu (HINU) is set for its latest price increase, taking the value of the HINU token from $0.00023209 to $0.00023298. The project’s regular price increases are part of its pre-launch phase, which began on April 1, following the conclusion of the presale. The price increases allow the project to continue fundraising efforts while empowering existing token holders and community members. The pre-launch phase’s primary goal is to ensure capital raise, fund platform improvements, undertake market initiatives, and broader ecosystem expansion. Fundraising Stagnating Again Husky Inu is facing another slowdown in fundraising, which has stalled at around $905,470, despite crossing $900,000 back in October. The team is hoping fundraising picks up again as the project approaches its official launch date of March 27, 2026.

This crucial alert comes after the exchange confirmed a significant security incident affecting the project, raising immediate concerns for investors. The move highlights how major exchanges monitor and respond to potential risks in the volatile crypto market. Why Did Bithumb Issue This Investment Warning? Bithumb’s decision stems from two critical factors that emerged during their routine monitoring. First, the exchange confirmed that BOA experienced a security breach of undetermined origin. This could mean anything from a hack of project wallets to issues with its distributed ledger technology. Second, and perhaps more concerning, the project team failed to disclose this incident to the exchange and community in a timely manner. When exchanges like Bithumb discover such situations, they must act quickly to protect their users. The investment warning designation serves as a red flag, alerting traders that this asset carries elevated risk. This proactive approach helps prevent further financial losses while the situation gets investigated. What Does an Investment Warning Mean for Traders? If you’re holding or considering BOA tokens, understanding Bithumb’s warning is essential. Here’s what typically happens when an exchange issues such a designation: Trading restrictions may apply – The exchange might limit certain trading activities Increased scrutiny – The asset receives closer monitoring from exchange security teams Potential delisting – If issues aren’t resolved, the token could face removal from the platform Information gathering – The exchange seeks more details from the project team For current BOA holders on Bithumb, this doesn’t necessarily mean immediate action is required. However, it does signal that careful consideration should guide any decisions about this asset. The exchange’s primary goal is transparency, ensuring users make informed choices with their investments. How Do Exchanges Like Bithumb Protect Users? Major cryptocurrency exchanges implement several protective measures when potential risks emerge. Bithumb’s response to the BOA situation demonstrates their commitment to user security through: Continuous monitoring systems that track unusual activity across listed assets Rapid response protocols when security incidents are detected Clear communication channels to inform users about potential risks Collaboration with project teams to resolve issues transparently This investment warning system represents an important layer of protection in the largely unregulated cryptocurrency space. While exchanges cannot prevent all problems, they can provide early warnings that help users avoid significant losses. What Should Investors Do Next? If you’re affected by Bithumb’s warning about BOA, consider these practical steps: Review your position – Assess how much BOA you hold and its importance in your portfolio Seek official information – Check Bithumb’s announcements and BOA’s official channels for updates Consider risk tolerance – Determine if holding through uncertainty aligns with your investment strategy Monitor developments – Watch for resolution of the security issues and communication improvements Remember that warning designations can sometimes be temporary. If BOA’s team addresses the security concerns and improves their communication practices, Bithumb might remove the investment warning . However, until that happens, exercising caution is the prudent approach. The Bigger Picture: Security in Cryptocurrency Bithumb’s action highlights ongoing security challenges in the cryptocurrency industry. While blockchain technology offers transparency, individual projects still face risks including: Smart contract vulnerabilities Wallet security breaches Team communication failures Regulatory compliance issues Exchanges serve as important gatekeepers in this ecosystem. Their investment warning systems help create safer trading environments, though ultimate responsibility remains with individual investors to conduct due diligence. Conclusion: A Necessary Safeguard Bithumb’s designation of BOA as an investment warning item demonstrates responsible exchange management in action. While disappointing for BOA supporters, this protective measure helps maintain trust in the broader cryptocurrency market. The incident serves as a reminder that security and transparency remain paramount, and that exchanges play a crucial role in identifying and communicating risks to their communities. Frequently Asked Questions What exactly is an investment warning on Bithumb? An investment warning is a designation Bithumb applies to assets that show elevated risk factors, such as security incidents or poor communication from project teams. It alerts users to exercise additional caution with that particular cryptocurrency. Can I still trade BOA on Bithumb after the warning? This depends on Bithumb’s specific restrictions. Some warnings allow continued trading with increased awareness, while others might impose temporary limitations. Check Bithumb’s official announcements for current trading status. How long do investment warnings typically last? There’s no fixed duration. Warnings remain until the exchange determines the underlying issues have been adequately addressed by the project team and no longer pose significant risk to users. Should I immediately sell my BOA tokens? This is a personal investment decision based on your risk tolerance and portfolio strategy. The warning suggests increased risk, but doesn’t automatically mean the project will fail. Consider your position carefully and monitor developments. How can I stay updated on BOA’s status? Monitor both Bithumb’s official announcements and BOA’s project communications through their website and social media channels. Reputable cryptocurrency news sources may also provide updates. Does this affect BOA trading on other exchanges? Potentially. Other exchanges often monitor their competitors’ actions and may conduct their own reviews. However, each exchange makes independent decisions about listed assets. Found this analysis helpful?

Since its launch in 2015, Ethereum has transformed blockchain technology with its smart contracts, self-executing programs that power decentralized applications (dApps) without intermediaries. Today, it stands as more than a digital currency; it’s the backbone of innovation in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, and Web3 ecosystems. As the crypto industry matures, price predictions have become a vital tool for guiding both new and experienced investors. In Denmark, where digital adoption and fintech innovation thrive, understanding Ethereum’s future is increasingly relevant. This article explores expert forecasts for Ethereum’s price prediction in 2025, examining Denmark’s economic climate, regulations, and technological progress, all shaping how investors view Ethereum’s potential. The Current State of Ethereum Historical Price Trends Ethereum’s growth story is a blend of innovation, volatility, and investor confidence. Launched at under $1 per ETH in 2015, it surged past $1,000 during the 2017 crypto boom. The 2021 bull run saw it reach an all-time high of over $4,800 before retracing during the market correction that followed. Key milestones influencing Ethereum’s price include: Network upgrades, including the transition to Proof-of-Stake (Ethereum 2.0). Institutional adoption by fintech and DeFi platforms. Cyclical trends, often linked to Bitcoin halving events and global liquidity shifts. Current Market Performance As of late 2024, Ethereum trades between $3,200 and $3,500, showing resilience amid macroeconomic uncertainty. Unlike Bitcoin, often viewed as a “store of value,” Ethereum derives value from real-world utility. Its ecosystem supports thousands of DApps, NFTs, and DeFi projects, making it a core player in blockchain innovation. Compared to competitors like Solana and Litecoin, Ethereum still commands the largest developer community and the highest Total Value Locked (TVL) in decentralized applications. According to CoinMarketCap, Ethereum continues to dominate the smart contract sector globally. Key Factors Influencing Ethereum’s Price in Denmark Economic Factors Denmark’s stable economy, low inflation, and tech-savvy population make it fertile ground for cryptocurrency adoption. However, like most EU nations, it’s influenced by broader European monetary policies. The Danish krone’s peg to the euro aligns its economic stability with EU markets. Rising global inflation and interest rates encourage diversification into digital assets such as Ethereum. Fintech innovation continues to strengthen Denmark’s role as a hub for blockchain development. These factors suggest that Danish investors will likely continue viewing Ethereum as both a speculative and strategic digital asset. Regulatory Environment Denmark has one of Europe’s most transparent regulatory frameworks for cryptocurrencies. The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority (DFSA) treats digital currencies as taxable capital assets but not legal tender. The upcoming EU MiCA (Markets in Crypto-Assets) regulation aims to standardize crypto rules across Europe, improving investor protection and market transparency. While it may increase compliance requirements, such clarity generally boosts investor confidence and supports long-term growth. For detailed updates, investors can consult the DFSA’s cryptocurrency guidelines. Technological Developments Ethereum’s evolution is central to its future value. The Ethereum 2.0 upgrade, shifting to a Proof-of-Stake mode, has already improved scalability and reduced energy consumption. Major improvements include: Lower transaction fees and faster processing. Enhanced network security and environmental sustainability. Layer-2 scaling solutions, expanding Ethereum’s transaction capacity. These align with Denmark’s emphasis on sustainability and digital innovation, making Ethereum attractive to eco-conscious and institutional investors alike. Market Sentiment in Denmark Market psychology plays a major role in short-term price movements. In Denmark, social media, crypto forums, and online investment groups significantly influence market sentiment. Interestingly, many Danish investors often playfully nicknamed the spillefuglen approach to cryptocurrency investment with curiosity and optimism. This mindset mirrors the nation’s broader entrepreneurial culture, where taking calculated risks is part of innovation and progress. For readers who enjoy exploring risk-taking trends and digital entertainment, you can read more about casino uden ROFUS , a popular topic in Denmark’s online landscape that reflects similar decision-making psychology between gaming and investing. Expert Ethereum Prediction: What Could 2025 Look Like? What Analysts Are Saying? Experts across the crypto and financial sectors have released varying Ethereum prediction figures for 2025: Standard Chartered Bank: Predicts Ethereum could hit $14,000, supported by institutional adoption and potential spot ETF approvals. Finder’s panel of 50 experts: Estimates Ethereum’s range between $6,000 and $8,000, assuming regulatory stability and steady DeFi growth. Techopedia: Suggests a realistic bracket of $4,500 to $8,000, depending on macroeconomic conditions and blockchain adoption. Overall, experts agree on continued long-term growth, though short-term volatility remains inevitable. Why Experts Are Optimistic? Expanding blockchain adoption across Denmark and Europe. Institutional interest in Ethereum-based funds and assets. Continuous innovation in DeFi and Web3 ecosystems, driving higher network activity. Why are some analysts cautious? Potential EU regulatory tightening on crypto markets. Natural market corrections follow bullish cycles. Increased competition from other Layer-1 networks, such as Cardano or Solana. Balancing optimism with informed caution is essential for anyone exploring Ethereum or similar digital investments. Case Studies: Europe and Denmark in Focus Comparing Ethereum Trends Across Europe Countries like Germany and Sweden offer useful insights into Ethereum’s evolution. Germany’s institutional access through ETFs has driven adoption, while Sweden’s regulated exchanges foster investor confidence. Denmark may follow suit as its crypto infrastructure matures. Danish Success Stories Some early Danish Ethereum investors, particularly those who entered between 2017 and 2020, have reported significant long-term gains. Their success often stems from: Holding through volatility instead of reacting impulsively. Diversifying across cryptocurrencies for risk balance. Staying compliant with tax rules and local regulations. These lessons emphasize that consistent research and patience often outperform speculation. Conclusion: Ethereum’s Future in Denmark Ethereum remains a cornerstone of decentralized innovation and a vital component of the global blockchain ecosystem. Expert forecasts for 2025 range from $4,000 to $14,000, but the underlying fundamentals, sustainability, institutional adoption, and ongoing technological growth continue to position Ethereum strongly in Denmark’s investment landscape. Building an effective investment portfolio requires balance, blending creativity, data, and patience. Ethereum offers both opportunity and challenge for those willing to stay informed and adaptive. Knowledge, consistency, and caution remain your best assets in navigating the evolving world of crypto. Invest wisely, stay curious, and continue learning.

Officials said this week that users can delete a cybersecurity app they want installed on every new device sold in the country. On Nov. 28, the Ministry of Communications told phone makers and importers to put the Sanchar Saathi app on devices before selling them. The idea was to cut down on online fraud. Companies got instructions to keep the app accessible and make sure “that its functionalities are not disabled or restricted.” That didn’t sit well with a lot of people. By Tuesday, Communications Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia was doing damage control. “If you don’t want Sanchar Saathi, you can delete it,” he said in a statement the ministry posted on X. “It is optional.” ""There is no snooping and no call monitoring.

The choice to activate, keep, or delete the app rests entirely with the user."" – Hon'ble Minister Shri @JM_Scindia Ji The app continues to deliver strong citizen benefits: • 26 lakh mobile… pic.twitter.com/BJ1IC4vMfG — Office Of JM Scindia (@Officejmscindia) December 3, 2025 Opposition politicians jumped all over it. Mallikarjun Kharge, who heads the Congress party, wrote on X that the requirement would mean “snooping, surveilling, scanning and peeping.” He even called it “akin to dictatorship.” What the app actually does Some government officials explained to Bloomberg what the app does. Users can fight fraud, block stolen phones from working, and verify mobile connections. The app needs access to call logs and text messages. It also asks for camera permissions and some other features. Officials were quick to say it doesn’t touch the microphone, location, Bluetooth, or operating system. This whole thing matters because India has more people than anywhere else on earth. Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google run tight ships when it comes to their phone platforms. They usually push back hard against government interference, saying they need control to keep things secure and protect privacy. Apple may challenge the order Apple might challenge the order officially, according to Reuters. Company reps didn’t respond when asked about it. Google stayed quiet too. Apple just had its best year ever in India, with sales hitting nearly $9 billion last fiscal year as reported by Cryptopolitan . The company’s been opening more stores as demand keeps growing. The government says the numbers prove the app works. There have been 14 million downloads since launch. Around 2.6 million lost and stolen phones got traced because of it. India has been ramping up efforts to tackle cyber fraud across multiple fronts, including training thousands of cyber police officers in recent years. Scindia defended the whole thing Tuesday. He said the app protects people, not spies on them. “Sanchar Saathi is voluntary, transparent, and designed solely to protect India’s mobile consumers while advancing the nation’s cybersecurity,” Scindia said. “Users have complete freedom to activate, or delete the app at any time, ensuring safety without compromising privacy.” Get up to $30,050 in trading rewards when you join Bybit today",Tech|Alphabet|Apple|Google|INR,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-03 10:00:39

Crypto is so unthinkably huge at the moment, a nearly $4 trillion industry that’s aiming for world domination. Recent headlines talk of Circle and Mastercard planning to add USDC to global payment systems, Ethereum and Bitcoin treasuries in the billions of dollars, and Google building its own blockchain. Bitcoin has an all-time growth of over 180,000,000%, Dogecoin over 43,000%, and some of the newest presale coins often pump 10x, 100x, or even 1,000x on rare occasions. Explosive potential is probably the single best description for what we’re seeing today in crypto.

As Bitcoin Eyes Six Figures, Bitcoin Hyper Quietly Lines Up as the Next Crypto to Explode December 3, 2025 • 10:00 UTC $BTC just bounced from a sharp flush down to $84,5k back to above $93k as analysts like Michael van de Poppe openly discuss a path to $100k over the next few months. The key $86k–$88k support zone has already survived around 60 tests without breaking, which shows how much smart money defends this range while ETF inflows and potential Fed cuts act as tailwinds. If you already hold $BTC, the next step is usually finding higher-beta exposure to that same narrative rather than chasing random meme coins. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) fits that lane as a Bitcoin Layer-2 built on the Solana Virtual Machine , bringing Solana-style execution and dApp potential to Bitcoin. It achieves this via a canonical bridge that lets you move $BTC into DeFi, NFTs, and gaming for the first time. With $28.8M raised so far at a $0.013365 token price, you tap into infrastructure that scales Bitcoin instead of just tracking it, giving you a more asymmetric angle on the next crypto to explode. Read more about what Bitcoin Hyper is here. Solana’s Rizzmas Revival Puts Meme Liquidity Back on the Map for Maxi Doge, a Potential Next Crypto to Explode December 3, 2025 • 10:00 UTC Solana meme action just switched back on, with Rizzmas reappearing as $SOL posts double-digit daily gains and spot volumes flood into seasonal tokens again. When meme coins start waking up on a high-throughput chain, it usually signals that traders feel comfortable rotating out along the risk curve, hunting for fresh narratives with stronger upside than the first wave. That dynamic favors meme plays that carry real mechanics, not just a logo and a dog. Maxi Doge ($MAXI) leans into this shift by combining classic Doge culture with staking, trading contests, and future 1000x leverage tie-ins, which turn the community into a constant flow of competition and volume rather than passive holders. With $4.25M already raised at a $0.000271 token price, you position yourself earlier than most meme rotations, while still tying into a project that has audits, fixed supply, and a clearly defined ecosystem.

Yet even with SOL’s relative resilience, investor attention is beginning to shift toward high-growth emerging projects that offer deeper upside potential in the current market cycle. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quickly become the best crypto to buy, driven by surging demand for early-stage DeFi platforms with real utility and strong roadmap execution. Priced at $0.035 and rapidly advancing through its presale, MUTM is gaining momentum as anticipation builds for the upcoming V1 protocol launch, which is expected to expand the platform’s decentralized lending-and-borrowing capabilities. Mutuum Finance phase 6 is already over 95% sold out, meaning investors have less time remaining. With growing investor rotation out of large-caps and into innovative early-stage ecosystems, Mutuum Finance is positioning itself as the top crypto to watch in the months ahead. Solana Forms Bull Flag as Market Watches for a Breakout Solana (SOL) is currently shaping a clean monthly bull flag, consolidating tightly after its major vertical rally and signaling the potential for another powerful move. Analysts note that if SOL breaks out from this structure, the long-term measured target could reach as high as $1,500, raising the question of whether Solana might lead the next altcoin cycle. With price action stabilizing and momentum building, traders are watching closely for confirmation of a breakout that could accelerate market-wide optimism. In an environment where strong narratives and early positioning matter, shifting investor attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making it the best crypto to buy for investors seeking early-stage DeFi opportunities. Mutuum Finance Emerges as a Leading DeFi Investment Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) presale offers investors a rare opportunity to acquire MUTM tokens before they are listed on exchanges, providing early access to a high-potential digital asset. Phase 6 of the presale is currently underway, with tokens priced at $0.035, more than three times the initial Phase 1 price of $0.01. This allows early participants to secure substantial gains before Phase 7 increases the price to $0.04. With over 95% of Phase 6 already sold and contributions from more than 18,270 participants raising $19.05 million, MUTM has garnered significant market traction. These factors position it as the top crypto for the remainder of 2025 and into 2026, appealing to both retail and institutional investors. Incentives to Encourage Community Engagement Mutuum Finance is actively fostering community involvement and loyalty through targeted incentives. Early participants are being rewarded via a $100,000 giveaway , with the ten users set to receive $10,000 each. This initiative recognizes early adopters and encourages them to actively engage with the platform and its ecosystem. By emphasizing transparency, user participation, and long-term engagement, MUTM differentiates itself from competitors and establishes a strong foundation for sustained growth. These initiatives reinforce why MUTM is regarded as the best crypto to buy, combining early access, security, and tangible incentives, making it a highly attractive opportunity for investors in 2025. Security is a core priority for Mutuum Finance. The platform’s lending and borrowing smart contracts are undergoing a thorough audit by Halborn Security, a leading blockchain security firm. This process ensures the contracts function as intended and that users’ assets are protected. Once the audit is complete, the team will announce the testnet launch schedule, allowing early users to interact with the platform under fully verified secure conditions. By implementing these rigorous security measures, MUTM is developing a secure, scalable, and trustworthy DeFi ecosystem, providing investors confidence in both its technology and operational reliability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is capturing investor attention as the best crypto to buy in 2025. Phase 6 of its presale is over 95% sold at $0.035, raising $19.05 million from 18,270+ participants. With a secure, audited platform, a V1 protocol launch on the horizon, and community incentives like a $100,000 giveaway, MUTM offers early access to a functional DeFi ecosystem with real lending and borrowing utility. Investors rotating from large-cap altcoins like SOL are increasingly eyeing MUTM as the top crypto with high-potential growth heading into 2026.

55293591,638608,1764756054,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55293591.jpeg,Crypto Investors Brace As Japan Proposes 20% Tax By 2027,https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-investors-brace-as-japan-proposes-20-tax-by-2027/,"Japan’s government is backing a plan to tax cryptocurrency profits at a flat 20% rate, a major change from the current system that can push some traders into much higher brackets. Reports have disclosed the move aims to treat crypto gains more like stock trading, simplifying what many investors have called a confusing tax regime. What The Change Means Under the proposal , gains from crypto trades would be taxed separately from salaries and other miscellaneous income and instead be subject to the same 20% capital gains-style rate that applies to many investment products. Right now, crypto earnings in Japan are lumped in with other income and can be taxed at rates reaching as high as 55%. Reports have also said regulators want to reclassify many cryptocurrencies as financial products. That would bring new rules, such as tighter disclosure and the potential application of insider trading laws to crypto markets. The Financial Services Agency is said to be leading the drafting of the proposal. Industry Reaction And Regional Impact Exchanges and brokers in Japan are studying what a uniform 20% rate would mean for fees, trading volumes, and client onboarding. Some market participants welcome the predictability; others worry about additional compliance burdens if exchanges must follow securities-style rules. Firms in other Asian hubs are watching closely because lower retail tax costs in Japan could shift where regional investors choose to trade. Analysts note two effects are likely: clearer tax bills for individual traders and a possible uptick in institutional interest if banks and insurers can sell crypto through regulated channels. Still, some retail traders who benefited from earlier tax treatments may see little immediate gain. Implementation Timeline And Next Steps Based on reports, the measure is expected to be included in the fiscal 2026 tax reform package that ruling parties will compile soon, with legislation to be introduced in the next parliamentary session. That timetable means practical implementation could come in 2026 or take effect in 2027 depending on parliamentary approval and technical details. Several important details remain unclear. Which assets will qualify, how past losses will be handled, and whether a list of approved tokens will be set are all open questions. Some coverage mentions a specific list of approved cryptocurrencies will be treated like equities, but final wording has not been released.

Related Reading: Bitcoin Trail Ends: $29M Seized After European Authorities Shut Down Cryptomixer The move followed a sharp sell-off that removed about $8,000 from the price late over the weekend, and traders pushed the coin to a 24-hour peak of $93,910 on Coingecko. Bitcoin Climbs Above Key Levels According to MN Fund founder Michaël van de Poppe, regaining ground above $93,000 is important for momentum. He said that if the price holds and breaks higher, a run toward $100,000 becomes more likely. Other analysts echoed the call: Nick Ruck of LVRG Research pointed to macro factors and fresh ETF flows as drivers that could help Bitcoin test six figures in the coming months. This is what you’d want to see. $BTC coming back up again, after a weird move down on the 1st of this month. Now, again, breaking the $92K area is crucial. If that breaks, then I’m sure we’ll start to see a new all-time high and a test at $100K. A great day on the markets. pic.twitter.com/uy6WPabnQ8 — Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) December 2, 2025 ETF Activity And Market Moves Reports have disclosed that ETF-related trading helped lift the market. BlackRock’s IBIT recorded over $1.8 billion in volume within two hours after Vanguard reversed a previous stance, and total spot Bitcoin ETF volume topped $5.1 billion on the day. Market stats showed the broader crypto capitalization rose close to 7% to $3.13 trillion, with BTC dominance climbing to nearly 60%. Bitcoin itself jumped by about 8% after the US market opened, giving larger markets a clear lift. Support Zone Holds Focus Analysts had been watching the $86,000 to $88,000 band as a critical area of support. Based on reports from active market watchers, that range had been tested dozens of times in recent months and holding above it signaled reduced selling pressure. One analyst argued that a break below would likely lead some big players to change tack, moving from buying to selling behavior. Liquidations And Net Inflows Changed The Day Other market observers reported heavy turnover in derivatives and spot markets: over $360 billion in short positions were liquidated, while more than $160 billion was reportedly added back into crypto markets within a 24-hour span. Those figures, if accurate, helped explain the speed of the rebound and the large single-day gains. Related Reading: XRP Is About To Hit A Major Turning Point This Week, Analyst Says What Comes Next For Prices Short-term traders will watch how Bitcoin behaves around $92,000 and whether it can hold above the $86,000–$88,000 floor. Some commentators warned that sudden ETF-driven demand can cause sharp spikes that may not last. Others pointed to possible policy shifts, such as renewed talk of US interest-rate cuts, as reasons why money might flow into major crypto assets in the months ahead. For now, prices sit a little above $92,700 at the time of writing. The market is clearly volatile. Investors and traders will likely need to balance the bullish signs against the risk that a fresh round of selling could wipe gains quickly.

Most focus on charts or headlines, but very few start with a plan for daily life. In a recent video, crypto analyst Levi Rietveld approached XRP from a different angle. He ignored short-term hype. He focused on preparedness, structure, and long-term thinking. His message centered on discipline rather than excitement. It shifts the XRP debate away from speculation. It places it within personal finance and time horizons. Rietveld asked a direct question. If XRP hit $100 overnight, would holders panic or act with clarity? If $XRP Hit $100 Would You Be Ready? Comment ""passive"" and I'll send you the link!! Like & repost to spread awareness!! pic.twitter.com/0SFT3By2P5 — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) November 30, 2025 Rietveld’s Starting Point Rietveld began by defining survival before profit. He said, “The very first thing I’m going to do is find the monthly income that I need to survive and live comfortably.” He set that figure at $10,000 per month. He then scaled it to $120,000 per year and extended it across 50 years. That math produced a clear $6 million goal. At a $100 XRP price, that equals 60,000 XRP. The approach framed XRP as a tool for income stability, not a lottery ticket. Turning XRP Into Regular Income Rietveld then focused on capital efficiency. He referenced a common principle. Idle money loses power over time. His solution involved yield. He explained his intent to deploy XRP into interest-generating strategies rather than sell instantly . He stated that platforms exist offering yield on digital assets , including XRP. His goal involved compounding returns until the 60,000 XRP target balance. After that, he described living off the yield rather than liquidating his principal. His message stayed consistent. Discipline matters more than speed. Allocation matters more than timing. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 What This Signals for XRP Rietveld’s comments reflect confidence in XRP’s long-term viability . His framework assumes deep liquidity, sustained demand, and functional markets at higher prices. Those conditions require utility, not just narrative momentum. Rietveld stated, “If you don’t get your money to work for you, you’re going to be broke forever.” The digital asset already powers a rapidly growing global payment infrastructure. Supporters argue that price expansion follows usage growth. A $100 valuation implies institutional depth, not retail frenzy. Investors who enter positions early will benefit the most from this expected growth. Rietveld emphasized lifestyle planning over prediction. In that sense, the question is not whether XRP reaches $100. The question is whether holders will be ready when it does.

Recent market data tells a compelling story that suggests we’re just getting started. According to fresh analysis from CryptoQuant contributor CoinCare, strong buying pressure across exchanges indicates this cycle has plenty of room to run. Let’s explore the evidence that has analysts buzzing with optimism. What Does the Bitcoin Buying Pressure Actually Tell Us? The market buy-sell ratio in Bitcoin perpetual futures markets recently surged to 1.17. This represents the strongest daily buying sentiment we’ve seen since January 2023. More importantly, this level of activity typically appears during the early to mid-stages of a cycle, not at its end. CoinCare explains this pattern clearly: “This is a typical signal seen when liquidity and structural fund flows are accelerating rather than slowing down.” In simpler terms, money is flowing into Bitcoin faster than it’s flowing out – a classic sign of a healthy Bitcoin bull run . How Institutional Adoption Fuels the Bitcoin Bull Run The timing of this buying pressure coincides with significant institutional developments. Global asset manager Vanguard recently decided to permit trading of spot Bitcoin ETFs. This single move could potentially open Bitcoin markets to over 50 million investors who previously couldn’t access cryptocurrency through traditional channels. Consider these institutional factors: Massive new investor pool through traditional financial platforms Increased likelihood of steady institutional capital inflows Greater market stability from diversified participation This institutional embrace creates a foundation for sustained growth rather than speculative spikes. Why Macro Liquidity Signals Support Continued Growth Beyond direct Bitcoin metrics, broader economic indicators align with continued bullish momentum. Key macro liquidity indicators appear to be bottoming out and rebounding. This matters because Bitcoin bull markets have historically occurred during the initial recovery phase of a liquidity cycle, not at its peak. CoinCare emphasizes this crucial point: “Bitcoin bull markets have historically occurred during the initial recovery phase of a liquidity cycle, not at its peak.” We’re seeing exactly this pattern unfold now, suggesting we’re in the sweet spot for cryptocurrency growth. What Are the Real Risks to This Bitcoin Bull Run? While the evidence points toward continued growth, no investment comes without risks. The analysis identifies two primary concerns that could impact the current Bitcoin bull run : Financial instability from Japan affecting global markets Lack of definitive trend reversal signals creating uncertainty However, these risk factors appear manageable within the broader context of strong fundamentals and institutional adoption. The weight of evidence suggests the current Bitcoin bull run has not yet reached its apex, and further rally remains highly possible. Conclusion: The Evidence Points to Continued Momentum The combination of strong technical signals, institutional adoption, and favorable macro conditions creates a compelling case for Bitcoin’s continued growth. The current Bitcoin bull run shows characteristics of early to mid-cycle behavior rather than late-stage exhaustion. While investors should always remain aware of risks, the data suggests this story has more chapters to write. Frequently Asked Questions What is the market buy-sell ratio telling us about Bitcoin? The ratio recently hit 1.17, its highest level since January 2023. This indicates stronger buying pressure than selling pressure, suggesting continued bullish sentiment. How does Vanguard’s decision affect Bitcoin markets? By allowing spot Bitcoin ETF trading, Vanguard opens access to over 50 million traditional investors who can now participate in cryptocurrency markets through familiar platforms. What stage of the bull run are we currently in? Analysts believe we’re in the early to mid-stages based on liquidity patterns and buying pressure signals that typically appear before market peaks. What are the main risks to the current Bitcoin bull run? Financial instability from Japan and the absence of clear trend reversal signals represent the primary risks, though they appear manageable given current fundamentals. How does macro liquidity affect Bitcoin prices? Bitcoin historically performs best during the initial recovery phase of liquidity cycles, and current indicators suggest we’re in exactly this favorable environment. Should investors be concerned about a market peak? Current signals suggest we haven’t reached the peak yet, but as with any investment, diversification and risk management remain essential strategies. Found this analysis helpful?

While the promise is to allow users to directly monetize their social capital and activity, existing platforms often remain siloed or offer incomplete, fragmented user experiences. This fragmentation limits the true potential of creator economies and user-owned data, preventing the seamless creation and participation in social-financial activities. A full-stack solution that integrates social networking, user identity, and robust financial mechanisms like prediction markets is essential to genuinely unlock this value. Leading this charge toward a genuinely integrated and decentralized social-financial ecosystem is Polarise, an AI-powered full-stack SocialFi protocol. Polarise addresses this industry fragmentation head-on by building a comprehensive, full-stack protocol, fundamentally changing the status quo of how social capital is valued and traded. Their unique selling proposition lies in their AI-powered full-stack SocialFi technology, which integrates core social functionalities with robust DeFi tools, specifically designed to empower prediction markets. This integrated, full-stack approach, strategically backed by prestigious institutions like Digital Currency Group, Coinbase Ventures, Hashkey Capital, and Polygon, sets Polarise apart from fragmented competitors. The team is currently gearing up for major milestones, including the mainnet launch and the Token Generation Event (TGE). In anticipation, the community is actively participating in the Polarise Genesis Program, offering early access and rewards to those who help bootstrap the ecosystem. Through its comprehensive approach and upcoming launch, Polarise aims to be a defining moment for the sector, solving the industry problem of fragmentation with a truly integrated SocialFi protocol. We now have the opportunity to delve deeper into the vision and technology of Polarise by speaking directly with Founder Colin Lee . Polarise is positioned as an ""AI-powered full-stack SocialFi protocol."" Could you elaborate on what makes your technology genuinely ""full-stack,"" and how does the AI component enhance both the social features and the underlying financial mechanisms? When we say full-stack, we mean Polarise provides every layer a super individual needs to evolve from content creator to value captor. Most SocialFi projects give you one piece: maybe social tokens, maybe a tipping mechanism. But they're fundamentally incomplete loops. Polarise gives you four complete layers: First, the decision layer. Our AI isn't just generating content suggestions. It's analyzing on-chain behavior, market sentiment, historical prediction outcomes to surface alpha in real-time. When you're creating a prediction market, AI tells you optimal pricing ranges based on comparable markets. When you're managing multiple social assets across topic NFTs, prediction positions, community tokens, AI calculates portfolio rebalancing strategies and auto-routes yields to highest-APY opportunities. This is institutional-grade decision support, but accessible to anyone. Second, the execution layer. This is our social symbol compiler. In traditional DeFi, there's massive friction between insight and execution. You need to understand smart contracts, bootstrap liquidity, navigate complex UIs. We've collapsed that entirely. When you type % Bitcoin hits $150K in 2026, you're not writing a tweet. You're deploying a prediction market. # mints topic NFTs. @ triggers revenue splits. Social language compiles directly into financial primitives. Zero technical overhead. Third, the asset layer. This is our proprietary ERC1000. Every value creation event generates an on-chain asset you fully own. But here's the critical innovation: NFT↔FT seamless conversion. Your prediction market is an NFT capturing fee revenue, but it's also instantly convertible to FT for secondary liquidity. You're never locked. Traditional prediction markets trap capital until settlement. We give you optionality at every stage: hold for full upside, take profits via market exit, or stake for working capital while retaining position. Fourth, the liquidity layer. This is where it all comes together. Markets for social assets, prediction positions, community tokens, all with AI-driven market making ensuring depth even for long-tail assets. You create value, capture it as owned assets, and have instant exit liquidity. Complete loop. Now, how does AI enhance both social and financial sides? On the social side: AI analyzes your engagement patterns, identifies which content attracts long-term supporters versus drive-by engagement, suggests optimal posting strategies, helps you design community incentive mechanisms that actually retain high-value participants. It's transforming social capital into measurable, optimizable metrics. On the financial side: AI monitors all prediction markets for mispricing, calculates expected value of different positions, optimizes your asset allocation across the ecosystem, and most importantly, provides real-time decision support that previously only hedge funds had access to. When market sentiment shifts, AI surfaces that signal immediately. The key insight is this: AI doesn't replace human judgment. It amplifies it. You still need edge, you still need insights about the world. But AI handles all the optimization, execution, and portfolio management that used to require a team of analysts. That's what full-stack means. It's not one feature. It's a complete value creation and capture infrastructure where every layer is AI-enhanced, and every layer connects seamlessly to the next. Most projects give you tools. We're giving you capabilities. There's a fundamental difference. We know that many SocialFi attempts have been fragmented. Why did the Polarise team decide to build a genuinely full-stack solution from the ground up, and how does this structure inherently prevent the silo issues seen in earlier projects? We've watched every major SocialFi wave. They all hit the same wall, and it's architectural, not accidental. The fundamental issue is they built applications, not protocols. When you build an application, you create silos by design. Your social graph lives in one app. Your content lives in another. Your financial primitives, if they exist at all, are trapped in yet another platform. Users become hostages to whichever silo captures them first. We made a different architectural decision from day one: build protocol-layer primitives that compose, not application-layer features that compete. Let me give you a concrete example with our UGC prediction markets, because this perfectly illustrates the difference. Traditional prediction markets like Polymarket are centralized gatekeepers. They decide which markets get created. They control liquidity. They own the infrastructure. It's fundamentally an application model dressed up as a platform. When Polymarket doesn't want your market, you're out of options. Polarise enables permissionless UGC prediction market creation. Anyone types % [any prediction] and deploys a market instantly. No approval. No capital requirements. No technical overhead. This is our pump.fun moment for predictions, but here's why it's not siloed: First, it's protocol-native. These prediction markets aren't trapped in Polarise's UI. They're ERC1000 NFTs convertible to FTs. That means they can trade on any marketplace, integrate with any DeFi protocol, compose with any yield strategy. We're not building walls, we're building legos. Second, the AI layer is composable. When someone creates a prediction market, our AI analyzes historical data to suggest optimal parameters. But that AI intelligence isn't locked to predictions. The same models optimize your topic NFT strategy, your community token allocation, your content engagement. One AI layer serving every primitive, not separate AI features for separate silos. Third, liquidity is unified. This is critical. In fragmented systems, you have isolated liquidity pools. Predictions trade in one place, social tokens in another, NFTs somewhere else. We architected a unified liquidity layer where everything shares depth. Your prediction market NFT can be staked for yield in the same pools as topic NFTs and community tokens. That unified liquidity is what prevents silos from forming. Fourth, value flows are interconnected. When you create a UGC prediction market and it starts generating trading volume, those fees don't just accumulate in isolation. They flow through ERC-1000 architecture into your broader portfolio. You can stake prediction NFTs to bootstrap liquidity for your community DAO. You can use topic NFT revenue to create new prediction markets. Every primitive reinforces the others. The reason earlier projects fragmented is they optimized for growth within their silo. We optimized for composability across primitives. In Polarise full-stack model: You create a prediction market with %. It generates fees as an NFT. You convert that NFT to FT via ERC-1000 for instant liquidity. You use that liquidity to mint a topic NFT with #. That topic gains engagement, and the NFT appreciates. You stake both assets in unified liquidity pools. AI optimizes your entire portfolio allocation in real-time. One protocol, complete composability, zero silos. Polarise is poised to be a ""pump.fun moment for prediction markets."" What specific features or mechanisms within the protocol will make prediction market creation and participation as viral, accessible, and high-velocity as the token creation on platforms like pump.fun? So when we talk about the ""pump.fun moment,"" we're really talking about one thing: what happens when you let anyone create markets without asking permission. That is, when you remove the gatekeepers and just let people launch stuff instantly, you discover this massive demand that nobody knew existed. We're doing the exact same thing for prediction markets. Right now, if you want to create a prediction market on Polarise, you literally type % Bitcoin hits $150K in 2026 and boom, then you've got a live market. AI sets the parameters, liquidity flows in automatically, and you're off. But here's where it gets interesting. We're not just copying the permissionless creation model. We've actually built something with fundamentally better economics. First, you're building an actual asset with multiple revenue streams. When you create a prediction market on Polarise, you're earning trading fees from every transaction, forever. That market is also an NFT that appreciates as trading volume grows. You can stake it for additional DeFi yields. And if you take a position and you're right, you get settlement profits too. So one market, four different ways you're capturing value. That's very different from just ""will my bet pay off or not."" Second, and this is huge: you're never locked in. Traditional prediction markets have this brutal capital efficiency problem. You predict something for 2026? Your money's completely stuck until 2026. Market moves 80% in your favor by mid-2025? Doesn't matter, you can't realize those gains. You found a better opportunity elsewhere? Too bad, your capital's trapped. We solve this through ERC1000. Your prediction position is an NFT that converts to fungible tokens instantly, anytime. So you have complete flexibility: Market price already reflects your thesis and you want to take profits early? Convert the NFT to FT and exit via secondary markets right now. You don't wait two years for settlement. Found a better opportunity and need to rebalance? Convert your position instantly and redeploy that capital wherever you want. Need working capital but still believe in your long-term prediction? Stake the NFT as collateral, get instant liquidity, but keep your position and settlement upside intact. Want passive income while holding? Stake the NFT in DeFi pools and earn yield on top of your prediction exposure. You're never forced into this binary ""lock up capital until settlement or don't play at all."" You have liquidity and optionality at every single stage. That's real capital efficiency. Third, these prediction markets aren't isolated assets. They're composable DeFi primitives. Bundle multiple prediction NFTs into diversified portfolios. Use them as collateral in lending protocols. Integrate them into DAO governance structures. They plug into the entire DeFi ecosystem, not just sit in a silo waiting for settlement. And the AI layer is doing something really important: when you create a market, it's automatically surfaced to people who've traded similar topics, who have positions in correlated predictions, who actually have informed opinions on this. You're not just launching into the void and hoping for liquidity. The protocol is intelligently connecting your market to the right participants from day one. So yeah, the pump.fun comparison is about permissionless creation discovering massive long-tail demand. But we've built proper infrastructure underneath: multiple revenue streams per market, instant exit liquidity at every stage, full composability with DeFi, and intelligent discovery. It's not just ""anyone can create markets now."" It's ""anyone can create markets that generate sustainable cash flow, never lock your capital, and compose with everything else you're doing in DeFi."" That's the actual innovation here. Polarise is backed by top-tier names like Digital Currency Group, Coinbase Ventures, and Animoca Brands. How have these strategic partnerships influenced the development and vision of the protocol, and what does this level of institutional backing mean for user trust? When we went out to raise, we were very selective. We specifically targeted partners who understood what we're building at a technical level: DCG, Coinbase Ventures, Crypto.com, Gate.io, HTX, Polygon, Dapper Labs, Hashkey Capital, Animoca Brands, Alliance DAO. What matters most is what they validated. These institutions did serious technical diligence. They reviewed our ERC1000 architecture. They stress-tested our AI models. They went through our security audits with PeckShield. They modeled our liquidity mechanisms and tokenomics. They weren't investing in a pitch deck or a narrative. They were validating that the protocol actually works at a technical level. DCG and Coinbase Ventures are two of the most sophisticated technical investors in crypto. They've seen every iteration of SocialFi, every prediction market attempt, every ""AI-powered"" protocol pitch. For them to back Polarise means they looked at our architecture and said ""this is different, this actually solves the problems previous attempts couldn't crack."" Crypto.com, Coinlist, Gate.io, HTX, these are major exchanges with deep technical teams. They validated our product from an operational standpoint: can this scale, can this handle real trading volume, does the liquidity model work, is the security infrastructure sound? Polygon and Dapper Labs bring multi-chain expertise. They've deployed protocols at scale across different ecosystems. Their backing validates our technical approach to cross-chain deployment and our ability to deliver performance at Layer 2. Animoca Brands, Hashkey, Alliance DAO, these are ecosystem builders who've backed some of the most successful Web3 projects. They validated product-market fit, our go-to-market strategy, and our understanding of what super individuals actually need. What this means for user trust is straightforward: this isn't a team building in isolation with untested ideas. The protocol has been scrutinized by some of the most experienced technical and strategic minds in crypto, and they've validated the approach. There's also a practical element: runway and commitment. We've seen so many SocialFi projects launch with hype and disappear at the first rough patch. Having strong institutional backing means we have the resources to keep building through market cycles, to iterate based on real user feedback, to deliver on the long-term vision rather than chasing short-term narratives. For new users and community members, could you provide more details about the Polarise Genesis Program? What are the key ways people can get involved right now to earn rewards and contribute to the network's initial growth? Absolutely. Polarose Genesis Referral Program is really important for us because it's how we're bootstrapping the first cohort of super individuals on the protocol before mainnet fully launches. And it's live now! Let me break down what it actually is: Genesis is the pre-launch participation phase where early users accumulate points that convert directly to $RISE token allocation at TGE. This isn't an airdrop in the traditional sense. It's an equity stake for people who help us build network effects before the protocol goes fully live. Here's how participation works: Step one is simple: sign up. You go to www.polarise.org , click ""Unlock Rewards,"" register for Genesis. That's it. You're now in the earliest cohort. The users who got here before mainnet, before TGE, before mass adoption. Step two is completing tasks to earn points. We've structured this around actions that actually help the protocol: Daily check-in gets you 100 points. This keeps you engaged and familiarizes you with the platform as we roll out features. Testnet interaction is 200 points. We need users actually testing the prediction markets, the social symbol compiler, the AI features. Your feedback here directly shapes the product. Linking your Gmail is 200 points. This helps us verify real users versus bots, which matters a lot for maintaining protocol integrity. Social sharing gets bonus points. When you talk about Polarise, you're helping us reach other potential super individuals who'd benefit from the platform. Every task you complete strengthens your position. Every point converts to $RISE allocation. It's straightforward accumulation. Step three is where it gets interesting: the referral multiplier. This is how you really scale your position. Direct invite: 1,000 points per friend you bring in. Second-tier: when your friend invites someone, you get 800 points. Third-tier: when their friend invites someone, you still get 600 points. Three-level referral rewards mean your network compounds automatically. And here's a key detail: when your invited users complete tasks, you instantly receive those referral points. So you're incentivized to bring in people who'll actually use the platform, not just sign up and disappear. Plus, everyone you invite automatically follows you on Polarise. You're building your audience from genesis, before you even start creating prediction markets or topic NFTs. Now, the milestone rewards are permanent, not temporary perks: 20 invites → Gold Badge 60 invites → Platinum Badge plus 1.5× referral points multiplier 100 invites → 1.9× multiplier 200 invites → Diamond Badge 300 invites → Permanent VIP status plus 2.5× multiplier 500 invites → Genesis Founder NFT These aren't just cosmetic. These badges carry actual weight in the protocol. VIP status affects governance rights, early access to new features, priority in liquidity pools. The multipliers compound your earning potential permanently. The Genesis Founder NFT is an on-chain marker that you were here at the beginning, building the network before anyone else. The users with the highest multipliers today will capture the most $RISE allocation tomorrow. That's by design. We want to reward the people who helped bootstrap the network, who brought their communities in, who tested the product when it was rough around the edges. Why should people care about participating now versus waiting? First, points-to-$RISE conversion happens at TGE. The earlier you accumulate, the larger your allocation. Simple math. Second, the referral multipliers are permanent. If you get to Platinum or VIP status now, that 1.5× or 2.5× multiplier applies to everything you earn going forward. Third, you're building your social graph early. Every person you invite follows you. When the protocol launches and you start creating prediction markets or topic NFTs, you have an audience from day one. Other users will be starting from zero. So the call to action is simple: Go to www.polarise.org right now. Click ""Unlock Rewards."" Register. Start earning points. Invite your network. The earlier you start, the larger your stake in what we're building. TGE timeline will be announced soon. Genesis is the window to accumulate maximum allocation. Once mainnet launches and we're live, this opportunity closes. First-mover advantage is real here.Claude can make mistakes. Looking ahead, where do you see Polarise in the next 12-18 months, and what is the ultimate goal for how you will revolutionize the way people interact, socialize, and monetize their capital in Web3? In the next 12-18 months, we have very concrete milestones: First, mainnet launch is imminent. We're talking weeks, not months. The protocol is live, DeFi modules are running with $22.9M TVL, security audits are complete. What's happening now is final polish and Genesis Program completion to ensure we have that critical initial user base. TGE is coming right after mainnet launch. We'll be announcing the exact timeline very soon, but Genesis participants should understand: the points you're accumulating now convert directly to $RISE token allocation at TGE. Post-TGE and mainnet, the focus is scaling the AI layer. Right now, our AI provides decision support for prediction market pricing, portfolio optimization, content strategy. Over the next year, we're expanding that significantly: AI trading agents that can execute strategies autonomously with user approval, more sophisticated sentiment analysis across on-chain and off-chain data, predictive models for creator growth trajectories. We're also expanding the social features. Right now, you can deploy prediction markets and topic NFTs. We're building out the full creator economy tools: livestream monetization is a major milestone. Let's imagine streaming where every viewer interaction, every tip, every engagement moment converts directly to tradeable assets in real-time. Community DAO templates that auto-deploy with optimized tokenomics. Reputation systems that compound your influence as you demonstrate consistent judgment. Multi-chain deployment is critical. We're launching on Ethereum, but we're not staying there. BNB Chain, Base, Polygon and all EVM integration is already in progress. Solana is next because that's where a lot of consumer crypto activity lives. And we're building integrations with the broader DeFi ecosystem. Our prediction market NFTs and social assets need to plug into existing lending protocols, DEXs, yield aggregators. Composability isn't a requirement just for us. Instead, it's what makes the entire vision work. Your Polarise assets should be usable across the entire DeFi landscape. We'll also be announcing heavyweight strategic partnerships over the coming months. I can't share specifics yet, but we're in late-stage discussions with major platforms and protocols that will significantly expand Polarise's reach and capabilities. These aren't just ""partnership announcements"", they're real integrations that bring substantial user bases and new use cases to the protocol. Now, the bigger vision: AI has already given individuals institutional-grade capabilities. Anyone can now analyze data, optimize strategies, make predictions at a level that used to require entire teams. But here's the problem: Web2 platforms give you AI tools while extracting all the value you create. What we're building is the missing piece: infrastructure that lets individuals not just use AI capabilities, but actually capture the value those capabilities generate. When you create prediction markets using AI-optimized parameters, you're not just making content for a platform. You're deploying cash-flowing assets you own. When you build communities with AI-enhanced engagement strategies, you're not generating ""metrics"" for advertisers. You're creating economic primitives where every interaction converts to value you and your community capture. When you stream with AI analyzing viewer behavior in real-time, attention doesn't flow to platform ad revenue. It converts directly to tradeable assets. The goal isn't making everyone into mega-influencers. It's making ""super individual"" normal. If you have edge in a niche, you should earn sustainable income. If you build a community of 500 engaged people, that should generate real economic returns. The AI layer handles the complexity: optimization, execution, portfolio management. You focus on what you're good at: judgment, community, value creation. In five years, success means Polarise becomes the standard infrastructure enabling super individuals across platforms. Not a walled garden, but the financial rails underneath social interaction everywhere. Genesis participants are proving this evolution is possible. With TGE and mainnet launching soon, we're moving from theory to reality. For someone new to SocialFi or prediction markets, what is the best entry point or first step they should take to get involved with Polarise today? Honestly, just jump in. Go to www.polarise.org, click ""Unlock Rewards,"" register for Polarise Genesis Program. Here's what I actually recommend for someone new: Create one prediction market about something you have an opinion on. Type % Bitcoin hits $150K by 2026 or whatever you think will happen. AI handles the parameters, liquidity bootstraps automatically. You don't need to understand smart contracts. Watch what happens: people trade on your market, you earn fees, prices move with sentiment. That's the lightbulb moment when you realize you just turned an opinion into a cash-flowing asset. For Genesis specifically: Sign up, complete basic tasks: daily check-in, testnet interaction, link Gmail. Then invite friends who'd actually use this. Your referral points compound through three levels, and everyone you invite automatically follows you. You don't need to be a DeFi expert. Polarise is designed for people with judgment and social capital, not necessarily technical knowledge. The protocol handles complexity. You focus on opinions, communities, value creation. Start small: create one market, invite a few friends, watch how it works. Then scale from there. And stay connected with the community: X: https://x.com/Polariseorg Discord: https://discord.gg/polariseprotocol Telegram: https://t.me/polariseorg The earlier you start, the better. Genesis points convert to $RISE at TGE. Milestone multipliers are permanent. Getting in now means compounding advantages before mainnet launches.

This development, first reported by Reuters, carries significant implications for institutional capital flows and market stability. With a decision deadline of January 15, the crypto community watches closely, especially after JPMorgan’s analysis projected potential outflows reaching a staggering $8.8 billion. What Does a Potential MSCI Index Removal Mean for Strategy? An MSCI index removal represents more than a symbolic setback. These indexes serve as essential benchmarks for countless institutional investors, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and passive investment vehicles worldwide. When a company is removed, those funds are often compelled to sell their holdings to maintain accurate index tracking. Therefore, the primary concern revolves around forced selling pressure and its subsequent impact on Strategy’s market valuation and liquidity. CEO Michael Saylor has publicly confirmed the ongoing talks with MSCI. However, in a notable rebuttal, he has expressed strong disagreement with the $8.8 billion outflow figure estimated by banking giant JPMorgan. This discrepancy highlights the uncertainty and high stakes involved in the situation. Breaking Down the $8.8 Billion Outflow Estimate JPMorgan’s analysis sent shockwaves through the market. To understand the scale, consider the mechanisms at play: Index-Tracking Funds : Billions in assets under management (AUM) are tied to replicating MSCI index performance. Automated Selling : Upon official removal, these funds would automatically divest their Strategy holdings. Market Impact : Such concentrated selling could depress the price, potentially triggering further sell-offs from other investors. Saylor’s counter-argument likely centers on the actual composition of index holders and potential pre-emptive adjustments by large funds. The true financial impact remains a point of intense debate until MSCI’s final verdict. Why Is the January 15 Decision Date So Important? The January 15 deadline set by MSCI creates a clear timeline for market participants. This date is critical for several reasons: It provides a finite window for Strategy to present its case to the index provider. It allows institutional investors to model scenarios and prepare contingency plans. It concentrates market anticipation, which can lead to increased volatility as the date approaches. The outcome will set a precedent for how major index providers evaluate and treat cryptocurrency-centric investment firms in the future. A removal could signal stricter criteria, while retention would affirm Strategy’s standing in traditional finance circles. Actionable Insights for Investors Navigating the Uncertainty For investors, this period requires careful navigation rather than reactionary decisions. Here are key considerations: Monitor Official Channels : Rely on announcements from MSCI and Strategy rather than speculative reports. Assess Portfolio Exposure : Evaluate how much of your portfolio is tied to Strategy or correlated assets. Understand the Timeline : Remember that any official MSCI index removal would involve a implementation lag, not an instantaneous sell-off. Look Beyond the Headline : Consider Strategy’s fundamental business health alongside this index-specific event. Conclusion: A Defining Moment for Crypto-Traditional Finance Integration The discussions between Strategy and MSCI underscore the ongoing and sometimes tense integration of cryptocurrency entities into the traditional financial system. While the potential for significant outflows from an MSCI index removal is a serious near-term risk, the long-term narrative revolves around legitimacy and acceptance. January 15 will deliver a verdict, but the broader conversation about crypto’s role in institutional portfolios will continue. This event serves as a powerful reminder of the growing interconnectedness between digital asset markets and established financial frameworks. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is an MSCI index and why is it important? A: MSCI indexes are globally recognized benchmarks used by institutional investors to track market performance and guide investment decisions. Inclusion signifies credibility, while removal can trigger mandatory selling by funds that track the index. Q2: Why might MSCI consider removing Strategy from its index? A: While not publicly specified, common reasons include not meeting certain liquidity, market capitalization, or corporate governance criteria required for continued inclusion. Q3: If removed, would the selling happen immediately on January 15? A> No. The decision is announced on that date, but the actual removal and subsequent rebalancing by funds would occur on a predetermined future date, giving investors time to adjust. Q4: Does CEO Michael Saylor believe the outflow will be lower than $8.8B? A: Yes. Saylor has confirmed the discussions but publicly disagreed with JPMorgan’s specific financial estimate, suggesting the real impact may be different. Q5: How can retail investors protect themselves during this event? A> Avoid panic selling based on headlines. Focus on Strategy’s long-term fundamentals, diversify your holdings, and consider setting strategic buy-limit orders in case of a market overreaction. Q6: Has this happened to other crypto companies before? A: Yes. Other crypto-related stocks have faced similar index inclusion and exclusion events, which often cause short-term volatility but don’t necessarily dictate long-term success.

A crypto-friendly Hassett could revitalize the market and bring more investors in, effectively ending the current bear market. Bitcoin Hyper uses SVM-based execution to bring scalable smart contracts and DeFi to Bitcoin, offering a higher-octane way to ride a long-term $BTC bull thesis. $HYPER raised over $28.8M in presale so far and is positioned for a post-launch ROI of 1,396% in 2026 and 11,123% or higher by 2030. Donald Trump floating former White House economist Kevin Hassett as a ‘potential Fed chair’ is more than a personnel rumor. Kalshi’s prediction puts the odds at 84% and growing, while The Kobeissi Letter already sees it as a one-and-done , with the mention that ‘2026 is going to be a wild year.’ If confirmed, the arrival of Kevin Hassett at the helm would spell good news for crypto. A more dovish, crypto-tolerant Federal Reserve would structurally lower the hurdle for risk assets. Cheaper capital and less aggressive tightening historically favor high-beta trades, from tech equities to altcoins. If Bitcoin is the macro bellwether in this environment, Bitcoin-linked leverage plays could become the next logical step for conviction bulls. But there’s a catch: Bitcoin’s base layer still processes roughly seven transactions per second, with fees that can spike into double digits during congestion and no native smart contracts. That’s where Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) comes into focus. It positions itself as a Bitcoin Layer 2 with Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) integration, designed to give you Solana-style performance and programmable DeFi rails while still anchoring to Bitcoin’s settlement layer. Read this to learn more about what Bitcoin Hyper is. Why Looser Fed Policy Supercharges Bitcoin’s Infrastructure Race A credible chance of a crypto-friendly Fed chair changes the calculus for builders and investors. If rate cuts or a softer stance are on the table, liquidity doesn’t just chase $BTC; it hunts yield, leverage, and new primitives that sit on top of Bitcoin and other base layers. That’s why Bitcoin scalability and programmability are suddenly core macro trades, not just technical debates. Lightning Network tackles payments but struggles with UX and liquidity routing at scale. Meanwhile, Bitcoin-adjacent ecosystems like Stacks, Rootstock, and Merlin Chain are racing to bolt smart contracts and DeFi onto Bitcoin without compromising security guarantees. In this emerging Layer 2 stack, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is one contender, pitching a modular design where Bitcoin remains the settlement and security anchor while a high-throughput execution layer handles smart contracts. You can buy $HYPER on the official presale page today. How Bitcoin Hyper Turns Bitcoin Into a High-Beta DeFi Play Zooming in, Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) markets itself as the first Bitcoin Layer 2 to integrate the Solana Virtual Machine, targeting real-world throughput that can exceed Solana’s own benchmarks while still anchoring state back to Bitcoin. The core idea: keep Bitcoin as the trust layer, but move execution to an SVM-powered environment optimized for parallel processing and sub-second confirmation. The result: a faster, cheaper, and more scalable Bitcoin network, attracting more institutional investors and tapping into the mainstream. By combining a modular architecture – Bitcoin L1 for settlement, an SVM-based L2 for execution, and a decentralized Canonical Bridge for $BTC transfers – $HYPER sidesteps Bitcoin’s biggest constraints: slow base-layer confirmation times, volatile on-chain fees, and the absence of native smart contract logic. The goal is to enable swaps, lending, staking, NFTs, and gaming in wrapped $BTC with low latency and low cost. From a market-structure angle, this turns $HYPER into a leveraged bet on Bitcoin’s upside and on-chain usage growth. The presale has raised over $28.8M so far, with $HYPER sitting at $0.013365, suggesting investors are already positioning for a structurally looser policy backdrop and a richer Bitcoin DeFi stack. Based on the presale’s performance and Bitcoin Hyper’s utility, we expect the token to hit the market hard. A fair price prediction for $HYPER considers a potential target of $0.20 in 2026 and a high of $1.50 by 2030, once Bitcoin Hyper achieves its core developmental phases. Think 1,396% and 11,123% in terms of ROIs for one-year and five-year investment plans respectively. From a pure numbers’ perspective, $HYPER could become one of the best altcoins to buy in 2026. The presale targets a release window between Q4 2025 and Q1 2026, depending on market conditions and demand, with the latter already being high. So, if you want in, you should feel a sense of urgency right about now. Make sure you read our guide on how to buy $HYPER first, though. Go to the presale page and buy your $HYPER now.

These investors, who purchased BTC within the last one to three months, now face their largest unrealized losses of the current market cycle. This development signals we may be approaching a significant turning point in cryptocurrency markets. What Do Maximum Losses for Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Mean? According to analysis from CryptoQuant contributor DarkPost, Bitcoin short-term holders have been experiencing unrealized losses of 20-25% for over two consecutive weeks. This creates maximum psychological pressure on these investors, who typically have less conviction than long-term holders. When these losses reach extreme levels, they often precede important market shifts. The situation becomes particularly significant because these Bitcoin short-term holders will remain in a loss-making position until Bitcoin’s price recovers to approximately $113,000. This creates a psychological barrier that can influence market behavior in several ways: Increased selling pressure as investors attempt to cut losses Reduced buying interest from this investor cohort Potential capitulation events that typically mark market bottoms Why Should You Care About Short-Term Holder Psychology? Market psychology plays a crucial role in cryptocurrency price movements. The current situation with Bitcoin short-term holders represents a classic market sentiment extreme. DarkPost explains that genuine buying opportunities typically emerge only after a significant number of these holders capitulate and sell at a loss. This process serves several important market functions: It transfers assets from weak hands to strong hands It creates oversold conditions that can trigger rebounds It establishes stronger support levels for future price action The extended period of losses – now exceeding two weeks – suggests we’re approaching a decision point. Either these Bitcoin short-term holders will capitulate, potentially creating a buying opportunity, or Bitcoin’s price will need to recover significantly to relieve their psychological pressure. How Does This Situation Compare to Previous Cycles? Historical analysis shows that extreme pain for Bitcoin short-term holders often coincides with market turning points. Previous cycles have demonstrated that when this group experiences maximum losses, it frequently marks either a significant bottom or the beginning of a new trend phase. Several factors make the current situation particularly noteworthy: The duration of losses has extended beyond typical periods The percentage losses are substantial but not unprecedented The psychological impact is amplified by broader market conditions For investors monitoring the situation, the key question becomes: Will these Bitcoin short-term holders hold through the pain, or will their capitulation create the next major buying opportunity? What Actionable Insights Can Investors Take From This Analysis? Understanding the dynamics affecting Bitcoin short-term holders provides valuable insights for all market participants. First, recognize that extreme psychological pressure often precedes market reversals. Second, monitor for signs of capitulation, which could signal improved risk-reward opportunities. Consider these practical steps: Monitor trading volume for signs of capitulation selling Watch for price stabilization after periods of maximum pain Consider dollar-cost averaging if capitulation occurs Maintain perspective about typical market cycle patterns Remember that while Bitcoin short-term holders are experiencing maximum pain, this doesn’t guarantee immediate price recovery. However, it does indicate we’re in a phase where market sentiment has reached an important extreme. Conclusion: Navigating the Current Bitcoin Market Phase The situation with Bitcoin short-term holders represents a critical market juncture. Their maximum losses create psychological pressure that typically resolves through either price recovery or investor capitulation. Both outcomes have significant implications for market direction. As we monitor this development, remember that extreme sentiment readings often mark turning points rather than continuation patterns. The pain experienced by Bitcoin short-term holders today could well plant the seeds for tomorrow’s recovery – but only time will reveal whether capitulation or price recovery provides the resolution. Frequently Asked Questions Who are considered Bitcoin short-term holders? Bitcoin short-term holders typically refer to investors who have held their BTC for one to three months. They’re often more sensitive to price movements than long-term holders. Why do short-term holder losses matter for the overall market? When short-term holders experience maximum losses, it creates psychological pressure that can lead to capitulation selling. This often marks market bottoms and transfers assets to stronger hands. What price does Bitcoin need to reach for short-term holders to break even? According to the analysis, Bitcoin needs to recover to approximately $113,000 for these short-term holders to exit their loss-making positions. How long have short-term holders been experiencing these losses? The current period of 20-25% unrealized losses has persisted for over two weeks, creating extended psychological pressure. Should I buy Bitcoin when short-term holders are experiencing maximum pain? While maximum pain can signal potential buying opportunities, it’s not a timing indicator. Consider dollar-cost averaging and proper risk management rather than trying to time exact bottoms. What signs indicate short-term holders are capitulating? Look for increased selling volume at lower prices, negative sentiment extremes across social media, and sustained price declines despite oversold conditions.

Glassnode Explains!",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/has-bitcoin-really-turned-bearish-or-is-the-bullish-trend-continuing-glassnode-explains/,"Bitcoin (BTC) green-washed the entire market with the recovery wave it launched last night. However, the sharp corrections it has experienced consecutively over the past two months have revived talk of a bear and crypto winter. While some analysts claim that a bear market has arrived with the declines, others state that such deep corrections are normal in bull markets and that the bull market is not over yet. At this point, analysis firm Glassnode said in its latest report that it is too early to declare crypto winter for Bitcoin. It's too early to say the market has entered a “crypto winter” or a prolonged bear market, and such claims lack sufficient evidence, according to a new report by Glassnode and Fasanara Digital. Analysts have noted that Bitcoin experienced similar declines during periods of leverage reduction or macro tightening, namely in 2017, 2020, and 2023, before continuing to rise. Glassnode and Fasanara stated that the leverage reduction in October 2025 followed this pattern seen in other years. Glassnode and Fasanara Digital pointed to Bitcoin’s recent influx of more than $732 billion in net new capital since its 2022 cycle bottom as an example of the bull run. Citing several key indicators, analyst firms have argued that the current decline is a mid-cycle consolidation. At this point, the report noted that capital inflows during the last Bitcoin cycle exceeded the total of all previous cycles. Apart from this, the spot price has increased from the 2022 bottom of $16,000 to $126,000, and spot Bitcoin ETFs currently hold 1.36 million BTC (6.9% of the circulating supply) and continue to see sustained demand. The report also noted that Bitcoin's current price action is different from past crypto winters. According to the report, Bitcoin is trading closer to this year's peak of $126,000 than its cycle low of $76,000, whereas in previous winters, BTC had fallen towards the bottom of its range. At this point, analysts argued that Bitcoin needed to fall much lower to be considered in bear season. Glassnode and Fasanara also noted that fundamental bear market signals are absent in Bitcoin. One-year realized volatility has fallen from 84% to 43%, in contrast to the increased volatility seen at the beginning of past winters. Furthermore, there is no evidence of miner hash rates falling or of realized losses accumulating among long-term investors. *This is not investment advice.

The announcement triggered a 7.2% plunge in early trading, with shares last quoted lower as of press time, based on data from CNBC. SoftBank unloads shares as Eutelsat lags far behind Starlink The timing couldn’t be worse for Eutelsat, which merged with OneWeb in 2023, hoping to compete with Starlink , the satellite-internet arm of Elon Musk’s empire. But the gap is still massive. On its site, Eutelsat claims to operate over 600 satellites. On the other hand, Starlink lists more than 6,750 satellites in orbit. The difference in scale speaks for itself. The company had been riding high earlier this year. In early March 2025, shares skyrocketed more than 600%, as Europe raced to build up its tech infrastructure following the U.S. pullback in military support to Ukraine. That momentum definitely did not last. Since those March highs, Eutelsat has cratered more than 70%, erasing most of the year’s gains and calling its long-term plan into question. To stabilize things, the French government stepped in. In June, Paris led a €1.35 billion (roughly $1.57 billion) investment round, becoming Eutelsat’s top shareholder with a stake near 30%. That gave the company access to fresh capital and a lifeline, but not enough to change its market position. The merger with OneWeb hasn’t delivered the dominance many in Brussels hoped for. Meanwhile, SoftBank’s selloff might not be the last. The Japanese company hasn’t issued any public explanation yet. The fire-sale structure, though, suggests they weren’t interested in holding through the dilution. And in this market, that kind of selling attracts more selling. European indices rise while investors eye Fed decision and ADP report Despite the blow to Eutelsat, Europe’s stock market opened pretty strong today, with the Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.32%, holding at 577.50. Most major indexes across the region showed gains. France’s CAC 40 climbed 0.27% to 8,096.74. Italy’s FTSE MIB jumped 0.76% to 43,683.47. Germany’s DAX rose 0.32% to 23,786.81. Spain’s IBEX 35 popped 1.50% to 16,721.00. The UK’s FTSE 100, however, slipped 0.14% to 9,687.74. The gains followed a bounce in U.S. markets on Tuesday and solid trading in Asia overnight, after a weak start to the week. In the States, all three major indexes finished green. Nvidia led the tech rally. Bitcoin also rebounded after logging its worst session since March the day before. The S&P 500 and Dow both dipped during the session but recovered late, while the Nasdaq hugged the flatline before lifting. Investors are now bracing for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate call on December 10. The odds of a rate cut have surged to 89%, based on trader expectations. That’s a steep jump from the middle of November and reflects bets that inflation is cooling faster than expected. The next test for those bets comes fast, as labors numbers in the ADP private payrolls report for November is scheduled to hit around 5 hours from now. The report is expected to show the job market holding steady, giving the Fed more cover to ease policy if needed. If you're reading this, you’re already ahead.

With the revival of BTC, market analysts notice the distribution shift of capital. It has been forecasted that investment capital, in search of greater growing prospects beyond the ever-increasing trend established by Bitcoin, will pour vigorously into a specially identified new cryptocurrency, named Mutuum Finance (MUTM), whose rapidly developing presale process garners advanced investor interest. Bitcoin Miner Capitulation The current Hash Ribbon signal, which occurs when the 60-day hashrate moving average crosses above the 30-day moving average, shows the strength of the pressure against Bitcoin miners. The capitulation level, shown in the 15% decline from all-time highs in network hashrate, has always represented significant buying moments in the past, such as May 2021 and December 2022. The current signal comes after a 35% price adjustment from Bitcoin’s October peak, bringing the miner hashprice to its five-year low, pushing miners to turn towards related domains like AI. Miner exhaustion helps remove speculative players from the market, thereby setting the stage for an intense bull run. Although Bitcoin has stabilized above $90,000, the fact that such a pattern is being formed means that the top cryptocurrency could very well be about to embark on the next phase of its ascendancy, giving the market a highly positive indicator in the process. Mutuum Finance Holds Strong Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is rapidly becoming the go-to destination for capital in search of exponential gains. The presale stage of the project has exhibited remarkable speed, accumulating well over $19,050,000 from the support of 18,270 wallets. It is at the critical stage of phase 6, with tokens priced at $0.035. This phase will soon reach a complete sell-out situation, thereby providing a limited period of investment opportunity as the price will rise after that. The approaching completion of Phase 6 will mark the beginning of Phase 7; hence, there will be an increase of about 20% in the price, rising to $0.040. The systematic approach towards attaining the $0.06 launch price enables current buyers to gain above 400% return-on-investment, thereby emerging as one of the most attractive emerging cryptocurrencies in the market. Dual-Lending Model The key strength of Mutuum Finance is in its innovative dual lending model ecosystem, built to meet the requirements of all manner of assets and risk thresholds. The project features Peer to Contract (P2C) lending pools for liquid assets such as ETH or USDT in order to generate yields from the pool when deposits are made. The above is coupled with Peer-to-Peer (P2P) marketplace services, which enable and support direct lending in tokens that are considered less suitable for pooling. By providing such diversity in services, Mutuum Finance ensures that both conservative and adventurous buyers can enjoy services under the same ecosystem, thus making it the most comprehensive Defi crypto-exchange service in the marketplace. Stability & Security in the New Era Mutuum Finance has always focused on strong security mechanisms from the very beginning. The most important lending and borrowing smart contracts of the project are at the moment undergoing an analysis and audit by Halborn, which is a leading security firm in the space. In addition, the fact that the platform relies on oracles from Chainlink ensures the integrity of data from the price feeds, an important factor when it comes to liquidation. It can thus be said that the security mechanisms at play in the MUTM project offer considerable comfort to its investors. The Shift in Strategy Has Commenced The convergence of the signs from Bitcoin’s on-chain data and the meteoric presale success of Mutuum Finance highlights the fact that the market is in flux. During the time that Bitcoin is consolidating in preparation for the next phase of the trend in the positive cycle, smart money knows where to put its bets. Mutuum Finance embodies exactly such an investment—namely, a protocol with such an innovative lending vision, such an unwavering dedication to security, and such an imminent presale period with significant price surges ahead. For all such investors tracking where the smart money is headed, buying the MUTM tokens prior to the end of Phase 6 is the clear-cut play.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk has ordered an investigation into an alleged “crypto affair,” implicating the head of state, while members of his ruling coalition are accusing him of attending to Russian interests. Halted Polish crypto bill stirs political storm in Warsaw Poland is descending into a major political clash over Nawrocki’s decision to stop the Tusk cabinet’s attempt to impose legislation transposing the EU’s latest crypto rules into national law. On Monday, the president vetoed the Crypto-Asset Market Act passed by the Polish parliament, which critics say is much harsher than Europe’s Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. The local Bitcoin community has already warned it may literally kill crypto business in the country, and the recently elected Polish leader expressed additional concerns in his motives, including regarding Poles’ personal and economic freedoms and their state’s stability. Tusk’s government counterattacked, alleging Nawrocki’s participation in a “crypto affair” and exposing his “weird relationship” with the digital asset industry, as reported by Bitcoin.pl portal. “Everyone is already talking about a crypto scam. This involves a large company, lawsuits, investigations, suspected murder, the disappearance of the manager of a key crypto firm,” the prime minister stated, quoted by the RIA Novosti news agency. He also saw a “political campaign” behind the president’s move and spoke about right-wing leaders and media advertising one of the investigated companies. On Tuesday, Tusk also lashed out in a post on X. Screenshot of the English translation of Tusk’s tweet. Source: @donaldtusk via X/Twitter The head of the Polish government announced he had instructed his colleagues in the government to collect details on the case, stating: “I expect the Minister of Finance to provide full information about the negative consequences of this veto, and I ask Ministers Siemoniak, Kerwiński, and Żurek for information about the context of this case and who is behind the blocking of this law.” Tomasz Siemoniak is Poland’s coordinating minister of intelligence, Marcin Kerwiński is the head of the Ministry of the Interior, and Waldemar Żurek serves as minister of justice and prosecutor general. Donald Tusk vowed to push the law through parliament again and resubmit it for signature from Nawrocki, whom he directly threatened: “I ask you to treat this as your last chance to remove your name from the crypto scam, which has become a very public fact in recent days.” Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Gawkowski blamed the president for “blocking progress in digitalization.” And the government said the bill will be “immediately” sent back to Polish lawmakers to ensure protection for 3 million Polish investors, as Tusk insisted. Ruling coalition alleges Russian connection in presidential veto The Civic Coalition, which holds the executive power in Warsaw, went even further, with its representatives suggesting that Nawrocki’s halt of their legislative initiative actually serves Putin’s Russia , because Moscow is using cryptocurrencies to circumvent Western sanctions . Bitcoin.pl, which registered the attack on social media, described the claim as “bold but misguided.” The crypto news outlet insisted that “a well-constructed law could block this without destroying the Polish Web3 ecosystem.” The website pointed out that the proposed crypto law is “more than 100 pages of legislative nightmare, full of mistakes, ambiguities and bureaucratic barriers” that can “finish off” Polish blockchain businesses. It also commented: “The president vetoed it not to defend fraudsters, but to give time to correct fundamental mistakes. It’s not a blocking of innovation, but an attempt to save it from the legislative molochs.” The online edition called the moment critical for the Polish crypto market, arguably Eastern Europe’s largest within the EU, as it provides an opportunity to adopt rules that protect investors, without strangling entrepreneurs. “If the bill passes in its current form, we are in for a massive exodus of companies and capital to more friendly jurisdictions,” the Bitcoin portal wrote, listing some of the more welcoming nations in Europe such as Estonia, Switzerland and Portugal, besides Poland’s Czech and Hungarian neighbors.

55296818,638903,1764761447,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55296818.jpeg,"Bitcoin Bubble Worse Than Tulip Mania, Claims ‘Big Short’ Michael Burry",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bubble-worse-tulip-mania-michael-burry/,"Michael Burry has escalated his long-running war on Bitcoin, calling it “the tulip bulb of our time” and insisting it is “not worth anything.” Speaking on Michael Lewis’ “Against the Rules: The Big Short Companion” podcast released on December 2, Burry recoiled at how normalized such valuations have become in financial media. Burry Revives Tulip Bubble Comparison For Bitcoin “I think that Bitcoin at $100,000 is the most ridiculous thing,” he said. “Sane people are sitting on TV talking about Bitcoin, they’re just casually, ‘it’s 100,000, it’s down now, it’s 98,000.’ It’s not worth anything. Everybody’s accepted it. It’s the tulip bulb of our time.” He then pushed the analogy further: “It’s worse than a tulip bulb because this has enabled so much criminal activity to go deep under.” The exchange was triggered when Lewis asked whether Burry’s “institutional pessimism” nudged him toward refuges like “Bitcoin or gold or one of these refuges that people” talk about. Burry rejected Bitcoin outright and drew a sharp contrast with his own positioning: “I have had gold since 2005.” In his framework, Bitcoin is not “digital gold” but a speculative token whose perceived value rests on social consensus and leverage, while simultaneously, in his view, providing a powerful channel for illicit flows rather than productive capital formation. Burry’s critique is consistent with his broader view that markets are again trapped in a cross-asset bubble driven by narrative and cheap money rather than fundamentals. But he does not present himself as a crypto macro-trader looking to time Bitcoin’s next leg lower. Instead, Bitcoin appears in the interview as a kind of exhibit A in a system that, he argues, has once more stopped asking what anything is intrinsically worth and simply extrapolates price action and stories. Burry’s Critique Is Not New The podcast marks the latest chapter in a Bitcoin skepticism that Burry has been voicing since the last cycle. In late February 2021, with BTC near its then-record zone, he tweeted that “BTC is a speculative bubble that poses more risk than opportunity despite most of the proponents being correct in their arguments for why it is relevant at this point in history,” adding a warning on hidden leverage: “If you do not know how much leverage is involved in the run-up, you may not know enough to own it.” By June 2021, as meme stocks and crypto surged together, Burry widened the lens . He described the environment as the “greatest speculative bubble of all time in all things. By two orders of magnitude,” and cautioned that “all hype/speculation is doing is drawing in retail before the mother of all crashes,” explicitly including cryptocurrencies in that warning. Today’s “tulip bulb” broadside on Lewis’ podcast does not represent a new stance so much as the culmination of that trajectory: from calling Bitcoin a leveraged “speculative bubble” in early 2021 to declaring in 2025 that, at the kinds of levels now discussed on television, it is simply “not worth anything” at all. At press time, BTC traded at $93,226.",Bitcoin News|bitcoin|bitcoin news|bitcoin price|btc|BTC news|btc price|Michael Burry,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-03 11:30:47

Crypto researcher SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) has unearthed another notable link, showing that Apple Pay supports Ripple’s Interledger Protocol . He shared a document that explored how Ripple’s technology could fit inside Apple’s large ecosystem. The document pinpoints possible use cases that could help XRP in the Apple Pay ecosystem. XRPApple Pay Documented. https://t.co/JUdTe88Ibs pic.twitter.com/x9F9ddVv3j — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) November 30, 2025 Financial Transformation Potential The first point is financial transformation. It stated that “Ripple’s efficiency and the potential for instant transactions leveraging Apple’s $900B ecosystem could revolutionize digital finance.” Ripple builds tools that move values faster. Apple Pay reaches millions of users each day. Ripple uses XRP as a settlement asset . It leverages its low fees and short confirmation times. Apple Pay handles retail, online, and in-app payments worldwide. The document says this mix can support new tools for payments, inclusion, credit, and digital access. These goals match Ripple’s work on cross-border transfers. Apple Pay provides a means to picture how such tools might grow. SMQKE linked this point to his earlier note about Interledger support. This shows that Apple Pay can interact with systems that follow Interledger rules. Apple’s Role in Crypto Exploration The second section discusses Apple’s crypto potential. It points to Apple’s $2.7 trillion market capitalization and 1 billion iPhone users, noting that Apple moves slowly when it explores crypto tools. XRP is already making significant headway in mobile accessibility . It states that this careful path puts Apple in a position to “accelerate crypto adoption.” Apple has not launched a full crypto feature in Apple Pay. It runs a platform that shapes daily payment habits. If Apple tests new digital tools, developers will react. This gives Ripple supporters a reason to suggest how XRP could fit future products. SMQKE shared the screenshot to show these ideas. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Regulatory Access and Compliance The third section discusses regulatory access and compliance, noting strict rules in the U.S. and Canada. It conveys the setup that backs legal standards. It also mentions “ensuring a secure and streamlined investment process in XRP through Apple Pay.” Ripple and Apple previously worked together on Apple’s tap-to-pay feature . Ripple highlights compliance. Apple enforces strict rules for payment services. Both have the tools to build payment systems that meet required regulatory standards. SMQKE’s post links technical details with large-scale payment tools. Ripple’s speed, Apple Pay’s reach, and a focus on rules form strengths. It shows why many people see long-term value in XRP’s role in digital payments. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This signals returning risk appetite, bolstering the case for curated presale exposure. Bitcoin Hyper brings SVM execution and extremely low-latency processing to a Bitcoin Layer 2, targeting wrapped $BTC payments, DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. Maxi Doge and Pumpd offer higher‑beta meme exposure, the former around leverage‑trader culture, the latter around automated burns and AI market tooling. Altcoin risk appetite is quietly returning. Coinbase’s latest roadmap additions and Bithumb’s fresh KRW pairs show that big, regulated venues are finally widening the funnel again, just as spot volumes and stablecoin float start to recover from 2024’s drawdown. When top-tier exchanges expand listings to improve liquidity, it’s usually not about chasing memes; it’s about preparing inventory for the next rotation. Historically, periods like this have front‑run broad alt seasons as sidelined capital migrates from $BTC and stablecoins into higher‑beta narratives. You’re also seeing a structural shift under the surface. Stablecoin market caps are ticking higher , basis trades are back on, and derivatives funding is no longer screaming fear. That combination tends to favor early‑stage bets: investors look for presales that marry strong narratives with credible tech and clear token utility. Against that backdrop, three of the best crypto presales stand out across very different corners of the market: Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) as a high‑throughput Bitcoin Layer 2, Maxi Doge ($MAXI) as a hyper‑speculative trading culture play, and Pumpd ($PUMPD) as an experiment in algorithmic meme tokenomics and AI tooling. Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER): The High-Performance Layer 2 for the Bitcoin Economy Bitcoin established the foundation of digital finance as the ultimate store of value. But to power the next generation of Web3, the network needs speed and utility without sacrificing security. Introducing Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) , a revolutionary Layer 2 scaling solution engineered to take Bitcoin further. Bitcoin Hyper differentiates itself by integrating the high-performance Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) directly atop Bitcoin’s security anchor. This unique architecture leverages the SVM’s parallel processing capabilities to deliver sub-second finality and negligible gas fees, making high-frequency trading and complex DeFi finally viable on Bitcoin. Furthermore, onboarding assets is secure and seamless via its robust canonical bridge. This trust-minimized gateway ensures that native $BTC can be safely ported onto the Bitcoin Hyper network without relying on centralized intermediaries. Want a bit more project info? We’ve got you covered in our ‘ What is Bitcoin Hyper ’ guide. The native $HYPER token fuels this rapidly expanding ecosystem, serving as the essential currency for network transaction fees and decentralized governance. Bitcoin Hyper isn’t just faster money; it is the sophisticated infrastructure needed for a decentralized future built on the bedrock of Bitcoin. $HYPER’s already flying high, having raised over $28.8M in its presale. It currently offers you 40% staking rewards, and there have been some hefty whale purchases, one of $500K , showing that smart money sees it as a viable play. Buy your $HYPER today for $0.013365. 2. Maxi Doge ($MAXI): Meme Token for Leverage Degens Maxi Doge ($MAXI) leans unapologetically into the leverage culture that still defines much of crypto trading. Branded as a 240‑lb canine juggernaut, it’s less about utility primitives and more about capturing the 1000x mentality through community competition, and the ‘never skip leg-day, never skip a pump’ attitude. The core pitch is ‘Leverage King Culture’: a meme asset that personifies the high‑risk, high‑reward ethos of perpetual traders while avoiding actual 1000x leverage on platforms that blow up accounts. Holder‑only trading competitions, performance leaderboards, and reward campaigns in the future will turn speculative behavior itself into content and community glue. Already sold on the vibe? Check out our ‘ How to Buy Maxi Doge ’ guide to see how to get in on the action. On the numbers side, the Maxi Doge presale has raised over $4.2M so far, with tokens currently at $0.000271. That’s a meaningful war chest for marketing, liquidity provisioning, and partnerships through its Maxi Fund treasury, which is earmarked to support listings and ecosystem collaborations as conditions improve. Staking comes with a dynamic APY model currently offering 72% rewards, which can flex based on treasury performance and market conditions. If you believe meme liquidity roars back whenever alt seasons kick off, Maxi Doge offers a focused bet on that behavior. Buy Maxi Doge in its presale now. 3. Pumpd ($PUMPD): Daily-Pump Meme Coin With AI Trading Tools Pumpd ($PUMPD) pushes meme tokenomics into more programmatic territory. It’s a meme‑driven project whose smart contract encodes daily price increase mechanics, an automated burn schedule tied to market triggers, and AI‑powered analytics tools designed to help holders trade more intelligently across the broader market. The token includes a ‘daily pump’ parameter baked into the contract, effectively engineering a persistent upward bias in the quoted presale price while supply gets reduced via automatic burns. Those burns are triggered by specific market conditions, removing tokens from circulation without relying on manual team actions or discretionary treasury moves. On top of that, Pumpd is building AI systems that scan markets, whale wallets, and social sentiment for trading signals, with the goal of turning raw volatility into structured alerts and dashboards for the community. It’s still firmly a meme coin, but one that tries to justify attention with data‑driven tools rather than vibes alone. The project remains in an active presale phase, with guaranteed daily price steps and a growing set of launchpad and AI integrations. As an emerging meme play with a more advanced technical stack, Pumpd fits investors who want speculative upside plus a narrative around automation and on‑chain intelligence rather than pure branding. Get your $PUMPD for $0.000412. Recap: With big exchanges expanding altcoin listings into a recovering liquidity backdrop, the best crypto presales like Bitcoin Hyper , Maxi Doge , and Pumpd offer very different ways to position for the next cycle. Remember, this isn’t intended as financial advice, and you should always do your own research before investing.

Bitcoin posilnil o ďalších 7 % za posledných 24 hodín,https://bitcoinist.com/kryptomeny-idu-hore-bitcoin-posilnil-o-7-percent/,"Oslabujúci dolár, očakávané zníženie úrokových sadzieb americkým Fedom a rastúca aktivita na spotových ETF fondoch formujú nové podmienky pre decembrový trh. Bitcoin sa opäť obchoduje nad úrovňou 92 000 $ a aj altcoiny naznačujú zmenu trhovej dynamiky. Je december vhodným časom na nákup? Preskúmať top predpredaj 2025 Cena Bitcoinu stúpla o viac ako 6 % za posledný týždeň Bitcoin sa dnes obchoduje za 92 981 $ . V priebehu posledných 7 dní posilnil o 6,15 % a zotavil časť novembrových strát, ktoré patrili k najvýraznejším od roku 2021. Nárast objemov v spotových ETF , najmä po tom, čo Vanguard zrušil obmedzenie obchodovania s Bitcoin ETF , podporil nový prílev kapitálu do trhu. Len samotný fond IBIT spoločnosti BlackRock dosiahol miliardové objemy už v prvých minútach obchodovania po otvorení amerického trhu. Zdroj: coinmarketcap.com Prelomenie hranice 93 000 dolárov by podľa analytikov Glassnode mohlo vyvolať krátkodobý short squeeze, ktorý by cenu vystrelil smerom k 95-100 tisíc $ . Zároveň platí, že pokiaľ Bitcoin zostane nad úrovňou 80 tisíc $, trh si udrží býčí výhľad. Makro faktorom dominuje očakávanie, že Fed už budúci týždeň pristúpi k zníženiu sadzieb , ktoré tradične podporuje rizikové aktíva vrátane kryptomien. Euro posilňuje v očakávaní rozhodnutia americkej centrálnej banky. Dolár oslabil tento rok o takmer 7 % Euro v úvode decembra posilňuje a prelomilo svoj 50-dňový kĺzavý priemer po tom, čo inflácia v eurozóne mierne prekonala očakávania. Spoločná mena sa aktuálne obchoduje pri úrovni 1,1640 dolára a smeruje k najlepšiemu ročnému výkonu od roku 2017 . Trh tak reaguje na kombináciu priaznivých európskych makrodát a slabnúceho amerického dolára , ktorý v tomto roku stratil takmer 7 % hodnoty na indexe DXY. Investori sa zároveň pripravujú na zasadnutie Federálneho rezervného systému , ktorý sa uskutoční už budúci týždeň. Podľa údajov platformy Polymarket vyskočila pravdepodobnosť, že Fed pristúpi k ďalšiemu zníženiu sadzieb až 93 % . Práve toto očakávanie patrí medzi hlavné dôvody oslabenia dolára . Americká mena sa totiž stáva menej atraktívnou v prostredí, kde sa úrokový diferenciál medzi USA a ostatnými ekonomikami rýchlo zužuje. Odborníci upozorňujú, že aj malé náznaky holubičej rétoriky Fedu by mohli spôsobiť ďalší pokles dolára v druhej polovici decembra. Zdroj: tradingview.com Naopak, Európska centrálna banka neplánuje bezprostredné znižovanie sadzieb a trhy započítavajú iba približne 25 % pravdepodobnosť uvoľnenia menovej politiky v roku 2026. Tento kontrast medzi Fedom a ECB hrá v prospech eura, ktoré zostáva podporované stabilnou politikou ECB a slabnúcou americkou menou. Makro pohyby na devízových trhoch tak vytvárajú prostredie priaznivé pre rizikové aktíva vrátane kryptomien . Slabší dolár totiž historicky podporuje dopyt po Bitcoine , altcoinoch a ďalších volatilnejších aktívach. Altcoiny naznačujú budúci rast. Ethereum si polepšilo o 9 % Popri Bitcoine sa nálada zlepšuje aj v segmente altcoinov . Celková trhová kapitalizácia kryptomien stúpla na 3,14 bilióna dolárov , čo predstavuje 6,84 % denný nárast . A práve altcoiny ťahajú značnú časť tohto impulzu. Ethereum (ETH) vzrástlo za posledných 24 hodín o 8,80 % a jeho cena sa drží nad 3 052 dolármi . Rast podporuje návrat likvidity na trh a klesajúca dominancia Bitcoinu , ktorá vytvára priestor pre širšiu altcoinovú rally. Zdroj: coinmarketcap.com XRP taktiež potvrdzuje posilnenie sentimentu. S 8,27 % denným nárastom patrí medzi najvýkonnejšie veľké altcoiny, pričom jeho trhová kapitalizácia presiahla už 131,6 miliardy dolárov . Súčasne rastie aj dopyt po XRP ETF fondoch, ktoré pritiahli tento týždeň už viac ako 157 miliónov dolárov . Súčasne, natívna kryptomena populárneho blockchainu pre meme coiny Solana (SOL) , si pripísala za posledný deň 12 % . Celkovo si tak polepšila o takmer 4 % za týždeň. Záujem investorov podporuje vysoká aktivita v DeFi a rastúce množstvo nových aplikácií v jej ekosystéme. Zdroj: sosovalue.com Stablecoin Tether (USDT) zostáva najväčším zdrojom likvidity na trhu, čo je viditeľné z vysokého 24-hodinového objemu 128,2 miliardy dolárov Ide o jasný signál, že obchodníci aktívne rotujú kapitál medzi hlavnými altcoinmi. Súčasné trhové ukazovatele vytvárajú konzistentný obraz prostredia, v ktorom sa altcoiny presadzujú čoraz výraznejšie. Rastový impulz v segmente altcoinov zároveň vytvára priaznivé podmienky pre nové kryptomeny, ktoré práve v tomto období vstupujú na trh. Investori po mesiacoch opatrnosti opäť rozširujú expozíciu voči projektom s vyšším potenciálom, čo zvyšuje záujem o kvalitné predpredaje . V tejto skupine aktuálne dominuje projekt Bitcoin Hyper , ktorý počas prebiehajúceho predpredaja už získal viac než 28 miliónov dolárov . Layer 2 architektúra Bitcoin Hyper prináša pre BTC novú úroveň využitia Základom projektu Bitcoin Hyper (HYPER) je snaha prepojiť vysokú bezpečnosť Bitcoinovej siete s výkonnosťou moderných blockchainových architektúr. HyperChain používa Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) ako výpočtovú vrstvu, no finálne osadenie transakcií sa rieši na Bitcoinovom Layer 1. V praxi to znamená, že DeFi aplikácie môžu využívať nízke poplatky a vysoké TPS , kým Bitcoin zostáva konečnou autoritou pre zúčtovanie. Súčasťou riešenia je aj mechanizmus canonical bridge , v ktorom sa BTC uzamkne na základnej vrstve a jeho zabalená verzia sa následne používa v prostredí Bitcoin Hyper . Tým sa otvára priestor pre reálne ekonomické aktivity, ktoré Bitcoin doteraz nepodporoval. Zdroj: bitcoinhyper.com Natívny token HYPER zohráva v ekosystéme ústrednú úlohu. Držitelia ho využijú ako: platidlo na úhradu transakčných poplatkov zdroj pasívnych príjmov za staking (aktuálne ponúka 40 % APY ) hlasovacie právo pri rozhodovaní o budúcom vývoji ekosystému v rámci DAO investičný nástroj na zhodnotenie kapitálu v trhovom prostredí Aktuálna cena kryptomeny HYPER v predpredaji je 0,013365 $ , pričom do uzavretia predpredaja zostáva už len niekoľko dní. Silný záujem retailových investorov dopĺňajú aj výrazné kapitálové vstupy zo strany veľrýb, čo zvyšuje dôveru v dlhodobejšiu víziu projektu. Pre mnohých investorov predstavuje Bitcoin Hyper riešenie, ktoré môže Bitcoinu priniesť funkcionalitu, aká mu doteraz chýbala. Nová Layer-2 vrstva umožňuje obchodníkom aj vývojárom využívať BTC v moderných decentralizovaných aplikáciách , pokročilých DeFi riešeniach , ekosystémoch založených na meme tokenoch či v rámci smart kontraktov . Tvorcovia projektu zároveň stavili na výraznú vizuálnu identitu , ktorá pracuje s hravým a virálnym potenciálom značky. Novú sieť reprezentuje postava Hyper, využívaná v meme formáte s estetikou superhrdinu, ktorá sprevádza jednotlivé fázy vývoja projektu. Markets move fast.

The figure represents a 0.6% WoW increase and a significant 63% growth YoY. As Ethereum maintains its leading position in the stablecoin market, several Layer 2 networks are also experiencing notable growth. Stablecoin liquidity battles intensify among Layer 2 networks Data from the on-chain data explorer Growthepie shows that Arbitrum One follows Ethereum with a stablecoin supply of $7.84 billion. The L2 network’s stablecoin supply has witnessed a 1.2% decline WoW but has grown by 45% YoY. Base Chain claims the third position with a stablecoin supply of $4.53 billion, a 1% increase WoW, and a 31% growth rate YoY. Mantle claims the fourth spot with $668.42 million, with a steady growth rate of 147% YoY and a slight 2.1% drop WoW. However, not all L2 networks have witnessed growth YoY. OP Mainnet ranks fifth with a stablecoin supply of $548.79 million. The network’s stablecoin supply has declined by 7.6% WoW, bringing its YoY decline to 55.2%. Celo’s supply has also dipped by 27.9% YOY to $184.22 million as per the blockchain explorer. Ethereum also leads other networks in stablecoin supply . According to data from Token Terminal, a blockchain metrics provider, Ethereum has a stablecoin supply of $184.8 billion. Ecosystem stablecoin supply. Source: Token Terminal. Tron claims the second position with a stablecoin supply of $78.5 billion, while Solana trails in third place with a supply of $14.4 billion. The data also shows that the stablecoin supply reached an all-time high of $283.2 billion. Cryptopolitan reported that the sudden surge in stablecoin supply is attributed to new regulations from the Trump administration. President Trump signed the GENIUS Act earlier, providing regulatory clarity for stablecoins. CEO of MNEE Ron Tarter referred to the reform as a “green light” for corporate companies in the U.S. to infiltrate the industry. Data from crypto data aggregator CoinMarketCap shows that the market capitalization of Tether’s stablecoin USDT has reached an all-time high of $184.79 billion and has been on a steady increase since November 22. USDT is the world’s largest stablecoin by market cap. Stablecoin growth likely credited to new U.S. regulations. A publication issued by The White House in mid-July this year highlighted that the Act will ensure stablecoins play a crucial role in ensuring the continued global dominance of the U.S. dollar as the world’s reserve currency. The act requires stablecoin issuers to back their assets with Treasuries and U.S. dollars. The publication also explained that the act will increase crypto-related activities in the country by providing regulatory clarity for institutions. The move aligns with Trump’s long-term vision to make the U.S. the global crypto capital, a promise he made to Americans during his presidential campaign. Trump signed an executive order in his first week in office to promote the U.S.’s leadership in the crypto ecosystem. In Europe, new reforms for stablecoin development are also taking shape. Ten major banking giants have united to form a regulated, euro-pegged stablecoin. The alliance will operate under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework and plans to launch the stablecoin in the second half of 2026. The banks involved in Qivalis include ING, CaixaBank, DekaBank, BNP Paribas, Danske Bank, KBC, UniCredit, SEB, Banca Sella, and Raiffeisen Bank International. The bank-issued stablecoin will operate on decentralized blockchain networks, unlike conventional payment systems. The stablecoin will be available for individual and corporate cross-border settlements after licensing agreements and regulatory approvals are completed.

This Major Level Holds the Answer,https://cryptopotato.com/ethereum-eth-bulls-or-bears-this-major-level-holds-the-answer/,"Ethereum (ETH) is trading at around $3,065, with a 24-hour trading volume of $30 billion. The price has climbed 9% in the last day and 4% over the past week. ETH is now sitting near a key level that could decide its short-term direction, as traders keep a close eye on $2,800. $2,800 Support May Define the Next Trend Crypto analyst CryptosRus said , “$ETH is sitting right on $2,800, one of the biggest support zones on the chart.” they added, “Hold it → room back to $3,300 and even $3,900. Lose it → volatility at $2,500 HVN, then a real shot at $2,300.” ETH has rebounded after recent weakness, but it remains close to this key zone. Price charts show a bullish candle on the daily close, though a clear breakout is still needed. Traders are watching the higher low trendline for confirmation of a push toward $3,700. For now, short-term setups on smaller timeframes are driving activity. High Leverage Meets Lower Open Interest Data from Binance shows Ethereum’s leverage ratio at an all-time high of 0.57, according to CryptoOnchain. This means many traders are using borrowed funds. At the same time, open interest has dropped to $6.6 billion, which suggests “ a lot of froth already flushed out .” Notably, this creates a mixed setup. High leverage increases risk, while the drop in open interest shows that many weaker positions may have already been cleared. Traders are warning that the current build-up could lead to sudden price moves if the market reacts sharply near current levels. Short-Term Levels and Chart Patterns CRYPTOWZRD shared that the $3,055 level is now an important intraday resistance. They explained that ETH recovered well but may be forming a double-top. “A bearish pullback and then a bullish move again will offer a quality long setup, otherwise there may be a fake-out,” they said. The next lower support is around $2,880. If the asset holds there and finds buyers, traders may look for long entries. On higher timeframes, ETH is forming a bullish wedge and inverse head-and-shoulders, based on recent analysis reported by CryptoPotato . These patterns are being tracked by traders expecting a breakout above $4,500. Meanwhile, institutional buying is also active. BitMine, linked to Tom Lee, recently purchased over 30,000 ETH—worth close to $92 million. This shows growing interest from larger players, even as the market tests a critical zone.

55297491,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=861877,1764763177,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/21/55297491.jpeg,"XRP ETFs Attract $756M as Price Slides Toward $2, Meme Traders Rotate Into Maxi Doge",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/xrp-etfs-inflows-meme-rotation-maxi-doge-analysis/,"What to Know: XRP ETFs, attracting hundreds of millions, while the token drifts toward $2, signal a quiet transfer of supply from retail to institutions. Divergences between ETF inflows and spot price often push smaller traders toward higher‑beta meme plays in search of asymmetric upside. Meme tokens are evolving into trading-centric communities with games, leaderboards, and incentives, rather than just static dog logos and passive holders. Maxi Doge targets leverage‑obsessed retail with a 240‑lb gym‑bro mascot, 1000x energy culture, and competitive, community‑driven trading tournaments. Sometimes crypto sends mixed signals, and this is one of those moments. XRP spot ETFs have quietly absorbed about $756M in cumulative inflows even as the token drifts toward the $2 range. On the surface, it seems contradictory: prices are sliding, while regulated products steadily absorb the supply. But for allocators, the divergence is perfectly rational. ETFs let funds scale exposure without touching exchanges, pulling liquidity from long-suffering retail holders eager to derisk after a punishing multi-year grind. What retail reads as ‘weakness’ is often just order flow transferring from impatient sellers to institutional balance sheets. And we’ve seen this dynamic before. When institutions buy dips through compliant wrappers, degen capital almost never follows them into KYC funnels. Instead, it rotates into pure upside, hunting spots where a few thousand dollars can still shift the entire market cap. That’s where meme-beta comes back into play. As capital migrates out of direct XRP and into ETFs, traders are scanning for narrative-charged microcaps with real volatility potential. Meme contenders like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) are increasingly popping up on watchlists, not because they’re ‘safe,’ but because they offer what ETFs never will: the chance at 10x, not 10%. How ETF Accumulation Rewires Retail Risk Appetite The XRP structure is a textbook case of institutional-retail divergence. ETF inflows signal long-horizon conviction, yet the spot chart grinds lower, pushing smaller holders toward capitulation. For many retail wallets, that exit liquidity becomes fresh ammo for the next speculation cycle. Historically, that rotation never returns to sleepy large caps. It flows into the highest-beta corners of the market, meme tokens, trading tribes, and micro-caps, where a five-figure punt can actually move the needle. Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and Pepe all surged on earlier waves of capital fleeing blue-chip boredom for volatility. But meme markets aren’t the wild west they used to be. Competition is fierce. New entrants lean into trading culture, on-chain games, real utility, and social leaderboards, not just another dog mascot. Turbo, Floki, and similar projects now fight for attention by building communities around distinct identities: degenerates, gamers, options addicts, stat-nerds. Inside that landscape, Maxi Doge is carving out its lane as the meme avatar for hyper-aggressive traders, a gym-bro, 240-lb canine built around 1000x-leverage energy and ruthless PnL flexing. For traders rotating out of slow-bleeding majors, it slots neatly onto the high-risk, high-reward menu, right alongside other meme ecosystems competing for the next cycle’s volatility flow. Why Maxi Doge Targets the Leverage-Obsessed Retail Gap Under the memes, Maxi Doge is tapping into a very specific retail pain point: most traders don’t have whale-level capital or discipline, but they still want whale-sized returns. Instead of pretending that the average user will suddenly become a methodical swing trader, $MAXI leans directly into the reality of leverage and builds its entire culture around it. The project presents itself as a 240-lb, gym-bro canine built on 1000x mentality, the same mindset traders chase when hunting for the next 1000x crypto , and then hardwires that persona into on-chain incentives. Holder-only trading competitions, seasonal ROI leaderboards, and public PnL flexing turn degen behavior into a structured game, where bragging rights, prizes, and social pressure reinforce the ‘never skip leg day, never skip a pump’ ethos. However, unlike memes that stop at a logo and Discord, Maxi Doge incorporates yield mechanics and treasury strategy. Stakers currently access a 72% APY via daily auto-distributions from a dedicated 5% staking pool for up to a year. Meanwhile, the Maxi Fund treasury focuses on liquidity, partnerships, and futures integrations, designed to fuel these competitions and keep the ecosystem active. Early metrics show that positioning is resonating. The presale has raised over $4.2M so far, with tokens priced at $0.000271. Smart money isn’t ignoring it either: two high-net-worth wallets accumulated $503K in recent weeks, including a single $251K buy . For traders looking to get involved early, the process is straightforward. Our full guide on how to buy $MAXI walks through wallet setup, network selection, and how to join the presale before allocations increase. Always DYOR, understand the risks, and never allocate more than you can afford to lose when speculating on $MAXI or any meme asset.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|ZRX|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-12-03 11:59:37

What once seemed like fringe crypto talk — tokenization of real-world assets — is now being championed by the biggest names on Wall Street . This shift could redraw the map of finance itself. When BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein recently likened today’s tokenization movement to the early internet era, a wave of excitement swept through the crypto community. One of the most vocal reactions came from Levi Rietveld of Crypto Crusaders. On X, Levi grabbed attention: “Are you guys seeing this shit right now?” He stressed that the remark should not be taken lightly and argued that tokenization could massively benefit crypto networks such as XRP. What BlackRock Actually Said In a December 2025 column for The Economist, BlackRock’s executives wrote that tokenization is entering an “early-internet” phase. They cited a 300% rise in real‑world asset (RWA) tokenization over the past 20 months as proof that adoption is accelerating. They argued that putting traditional assets — such as bonds, real estate, or ETFs — onto the blockchain could modernize market infrastructure. With digital ledgers, ownership becomes programmable, settlement near-instant, and access globally inclusive. WHAT THE F*CK! BlackRock Just Shocked $XRP Holders! Comment “knowledge” and I’ll DM you access to my community! Like & repost to spread awareness!! pic.twitter.com/CVydDctw0F — Levi | Crypto Crusaders (@LeviRietveld) December 2, 2025 Why It Resonates With XRP Investors To many in crypto communities — including Levi — BlackRock’s public support feels like macro-validation. Because tokenization itself does not mention specific cryptocurrencies, proponents read it as a green light for networks that support real-world asset use cases. Levi noted that tokenization could “elevate assets like XRP” thanks to its ledger features and existing infrastructure. That gives BlackRock’s statement extra weight in trading circles. In essence, the argument goes: if institutional giants view tokenization as the next big structural shift, networks that already support fast settlement, liquidity, and compliance will naturally be in demand. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Reality — Not All That Glitters Is Gold But optimism must be tempered. Tokenized assets still represent only a tiny fraction of global markets. Analysts warn that the transition to tokenization will likely be multi-phased and gradual. According to one legal expert cited by Decrypt, real gains come only when tokenization actually solves real problems — such as liquidity inefficiency, high fees, or regulatory bottlenecks. Moreover, tokenization requires more than hype. It needs clear regulatory frameworks, reliable custody solutions, and real-world asset issuance at scale. Until those are in place, any 100× predictions — such as those referenced by Levi — remain speculative. What This Means for XRP Holders Now BlackRock’s comments have undeniably boosted market sentiment. For XRP investors, this offers a renewed narrative: tokenization could bring long-term relevance beyond speculation. Yet the underlying fundamentals haven’t changed overnight. XRP’s technology remains the same. Its legal status remains subject to clear regulations. Its adoption will hinge less on hype and more on real infrastructure, issuance, and institutional buy-in. Levi’s rallying call — “lock the fuck in” — reflects trader urgency and trader psychology. It does not guarantee future returns. For serious investors, the smartest play is to watch developments closely: tokenization progress, real-world asset launches, regulatory clarity, and ecosystem growth. BlackRock may have just added fuel to the fire . Whether XRP — or any other crypto — becomes one of the main beneficiaries depends on execution, not excitement.

Here's Why,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/payment-giant-paypals-stablecoin-pyusd-has-become-the-shining-star-of-the-latest-period-heres-why/,"According to DeFiLlama data, PayPal's stablecoin PYUSD has seen remarkable growth in recent months, becoming one of the fastest-rising assets in the cryptocurrency ecosystem in terms of market capitalization. PYUSD, which had a market capitalization of approximately $1.2 billion in September, has more than tripled to over $3.8 billion by December. This is one of the fastest stablecoin expansions in just a few months. PYUSD's growth rate over the past month has exceeded 36%. This performance demonstrates both the asset's strengthening user adoption and its rapidly expanding role within PayPal's Web3 ecosystem. With this rise, PYUSD has become the sixth-largest stablecoin by total market capitalization. Analysts attribute PYUSD's rapid growth to several factors. PayPal's large user base and global payment infrastructure are driving the stablecoin's rapid market acceptance. Additionally, PYUSD's availability on numerous decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms is driving demand for the asset. Other factors bolstering PYUSD's position include increased institutional participation and the growing importance of diversification in the stablecoin market. The growth of PYUSD further demonstrates the intensification of competition in the stablecoin market and the increasing assertiveness of traditional financial giants in the digital asset space. This trend is expected to accelerate further in the coming period. *This is not investment advice.

This deposit, valued at approximately $135 million, was sent directly to Coinbase Prime. For investors and enthusiasts, this isn’t just a transaction; it’s a powerful signal of deepening institutional commitment to the BlackRock Ethereum ETF and the broader Ethereum ecosystem. Let’s unpack what this massive transfer truly means. What Does This BlackRock Ethereum ETF Deposit Actually Mean? According to data from on-chain analytics firm Lookonchain, this transaction is directly tied to BlackRock’s spot Ethereum ETF, known by the ticker ETHA. The recipient, Coinbase Prime, is a specialized platform designed for institutional players, offering services like high-volume trading and secure custody. Therefore, this move is far from a retail investor trade. It represents a strategic allocation by one of the world’s largest asset managers. This action provides tangible, on-chain proof of the fund’s operational activity following its regulatory approval. It demonstrates that the BlackRock Ethereum ETF is not just a paper product but is actively managing a substantial treasury of ETH. For the market, this visibility builds trust and validates the ETF’s scale. Why Is Coinbase Prime the Chosen Destination? Understanding why the ETH went to Coinbase Prime is key. This platform is built for the specific needs of large institutions like BlackRock. Here are the core reasons for this choice: Institutional-Grade Security: Coinbase Prime offers custody solutions that meet the rigorous compliance and insurance standards required by mega-funds. Liquidity Access: It provides deep liquidity pools, allowing for the execution of large trades without causing significant market slippage. Prime Brokerage Services: This includes lending, staking, and reporting tools tailored for complex institutional portfolios. This deposit suggests BlackRock is positioning the ETH for potential future activities, whether that’s facilitating creation/redemption baskets for the ETF, earning yield, or simply securing it in preparation for further investor inflows. What Are the Implications for Ethereum’s Market? A transaction of this magnitude naturally leads to questions about market impact. The immediate transfer of 44,000 ETH to an exchange could be interpreted as a precursor to selling. However, the context is crucial. Deposits to Coinbase Prime are often for operational and custodial purposes, not necessarily immediate liquidation. In the broader view, this move is overwhelmingly bullish for several reasons: Legitimization: It reinforces Ethereum’s status as a credible institutional asset class. Supply Dynamics: Large-scale locking of ETH in regulated vehicles reduces circulating supply, a positive fundamental for price. Network Effect: BlackRock’s involvement attracts other conservative capital, creating a virtuous cycle of adoption. The true impact of the BlackRock Ethereum ETF will be measured in sustained inflows over months and years, not a single deposit. Navigating the Future of Institutional Crypto Investment This event is a clear milestone in the maturation of cryptocurrency markets. It highlights the seamless movement of nine-figure sums between traditional finance giants and crypto-native infrastructure. For retail investors, it offers a critical lesson: monitor on-chain data for clues about institutional intent. The path forward involves watching for consistent patterns. Will we see more deposits as the ETF grows? How will other asset managers like Fidelity respond? The BlackRock Ethereum ETF has now set a visible, on-chain precedent that others will follow. In conclusion, BlackRock’s $135 million ETH deposit is a masterclass in institutional crypto strategy. It’s a move that combines security, operational readiness, and market signaling. While short-term price fluctuations are inevitable, the long-term narrative is clear: Ethereum is being woven into the fabric of global finance by its most powerful players. This deposit is not an end point, but a formidable beginning for a new era of digital asset ownership. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: Does this mean BlackRock is selling its Ethereum? A: Not necessarily. Depositing ETH to Coinbase Prime is often for secure custody and operational readiness. It allows BlackRock to manage the assets for the ETF, which could include creating shares or earning staking rewards, not just selling. Q2: What is the ticker for BlackRock’s Ethereum ETF? A: The ticker for BlackRock’s spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund is ETHA . Q3: How can the public see these transactions? A: Anyone can view them using blockchain explorers like Etherscan. Analytics firms like Lookonchain specialize in interpreting these public ledger transactions and linking them to known entities. Q4: Will this large deposit cause the price of ETH to drop? A: A single deposit to custody does not directly cause a price drop. Selling pressure occurs when assets are sold on the open market. This move is more about logistics and institutional workflow than immediate market selling. Q5: What is the difference between Coinbase and Coinbase Prime? A: Coinbase is the retail-facing exchange app. Coinbase Prime is a separate, institutional-grade platform offering advanced trading tools, dedicated custody, and services tailored for hedge funds, asset managers, and corporations. Q6: Are other companies launching Ethereum ETFs? A: Yes. Several major firms, including Fidelity, Grayscale, and Ark Invest, have also received approval for spot Ethereum ETFs, creating a new competitive landscape for institutional crypto investment.

However, regulators have not yet decided whether the token will peg to the New Taiwan dollar (NTD) or the US dollar (USD). According to local media in Taiwan, Financial Supervisory Commission Chair Peng Jin-long told lawmakers this week that the draft Virtual Assets Service Act has cleared initial cabinet reviews and could pass its third reading next session. To that end, regulations specific to stablecoins would follow within six months, putting the earliest possible launch in late 2026. Analysts call Taiwan a late stablecoin adopter that could struggle. The FSC and Taiwan’s central bank have agreed that financial institutions will lead issuance in the initial stage. However, the legislation does not restrict issuers to banks. What remains unclear is the currency backing. This is a choice that will shape the project’s impact on the region’s currency controls. A US dollar-backed coin would bypass the strict limits on exporting the Taiwan currency offshore. On the other hand, Taiwan’s currency cannot legally circulate offshore, and the central bank has a long record of policing attempts to use it for transactions without a direct connection to the island. James Lee, a senior advisor at the Taiwan External Trade Development Council (TAITRA), previously warned against both ideas. According to him, Taiwan should be cautious due to the lack of scalability and the low interest return of roughly 1% on reserves compared to 4% in the US. “Why would somebody use a less well-known stablecoin that is in USD, let alone a Taiwan dollar pegged stablecoin when they can use USDC and USDT for zero switching costs? It is very difficult for latecomers to compete with these aside from very niche players,” he added. For now, regulators are drafting rules based on full reserve backing, strict segregation of assets, and domestic custody requirements. Recently, as reported by Cryptopolitan , Taiwan’s central bank has called for a licensing role in the FSC’s draft Virtual Asset Services Act (VASA) to determine risks to foreign exchange and payment system rules. The draft act is Taiwan’s first dedicated effort to supervise digital assets businesses. The legislation will cover Taiwan dollar (TWD) and USD pegged stablecoin issuance. It is currently under review by the Executive Yuan – Taiwan’s highest administrative body. Meanwhile, several local banks are preparing for a regulated stablecoin era. O-Bank has expressed interest in launching a Taiwan dollar-pegged coin. Meanwhile, KGI Bank signed a memorandum with Tether in October to build token-enabled cross-border finance applications. Cathay United Bank is also exploring stablecoin issuance, pending regulatory clarity. US runs away with 99% stablecoin dominance Current data indicates that approximately 99% of stablecoins currently on the market are USD-pegged. This reveals the absolute dominance of the US dollar in the digital asset sector. This is a result of joining early and the passage of the US GENIUS Act. In response, nations have begun positioning themselves to issue stablecoins pegged to their own fiat currencies, especially in the coming year. In Europe, banks have come together in a collaborative effort called Qivalis to develop an EU-based token designed for on-chain payments. The group intends to introduce the stablecoin in the second half of 2026, positioning the project under the EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory regime, Cryptopolitan reported . Israel has also set the launch date of the digital shekel somewhere in 2026. To that end, it is preparing to tighten its regulations. Additionally, Japanese Sony Bank is set to launch a dollar‑backed stablecoin in America as early as fiscal 2026. The stablecoin will be used to pay for games, anime, and digital subscriptions across Sony’s ecosystem. At the same time, South Korea is reportedly working on a plan to restrict the issuance of Korean-won-pegged stablecoins to consortia in which commercial banks hold a majority stake. Meanwhile, the total global issuance of stablecoins is projected to reach between $1.9 trillion and $4 trillion by 2030. The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter. Want in?

In a stark warning to traders and investors, the bank predicts the Australian dollar could plummet to 0.63 against the US dollar by the first quarter of 2026. This significant currency depreciation is directly tied to mounting China economic weakness , a critical factor that threatens to unravel one of forex’s most watched pairs. For those monitoring global economic health, this prediction serves as a crucial barometer of coming turbulence. Why is Bank of America’s AUD/USD Forecast So Bearish? The core of the Bank of America analysis rests on a deteriorating outlook for Australia’s largest trading partner. China’s post-pandemic recovery has stalled, plagued by a property sector crisis, weak consumer demand, and deflationary pressures. As China’s economic engine sputters, demand for Australian exports—particularly iron ore, coal, and liquefied natural gas—is expected to weaken substantially. This fundamental shift in trade dynamics forms the basis for the bank’s extended bearish AUD/USD forecast . China Economic Weakness: The Domino Effect on the Australian Dollar Understanding the forex market trends requires connecting global dots. Australia’s economy is exceptionally leveraged to China’s fortunes. Consider the following data points that illustrate this dependency: Australian Export to China Percentage of Total Exports Vulnerability to Slowdown Iron Ore ~30% High Coal ~20% High LNG ~10% Medium-High Education & Tourism Significant Services Medium A sustained China economic weakness would hit Australia’s trade surplus, a key pillar supporting the AUD. Reduced export income translates to fewer Australian dollars being purchased on global markets, applying direct downward pressure on the currency pair. This is not a short-term blip but a structural recalibration of the forex market relationship. Decoding the Bank of America Analysis: Key Drivers Beyond Trade The Bank of America analysis incorporates several interlocking factors beyond pure commodity trade. The bank’s researchers model a scenario where: Diverging Central Bank Policies: The US Federal Reserve is likely to maintain higher interest rates for longer to combat inflation, while the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) may be forced to cut rates sooner if the economy falters. This interest rate differential favors the USD. Global Risk Sentiment: The Australian dollar is a classic “risk-on” currency. Persistent worries about China could trigger global risk aversion, prompting investors to flee the AUD for the safe-haven US dollar. Capital Outflows: Weak growth prospects could lead to reduced foreign direct investment in Australia and capital flight, further exacerbating the currency depreciation . Forex Market Trends: How Should Traders Position Themselves? For active participants in the forex market , this extended AUD/USD forecast presents both a warning and an opportunity. The path to 0.63 is unlikely to be a straight line, but the overarching trend is clear. Traders might consider: Monitoring Chinese economic data releases (PMI, retail sales, industrial production) as leading indicators for AUD pressure. Watching for any major Chinese stimulus announcements that could temporarily reverse sentiment. Assessing correlated pairs and assets, as weakness in AUD/USD often coincides with pressure on other commodity-linked currencies and assets. Actionable Insights from the Currency Depreciation Forecast Beyond pure forex trading, this predicted currency depreciation has real-world implications. Australian importers will face higher costs, potentially fueling domestic inflation. Australian tourists and students heading overseas will find their money doesn’t go as far. Conversely, exporters outside the China nexus might gain a competitive edge. For global investors, it underscores the importance of geographic and currency diversification in portfolios. Ignoring the profound link between China economic weakness and the Australian dollar is a risk few can afford to take. FAQs: Understanding the AUD/USD and China Forecast What is the current AUD/USD exchange rate, and how does 0.63 compare? The rate fluctuates daily. A fall to 0.63 from current levels (check live data) represents a depreciation of several percentage points, a major move in forex terms. Has Bank of America been accurate with forex forecasts in the past? Like all major banks, Bank of America has a mixed record. Their analysis is respected due to their vast research resources, but forex predictions are inherently uncertain. Are other financial institutions making similar predictions? Sentiment is broadly bearish on the AUD due to China, but the 0.63 target for Q1 2026 is among the more pessimistic forecasts. It’s crucial to compare analyses from multiple sources like Goldman Sachs and Citi . What could cause Bank of America’s forecast to be wrong? A dramatic and sustained recovery in the Chinese economy, a sudden collapse in the US dollar, or an unexpected surge in demand for non-China Australian exports could alter the trajectory. Who are the key analysts at Bank of America covering this forecast? The bank’s global forex strategy team, often led by its head of G10 FX strategy, would be responsible for this outlook. Their reports are widely circulated in financial media. Conclusion: A Storm Warning for the Forex Market The Bank of America analysis delivering a 0.63 AUD/USD forecast for early 2026 is more than just a number—it’s a stark assessment of intertwined destinies. It highlights how China economic weakness can trigger powerful forex market trends and severe currency depreciation thousands of miles away. While forecasts are not fate, they provide an essential framework for understanding the risks brewing in the global economy. For anyone with exposure to the Australian dollar or investments linked to the Asia-Pacific region, the message is clear: vigilance is paramount.

On-chain data reveals a wallet linked to the Tron founder moved a staggering $33 million in TRX and USDT from Binance. This massive transaction raises immediate questions about market strategy and potential price impact. What Does This Justin Sun Address Withdrawal Mean? According to on-chain analyst Lookonchain, the transaction occurred just 30 minutes before reports surfaced. The address withdrew 100 million TRX, valued at approximately $27.96 million, alongside 5 million USDT. Such substantial movements from figures like Justin Sun often signal strategic portfolio adjustments rather than routine trading. Large withdrawals from exchanges typically reduce immediate selling pressure on the asset. When whales move coins to private wallets, they usually plan to hold them, which can be interpreted as a bullish long-term signal. However, the market often reacts with volatility as traders speculate on the motive behind the Justin Sun address withdrawal . Why Do Whale Movements Matter So Much? Whale transactions provide crucial insights into market sentiment, especially when involving prominent figures. Here’s why this Justin Sun address withdrawal matters: Market Influence : Justin Sun’s actions directly impact Tron’s price and investor confidence. Liquidity Signals : Moving assets off an exchange suggests accumulation, not imminent selling. Strategic Timing : The timing of such large moves often precedes major announcements or market shifts. Network Health : Large transactions demonstrate active use and confidence in the Tron network. Therefore, monitoring these movements helps traders understand potential price directions. The recent Justin Sun address withdrawal follows a pattern of strategic accumulation observed throughout 2024. How Might This Affect TRX Price Action? Initial market reaction to the Justin Sun address withdrawal showed mild positive momentum for TRX. Removing $28 million worth of TRX from exchange supply reduces available sell-side liquidity. This scarcity effect can support price stability or gradual appreciation if demand remains constant. However, cryptocurrency markets remain unpredictable. While the Justin Sun address withdrawal suggests confidence, external factors like Bitcoin’s performance and broader market sentiment still dominate. Traders should watch for follow-up transactions from related addresses to confirm the accumulation thesis. What Are the Broader Implications for Crypto? This event highlights several key trends in today’s cryptocurrency landscape. First, on-chain analytics have become essential tools for investors. Platforms like Lookonchain provide real-time transparency that was unimaginable a few years ago. Second, the actions of founders and core team members carry significant weight. A Justin Sun address withdrawal generates more analysis and speculation than similar moves by anonymous whales. This underscores the human element in decentralized markets. Finally, such movements reinforce the importance of self-custody. Large holders increasingly move assets from centralized exchanges to personal wallets, reflecting growing maturity in security practices across the industry. Conclusion: Decoding the Whale’s Message The $33 million Justin Sun address withdrawal from Binance represents more than just a transaction. It’s a statement of confidence in Tron’s underlying technology and future prospects. While short-term price movements may fluctuate, the long-term implication suggests strategic positioning rather than panic. For investors, this event serves as a reminder to monitor on-chain data alongside traditional market analysis. The transparency of blockchain technology turns every major move into a public signal, waiting to be interpreted by those who know where to look. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How do we know it was Justin Sun’s address? On-chain analysts use pattern recognition, comparing transaction histories and wallet behaviors to known addresses associated with Justin Sun. While not 100% certain, the patterns strongly suggest his involvement. Is withdrawing crypto from an exchange always bullish? Generally yes, as it reduces immediate selling pressure. However, context matters. The destination wallet and subsequent actions provide clearer signals than the withdrawal alone. What happens to TRX price after such large withdrawals? Historically, large exchange withdrawals precede periods of price consolidation or gradual appreciation, as supply becomes scarcer on trading platforms. Should I buy TRX because of this withdrawal? Never make investment decisions based on single events. Consider this as one data point within your broader research on Tron’s fundamentals and market conditions. How can I track similar whale movements? Several blockchain explorers and analytics platforms like Lookonchain, Etherscan, and Tronscan provide real-time data on large transactions. What’s the difference between USDT and TRX in this context? USDT is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, often used as trading capital. TRX is Tron’s native cryptocurrency. Withdrawing both suggests complex portfolio management rather than a simple asset shift. Found this analysis of the Justin Sun address withdrawal helpful?

The BOSAGORA Foundation has reported a devastating BOSAGORA security breach , resulting in the catastrophic loss of nearly one billion BOA tokens. This event sends a stark reminder of the persistent vulnerabilities in the digital asset space and raises urgent questions about the safety of cross-chain bridges. What Happened in the BOSAGORA Security Breach? The foundation broke the news through a Medium post, revealing an unauthorized transfer from a bridge contract. In simple terms, a bridge is a tool that lets tokens move between different blockchains. The hacker exploited a weakness in this critical piece of infrastructure. Here are the staggering numbers from the incident report: 990 Million BOA Tokens Stolen: The total amount siphoned from the bridge contract. 460 Million BOA Moved to OrangeX: The attacker quickly deposited a large portion into the OrangeX exchange using multiple wallets. Immediate Price Impact: Following the news, the BOA price plummeted over 13%. How is BOSAGORA Responding to the Crisis? Faced with this crisis, the BOSAGORA team has initiated a multi-pronged response. Their immediate priority is damage control and investigating the BOSAGORA security breach pathway. First, they have requested that all exchanges suspend deposits and withdrawals for BOA tokens. This action aims to freeze the movement of stolen funds and prevent the hacker from cashing out. Secondly, they have formally involved law enforcement, launching a police investigation to track the perpetrator. The foundation has promised a thorough review of all possible recovery measures. However, recovering stolen cryptocurrency is notoriously difficult, often relying on cooperation from exchanges to freeze the assets. What Does This Mean for BOA Investors? For holders of BOA tokens, this event is a nightmare scenario. The direct financial impact is clear from the sharp price drop. Beyond the immediate loss, this BOSAGORA security breach severely damages trust in the project’s underlying technology and security protocols. This incident didn’t occur in a vacuum. Previously, the major South Korean exchange Bithumb had already flagged BOA, suspending its deposits and withdrawals and labeling it an “investment warning” item. The hack validates those earlier concerns and places immense pressure on the BOSAGORA team to be transparent and effective in their resolution efforts. The road to recovery will be steep. Rebuilding investor confidence after a security failure of this magnitude requires more than just promises; it demands demonstrable improvements in security infrastructure and, if possible, restitution for affected users. Could This BOSAGORA Security Breach Have Been Prevented? While the specific vulnerability is under investigation, this event highlights a critical weak spot in the crypto ecosystem: cross-chain bridges. These complex smart contracts hold vast sums of assets, making them prime targets for hackers. The BOSAGORA incident joins a growing list of bridge exploits, underscoring an industry-wide challenge. For all crypto projects, this serves as a crucial lesson. It emphasizes the non-negotiable need for: Rigorous Smart Contract Audits: Continuous, professional code reviews by multiple independent firms. Bug Bounty Programs: Incentivizing ethical hackers to find vulnerabilities before malicious actors do. Decentralized Custody Solutions: Moving away from single points of failure in fund management. Conclusion: A Sobering Reminder for Crypto Security The devastating BOSAGORA security breach is more than just a bad news day for one project. It is a sobering lesson for the entire cryptocurrency industry on the paramount importance of security. While innovation and speed to market are valuable, they must never come at the expense of robust, battle-tested security measures. For BOSAGORA, the path forward hinges on transparent communication, a thorough forensic investigation, and a renewed, unwavering commitment to protecting user assets. The community will be watching closely to see if the foundation can navigate this crisis and emerge stronger. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What exactly was stolen in the BOSAGORA hack? A1: The hacker stole approximately 990 million BOA tokens by exploiting a vulnerability in a bridge contract, which is a tool for moving tokens between blockchains. Q2: Has the BOA price been affected? A2: Yes, significantly. Following the breach announcement, the price of BOA fell by over 13%, reflecting a direct loss of investor confidence. Q3: What is BOSAGORA doing about the stolen tokens? A3: The foundation has suspended exchange activity, started a police investigation, and is reviewing all possible recovery options, though crypto recovery is often very difficult. Q4: Should I sell my BOA tokens now? A4: This is a personal financial decision. The hack introduces high uncertainty and risk. It’s crucial to conduct your own research and assess your risk tolerance based on the project’s response and future plans. Q5: Are other cryptocurrencies safe from similar attacks? A5: While security is improving, any project, especially those using complex cross-chain bridges, carries inherent risk. This event highlights why investors must prioritize projects with proven, audited security practices. Q6: Can the hacker be caught? A6> Blockchain transactions are transparent but pseudonymous. While law enforcement can trace wallet movements, identifying the individual behind them is challenging and relies on exchanges complying with requests to freeze funds.

Large Transactions Crash To 2-Month Lows,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-whales-leaving/,"Dogecoin’s recent price action has taken an unexpected turn as on-chain data shows whale transactions collapsing to levels not seen in two months. This lack of activity from whale addresses has seen the meme coin falling to an important support area, and it raises the question about whether big players are stepping back from the meme coin. Dogecoin Whale Activity Falls To Its Lowest Level In 60 Days Data from on-chain analytics platform Santiment reveals that large transactions on the Dogecoin blockchain recently fell to as low as just 4 in a single day, marking a two-month low in whale participation. Santiment classifies whale transaction count as transactions with a value of $1 million or greater. This drop is notable, as it is a drastic change from the high levels of participation of whale traders in October and early November, which reached as high as 212 whale transactions on October 11. Related Reading: Here’s What To Expect If The XRP Price Holds $2 This drop is an extension of a steady Dogecoin cooldown that has persisted through the past few weeks. Large-holder activity can serve as a proxy for institutional or high-volume investors. Therefore, the current decline suggests that big players are either waiting for better entry conditions or scaling back exposure. At the time of writing, Santiment data shows that there were 11 Dogecoin whale transactions in the past 24 hours. Although this is a rebound from the alarming four-transaction low, the current level is far below what is considered a healthy range for a cryptocurrency that relies heavily on sentiment bursts of activity. The reduction in transfers is especially notable at a time when Dogecoin’s price action in the past 24 hours is attempting to maintain an important level above $0.15. Dogecoin Whale Transaction Count. Source: Santiment DOGE Holds Support, But Technical Momentum Weakens Price action in the past few weeks has been mostly bearish price action, and technical analysis shows that the meme coin is now in its longest accumulation phase since its inception. Related Reading: Ripple Marks Another Milestone In Bid To Dominate Global Payments With XRP Dogecoin Price Accumulation. Source: @galaxyBTC On X Notably, Dogecoin is going through a spark of strength over the past 24 hours as it bounced from $0.134 and climbed about 11%, but the recovery appears to be generated by retail traders rather than a meaningful return of whale activity. That estimation aligns with the weak inflows into Spot Dogecoin ETFs and the overall quietness from major holders. It is difficult for the price to build a strong upward trend without whales participating on the buy side. It’s not just the presence of whales that matters, but the nature of their activity. Earlier in the year, on October 11, whale transactions surged to 212, but most of those were sell orders. The result was immediate and painful, as the Dogecoin price dropped from $0.25 to $0.18 in a single day.

Bitcoin Hyper Presale Eyes Layer 2 Breakout,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-hyper-presale-next-1000x-bitcoin-layer-2/,"What to Know: Even as Bitcoin holds around $93K, Bitcoin’s base layer remains secure but slow, with high fees and no native smart contract environment, limiting real on-chain activity for everyday users. As demand for scalable on-chain applications grows, the lack of a high-speed execution layer around Bitcoin creates a structural gap for DeFi, gaming, and payments. Bitcoin Hyper introduces the first Bitcoin Layer 2 with SVM integration, targeting faster-than-Solana performance while leveraging Bitcoin as the settlement backbone. By delivering extremely low-latency execution, fast smart contracts, and Rust-based tooling, Bitcoin Hyper aims to make wrapped $BTC usable across DeFi, NFTs, and gaming. If you’re convinced Bitcoin is marching toward six figures, the bigger question is where the next asymmetric upside comes from. Right now, the world’s leading crypto is holding near $93K. History suggests the highest multiples don’t usually come from the base asset itself, but from the infrastructure built on top of it; think ERC-20 DeFi blue chips riding Ethereum’s 2020 breakout. Bitcoin’s problem is that it never had its own native DeFi and application stack to the same extent. Slow confirmation times, high fees during peak cycles, and the absence of native smart contracts have kept most real on-chain activity on other networks, even as Bitcoin dominates as a store of value and brand. That’s the gap Bitcoin Hyper ($HYPER) is going after: a high-speed Bitcoin Layer 2 that brings Solana-style throughput directly to $BTC’s settlement layer. Instead of asking you to rotate out of Bitcoin into a ‘fast L1,’ Bitcoin Hyper is betting the next 1000x upside comes from plugging DeFi, gaming, and payments into Bitcoin’s existing liquidity. With a presale already into eight figures and early whales circling, Bitcoin Hyper is positioning itself as a bet not against Bitcoin, but on Bitcoin finally getting the performance layer it has been missing. For $BTC holders who want more than passive ‘number go up,’ that’s a compelling narrative to examine seriously. Bitcoin Hyper Turns BTC Into a High-Speed Application Layer Bitcoin Hyper is built for one simple outcome: letting you use Bitcoin like a modern, high-throughput network without abandoning Bitcoin’s security and brand. It introduces a dedicated Layer 2 that runs smart contracts using the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) tooling, tuned to deliver faster performance than Solana itself for real-world transactions. For users, this translates into sub-second confirmation experiences and low fees on wrapped $BTC transfers, swaps, and dApps, rather than waiting on congested Bitcoin blocks. DeFi traders can move into pools, lending markets, and staking strategies at speed, while still ultimately settling back to Bitcoin as the base layer they trust via a Canonical Bridge . If you’re considering getting exposure, here’s a guide on how to buy Bitcoin Hyper. Developers get a Rust-based SDK and API to ship NFT platforms, gaming dApps, and high-frequency applications without fighting Bitcoin’s base-layer limitations. Bitcoin Hyper explicitly targets Solana-level speed while anchoring to Bitcoin, aiming to keep latency low enough for gaming and real-time apps. The presale has already pulled in $28.8M, a clear signal of early conviction behind the project’s thesis You can explore the Bitcoin Hyper presale now. Can $HYPER Be a 1000x for Bitcoin Maxis? If Bitcoin Hyper captures even a small portion of the broader Bitcoin DeFi and Layer 2 narrative market, our prediction suggests that $HYPER could reach $0.08625, delivering roughly 545% returns from the current presale price of $0.013365. That kind of upside depends on real usage, but the thesis is clear: bring Solana-like performance to where the Bitcoin liquidity already sits. You can read a Bitcoin Hyper price prediction breakdown for more scenario modeling. Momentum is already building around that idea. Whale buys include $500K , $379K , and $274K , all feeding into the $HYPER momentum. If Bitcoin does grind toward six figures over the next cycle, the infrastructure that lets $BTC behave like a modern programmable asset stands to benefit most. What is Bitcoin Hyper? The execution layer for crypto’s flagship: fast, cheap, and plugged directly into the world’s best-known crypto brand. The core opportunity here is simple: Bitcoin retains its role as pristine collateral and base money, while Bitcoin Hyper turns that collateral into something you can actually deploy across DeFi, gaming, and payments at high speed. If the market agrees that the next 1000x comes from building on Bitcoin rather than competing with it, $HYPER sits directly in that slipstream. Join the $HYPER presale now.

At this point, the most talked-about name was Strategy, the biggest institutional bull. Accordingly, as the BTC price approached Strategy's cost base of $74,000, allegations of Strategy selling BTC increased. While Michael Saylor firmly denied allegations that Strategy sold BTC, he stated that the company could withstand even larger declines. The final comment on this point came from Tiger Research. Asia-based Web3 research firm Tiger Research said the Strategy could withstand a BTC drop to $23,000. According to the report, the Strategy can hold out until Bitcoin's price falls to an equilibrium point of $23,000. For BTC to reach this level, it would mean dropping more than 70% from its current price. Tiger Research noted that Strategy maintains a relatively stable foundation through a diversified financing structure, including preferred stock and convertible bonds, in response to the news. While the $23,000 floor provides short-term comfort, Tiger Research has highlighted a critical danger in the long term. Analysts underlined that the real test is in 2028, noting that this is when call options on a large volume of Strategy’s convertible bonds will be concentrated. Accordingly, if market sentiment deteriorates and the Bitcoin price approaches the Strategy's bankruptcy threshold, investors can exercise these options to request early repayment. In this worst-case scenario, Strategy would need to immediately raise up to $6.4 billion in cash, which could force the company to liquidate a BTC volume equivalent to 20-30% of its global daily spot transactions, potentially shocking the market. “Therefore, 2028 will not be an ordinary date. It will be a potential turning point that could determine the fate of the Strategy and significantly increase volatility for every Bitcoin investor,” the analysts wrote in the report. *This is not investment advice.

He argued that the real activity occurs where most traders do not look. #XRP PRICE DETONATION IS NOW!!! pic.twitter.com/gS19WKezgi — Ripple Bull Winkle | Crypto Researcher (@RipBullWinkle) December 1, 2025 Why Supply Trends Matter Ripple Bull Winkle stressed that the steady drain of XRP from exchanges reflects strong long-term interest . He said that many traders mistake the current range for a stagnant market. He called this view incorrect because the supply shift shows clear accumulation. He pointed out that traders who ignore this trend risk missing a major price move. He explained how weaker holders lose interest during long periods with little price movement. They exit their positions, and stronger participants step in. He described them as patient buyers who increase their holdings without chasing price swings. Ripple Bull Winkle said they “accumulate quietly, patiently, and aggressively.” That approach often leads to tighter supply conditions. XRP then enters deeper storage channels , such as cold storage on custody platforms or institutional vaults. Those locations remove tokens from the available float, which reduces liquidity. Institutional Positioning and Market Structure Ripple Bull Winkle pointed out that the supply that moves off exchanges rarely returns in the short term. He views this trend as evidence of growing institutional interest . These participants do not trade with the same strategy as retail buyers. They prepare for future demand by securing supply early. This shift limits available liquidity once interest rises again. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 He also noted that reduced supply creates a thinner order book. In that environment, new demand pushes price movement faster. He said that the entire year functioned as a tightening cycle. He believes that this condition forms the foundation for “explosive price discovery.” What to Expect from XRP Ripple Bull Winkle’s comments support a constructive outlook for XRP. He encourages observers to focus on supply data, ETF activity , and institutional flows. His message strengthens confidence because it highlights measurable trends. Supply continues to decrease on exchanges as long-term holders accumulate. Institutional buyers continue to expand their positions. He believes this environment creates the conditions for a major XRP rally. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

55300720,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/?p=186104,1764768682,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/81/55300720.jpeg,"Crypto Market Recap, November 2025 by CryptoRank",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/crypto-market-recap-november-2025-by-cryptorank/,"November has shaped up to be one of the most negative months for the crypto market in the past three years. In this recap, we break down the key reasons behind this downturn, examine whether it affected core on-chain metrics, and highlight the projects that continue to see rising activity despite the broader market decline. One of The Longest US Shutdowns Hitted Crypto Hard The main macro event shaping markets in early November was the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which by the start of the month had already lasted longer than usual. This not only elevated market fear but also translated into real economic losses, as a large share of federal employees were placed on unpaid leave, slowing down actual economic activity. Interestingly, equities showed stronger resilience than Bitcoin. The S&P 500 fell less during the month and had recovered to its early-November levels by month-end. Bitcoin, however, posted its second-worst monthly performance in the past three years. Gold moved in the opposite direction, rallying 7% and reclaiming the levels lost during October’s decline. Additional pressure on Bitcoin and the broader crypto market comes from the growing risk of a correction in the S&P 500, which is up 16% year-to-date and appears overheated according to several major indicators—such as the GDP-to-market-cap ratio. Under current conditions, an equity correction could trigger an even sharper move in crypto, especially as the two markets have become increasingly interconnected through ETFs and DATs. Speaking of DATs, some market participants highlight a potential “black swan” scenario: the bankruptcy of one of the DAT issuers, which could trigger a cascade of liquidations. For now, however, this remains purely hypothetical rather than an imminent risk. Bitcoin Bitcoin’s weaker performance compared to the S&P 500 suggests fading enthusiasm for the asset. Market sentiment on Twitter further reflects this shift, with conversations tilting more pessimistic toward crypto. On a deeper level, this may stem from the lack of a strong global narrative or major upcoming catalysts. The market has entered a “boring phase,” with no significant crypto events on the horizon to fuel positive expectations. The absence of optimistic drivers has gradually transformed into broader market pessimism. Some long-term holders have started locking in profits above the $100K level, while many recently funded wallets have slipped into unrealized losses. Historically, when Bitcoin trades below the average purchase price of 1–2 year holders, it has often marked a strong accumulation zone. At the moment, this threshold sits just below $66K. However, it is not static: the longer Bitcoin remains above it, the higher this accumulation range will drift over time. Ethereum Faces Its Second-Worst Month in Years November is shaping up to be Ethereum’s second-worst month in the past three years. Even more notably, in 2025 Ethereum has recorded only three positive months so far. Over the last two years, ETH’s performance has tended to bifurcate: months are either clearly negative or extremely positive, often delivering sharp 20–40% gains in a single period. Despite being the second-largest cryptocurrency and enjoying broad distribution, Ethereum remains highly volatile. Its unique position in the ecosystem makes it difficult to value. Ethereum is not a typical crypto startup that can be assessed using traditional metrics like P/E, yet it is also not positioned like Bitcoin—which increasingly behaves like digital gold rather than a typical crypto asset. Even after a decade on the market, investors still need to “reinvent” ETH in terms of how it should be evaluated and understood. The market must ultimately decide what Ethereum represents as an asset class. The answer to that question may determine the direction of its future price performance. On-chain activity is fading as the crypto market remains turbulent BNB Chain BNB Chain recorded a 32% MoM decrease in transactions. Fees fell from a 3-year high of $71M to just $17M, driven by a pullback in perp trading and a cooldown in the memecoin sector. Despite active addresses slipped to 57.6M, it’s still the highest among all networks. Meanwhile, BNB Chain’s TVL declined 25%. BNB is now trading at $843, down 35% from its October all-time high. Despite the slowdown, BNB Chain continued to ship ecosystem updates in November, focusing on infrastructure and developer tools. Enhancements to opBNB and BNB Greenfield were showcased throughout the month, emphasizing lower latency and more efficient data availability. Solana Solana network fees hit a year low of $20M, while chain apps’ fees dropped to $293M, also a 2025 low. Monthly transactions were recorded near the yearly-ATL level of 1.55B, while active addresses reached 43.7M. DEX volume fell to $104B, but it’s still the top result among all chains. Meanwhile, memecoin volume only accounts for 5% of the total chain volume, the lowest level since memes exploded two years ago. A decrease in memecoin activity is seen as the key driver behind the falling numbers. Solana is now experiencing a strong competition from Base and other high-risk “memecoin substitutes”, like perps and predictions. A major milestone was the recent launch of spot Solana ETFs. It’s been an impressive 21-day streak of inflows, with cumulative total net inflow hitting $619M. Bitwise ’s BSOL is a clear leader here, accumulating 85% of the total SOL ETF inflows. However, institutional money flows didn’t much help the token to maintain its price. SOL followed the overall market fall and touched $127, a level not seen since April. Base Base monthly fees dropped by 37% to $6.3M. DEX and perps volume fell by 32% and 37% respectively. It’s surprising that Base recorded its lowest active address count of 2025 at 16.6M while simultaneously hitting a new ATH in transactions at 406.9M. On November 21, Base core developer Jesse Pollak launched his own token . Within 40 minutes, JESSE reached a $25 million market cap before losing momentum; it now trades around $11 million with about $3.5 million in pool liquidity. The first 24 hours saw $25 million in trading volume, though $18 million of that came in the opening hour. Interest faded quickly, and by the end of the day, hourly volume had fallen below $100K. Snipers earned more than $1 million from the launch by exploiting Base’s recent network upgrade and the addition of flashblocks. Each 2-second block contains sub-blocks that finalize in roughly 200 milliseconds, letting bots detect a token deploy and submit a buy transaction in the next flashblock while still inside the same main block. Meanwhile, Coinbase has been expanding through two major acquisitions, Echo and Vector . Hints of a potential BASE token have further fueled interest, with many anticipating an eventual airdrop . All eyes are now on how competition between Base and Solana will evolve. Tron It’s been a month of ups and downs for Tron in November. The network generated its lowest fee amount since January 2023 at $29.4M, though it still remains the highest among all chains. Around 84% of all Tron fees now come from USDT transfers. DEX volume stayed roughly in line with October, while perps volume hit a new ATH, rising an impressive 274% month-over-month. All perp activity continues to come from Sunperp, the perp DEX built within the SunPump ecosystem. Boosty Labs proposed introducing a transaction batching mechanism for Tron. The idea is to bundle multiple on-chain transactions into one, which could reduce fees and ease congestion for high-volume users like exchanges and payment processors, and testing is already underway on the testnet. Lower fees could make Tron more attractive for enterprises, especially for USDT-related use cases, since the stablecoin represents about 45% of all Tether in circulation. Still, the proposal requires community approval through a governance vote before it can go live. Plasma It’s been a tough month for Plasma , a newly launched L1 built specifically for stablecoins. The chain’s stablecoin market cap fell by more than 68%, dropping from $5.1B to $1.66B. Plasma’s TVL also declined by 34%, reaching $7B. XPL crashed about 90% from its ATH and now sits around a $326M market cap. The decline is largely tied to weak on-chain activity, with the network processing only around 13 transactions per second, far below the performance targets highlighted at launch. The stablecoin-focused narrative is now running into a reality check: without real user demand, even strong technical architecture won’t carry a chain forward. For now, Plasma needs to show real usage, because early hype isn’t enough to sustain the ecosystem. Altcoin in red, following the Bitcoin decline Most altcoins were bleeding in November due to overall market weakness. This selection highlights tokens that managed to show strength during the turbulence. RAIN surged after Nasdaq-listed Enlivex Therapeutics announced plans to raise about $212 million through a private placement to build a digital asset treasury centered around the Rain token. With a 126% monthly increase, it became the top gainer among tokens with a market cap above $500M. XMR continued to benefit from the privacy narrative, attracting capital during risk-off periods and geopolitical tension as investors seek assets resistant to surveillance. It delivered a solid 16% gain. STRK gained momentum as recent protocol upgrades improved throughput and reduced fees, which supported developer activity even in a bearish environment. The token reached its highest level since February before retracing by roughly 50%, and it now sits at a $570M market cap. MERL climbed to its 2025 ATH of 0.47 and is currently trading about 7% below that mark. The rally was driven by Merlin Chain’s latest upgrade, improving stability and scalability, supported by investor interest in Bitcoin L2s. PIPPIN , a Solana-based memecoin, surged more than 600% over the past month. With no major updates tied to the project, the growth appears fueled mainly by heightened speculative trading activity. Perp DEX activity slows down, Lighter is the new volume leader November was the first time in many months when we saw a change in the volume leader. Lighter became the top project by perp volume with $292M, marking its ATH. Even though Lighter doesn’t charge trading fees directly, the project also hit a record in monthly fees, collecting $24.5M. Aster finished second with $259M in perp volume, matching its October milestone. However, its fees dropped sharply from $133M to $53M. Aster also announced plans to launch its own zero-fee L1 blockchain with a strong focus on privacy. The team aims to support tokenized traditional assets such as stocks and futures, and will introduce a new futures pre-market product in partnership with Buidlpad. These steps make sense, as having its own chain is a key advantage enjoyed by Aster’s main competitors. edgeX attracted significant trader attention as well. The chain, designed specifically for perps, consistently ranks among the best-performing L1s by earnings. In November, edgeX set a new ATH in monthly fees at $64M, outperforming most rivals. Its TVL briefly reached $500M before retracing to $420M. For Hyperliquid , it was a difficult month for the long-time market leader. Perp volume dropped to $244M, the lowest since June. Fees, however, remained relatively strong at $101M. Hyperliquid still dominates all competitors by open interest; as of December 2, its 24-hour OI stands at 5.92M, higher than all other projects combined. On the development side, Hyperliquid launched HIP-3 Growth Mode, enabling permissionless market creation with significantly lower trading fees. The upgrade is designed to boost liquidity and attract new market makers. Taker fees on new markets are reduced by over 90%, and for top-tier traders can drop to as low as 0.00144%. To maintain stability, new markets must not duplicate existing assets, and their parameters remain locked for 30 days after deployment. HYPE fell back to its May price level of $29. Despite this, community sentiment remains optimistic, supported by the rollout of HIP-3. On November 29, the team received its first major unlock of 2.6M HYPE, and the market is now watching closely to see how these tokens will be handled. Overall, the perp sector faced pressure from the broader crypto market downturn, which reduced overall trading volumes. At the same time, competition increased from emerging chains, new derivatives-focused protocols, and high-risk sectors such as prediction markets. Prediction markets are thriving: Polymarket vs Kalshi Maybe the only crypto sector that didn’t experience any issues with volume or user activity in November was prediction markets. A new ATH in trading volume was reached, showing a strong 54% increase compared to October. Both major players, Polymarket and Kalshi , hit new record highs with $4.3B and $5.8B in volume, respectively. They also reached ATH levels in monthly transactions at 18.6M and 22.1M. Opinion Labs, backed by YZi Labs, entered the arena with an impressive $4.2B in volume. However, it only recorded 1.1M transactions, which is about 17 times fewer than Polymarket. It’s important to highlight that Opinion is the only one of the three running a full incentive program, so a large portion of the volume is likely driven by whales farming points and future rewards. Polymarket ’s biggest milestone in November was securing an Amended Order of Designation from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on November 24, allowing it to operate as a fully regulated U.S. exchange with intermediated access via futures commission merchants (FCMs) and traditional brokerages. The approval requires stricter surveillance, upgraded clearing systems, enhanced market oversight, and Part 16 reporting – effectively bringing Polymarket in line with federal trading venues after leaving the U.S. in 2022 due to fines and restrictions. Earlier in the month, Polymarket reopened limited U.S. access in a beta phase, letting a small group of users trade event markets as regulatory progress continued. On November 12, Polymarket announced an exclusive partnership with Yahoo Finance, becoming the platform’s sole provider of prediction-market data. It also expanded into sports and fantasy gaming through an exclusive integration with PrizePicks, embedding Polymarket’s markets directly into the popular fantasy sports app. A day later, on November 13, Polymarket signed a multi-year partnership with UFC and Zuffa Boxing, marking the first time prediction-market technology would be integrated into live sports broadcasts and venues. Kalshi also had a big month in November, securing a $1B investment round led by Sequoia Capital and CapitalIG , bringing its total funding to $1.57B. This pushed the project to a new valuation peak and signaled strong institutional conviction in the business model. Sports markets remain Kalshi’s main volume driver, but the platform continues expanding its offerings. New political markets were added, and the one tracking the duration of the U.S. government shutdown drew substantial trader attention. Kalshi also partnered with StockX , enabling speculation on sneaker resale prices, collectible demand, and brand performance during peak shopping periods. Combined with major partnerships, including a key one with Robinhood , Kalshi is rapidly moving into the financial mainstream. Regulatory challenges remain, with certain U.S. states classifying Kalshi’s contracts as gambling. The project is currently appealing these rulings. Recent investment trends show that institutional capital increasingly views prediction markets as a potential core component of modern financial infrastructure. This shift suggests they could eventually sit alongside traditional derivatives as a standard tool for real-time forecasting, risk management, and market sentiment pricing.

The delisting process is scheduled for mid-December, but the announcement has already started to weigh in on the prices of the affected tokens. Goodbye to These Ones Binance periodically reviews each digital asset listed on its platform and checks if each one meets important criteria like commitment of the team to the project, level and quality of development activity, trading volume, safety of the network from attacks, community sentiments, and more. Following its latest analysis, it decided to terminate all services involving StaFi (FIS), REI Network (REI), and Voxies (VOXEL) on December 17. “The spot trading pairs of the aforementioned tokens will be removed. All trade orders will be automatically removed after trading ceases in each respective trading pair,” the disclosure reads. The exchange clarified that deposits of these cryptocurrencies will not be credited to users’ accounts after December 18, whereas withdrawals will be unavailable after February 16, 2026. Binance is the leader in its field, and announcements of that type typically cause sharp declines in the prices of the involved tokens. The ones included in the latest delisting effort were charting impressive spikes prior to the disclosure alongside the broader crypto market revival, but after the news, they headed south. FIS and REI are down 2% for the day, whereas VOXEL remains in green territory. FIS Price, Source: CoinGecko When the exchange withdraws support for a digital asset, this reduces liquidity and availability and causes reputational damage. Approximately a month ago, the company terminated all services with Flamingo (FLM), Kadena (KDA), and Perpetual Protocol (PERP), triggering double-digit losses for the affected ones. The Previous Announcement Besides scrapping some cryptocurrencies that no longer meet the necessary standards, Binance often adds new trading pairs to its platform to enhance the user experience. Towards the end of November, it included 31 pairs on its spot program, including BTC/IDR, XRP/IDR, DOGE/IDR, ADA/IDR, and many others. The initiative was specifically focused on Indonesian users since IDR is the symbol of the national currency of the Asian country. Indonesia is a huge crypto market, with adoption rates placing it within the global top 10. The introduction of direct trading pairs between multiple digital assets and IDR should make it easier for local traders to enter and exit the sector without first converting their funds into other fiat currencies.

If regulators follow through, ordinary Russians could gain broader access to digital assets through supervised platforms instead of relying on informal or offshore channels. Russia May Scrap “Highly Qualified” Rule — What That Means for Crypto Access The Bank of Russia and the Ministry of Finance plan to drop the “highly qualified investor” requirement for cryptocurrency investments. They are working on a new approach that would let a wider group of citizens buy and trade assets such as Bitcoin under a regulated framework. Officials say they want a tiered access model, where people can enter the market with different limits based on experience, risk tolerance and financial knowledge, rather than a single barrier that blocks almost everyone. Until now, Russia has treated crypto as a product reserved for the very rich. The existing regime defines “highly qualified” status through strict income and asset tests, so only investors with very large portfolios or high annual earnings could legally access many crypto-linked products. Ordinary retail savers, even if they understood the risks, remained outside this category and therefore could not use most regulated channels to gain exposure to Bitcoin or other digital assets. The central bank’s own rules for investment funds reinforced this narrow access. Under previous instructions, mutual funds and similar vehicles could not hold digital currencies directly in their portfolios. They also could not use derivatives that involved physical delivery of coins. At most, funds whose units did not circulate freely could take small, cash-settled positions in instruments tied to digital currency prices, and even those positions sat inside tight concentration limits. As a result, retail investors who relied on regulated funds for market exposure saw only limited, indirect contact with crypto, while direct holdings and deliverable contracts stayed off-limits under the older framework. How Russia’s Plan Compares With the EU and US Russia’s move to drop the “highly qualified investor” rule would bring its crypto approach closer to other large markets that already let retail investors buy digital assets under supervision. In the European Union , the MiCA framework gives service providers a single set of rules. Exchanges and custodians must get licenses, follow anti–money laundering standards and share clear risk information with users. Retail investors can still trade many tokens; however, they do so through firms that regulators monitor. By contrast, the United States still relies on long-standing securities and commodities laws instead of a dedicated crypto statute. The SEC and CFTC use enforcement actions, registration demands and guidance to shape how companies list tokens, hold client assets and run trading platforms. As a result, access for ordinary investors exists, yet it often depends on how regulators classify each asset and on whether a platform meets those legacy rules. In this context, Russia is trying to move away from an elite-only gate without giving up control. Regulators want to replace the single “highly qualified” barrier with a tiered system and keep limits on how funds and platforms handle crypto. If they finalize this plan, more Russians could reach assets like Bitcoin through regulated channels, while the state keeps tight oversight similar to the EU’s licensing model and the United States’ enforcement-based approach.",News|Legal,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-03 13:42:54
55301319,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=872267,1764769574,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55301319.jpeg,Strategy’s Michael Saylor continues to discuss MSCI index January decision,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/strategy-saylor-talks-with-msci-index/,"Strategy, the world’s biggest corporate stockpiler of Bitcoin, is engaging with MSCI about a decision that could potentially exclude it from its indices. The company risks exclusion from MSCI indices due to its volatile balance sheet. According to reports , Chairman Michael Saylor is directly engaging MSCI ahead of its January 15, 2026, decision. JP Morgan warned that an exclusion would cast doubts on the company’s costs and ability to raise equity and debt in the future. Saylor cites JP Morgan’s numbers on the outflows as incorrect Strategy is currently part of the MSCI USA and MSCI World indices. A significant portion of its market value is tied to benchmarks through passive investment vehicles, such as ETFs. Bitcoin’s recent 10% price drop has intensified pressure on MSTR shares, which trade at a 2.5x premium to its crypto assets, serving as a leveraged Bitcoin proxy. As a result, JPM said , “In light of MSCI’s decision to consider removing MicroStrategy and other digital-asset treasury companies from its equity indices, potential outflows could reach $2.8bn if MicroStrategy is removed from MSCI indices. Should other index providers adopt this practice, cumulative outflows across all equity indices could total $8.8bn.” In response, Saylor stated that he was unsure whether JPMorgan’s numbers on the outflows were correct. Investors have also criticized JPM’s metrics. According to them, JPM intends to mount a coordinated attack against Strategy. Additionally, users noted that in July, JPMorgan tightened margin requirements on loans backed by MSTR shares. In their view, that was when Strategy’s problems began. “The equity is going to be volatile because the company is built on amplified bitcoin. If bitcoin falls, you know, if it falls 30%, 40% then the equity is going to fall more, because the equity is built to fall,” Saylor stated. The recent decline in the price of the king coin was driven by increased caution over riskier assets, spurred by the specter of an AI bubble amid lofty tech valuations and overall economic uncertainty, which has soured the rally in recent weeks. Meanwhile, the coin is up 6.5% in the last 24 hours, now trading at $92,998. Strategy FUD projects losses of up to $5.5 billion in 2025 Strategy’s stock has fallen 60% since hitting a record high in July, bringing its market cap very close to the value of its Bitcoin. They are also down over 37% this year. As a result, the value of Saylor’s company has also plunged. Strategy warned on Monday that it would suffer a loss of $5.5 billion in 2025 if the price of Bitcoin did not recover before the end of the year. As reported by Cryptopolitan, the Nasdaq-listed company also announced that it had sold some of its assets to set up a $1.44 billion cash reserve to pay its dividends on its preferred stock and interest on its outstanding debt. It also updated its 2025 earnings guidance, assuming a lower year-end price for Bitcoin of $85,000 to $110,000. The company previously set guidance indicating that Bitcoin would be around $150,000 by the end of the year. According to Saylor, the plan will better position the company to navigate short-term market volatility. However, analysts see it as a move designed to stop a panic sale of its stock. Still, Strategy’s share price has continued to decline by as much as 12.2% on Monday after the statement. During the worst of its slump, the company’s market cap was worth $10 billion less than its net Bitcoin holdings. “My hope is our mNAV doesn’t go below one, but if we did and we didn’t have access to other capital, we would sell bitcoin There’s the mathematical side of me that says that would be the absolutely right thing to do,” Sayor stated Meanwhile, the company continues to accumulate more Bitcoin. On Monday, it announced that it bought 130 more Bitcoin, boosting its stockpile to 650,000, valued at roughly $59 billion based on recent prices.

As the company’s market cap jumps ahead of major banks and draws fresh attention from index providers, the stock is entering one of its most closely watched periods yet. Strategy’s Market Value Briefly Surpasses Standard Chartered Strategy Inc.’s market capitalization has climbed above that of Standard Chartered, marking a new milestone for the Bitcoin-focused company. The latest trading data shows Strategy valued at roughly 52 to 53 billion dollars, while Standard Chartered sits near 51 billion dollars in U.S.-dollar terms. The shift reflects Strategy’s continued rise as its Bitcoin holdings drive both investor attention and daily valuation changes. The company has expanded its reserves throughout the year, and each price swing in Bitcoin now moves its market cap in real time. As a result, Strategy’s value occasionally passes long-established financial institutions. Strategy MSTR Market Cap. Source: Yahoo Finance Standard Chartered’s market capitalization continues to fluctuate with currency changes and trading volumes on the London Stock Exchange. Because the gap between the two companies is narrow, their positions can switch during the day. However, the current figures confirm that Strategy has, at least briefly, overtaken the global banking group in size. Saylor Confirms Talks With MSCI Over Potential $MSTR Index Removal Michael Saylor said Strategy Inc. is in direct discussions with MSCI after reports emerged that the index provider may remove the company’s stock from some of its benchmarks. He confirmed the talks in an interview cited by Reuters, calling them part of an active review process now underway. MSCI’s review comes as Strategy’ s growing Bitcoin exposure raises questions about how closely it aligns with the criteria for traditional equity indices. JPMorgan analysts recently noted that MSCI could decide to exclude $MSTR from specific indexes as early as January. The move would affect funds and benchmarks that currently include the stock due to its strong performance and market cap. Saylor said Strategy is working to ensure the company remains eligible while addressing concerns raised by index officials. No final decision has been made yet, but the ongoing discussions confirm that MSCI is seriously evaluating the firm's place in its benchmarks. Trader Flags Key Support Zone as Strategy Stock Rebounds Meanwhile, an options trader says Strategy’s stock now shows a risk-reward profile that leans to the upside after a steep pullback. The shares have dropped more than 60 percent from highs in the mid-400s earlier this year and recently returned to the 150–160 dollar area that acted as a demand zone several times in 2024. Last week, price bounced from that region and pushed back toward 181 dollars while Bitcoin traded steady above 90,000 dollars. MSTR Weekly Chart Analysis. Source: EliteOptionsTrader on X The analysis highlights 185 dollars as a key level on the weekly chart. Price has rejected that zone multiple times, so a clean break and close above it would mark a shift in momentum. From there, the trader argues that an extension toward and above 200 dollars becomes possible if buyers keep control. The view also links Strategy’s next move to Bitcoin’s behavior. If BTC continues to hold above 90,000 dollars and starts reclaiming higher levels, the trader expects Strategy to react strongly because the stock looks oversold on the weekly timeframe. However, the setup still depends on Bitcoin staying firm and on Strategy defending the recent support band.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-03 13:46:18

This pattern, accumulation, manipulation, and expansion, often signals major trend reversals and powerful price moves, and Niels says XRP is currently tracking it with remarkable precision. Based on this analysis, XRP’s accumulation phase is already complete, with smart money quietly positioning itself over recent months. The tight price ranges, low volatility, and steady supply absorption all point to well-capitalized buyers preparing for a major move. According to Niels, XRP has officially entered the manipulation phase, marked by shakeouts, deceptive price swings, and tight consolidation aimed at testing conviction and flushing out weak hands. The asset’s recent sideways movement fits this stage perfectly, reinforcing the view that the market is positioning itself for the third and most explosive phase of the pattern. Well, the critical level to watch is $2.60. A clean break above this zone would confirm the start of XRP’s expansion phase, the stage where momentum accelerates, trend strength rises, and price appreciation often becomes explosive. Historically, this third phase has marked the point where uncertainty gives way to confident, sustained bullish action with price currently standing at $2.18. Niels expects XRP to consolidate for a few more weeks, creating the illusion of stagnation while strategic buyers continue accumulating behind the scenes. Once selling pressure fades and market makers complete the manipulation cycle, the conditions for a breakout become significantly stronger. Therefore, if XRP completes the power-of-3 pattern, a breakout above $2.6 could signal the start of a powerful new uptrend, potentially its strongest in years. Nothing is guaranteed, but the convergence of technical structure, sustained accumulation, and steadily improving sentiment makes a major upside move increasingly plausible. Conclusion All eyes are now locked on the crucial $2.60 level, a breakout threshold that could shift XRP from quiet consolidation into a full-scale rally. With accumulation firmly established and the manipulation phase fading, the setup for a major expansion is coming into focus. Market cycles are never perfect, but the current power-of-3 structure provides one of the clearest technical roadmaps XRP has had in years. Should momentum ignite above $2.60, the next uptrend could significantly elevate XRP’s market position and shape its trajectory heading into the next crypto cycle.",News|Ripple,EN,0,0,MARKET|TRADING|XRP|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-03 13:50:37

Questa rapida ripresa (“V-shape recovery”) dei due principali asset digitali ha catturato l’attenzione del mercato, e gli analisti stanno ora condividendo la causa principale di questo “pump” inaspettato. Perché i prezzi di Bitcoin ed Ethereum stanno rimbalzando Attualmente Bitcoin scambia sopra i $93.000 dopo aver vissuto un periodo di vendite accelerate e pesanti liquidazioni delle posizioni Long che avevano brevemente spinto il prezzo al ribasso nelle ultime settimane. Ora che la vendita forzata si è attenuata, la criptovaluta ha recuperato in modo significativo, aggiungendo l’incredibile cifra di 75 miliardi di dollari alla sua capitalizzazione di mercato nel giro di sole 10 ore. Ethereum ha seguito la stessa scia rialzista. I dati di CoinMarketCap mostrano che ETH ha guadagnato più del 9% nelle ultime 24 ore, con un accumulo costante che ha spinto il prezzo sopra i $3.050 . L’Analisi: Acquisti istituzionali coordinati o manipolazione? L’analista di mercato Wimar.X ha spiegato il motivo dietro l’improvvisa impennata dei prezzi. Ha inquadrato la rinascita come un’ondata rapida di acquisti istituzionali coordinati ad alto volume . In parole povere, il mercato è “pompato” perché si è verificato un accumulo massiccio concentrato in una singola ora. I dati di Arkham Intelligence confermano questa tesi, tracciando i movimenti delle “balene” e dei market maker poco prima del surge: Wintermute : Ha acquistato 8.577 BTC . Binance (il più grande exchange al mondo): Ha acquisito 7.658 BTC . Whale Wallet (portafoglio sconosciuto): Ha aggiunto 6.010 BTC al portafoglio. BitMEX (exchange co-fondato da Arthur Hayes): Ha accumulato 5.818 BTC . Bitfinex: Ha assorbito 5.778 BTC . Secondo l’analisi di Wimar.X, questo accumulo improvviso e la sua tempistica appaiono coordinati. Ha descritto l’attività quasi come una forma di manipolazione , suggerendo che fosse intesa a influenzare la percezione del mercato e a spostare artificialmente i prezzi verso l’alto per innescare la FOMO. Le previsioni degli analisti: Cosa succede ora? Mentre il mercato mostra nuova forza e BTC recupera i $90.000, l’esperto crypto Michael van de Poppe ha sottolineato su X l’importanza di questo rimbalzo. Ha notato che il recente calo di Bitcoin all’inizio del mese appariva “insolito”, ma è stato seguito da una reazione forte. Secondo l’analista, il mantenimento sopra i $92.000 sarà critico per Bitcoin e potrebbe spianare la strada verso un nuovo massimo storico (ATH) e un potenziale test dei $100.000 . Dall’altra parte, l’analista identificato come ‘More Crypto Online’ si è concentrato su Ethereum. Ha dichiarato che ETH sta attualmente testando una zona di “micro supporto” tra $2.907 e $2.974 . Mantenere quest’area è cruciale per sostenere il momentum rialzista iniziato questa settimana. Target ETH: La prossima finestra di rialzo si trova tra $3.165 e $3.210 . Rischio: Una rottura sotto il livello di supporto inferiore potrebbe innescare un’onda correttiva più profonda. Tuttavia, i trend attuali suggeriscono che ETH punta principalmente verso l’alto.",Uncategorized|bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|ETH|EXCHANGE|ARKM|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-03 13:51:28

Institutional confidence received a notable boost thanks to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink and COO Rob Goldstein’s comments regarding real-world asset ( RWA ) tokenization, a market already exceeding $23 billion in value, as a transformative force in finance . Thanks to its fast settlement capabilities and built-in compliance architecture, XRP is positioned as a potential beneficiary of the next wave of financial infrastructure, potentially serving as a liquidity bridge for tokenized assets. At the same time, XRP ETFs have absorbed an estimated $845 million in inflows, and analysts are watching whether they can push past the $1 billion this week. As a result, XRP’s funding rate spiked nearly 120% on the daily chart on Wednesday, December 3, showing that leveraged traders have sharply increased their bullish exposure and are more willing to pay a premium to maintain their bets. XRP derivatives overview. Source: CryptoQuant Leveraged XRP traders turn more bullish, but there are signs of weakness While rapid surges in funding rates do reflect growing confidence, they can also point to an overheated market. That is, they can sometimes eat into profits for long-term holders and increase the risk of sudden corrections. A persistently high positive rate, especially alongside elevated open interest, usually means longs are overleveraged. Accordingly, if the momentum shifts, the imbalance could trigger a long squeeze. Indeed, XRP is already showing some signs of fragility. Namely, some recent trading patterns suggest that bulls are on shaky ground in regard to the $2 threshold. In other words, a failure to defend that level could open the door to a sharp slide toward $1.20. The broader market structure reinforces this bearish narrative. The $2 mark has acted as a vital support throughout the year, but repeated challenges have weakened it. Moreover, the latest retest has produced narrow volatility and shallow recoveries, conditions that often precede decisive breakdowns. XRP’s short-term performance is more positive, with the token trading at $2.18 at press time, up 6.65% on the day and about 1% over the past week. Meanwhile, the 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) sits at 47.6, signaling balanced momentum. XRP one-day price chart. Source: Finbold BlackRock “validates” XRP Although it did not explicitly reference any particular asset, BlackRock’s aforementioned column has had a noticeable impact on many crypto circles, and XRP traders were no exception. This is hardly surprising, as XRP’s ledger features and established infrastructure make it easy to read the currency itself into the article. “If history is any guide, tokenisation today is roughly where the internet was in 1996—when Amazon had sold just $16m-worth of books, and three of the rest of today’s “Magnificent Seven” tech giants hadn’t even been founded,” Fink and Goldstein wrote. Still, while Fink and Goldstein have undeniably boosted market sentiment, XRP’s adoption trajectory remains dependent on a number of factors, including institutional buys. “Tokenisation could advance at the pace of the internet—faster than most expect, with enormous growth over the coming decades, ” they added.

Bitcoin is trading around $93,000 after recovering from last week’s $88,500 crash , while the total crypto market cap sits at $3.3 trillion. Import prices recorded no change in September, while export prices were also unchanged, suggesting inflation pressures remain muted despite fuel price volatility. Markets are pricing in 88% odds of a December rate cut at the Fed’s December 9-10 meeting, and any signs of cooling price pressures in the data could reinforce dovish expectations and support risk assets, including crypto. Source: CME FedWatch Tool The September data shows nonfuel import prices rose 0.8% year-over-year while fuel imports fell 4.0%, with petroleum down 5.1% over the past 12 months. Higher prices for industrial supplies and consumer goods were offset by lower prices for capital goods and food. For crypto traders, the key takeaway is that inflation isn’t accelerating; import prices rose just 0.3% year over year in September, the first annual increase since March 2025. This supports the narrative that the Fed has room to continue cutting rates without reigniting inflation, which would be bullish for Bitcoin and altcoins as lower rates typically drive liquidity into risk assets. Technical indicators show Bitcoin needs to hold $94,000 support and break resistance at $98,000-$100,000 to confirm the uptrend. With QT officially ended December 1 and the Fed’s blackout period starting this week ahead of the December 9-10 meeting, today’s price data is one of the last major economic releases that could influence policy expectations. Subdued import prices combined with the Fed’s liquidity pivot create favorable conditions for crypto’s next leg higher, though traders should watch for any upside surprises in the data that could dampen rate cut odds.

This bearish outlook for BTC comes amid a rebound for the flagship crypto, with a recent surge above the psychological $90,000 level. Bitcoin Price Risks 50% Drop To $42,000 Based On This Pattern In an X post, Severino stated that the Bitcoin price likes to retrace to subwave 3/4 of wave 3/4 of its impulse. Based on this, the analyst indicated that BTC could crash to as low as $42,000 on wave C of this move to the downside. His accompanying chart showed that this decline could happen sometime at the start of next year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Can Hit These ‘Realistic’ Bullish Targets Before The Bear Market Begins This bearish Bitcoin price prediction comes amid BTC’s rebound above $90,000 following the end of quantitative tightening (QT) by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The flagship crypto has also rebounded amid optimism of another rate cut at this month’s FOMC meeting. CME FedWatch data shows there is almost a 90% chance that the Fed will lower rates again this month. However, despite these macro positives for the Bitcoin price, analysts such as Tony Severino have suggested that BTC is in a bear market and is likely to trend lower in the coming months. In an X post, he highlighted the BTC monthly chart, suggesting it showed a subtle volume breakout that confirmed a “not-so-subtle” trendline breakdown. Meanwhile, market technician JT described statements that the QT ending is bullish for the Bitcoin price as being a “fallacy.” He alluded to the possibility that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may hike rates this month as one of the stressors to liquidity beyond QT. Peter Brandt Predicts Drop To Mid $40ks In an X post, veteran trader and analyst Peter Brandt predicted that the Bitcoin price could drop to mid $40,000. He stated that the upper boundary of the lower green zone starts below $70,000 and that the lower support boundary is in the mid $40,000. Notably, Brandt had previously predicted that BTC could drop to around $50,000 before it then rallies to around $200,000 in the next bull market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price Breaks Below 50-MA For The First Time This Cycle, Why A Crash To $38,000 Could Be Coming The veteran analyst noted that there have been five major bull market cycles for the Bitcoin price since its inception. He further stated that in all previous cycles, the violation of the dominant parabolic advance has been followed by a 75% plus correction with no exception. As such, he expects BTC to undergo another significant correction in this cycle, potentially dropping below $50,000. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin price is trading at around $93,000, up almost 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Speaking during a White House meeting , he highlighted the administration’s efforts to contain inflation and pointed to improving economic indicators. “We’ve stopped inflation since January 2025, but there’s still a lot of work to do,” Trump said. “We’ve brought it down to an acceptable level, and we intend to reduce it further. Inflation must stay moderate — otherwise deflation sets in, which is often worse.” Trump noted that consumer prices for energy and food have eased in recent months, while mortgage conditions have improved — developments the administration sees as signs of stabilization. Trump Criticizes Powell as Speculation Over Successor Grows During the discussion, Trump delivered another sharp criticism of current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, arguing that Powell resisted calls for earlier rate cuts. He pointed to comments made by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, saying Powell ignored clear signals that monetary easing was needed sooner. “All of this was achieved despite the incompetent Fed Chairman,” Trump said. “He should have cut interest rates. He’s just a stubborn bull who probably doesn’t like me.” The president then hinted that the search for the next Fed Chair is already underway: “We’ll probably name someone in early 2026. I’ve spoken to Scott [Bessent, Treasury Secretary] about that.” A Key Name Emerges Inside the White House Trump also hinted directly at who may be the leading candidate: “I believe the potential Fed Chairman is here too… He’s a respected man. Thank you, Kevin.” The reference was directed at Kevin Hassett, head of the White House National Economic Council and a key economic adviser. Reports from late November 2025 already suggested he had become the favored choice for the role. Michelle Bowman, a current Federal Reserve Governor known for her pro-cryptocurrency position, is also believed to be under consideration — a factor that could shape future policy direction as digital assets gain broader relevance in U.S. financial strategy. What This Means for Markets and Crypto Investors have reacted quickly to the latest signals from Washington. The broader market and the crypto sector have both shown renewed momentum, partly due to expectations that a leadership change at the Fed could lead to more predictable — and potentially more supportive — monetary policy. Bitcoin and major digital assets moved higher following Trump’s comments, echoing past market behavior where speculation around Fed appointments often triggered notable swings. Fed leadership changes historically impact risk assets , especially during periods of elevated inflation or policy transition. Crypto markets are highly sensitive to rate-cut expectations , benefiting when investors see lower borrowing costs ahead. Hassett’s economic philosophy leans toward pro-growth strategies, which some traders interpret as supportive of more accommodative Fed policy in the long run. With more than a year left before the appointment, Trump’s signals are likely the start of a long period of speculation — and market reaction — as investors try to anticipate the next chapter in U.S. monetary leadership.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-03 14:04:02

XRP remains one of the most closely watched assets, and recent movements have intensified expectations. With volatility rising and sentiment improving, analysts are now examining whether XRP is entering a new phase of acceleration. Dark Defender recently reinforced this discussion when he stated that XRP’s long-term structure remains intact. His message builds on a February 2025 post where he emphasized that the same structure had guided XRP for 18 months. These remarks again positioned Dark Defender as a key technical voice in the XRP community. Technical Structure and Market Framework XRP’s chart has maintained a clear structure across higher timeframes. The market continues to respect long-established support and resistance zones that shape trader expectations. Dark Defender highlighted several levels that remain central to this structure. 2/2 13 February 2025 Structure https://t.co/cNprcdRFG7 — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) December 2, 2025 These levels act as checkpoints for strength, stability, and trend continuation. XRP’s recent price action continues to show reactions near these historical zones, reinforcing their relevance. The broader chart shows consistent consolidation in the low-dollar region. Consolidation of this type often signals preparation for significant directional movement. Traders are now watching whether XRP will transform this structure into a confirmed rally. Institutional Interest and Expanding Liquidity Technical structure gains power when it aligns with fundamental catalysts. XRP’s environment now includes rising institutional accessibility. U.S. platforms are allowing broader exposure to XRP through regulated financial products, increasing overall liquidity. More participants can enter positions with reduced friction, and this shift strengthens the market base supporting long-term trends. Growing participation from institutional channels also changes rally dynamics. Moves that once relied on retail enthusiasm can now be supported by larger pools of capital. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Market Conditions and Traders’ Risk Outlook A stable structure does not remove market risk. Breakouts can fail if volume weakens or global sentiment shifts. Traders should monitor volume increases, reactions at support levels, and confirmations on multiple timeframes. Dark Defender’s levels offer a framework, not guaranteed outcomes. They help traders define bias, manage exposure, and adjust strategies when conditions shift. Clear invalidation points remain essential. A decisive drop below long-term support would weaken the bullish structure. Strong closes above resistance levels would validate a continuation scenario. Key Signals to Watch The market will watch XRP’s behavior near the highlighted supports. Sustained strength above these levels would confirm stability. Traders will also look for rising buying volume, continued ETF inflows, and broader crypto market alignment. These factors must converge for a full rally to develop. In conclusion, Dark Defender’s December update reinforces a message he has shared throughout 2025. XRP’s structure remains intact, and the market appears prepared for movement. The combination of technical alignment and institutional access creates a compelling setup. Traders now look to the chart for confirmation. If momentum builds, this structure could become the foundation for XRP’s next major rally. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

This swift rebound has also coincided with a historic shift in institutional participation, with data revealing the most forceful single-day buy-side sentiment in the perpetual futures market since the current bull cycle began nearly three years ago. A Historic Shift in Market Sentiment According to pseudonymous analyst CoinCare, on December 2, the buy-to-sell ratio for market orders on perpetual futures exchanges hit 1.17, its highest point since January 2023. This ratio, which compares aggressive buy volume to sell volume, decisively moved above 1, signaling that buyer initiative heavily outweighed selling pressure for the first time in this cycle. CoinCare described this as a hallmark of a market transitioning into an expansion phase, where structural capital flows begin to increase. According to them, one of the main catalysts for this surge was the December 2 decision by investment giant Vanguard to allow its over 50 million brokerage clients to trade spot Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana ETFs. The move, influenced by new CEO and former BlackRock executive Salim Ramji, unlocked a massive new pool of potential capital, and reaction was immediate, with Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas noting that a large wave of Vanguard clients appeared to move “all at once.” This shift is also supported by improving macro liquidity conditions, suggesting the environment for risk assets like Bitcoin is becoming more favorable. “Taken together, the data suggests the current bull cycle is unlikely to be near its terminal stage,” wrote the analyst. “Structural ETF adoption, revived institutional participation, and an early turn in liquidity conditions all point toward continued expansion rather than exhaustion.” However, while the rally has been strong, the expert cautioned that there still remain systemic risks, including financial stress in Japan, which require monitoring. Broader Market Implications At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading around $93,000, up about 7% in the last 24 hours and nearly 6% over seven days, according to CoinGecko. The ripple effects of BTC’s rebound are being felt across the crypto landscape, helping push Ethereum back above $3,000, and triggering major altcoins like Solana and Cardano to post double-digit percentage gains. And there’s potential for things to get even better, with analysts at XWIN Research Japan saying that the scale of potential inflows from the $11 trillion asset manager is eye-watering. Their estimates suggest that even a tiny fraction of Vanguard’s assets flowing into crypto ETFs could inject tens of billions of dollars into the sector, exceeding the total inflows seen in the first year of U.S. spot ETF trading. According to them, it represents a pivotal moment, where crypto moves from niche adoption into a true phase of mainstream institutional acceptance.

The UK has officially recognized cryptocurrencies as property following the passage of a new law, Coindesk reported. At this point, the Property (Digital Assets etc.) Bill has also received Royal Assent as the final step after passing through Parliament. With this approval, the UK officially enacted the Property Act, which recognizes cryptocurrencies and stablecoins as personal property. Industry experts described the law as an important step in the legal recognition of digital assets, stating that it fosters a greater sense of trust among users. The new law provides enhanced legal protections for digital asset owners, including clearer ownership rights and theft recovery processes. It also facilitates the integration of digital assets into bankruptcy and inheritance procedures. “This change provides greater clarity and protection for consumers and investors by ensuring digital assets can be clearly owned, recovered in cases of theft or fraud, and included in bankruptcy and inheritance processes,” UK trade association CryptoUK said in a post. Cryptocurrencies were previously considered property in UK courts, but this was assessed on a case-by-case basis.

Analysts noted that the indicator tracks aggressive market buying versus selling in the perpetual futures market.

Experts say this pattern typically emerges during early market expansion phases , when structural demand increases and liquidity conditions start to recover.

Macro-level indicators support the same narrative.Analysts report that several stress metrics have dropped to their lowest levels, suggesting the market is moving from a stress phase into a liquidity recovery phase. Historically, these transitions often appear shortly before prolonged Bitcoin growth cycles. CryptoQuant added: “Taken together, these data suggest that the current bullish cycle is likely far from over.

While these declines have fueled market talk of a bear market and a crypto winter, options bulls are still anticipating a significant rally.

While Ethereum has had a rough quarter since its ATH in August, options bulls say the rally is far from over.

The $6,500 call option on Deribit was the most popular option with a total open interest value of over $380 million. A call option with a strike price of $6,500 represents a bet that the spot price will rise above that level, reflecting a strong expectation of a potential large rally for Ethereum.

The Australian Bitcoin Industry Body cited “misrepresented Bitcoin’s purpose, conflated it with criminal activity, omitted long-standing publicly available information, and relied on sensational language rather than evidence.” According to them, ABC ignored well-documented global and local use cases, including energy grid stabilization and humanitarian remittances, as well as merchant adoption and sovereign reserves, which effectively reduced its coverage to outdated & misleading tropes and narratives on price swings and US politics. ABC criticizes Bitcoin as a high-risk, high-volatility punt ABC, the nation’s largest media organization, which operates television, radio, and digital news services, published the contested piece on December 1. It analysed Bitcoin’s recent price volatility while questioning its utility. The article written by chief business correspondent Ian Verrender stated, “Conceived almost 18 years ago by the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto, or someone acting under that name, Bitcoin has never realised any of its stated goals and has no useful purpose. It hasn’t replaced the global financial system and is rarely used in ordinary, legitimate transactions.” The article also described Bitcoin as increasingly volatile and that it is no longer considered a store of wealth. “And now it seems likely that even those engaged in nefarious dealings are shying away from it,” the article continues. Additionally, the article highlighted that Bitcoin will not challenge the global dominance of the US dollar and that it no longer even pretends to be in a position to replace the greenback. Instead, it is now behaving less like the digital gold it was once hailed as and increasingly like a high-risk, high-volatile punt. And it is getting worse. ABIB stated that the coverage breaches the ABC’s own Editorial Policies and Code of Conduct by ignoring well-documented global and local use-cases. That includes energy grid stabilization and humanitarian remittances, as well as merchant adoption and sovereign reserves. The group also stated that it is frequently contacted by members of the public who are frustrated by recurring misrepresentations of Bitcoin in Australian media. To that end, ABIB calls on the ABC to issue corrections, uphold its editorial obligations, and engage subject-matter expertise in future reporting. “The public deserves better Bitcoin deserves informed, responsible coverage, not dismissal through outdated narratives,” the group wrote . Meanwhile, Bitcoin has increased by 6% over the last week. However, it is still 14% down in the last month. The coin is trading at $92,338. ABC criticizes Tether as an avenue to fly under the radar for criminals Besides Bitcoin, Tether wasn’t spared. The article stated, “As a stablecoin, Tether operates differently from most others in the crypto world. Unlike Bitcoin, which has a publicly available ledger, Tether offers users an avenue to fly under the radar. It now dominates trading across borders from the bazaars of Istanbul to Beijing and the barrios of Rio de Janeiro, allowing profits to be laundered globally and transfers hidden.” It quoted research firm Chainalysis, which revealed that in the last calendar year, approximately $41 billion of crypto linked to illegal activities was exchanged globally as stablecoins. It also quoted an investigation by The Economist newspaper, entitled ‘How Tether became money launderers’ dream currency.’ The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that at least $1.4 billion in USDT tokens passed through a crypto wallet linked to the Cambodia-based Huione Group. The group was flagged by US authorities for laundering billions tied to North Korean hackers, human trafficking, and scam operations.

While alarming at first glance, the data is not necessarily a bearish signal. Rather, it reflects structural factors consistent with a healthy bullish cycle. Namely, analysts argue that the chief suspect behind the falling numbers is the shift toward self-custody. That is, as the market strengthens, long-term investors and whales are moving “digital gold” from exchanges to cold wallets . This not only reduces potential selling pressure but also signals confidence rather than fear, as the behavior is typical of robust markets. Bitcoin reserves on Binance. Source: CryptoQuant Why Bitcoin reserves are falling A good chunk of the vanishing supply can simply be ascribed to spot Bitcoin ETFs drawing the asset in: movers such as BlackRock acquired BTC, and it gets shifted off exchanges and into custodial storage. Macro conditions are another important factor. Bitcoin has witnessed some rather drastic price swings over the past week or so amid risk-off flows and ETF redemptions. While it has since managed to stabilize, being up nearly 3% on the day and trading at $92,700 at the time of writing, the price action still shows that short-term price swings can be more than impactful.

In turn, this reduced margin deposits and lowered BTC balances on the exchange. Overall, the shrinking reserves appear to suggest that the world’s first cryptocurrency is simply being withdrawn from immediate circulation, with tightening supply, a condition that has usually supported medium- to long-term price gains, being the natural result. As such, the situation adds further support to some of the more bullish 2026 narratives .

The surge came only two weeks after their debut, giving XRP an early lead over Ethereum and Solana products. XRP reached $844.99 million in net inflows after only 13 trading days. This performance made XRP the third crypto asset to cross the $800 million line. Bitcoin achieved the mark in two days and Ethereum reached it after 95 sessions. XRP now stands out for its pace, despite entering the market more than two weeks after Solana. Moreover, XRP ETFs surpassed the progress of Solana ETFs, which collected $650.81 million after 25 days. The data also underscored the difference in rollout timing. Solana funds launched earlier because issuers completed their filings faster during the government shutdown. Hence, XRP’s performance indicates strong investor interest that continues to build despite the delayed start. Vanguard Adds XRP ETFs to Its Digital Assets Category Vanguard updated its Digital Assets section and included a full lineup of XRP funds. The list features active, index-based, leveraged, and premium-income ETFs. The additions also include products from Bitwise, Franklin Templeton, Canary, CoinShares, ProShares, REX-Osprey, and Amplify. Consequently, retail and institutional clients now gain access to regulated exposure through a single platform. The broad availability suggests growing demand among traditional investors who prefer familiar brokerage channels. Additionally, the variety of fund structures signals deeper market maturity around XRP-based financial products. Price Holds Above Key Support as Analysts Watch $2 Level XRP traded near $2.16 with daily volume above $4.7 billion. Market data showed a 4.70% increase over the past day. Analyst Ali Martinez identified $2 as the key support. He also highlighted $1.20 as the next critical zone. Source: X The chart shows lower highs forming as sellers test momentum. However, buyers continue defending the $2 floor. A rebound above $2.20 may open a path toward $2.40. A drop under $2 may shift attention to the broader $1.80–$1.20 demand region. Conclusion XRP continues to attract significant capital as ETF inflows strengthen across major platforms. Vanguard’s decision to list multiple XRP products adds another layer of support. Hence, the combination of strong demand, expanded access, and key technical levels places XRP in a decisive phase. The coming sessions will show whether buyers can hold the $2 zone and maintain the positive trend.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,ETH|SOL|XRP|MACROECONOMICS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-12-03 15:43:33

Improving momentum indicators support the move — but traders are urging caution as rising leverage across derivatives markets threatens to amplify volatility. Powered by Outset PR , this analysis reflects the agency’s commitment to strategic, data-backed communication in the crypto industry. Outset PR helps Web3 brands amplify their narrative and convert momentum into measurable outcomes. ETH Breaks Trendline and Flips Momentum Indicators Bullish Ethereum’s reclaim of $3,000 comes after a notable technical shift. ETH cleanly broke above a descending trendline that had capped upside since early Q3, suggesting momentum is turning. Key indicators reinforced the breakout: MACD histogram flipped positive (+33.26), showing renewed bullish momentum. RSI at 44 indicates ETH has room to run before nearing overbought conditions. Buyers also defended the $2,800 support zone during a brief mid-day dip, signaling strong demand from spot traders. Record-High Leverage Ratio Raises a Red Flag Despite the bullish turn, the derivative markets are flashing a warning. Binance’s ETH leverage ratio hit 0.57, its highest level ever recorded as noticed by CryptoOnchain . Elevated leverage often represents crowded positioning — typically from aggressive short-term speculators — and creates conditions for sudden liquidation cascades. As ETH approaches tighter resistance zones, this leverage imbalance increases the risk of sharp intraday volatility. ETH Key Levels Two zones now anchor Ethereum’s near-term outlook: • Resistance — $3,055 (EMA cluster) ETH must clear this level to convert the breakout into a structured uptrend. • Support — $2,800 The trendline retest held here. Losing $2,800 would invalidate the recent bullish shift. How Outset PR Leverages a Data-Driven Approach to Crypto Storytelling As Ethereum’s price structure shifts, so does the narrative environment around ETH — and this is where Outset PR has distinguished itself. Founded by crypto PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, Outset PR approaches communications like a hands-on workshop, crafting narratives that align with market momentum rather than relying on generic outreach. What sets the agency apart is its data-first methodology, powered by its internal intelligence suite Outset Data Pulse . This system tracks media trendlines, sentiment cycles, and traffic distribution patterns to determine the exact timing and angles that give a client’s message the highest possible lift. A central tool within this workflow is the agency’s proprietary Syndication Map, which identifies which publications consistently trigger downstream syndication across crypto aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns routinely achieve multi-layered visibility, often reaching up higher exposure of the initial placement as stories propagate through secondary channels. By connecting market events — such as key technical shifts in ETH — with timing-optimized storytelling, Outset PR ensures that every campaign is market-fit, narrative-aligned, and delivered precisely when the audience is most receptive. ETH Price Outlook Ethereum’s move above $3,000 is technically encouraging, backed by a MACD reversal and fresh demand from spot buyers. But with leverage at record highs, the rally remains sensitive to abrupt reversals. Should the price break above $3,055, the momentum will likely extend. On the flip side, breaking below $2,800 would invalidate the current uptrend. ETH’s next move will likely be shaped by the tug-of-war between improving technicals and a leveraged market structure that could either accelerate gains or magnify losses.

Volume nearly doubled in two days, @Lighter_xyz took the lead in daily flows, and traders rotated aggressively across chains. This mix usually appears before major moves — engagement is back. #MarketWatch pic.twitter.com/3sJArpAqsf — Outset PR (@OutsetPR) December 3, 2025 While trading flows expanded across multiple chains, the increase did not translate into higher market exposure, pointing to a shift in trader behavior. A sudden jump in leverage demand Perpetual futures volume often serves as a real-time indicator of speculative behavior. When traders increase position sizes, rotate capital across venues, or try to capture short-term volatility, the perps market responds immediately. A two-day move from $28 billion to $51 billion signals that traders are increasing leverage, betting on larger price swings. Expectations of volatility are rising, whether from macro catalysts or crypto-native events. Even without a major headline trigger, a jump of this magnitude shows the market is again willing to take directional risk. Lighter Chain takes the lead with an $11B a day The surge wasn’t concentrated in a single platform. Instead, it spread across the top three perp DEXs, each posting unusually high daily volumes. Lighter Chain led with over $11 billion in trading volume — a notable milestone for a platform that has rapidly gained traction among high-frequency traders and liquidity providers. Hyperliquid followed closely with around $10 billion, reaffirming its position as a top venue for active derivatives traders. Aster recorded over $9 billion, underscoring how quickly liquidity is fragmenting across newer ecosystems. This rotation suggests that traders are becoming more fluid in how they allocate short-term liquidity. Execution speed, fee structures, and incentive programs appear to be driving rapid venue switching rather than long-term shifts in user allegiance. How Outset PR Leverages Data-Driven Approach in Crypto PR Outset PR connects market events with meaningful storytelling through a data-driven methodology rarely seen in the crypto communications space. Founded by PR strategist Mike Ermolaev, the agency approaches each campaign like a hands-on workshop—building narratives that align with market momentum instead of relying on generic coverage or templated outreach. Beyond just monitoring on-chain flows, Outset PR monitors the media trendlines and traffic distribution through the lens of its proprietary Outset Data Pulse intelligence to determine when a client’s message will achieve the highest lift. This analysis informs the choice of media outlets, the angle of each pitch, and the timing of publication. A key part of the agency’s workflow comes from its proprietary Syndication Map , an internal analytics system that identifies which publications deliver the strongest downstream syndication across aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and Binance Square. Because of this approach, Outset PR campaigns frequently achieve visibility several times higher than their initial placements, with well-positioned stories reaching up to tenfold exposure as they circulate through secondary channels. Outset PR ensures that each campaign is market-fit and tailored to deliver maximum relevance at the moment the audience is most receptive. A turning point or a temporary spike? The derivatives market is showing the early signs of re-engagement: rising volume, cross-chain liquidity rotation, and elevated short-term positioning. The central question is whether this surge marks the beginning of a sustained trend or a short-lived volatility window. Historically, when cumulative perps volume expands this quickly, it often precedes large price movements in spot markets — either continuation rallies or sharp corrections. Understanding these dynamics and aligning messaging with them is increasingly important not only for analysts and traders, but also for crypto teams navigating a fast-moving information environment. Data-led approaches, such as those used by Outset PR, may become essential as the industry shifts toward more measurable and market-responsive communications.

55305368,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/top-altcoins-to-buy-before-2025-christmas-rally-starts,1764777112,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/104/55305368.jpeg,Top Altcoins to Buy Before 2025 Christmas Rally Starts,https://bitzo.com/2025/12/top-altcoins-to-buy-before-2025-christmas-rally-starts,"The holiday season often brings a surge in crypto market activity as liquidity narrows, sentiment improves, and traders position for potential upside. With the 2025 Christmas rally approaching, several altcoins are already flashing early strength. Reactor ($REACT) , XRP, and KAS stand out as leading candidates for investors looking to enter before momentum accelerates. 1. Reactor (REACT) — Most Undervalued Altcoin Ahead of the Santa Rally Reactor continues to gain traction as one of the most practical and feature-rich platforms in DeFi. Its token, $REACT, powers a trading ecosystem designed to simplify the fragmented world of decentralized finance. The platform consolidates spot execution, perpetual DEX trading, memecoin discovery, and multi-protocol yield inside a single, professional-grade interface — something retail and pro traders have been seeking for years. $REACT also benefits from a demand-driven token model. As platform usage grows, commission revenue fuels buy-backs and token burns, tightening supply over time. Early buyers still have the advantage of a 66% presale discount, boosted staking rewards (10% → 28%), and priority access to new tools and partner drops. Nearly 10 million tokens are already sold — showing accelerating demand ahead of the rally. With real utility, an active user base, and a strong value loop, REACT is the leading altcoin to watch heading into Christmas 2025. Buying Now Means Securing $REACT at the Best Price Before Demand Rises 2. XRP — Momentum Turns Positive, but Key Resistance Ahead XRP is beginning to recover after a volatile period, breaking above both its 7-day SMA at $2,18 and the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $2,22. These signals indicate a shift in short-term trend strength, supported by a technical signal: the MACD histogram flipped positive (+0,012753) for the first time since November 25. This MACD crossover is a buy signal, which explains the recent pickup in volume. However, XRP still faces a major hurdle at the 200-day EMA near $2,61, a level that shapes the broader trend. If XRP can maintain support at $2,14, bulls may attempt another push toward higher levels. A breakdown, however, risks a retest of the $2,06 support zone. For now, XRP enters December with improving momentum but must clear its long-term resistance to confirm a sustained rally. 3. KAS — Bullish Structure Intact as Price Pushes Against Resistance Kaspa is quietly strengthening, with its price climbing to $0,0566 and breaking above both the 7-day SMA ($0,05636) and the 30-day EMA ($0,0512). This alignment confirms a short-to-mid-term bullish structure. The RSI(14) at 55,8 reinforces the move — it reflects solid buying pressure without drifting into overbought territory, giving KAS room for further upside. The challenge now lies at the 23,6% Fibonacci level ($0,0555). This resistance has capped recent attempts to continue higher. A clean breakout would set the stage for a more decisive push, while rejection could briefly slow the trend. Even with this resistance overhead, KAS enters the Christmas rally window with favorable technical conditions and a solid trend foundation. Final Thoughts The Christmas rally often rewards assets that combine real utility, strong momentum, and supportive technical structures. REACT leads thanks to an active platform, revenue-driven tokenomics, and high-value presale access. XRP is showing its first meaningful momentum shift in weeks, with algorithmic traders turning bullish. KAS maintains a clean upward structure and sits just below a level that could unlock further gains. For traders positioning ahead of late-December volatility, these three altcoins offer some of the most compelling setups for 2025’s holiday season.

The calculation accounts for the projected expansion of the two sectors that rely heavily on energy-hungry computing hardware. Both are becoming increasingly important for Russia, as it’s trying to keep up in AI development while exploiting mining as an alternative income source under sanctions. AI data centers and crypto farms expected to double their power usage Electricity consumption of facilities engaged in the minting of digital currencies and artificial intelligence (AI) applications will reach 2% of Russia’s total by 2030, according to Vitaly Sergeychuk, member of the Management Board of VTB Bank. That represents a 2.5-fold increase, despite a decline in the overall growth of power usage in the country to just 1% this year, noted the executive of the majority state-owned banking institution, the second-largest in the Russian Federation. Sergeychuk was speaking at the ongoing “Russia Calling!” investment forum in Moscow. Quoted by the business daily Kommersant, he pointed out that Russia will have to build new generation capacities to prevent energy shortages and ensure a stable supply. The necessary capital expenditures for that purpose have been estimated at 6 trillion rubles (over $77 billion), the banker highlighted during his participation in the international event . Russia’s main electricity consumers in the future will be data centers powering AI, industrial production facilities, housing construction, and other sectors, he elaborated. Russian data centers now burn at least 1 gigawatt of electricity According to official data quoted by Sergey Sasim, director of the Center for Electric Power Research at the Higher School of Economics, the energy consumption of data centers in Russia currently amounts to 1 gigawatt (GW) and is expected to reach 2.5 GW by 2030, or 1.3% of the total. Other estimates already put their consumption at 1.5 – 2 GW of the installed capacities, and some forecasts indicate it will increase to 3 – 4 GW over the same period. Sasim remarked that at the moment, AI occupies only around 4 to 8% of the full computing power. Although its share may eventually jump to 10 – 15%, he is convinced that’s not going to be the main driver of higher consumption, but rather the general development of the IT sector. The expert also suggested that the 6 trillion rubles figure pitched by the VTB executive is overstated, as this would amount to over 17.5% of all Russian investments in the new generation. Yuri Shvydchenko, director of technology practice at TeDo, agreed with Sasim, adding that the current size of the data-center market of less than 200 billion rubles (a little over $2.5 billion) is insufficient to cover the costs of the necessary power generation capacity. Konstantin Stepanov, director of data center development at RTK-DC, quoted stats from the International Energy Agency, according to which data centers consume approximately 1 – 1.5% of the globally produced electricity, projecting their share to reach 4% by the end of the decade. Russia’s computing power concentrated in Moscow Few companies in Russia are currently capable of creating specialized clusters for AI computing and ensuring their operation under high loads, noted Ilya Mikhailov, director of data centers at Selectel. Another issue is their high concentration in and around Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city. About 80% of the 200 data centers running in Russia now are located in the capital and the adjacent region. Obtaining permission to connect to the grid may take years in some cases. Crypto mining companies often use their services to mint digital coins. Russia legalized their business last year to exploit its competitive advantages in terms of energy resources and cool climates. However, power shortages have led to restrictions on activity in about a dozen regions. The Russian government has already indicated it leans toward prioritizing AI development over crypto mining, despite the growing role of the latter as a source of income for its sanctioned economy, and even banning the use of data centers for mining purposes.

Late December often brings renewed risk appetite, thinner order books, and short-term momentum that pushes high-performing assets higher. As the biggest rally of 2025 approaches, three assets stand out for traders positioning early: Reactor (REACT) , Sui (SUI), and Chainlink (LINK). 1. Reactor (REACT): Most Undervalued Opportunity Heading Into the Rally Reactor is live, trading, and gaining traction fast — not based on promises, but on actual usage. Its token, $REACT, sits at the center of the Reactor ecosystem, a terminal that consolidates spot trading, perpetual DEX execution, memecoin discovery, and multi-protocol yield into one coherent interface. As the platform expands, early buyers can still access $REACT at a 66% discount before listing. Nearly 10 million tokens are already sold, signaling strong demand. Buying Now Means Securing $REACT at the Best Price Before Demand Rises What Makes $REACT Stand Out Reactor solves a common problem in DeFi: fragmented tools. Instead of juggling tabs and wallets, users get a single, professional-grade environment: Swap Interface — Smart routing through hundreds of liquidity sources to secure the best execution on spot trades. Perpetuals Dashboard — Real-time PnL tracking, leverage tools, and access to unique dynamic perpetual markets unavailable on other platforms. Vaults Hub — A unified yield-farming experience that pulls in tokens the moment they launch, lets users compare yields, and collects all reward streams in one place. Why REACT Is Selling Out Fast $REACT is a utility token with direct economic ties to Reactor’s growth. As more traders use the Terminal, the platform’s commission revenue increases. That revenue fuels buy-backs and token burns, gradually reducing supply and strengthening long-term value. Presale buyers receive meaningful advantages: Reduced fees (down to 0%) Staking APY boosted from 10% to 28% Early access to all new apps on the platform Priority entry for new pools, partner drops, and allowlists Early entry here means securing $REACT at the best price before demand accelerates — a key advantage ahead of the Santa rally. $REACT Presale Given a Chance to Lock In 66% Early-Bird Discount 2. SUI: Breakout Structure Aligns with Holiday Momentum SUI’s technical picture flipped bullish after it pushed through the $1.80 resistance and invalidated a prolonged downtrend. The 4-hour chart printed a falling-wedge breakout, supported by strong momentum signals. RSI: 57,76 — rising but not overbought MFI: 84,14 — strong capital inflows Key support reclaimed: 61,8% Fibonacci at $1.71 This structural shift sparked short covering and FOMO-driven buying, with traders eyeing the next major target at $2.04, aligned with the 23,6% Fibonacci retracement. If SUI holds above the $1.71–$1.80 zone, the setup remains constructive, and seasonal liquidity patterns could amplify the move. 3. LINK: Momentum Reversal Positions It for a Strong December Chainlink is stabilizing after weeks of downside, reclaiming important short-term levels. LINK broke above both its 7-day SMA ($13,07) and the 38,2% Fibonacci retracement at $15,35, signaling that sellers are losing control. Momentum indicators confirm the shift: RSI14: 46,59 — recovering from oversold MACD histogram: +0,17 — positive for the first time in days The breakout drove traders toward the $14,60 zone (50% Fib), which now acts as support. The next resistance sits at $16,22, last tested in November. A breakout there would reinforce a broader trend reversal. With LINK historically responding well to increased year-end speculation, the setup aligns with typical Santa rally dynamics. Conclusion The approaching Santa rally tends to reward assets with strong momentum and real catalysts. REACT offers utility, revenue-driven tokenomics, and a still-undervalued presale entry. SUI is breaking out of a bearish structure with clear upside targets. LINK is turning bullish after reclaiming key technical levels. For traders positioning early, these three assets offer compelling setups as 2025’s year-end momentum begins to build. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

It is the latest spurt after 250% growth and several analysts believe that this phase might be within its last few days. Most investors that monitor the leading crypto opportunities feel that this project might be on a significant window before it makes another price rise. Presale Development and Major Indicators Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has started one of the quickest nascent ascends of the year. The token was released at the beginning of 2025 at a price of $0.01. It has currently gone up to $0.035, which indicates a gradual 250% growth, prior to the initial version of the protocol coming online. The protocol has raised over $19.1 million and over 18,300 holders on the project. Early buyers have purchased more than 810 million tokens. Of the total 4 billion MUTM supply, 1.82 billion tokens are given out in presale. Much of that allocation has since been spent and Phase 6 has already reached 96% completion. The official issue price of the token will be $0.06, which according to analysts leaves the opportunity of early recognition on the upside after the opening of markets. Such swift development has thrown Mutuum Finance into the debate concerning some of the potential most suitable crypto to purchase currently within the emerging DeFi industry. What Mutuum Finance Is Constructing Mutuum Finance is preparing a lending protocol that is created on the basis of user activity on chains. The system gives users the option to lend and get yield on mtTokens. By providing such assets such as ETH or USDT, the individual receives the mtTokens which gain value when the borrowers pay up the interest. This forms a natural APY through protocol usage. The project is also of buy-and-distribute form. Part of the lending revenue will be used to buy MUTM in the open market. The acquired tokens are given to the users who deposit the mtTokens to the safety module. Analysts indicate that such a system favors long term buying pressure. Security is one area where there has been great emphasis. Mutuum Finance has passed CertiK audit with 90/100 certificate score on TOK Scan, and Halborn Security inspects the entire lending contract set. To point out code problems in time, there is a $50K bug bounty. Roadmap Milestones Mutuum Finance is planning to launch a USD pegged stablecoin with minting and burning according to demand. The interest charged to borrowers will preserve its support. According to analysts, stablecoins could be significant in enhancing liquidity by scaling and in expanding lending markets. It is also critical that it is accurately priced. Chainlink price feeds, backup oracles, aggregated pricing data, and on-chain information of DEX will be used in the project when reference point ETFs are liquid. As a stablecoin gains momentum, and using a secure oracle infrastructure, many top crypto investors believe the token could gain 400% to 700% growth during the first significant bull market with borrowing being high upon basis. V1 Testnet and Whale Momentum On its official X account , Mutuum Finance stated that the V1 testnet is scheduled to go live in Q4 2025 on Sepolia network. The initial one contains the liquidity pool, mtTokens, the debt-tracking model and the liquidator bot where ETH and USDT are the main assets supported. Investor momentum has been increasing as V1 approaches. The current phase 6 still has 4% of its allocation, and according to analysts, the final phase runs quicker than previous sections. Customers would be inclined to rush when the supply starts to run away. Even more focus was given to the project with a recent whale entry of $110K. Big buys frequently reflect the assurance of the high value investors and are likely to generate the momentum of the others sharing in the smaller amounts. This stage can seem shorter than previously guessed, with allocation becoming smaller, and the launch of the V1 in sight, traders who monitor new opportunities in crypto indicate that these are the days of change. Mutuum Finance has gone up 250% having over 18,300 holders, raised $19.1 million and moved to 96% Phase 6 allocation. Having a dual lending architecture, mtToken yield, a buy-and-distribute revenue model, strong audits, stablecoin plans, and an upcoming V1 launch, several analysts say that the project can become one of the most significant early-stage DeFi tokens in 2026.

55305642,639033,1764777621,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55305642.jpeg,Ripple Reveals How It’s Hijacking A $16 Trillion Industry Using The XRP Ledger,https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-a-16-trillion-industry/,"Crypto firm Ripple has revealed how it is capturing the projected $16 trillion tokenization industry by onboarding several institutions onto the XRP Ledger (XRPL) . The firm alluded to security and how its custody service is helping solve this issue. Ripple Comments On How It Is Capturing The Tokenization Industry Using XRP Ledger In an X post , Ripple indicated that it has managed to capture some of the projected $16 trillion industry onto the XRP Ledger through the adequate security it provides institutions. The crypto firm stated that it provides a security environment that mirrors the rigor of the banks it serves, combining HSM with FIPS-certified hardware to deliver security that scales. That way, they can protect assets without sacrificing operational speed. Ripple further noted that legitimate integration with the global financial system requires verification. That is why they adhere to SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 standards , ensuring that the infrastructure of these institutions that tokenize on the XRP Ledger is compliant with necessary regulations. Commenting on this, Ripple’s Head of Information Security, Akshay Wattal, said that in crypto, security isn’t a feature but the foundation of institutional trust. He added that effective custody requires in-depth architecture, battle-tested cryptography, and the governance rigor of a global financial institution. Notably, Ripple provides custody solutions to global banks, including BBVA, SG Fogre, DBS Bank, and DZ Bank. However, these banks are yet to tokenize on the XRP Ledger even as institutions move to tap into this $16 trillion industry. The crypto firm continues to propose several ways to onboard these institutions onto the network. One of Ripple’s proposals is the introduction of Confidential Multi-Purpose Tokens (MPTs) on the XRP Ledger in order to provide privacy for these institutions. The company’s developer, Ayo Akinyele, also recently proposed native XRP staking on the network, which could compel these institutions to build on XRPL, as they can earn yields while doing so. Progress On Other Sides Of Its Business In addition to its custody service, Ripple is also making progress in other areas of its operations, which also drives value to the XRP Ledger. The company announced yesterday that it had partnered with fintech company RedotPay, which has integrated Ripple Payments to launch a crypto conversion feature for Nigerian users. The development also provides a huge boost for XRP, which will be one of the supported assets on RedotPay’s “Send Crypto, Receive NGN” feature.

This Price Level Could Be The Tell,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/is-the-dogecoin-bottom-in-this-price-level/,"Dogecoin is staging a sharp rebound from a key technical level that one analyst has flagged as the potential low of its current correction. Is The Dogecoin Bottom In? On X, crypto analyst Kevin (@Kev_Capital_TA) highlighted the $0.138 region as the decisive line. Posting a weekly DOGE chart, he wrote: “$0.138 still holding strong on Dogecoin. If DOGE can hold this level (Macro .382 + 200W SMA) and BTC + USDT hold their respective support and resistance levels then $0.138 will be the lows for this corrective period. Still got work to do. Main focus is still BTC and USDT D.” His chart shows Dogecoin trading on the 1-week timeframe, with the price recently wicking down into a dense support cluster around $0.138 and rebounding. That area coincides with the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement of the prior advance, explicitly marked “0.382 (0.13827),” and the rising 200-week simple moving average that has now climbed into the same zone. Furthermore, this area coincides with an upward trendline that has guided DOGE’s price action since mid-2023; a decisive break below it would be technically fatal. Related Reading: Here’s The Bullish Trend Developing To Trigger A 174% Move For The Dogecoin Price The bounce has been visible on lower timeframes as well. DOGE traded as low as $0.13443 yesterday before surging to $0.152 today, gaining more than 13% at the intraday high. Kevin has been emphasizing this level for weeks. On November 22 he told followers: “$0.138 is massive support on Dogecoin folks. You really do not want to see that lost on 3D-1W closes. Obviously BTC’s performance will be the determiner to that outcome so focus there first along with USDT D.” In his framework, the integrity of the DOGE support cluster is inseparable from Bitcoin’s higher-timeframe structure and stablecoin flows. The macro background is shifting in his favor. Yesterday Bitcoin rebounded from $86,184 to $92,307, extended to $93,958 today and is currently around $92,816. Commenting on BTC, Kevin noted: “A close above $91K on the 3D-1W candle supports the idea that the counter trend rally is beginning in my BTC corrective phase reversal zone. One day doesn’t make a trend let’s see what we can do.” Related Reading: Market Downturn Hits Dogecoin Hard: Is a Larger Correction on the Horizon? That statement builds on his November 25 outlook, where he argued that the corrective phase he has been tracking since August–September on BTC and the “Total 2” altcoin index is nearing completion. “There will be a bottom formed and a counter trend rally in the coming weeks on BTC and Altcoins,” he wrote, adding that “the corrective phase is almost over” but still needs “a little more time to form a proper bottom.” Kevin’s DOGE chart maps the alternatives clearly. Above, horizontal resistance near the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement sits around $0.19, while lower support is marked at the 0.236 retracement near $0.093 alongside longer-term trendlines. Whether $0.138 becomes the definitive bottom of Dogecoin’s correction depends on two conditions Kevin keeps repeating: DOGE must continue to hold the macro 0.382 plus 200-week SMA and the uptrend line on 3-day to weekly closes, and Bitcoin must confirm its own counter-trend rally with sustained higher-timeframe strength. For now, the market has made its tell clear. The answer to whether the Dogecoin bottom is in starts—and potentially ends—at $0.138. At press time, Dogecoin traded at $0.14976.

Market watchers are eager to see if this could lead Dogecoin out of its current trading pattern. This article explores the potential for growth and examines which other coins might be poised to rise. Dogecoin Sees Calm with Potential for Gains Amid Resistance Levels Source: tradingview Dogecoin's price is currently between a little over 14 to nearly 15.5 cents. It's been a bumpy ride with prices dropping about one-fifth in the last month. However, growth prospects are there. The price is approaching a notable resistance level at just over 16 cents. If it breaks this, it could aim for nearly 17.5 cents, marking a potential increase of around 13%. With the ten-day moving average higher than the 100-day, it hints at short-term upward potential. While the price has dipped recently, the current movement shows a chance for recovery if it can overcome these barriers. Conclusion The update has brought a surge of interest. DOGE has long been in a tight range, but this new development could be a game-changer. Investors are watching closely to see if this will propel DOGE to new levels. Market sentiment and response will play crucial roles in this potential breakout. However, the true impact remains to be seen, and the coming days will be crucial for DOGE.

As markets brace for sweeping structural changes, a growing number of investors believe XRP could be on the verge of a major breakout. In a recent clip, crypto commentator CryptoSensei argued that we are entering a narrow window where blockchain infrastructure might reshape global finance, and that XRP could emerge as one of the main bridge currencies in that transformation. XRPL Is Evolving Beyond Hype XRPL is no longer just a legacy blockchain. Its ecosystem is rapidly maturing. In 2024–2025, XRPL welcomed a wave of high‑quality stablecoins, including RLUSD, USDC, and others. That expansion signals growing trust from users and institutions alike. With RLUSD live on both XRPL and Ethereum, XRPL now supports compliance‑focused assets. The stablecoin has become crucial to XRPL’s deeper value proposition: liquidity, fast settlement, and multi-asset support. GET READY NOW!!! #XRP PRICE EXPLOSION MAY BE COMING SOON!!! pic.twitter.com/zisQvSPkGw — CryptoSensei (@Crypt0Senseii) December 2, 2025 Thanks to XRPL’s built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), Automated Market Maker (AMM) protocol, and advanced token‑issuance support, tokenized real‑world assets (RWAs) and stablecoins can now flow through XRPL with institutional‑grade performance. Price Driver: Utility, Not Speculation If XRPL becomes a global settlement layer, XRP’s native role could regain significance. As liquidity and transaction volume grow, demand for XRP as a bridge currency, settlement token, and liquidity source could increase substantially. RLUSD’s growth is already visible. On XRPL alone, RLUSD became its largest stablecoin by market cap early in 2025. As institutions adopt XRPL for stablecoins, real‑world assets, and cross‑border liquidity, XRP could transition from speculative asset to critical infrastructure token. That transition could force revaluation over time. Realistic Challenges and Market Constraints Even with XRPL’s technical upgrades and token‑economy growth, obstacles remain. Adoption remains modest compared to giants like USDC or USDT, which still dominate stablecoin volumes globally. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Moreover, even if XRPL usage grows, converting that to astronomical price targets, such as $1,000 or $10,000 per XRP, implies an absurdly large network valuation. The total supply of XRP remains very high. Thus, while a bullish narrative is plausible, structural math makes extreme valuations highly improbable without sustained and massive real‑world adoption. What to Watch Over the Next 6–18 Months Watch for four key metrics: Rising stablecoin volume on XRPL (especially RLUSD and USDC), indicating adoption, growth in tokenized assets (RWAs) on XRPL, showing institutional trust, increased trading activity via XRPL’s DEX/AMM, signalling deeper liquidity, and on‑chain data showing XRP as a settlement or bridge asset, not just idle holdings. If these metrics trend upward, XRPL’s transformation could gradually fuel a reappraisal of XRP’s value. Exciting Potential, But No Guarantees CryptoSensei’s argument is powerful. XRPL is no longer fringe technology. It’s evolving into a compliance‑ready, institution‑capable backbone for stablecoins and tokenized assets. That evolution could drive real demand for XRP as a liquidity backbone. However, turning that potential into a massive price explosion requires more than optimism. It demands widespread adoption, regulatory clarity, and consistent network use over the years. For long‑term believers in structural change, XRPL may indeed be worth watching. For those chasing “moon shots,” caution remains wise. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Exploring undervalued digital coins under $1 reveals potential gems waiting for a breakout. This article delves into such promising tokens, ready to pique investor interest and possibly offer substantial returns. Stellar (XLM) Sees Minor Dip, Eyes Potential Gains Source: tradingview Stellar's (XLM) current value hovers between twenty-four and twenty-six cents, slightly below its ten-day moving average. There's a slight weekly growth of about one percent, but the coin has dipped nearly seventeen percent over the past month. Its immediate challenge is overcoming the nearby resistance at nearly twenty-seven cents, with a stronger target just below thirty cents. If XLM rallies to the second resistance, it would see an increase nearing fourteen percent from current levels. The coin’s RSI suggests a balanced market, while the stochastic indicator is on the lower side, indicating potential for upward momentum. This sets the stage for possible growth if market interest picks up. VeChain's Potential Rebound Amidst Recent Fluctuations Source: tradingview VeChain's price currently sits between just over one cent and nearly one and a half cents. After a recent dip, VeChain faces its nearest resistance at over one and a half cents, suggesting potential for a modest rally. If it breaks this, it could climb to nearly two cents, a rise of about 30% from its current range. With its 10-day moving average higher than its 100-day, it indicates a short-term bullish trend. Though it dropped by a tiny bit over the last week and about ten percent over a month, the relative strength index hints at potential growth without being overbought. Investors are watching closely as the market looks for signs of a rebound. Hedera (HBAR) Battles to Break Resistance, Eyes Strong Recovery Source: tradingview Hedera's price is hovering between 14 to 15 cents, struggling to break past the nearby barrier at 16 cents. If momentum builds, HBAR could test a more substantial resistance at 17 cents, reflecting a potential increase of a few cents from its current range. However, the 14-cent support line may offer some cushion if prices dip. Recent trends show mixed performance; a slight uptick over the past week contrasts with a significant decline this month. The coin's moving averages indicate it is on the rise, yet still far from full strength. Overall, signs suggest HBAR could rally modestly, while patient investors await more decisive bullish trends. Bonk (BONK) Shows Potential Amidst Recent Dip Source: tradingview Bonk's price swings between approximately $0.0000086 and $0.0000103. Despite a recent drop over one-third in six months, it is hovering above its nearest support level of around $0.0000078. The nearest resistance is just above the trading range at about $0.0000112. If Bonk manages to break past this, the next target is close to $0.0000129. This rise could mark an increase of over 20% from its current position. The Relative Strength Index suggests a balanced market, while the Stochastic level hints at some buying interest. Bonk's movement is watched closely as it edges near key thresholds, leaving room for optimism if it gains upward momentum. SPX6900 (SPX) Shows Signs of Recovery Amid Market Volatility Source: tradingview SPX6900 (SPX) is showing some resilience in the crypto market. Currently priced between 53 and 79 cents, it has recently gained over 13% in the past week. This suggests a short-term positive trend. Yet, it remains below its 10-day moving average. Breaking the nearest resistance at 90 cents could see it challenge the next level at $1.16, indicating a potential increase of about 47%. However, the longer-term picture shows a 35% drop over six months. The RSI is stable, hinting at equal buying and selling pressure. With Stochastic at 37.48, there's a possibility of upward momentum if market conditions feel right. Conclusion XLM, VET, HBAR, BONK, and SPX offer solid investment opportunities under $1. XLM is known for fast and low-cost transactions. VET focuses on supply chain management. HBAR provides high transaction speeds and security. BONK and SPX have unique use cases that attract attention. These coins could be promising due to their current low prices and strong potentials. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

The network’s release will provide native staking and yield opportunities for Ripple’s native token. According to a press release sent to CryptoPotato, Firelight’s services will include an on-chain economic security primitive designed to protect DeFi assets from exploits. Firelight to Introduce XRP Staking The launch of Firelight will come in two phases. The first will allow XRP holders to deposit their assets into vaults and receive stXRP, a 1:1, fully backed ERC-20 liquid token that is transferable and can be used across the Flare DeFi ecosystem. Flare is an interoperability blockchain that allows smart contracts to access data across other chains and the internet. On Flare, market participants can use stXRP to swap on decentralized exchanges, as collateral in lending pools, or in contributing to liquidity pools. Depositing XRP in Firelight’s launch vault will also qualify users to earn Firelight Points. In the first few hours after launch, Firelight’s vault has attracted more than $4.2 billion worth of tokens as per the official site. During the second phase of the launch, Firelight will attain its sole purpose – allocating capital deployed by staking their XRP to back a DeFi cover mechanism. This ensures the protocol sustains real demand to provide rewards for stakers. “Firelight aims to add a new layer of value for XRP by providing a staking layer that utilizes the staked XRP for providing on-chain cover. This cover can be contracted by DeFi protocols to safeguard asset value in case of hacks and exploits,” the Firelight team stated. Taking a Security-first Approach Notably, Firelight is taking a security-first approach for its launch and the introduction of XRP staking capabilities. The protocol is backed by the blockchain solutions platform Sentora (formerly IntoTheBlock) and Flare. Sentora serves as the technical service provider, while Flare provides a bridge to connect XRP to the DeFi ecosystem. Ripple backs both Flare and Sentora as they share a commitment to expand DeFi capabilities for XRP. Additionally, Firelight has undergone three audits to ensure maximum compliance with security protocols. The chain was audited by the leading security platforms, OpenZeppelin and Coinspect, and by a bug bounty program supported by Immunifi. “Their combined expertise in secure interoperability, protocol design, and network operations provides Firelight with deep technical support and a clear path for long-term ecosystem growth—so XRP holders and developers can build, secure, and scale real-world applications with confidence,” the Firelight team added.

Cryptocurrency ETF issuer 21Shares announced today the launch of two new ETPs for Ethena (ENA) and Morpho (MORPHO), providing investors with access to the best decentralized finance (DeFi) infrastructure, according to an official statement. Two new ETPs, 21Shares Ethena ETP (EENA) and 21Shares Morpho ETP (MORPH), are now listed on major European exchanges such as the SIX Swiss Exchange, Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Paris. Both ETPs support trading in US dollars (USD) and euros (EUR). Mandy Chiu, Head of Global Product Development at 21shares, said: “These launches reflect our commitment to providing institutional-grade access to the most innovative areas of digital finance. Ethena and Morpho represent two of the most significant advancements in on-chain financial infrastructure; one addressing the global dollar market and the other redefining decentralized credit.

The digital asset now trades below $93,000, having dropped 32% from its peak of over $126,000. Multiple warning signals flash red across the market, including record ETF withdrawals and declining whale positions. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $92,570, representing a 1.88% increase over the last 24 hours. BTC price chart, Source: CoinMarketCap The exchange recommends traders avoid attempting to catch falling prices. Instead, Coinbase suggests waiting for confirmed breakout patterns before entering positions. This guidance arrives as Bitcoin falls beneath its 200-day moving average, a threshold that typically supports bull market momentum. Source: X Market data reveals a cluster of negative factors pressuring prices downward. Digital asset treasury valuations have compressed significantly. Whale distribution patterns indicate large holders are reducing exposure. ETF outflows have reached unprecedented levels in November 2025. Technical Breakdown Leaves No Safety Net Bitcoin has breached every major support zone that previously stabilized prices during rallies. The asset now sits below the short-term holder cost basis, meaning recent buyers face losses. The 75% profit threshold that had historically provided support has failed to hold. The $98,000 to $100,000 range collapsed without meaningful resistance. This zone represented a dense cluster of holders who acquired positions at those levels. The rapid decline in this area demonstrates weak buying interest. Source: Coinbase Realized losses have spiked to levels not seen since the FTX collapse in November 2022. Short-term holders face mounting pressure to exit positions rather than endure further drawdowns. This capitulation risk intensifies as underwater positions accumulate. Below $90,000, cost-basis distribution thins considerably. The swift drop through the $85,000 to $90,000 band revealed minimal organic demand to absorb selling pressure. Options traders now pay premiums for downside protection instead of positioning for gains. The Bull-Bear Index has turned negative across short and medium-term periods. Long-dated options remain near neutral levels, suggesting uncertainty rather than conviction in either direction. Long-term holders have shifted to net negative positions over the past 30 days. Market intelligence firm Arkham identified one early Bitcoin whale who liquidated an entire 11,000 BTC position. The sale, valued at approximately $1.3 billion, took place between late October and November.

55308050,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=872317,1764781200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/55308050.jpeg,It’s Not Just Hype: This Crypto Offers Real Yields and Millionaire Potential,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/its-not-just-hype-this-crypto-offers-real-yields-and-millionaire-potential/,"The cryptocurrency sector in 2025 is marked by a decisive shift toward tokenized real-world assets (RWAs). Projects like RentStac (RNS) , which connect blockchain to the residential rental market, are emerging amid growing institutional interest. The focus is on generating verifiable passive income, moving the narrative beyond pure speculation toward real cash flows distributed via smart contracts. This trend is relevant in 2025 due to the search for stability and sustainable yield. The prevailing discussion centers on obtaining returns anchored to real-world economies, such as rental income, through transparent on-chain infrastructure. The Institutional Context and Tokenization Interest in tokenization extends beyond well-known names. Institutions like the World Bank have issued digital bonds for sustainable projects, while financial services firms like Goldman Sachs are exploring platforms to tokenize traditional assets. The Singapore Exchange (SGX) has also initiated partnerships to issue native digital financial instruments. This institutional activity provides a framework of credibility and directs capital toward blockchain infrastructure for practical financial use cases, creating fertile ground for projects specializing in niches like real estate. RentStac and the Tokenized Real Estate Model RentStac positions itself in this market by applying RWA principles to the residential rental sector. Its structure is based on using a dedicated Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) for each property, which holds the legal title. Ownership rights in the SPV are then tokenized, enabling fractional ownership. Smart contracts automate the distribution of rental income. The model is non-custodial, with distinct roles for investors, property managers, and validators. The native RNS token has a total supply of 2 billion. The Presale Structure and Bonus Calculation A public presale for the RNS token is currently underway at a price of $0.025. For purchases above $1,000, a 50% bonus is applied to the token allocation. Furthermore, for an investment of $1,500, participants are entered into a draw for a chance to win a $250,000 prize. An investment of $1,000, with the 50% bonus, results in the acquisition of 60,000 tokens (40,000 base tokens + 20,000 bonus tokens). The effective average cost per token therefore drops to approximately $0.01667. Analysis of Potential Appreciation Achieving a theoretical portfolio valuation of $1 million depends on the future appreciation of the token. With 60,000 tokens acquired for $1,000, the token price would need to rise to approximately $16.67 to reach the million-dollar mark ($1,000,000 / 60,000 ≈ $16.67). Compared to the presale price of $0.025, this represents an increase of roughly 666 times. Some analysts note that in earlier presale stages with higher bonuses, a smaller investment could theoretically have led to the same objective. For instance, with a past hypothetical 100% bonus, a $12,500 investment could have provided 1,000,000 tokens ($12,500 / $0.025 = 500,000 tokens, plus 500,000 bonus tokens). In that scenario, the token would have needed to reach $1 for a $1 million valuation. With the current structure (50% bonus), to obtain 1,000,000 tokens at an effective average cost of $0.01667, an investment of approximately $16,670 would be required today. Some sector analysts believe projects with sustainable RWA models could see gradual revaluation. External forecasts exist that hypothesize a price target of $1 for RNS by the end of 2026, based on the adoption of its model and its entry onto secondary markets. Such forecasts are speculative and depend on market factors, operational execution, and demand. The Rationale Behind Asset-Backed Models The attention toward projects like RentStac is linked to the search for economic fundamentals within the crypto sector. RWA models anchor a token’s potential value to physical assets and existing cash flows, offering an investment narrative distinct from purely digital assets. The transparency in revenue distribution and the legal structure of SPVs are seen as elements that could reduce perceived risk and attract capital interested in stable, long-term yield. Future Outlook for the Sector Growth in the RWA segment appears set to continue, driven by both innovation and institutional interest. The success of niches like tokenized real estate will depend on the ability to offer an efficient investment experience that is regulatory-compliant and capable of generating competitive returns. While the path for any single project remains uncertain, the general trend toward integrating real-world assets on-chain defines a phase of potential maturation for the entire ecosystem.

55307636,639039,1764781216,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55307636.jpeg,Shiba Inu Dev Alerts FBI After Shibarium Hack Trail Points To KuCoin,https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dev-alerts-fbi-shibarium-hack/,"Shiba Inu’s core development team is escalating its response to the Shibarium bridge exploit after a new on-chain investigation mapped the hacker’s Tornado Cash laundering trail to KuCoin deposit accounts. Reacting to on-chain sleuth Shima (@MRShimamoto) on X, core developer Kaal Dhairya wrote “Great work! This needs to be amplified. I will also ensure it’s sent to the FBI attached to the open investigation report and request Kucoin to cooperate.” Shiba Inu Sleuth Exposes Shibarium Hacker The Shibarium bridge was exploited in mid-September in an attack estimated at around $2.3–$2.4 million , after the perpetrator seized a super-majority of validator keys and withdrew assets including ETH, SHIB and KNINE. K9 Finance DAO, Shibarium’s liquid-staking partner, launched a bounty process that started at 5 ETH, later advanced to a 20 ETH smart-contract offer and ultimately to a final 25 ETH proposal endorsed directly by the Shiba Inu team. The exploiter never accepted, and K9 Finance has since confirmed that the unclaimed ETH in the bounty contract has been returned to contributors, with Shib.io receiving back 20 ETH. In a detailed 1 December thread, Shima said the “Shibarium Bridge hacker foolishly chose not to accept the K9 bounty – it’s finally time to share the investigation we’ve been working on,” describing months of tracing that involved thousands of transactions and 111 wallets. His reconstruction shows 260 ETH flowing from exploit-linked wallets into Tornado Cash, with 232.49 ETH ultimately reaching KuCoin through 48 deposits into 45 unique KuCoin deposit addresses, which he believes are largely operated by money mules rather than the hacker directly. According to his write-up and an accompanying MetaSleuth dashboard, the trail begins with the original exploit address and nine “dumping” wallets. Those wallets received the stolen tokens, liquidated them gradually for ETH over roughly a week, and sent a total of 260 ETH into Tornado Cash. Of that amount, 250 ETH entered the mixer’s 10-ETH pool and 10 ETH the 1-ETH pool in an attempt to break on-chain linkability between the hack and any later withdrawals. The critical breakthrough, Shima says, came about forty days after the exploit. A wallet already tied to the hacker cluster sent exactly 0.0874 ETH to what was intended to be a clean Tornado withdrawal wallet. That minor top-up, he describes as “one stupid mistake” that “completely unravelled their Tornado Cash laundering ,” because it established a direct on-chain connection between the exploit side of the graph and a supposedly anonymous post-mixer address. From that contaminated node he was able to work outward, clustering multiple Tornado withdrawal wallets, intermediaries and final KuCoin “funnel” wallets. Shima reports that each funnel wallet typically routes funds to two KuCoin deposit addresses, creating a final cluster of 45 KuCoin endpoints and roughly two dozen depositors that he argues can be treated as money-mule cash-out accounts. He says the full address list, transaction graph and methodology were first shared privately with the Shibarium team so they could approach law enforcement and KuCoin while any funds remained within reach. However, he recounts that KuCoin’s fraud desk insisted on receiving a formal law-enforcement case number before acting on the evidence. The official ShibariumNet X account has now publicly backed the research: “Thanks to @MRShimamoto for doing all the hard work here to compile this thread. We truly appreciate your diligence and methodical approach. Hopefully this investigation can continue with the help of the proper authorities. The communities need answers.” At press time, Shiba Inu (SHIB) traded at $0.00000878",Shiba Inu|shib|SHIB news|SHIB price|Shiba Inu news|Shiba Inu price|Shibarium|Shibarium Hack,EN,0,0,ETH|EXCHANGE|SHIB|CRYPTOCURRENCY|SECURITY INCIDENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-03 17:00:16

Although XRP is still more than 43% below its all-time high, a market analyst has outlined what needs to happen before the cryptocurrency can rally again. The analyst has shared a rather blunt assessment of XRP’s recent performance, highlighting its vulnerability and weakened price action. XRP Price Rally Hinges On Bitcoin’s Recovery A crypto market expert identified as ‘Guy on Earth’ has issued a fresh warning on X, highlighting that the XRP price is currently sitting at precarious levels and “hanging on for its dear life.” His outlook was cautious as he stated that the cryptocurrency is barely maintaining a crucial monthly bull market support level. Related Reading: Brace For Impact: XRP Price Has Formed A Bullish Cross On Its Weekly Stochastic RSI In his view, a potential XRP price rally now depends on a shift in Bitcoin’s behavior. The analyst explained that the altcoin market has suffered from maximum stress in recent months and will only begin to recover once BTC stages a rebound. He highlighted that the cryptocurrency needs to trigger a recovery rally while its dominance levels decline, giving altcoins enough room to regain former momentum and stage a rally. Without this change in Bitcoin, the pressure on XRP is likely to continue. Recently, BTC climbed roughly 7% and is now trading above $93,000. Within the same period, the XRP price has surged more than 9% to $2.19. This trend highlights a correlation between Bitcoin’s positive price action and XRP’s upward movement. Despite the recovery, Guy on Earth has warned investors and traders to stay realistic and manage their exposure carefully, given the market’s fragile state. His accompanying chart supports this caution. It shows that following a sharp impulse move that pushed XRP into a multi-year high zone, the price has stalled beneath a clear ceiling marked by repeated monthly rejections. Below the price structure, XRP’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) has declined, reflecting fading strength. XRP Price To 10x In 2026 Crypto Super Cycle Presenting a more bullish outlook for XRP, crypto analyst Amonyx has examined its price potential within the broader altcoin market cycle. He suggested that the crypto supercycle in 2026 will be massive. His analysis places XRP at the centre of this bullish expansion, predicting a powerful price surge. Related Reading: Warning: XRP Price Is Forming A Death Cross That Previously Led To A 15% Crash Amonyx shared a chart illustrating three distinct altcoin seasons during past bull market cycles, each marked by explosive performances relative to Bitcoin. The first two cycles show a massive surge followed by prolonged cooldown periods. The current cycle highlights a larger structure, suggesting that the upcoming altcoin season in 2026 could be more powerful than the last two. If this trend holds, the analyst predicts that XRP’s price could skyrocket 10x from its current level of $2.19 to approximately $22.

Their clothes, manners, and conversation all reflect stability and long-term financial success. That’s the impression Jake Claver shares in his recent post aimed at XRP holders. Claver explains that many wealthy individuals are not buying crypto to get richer. They already have substantial wealth. Instead, they view crypto as a hedge — a way to protect their fortunes against economic instability and financial system risks. The Rarity of XRP Ownership XRP holders are far from common. There are roughly 7 million wallets on the XRP Ledger globally. Many of these wallets are small or belong to exchanges, reducing the number of individual owners significantly. You should only have to get rich once So, my buddy's cousin drives Uber in Orlando. Picks up this family from Disney World You can tell immediately they have money. The clothes. The way they carry themselves. He's driving them back to their hotel and he starts catching pieces… pic.twitter.com/5DqdHgemyO — Jake Claver, QFOP (@beyond_broke) December 2, 2025 Only 663 wallets hold over 5 million XRP, highlighting a small, elite group. To be in the top 1% of holders, one needs around 50,637 XRP, worth roughly $114,000 at current prices. Being an XRP holder is rarer than many realize, as Claver emphasizes. Crypto as a Hedge, Not a Gamble Claver’s perspective challenges the mainstream narrative of crypto as a tool for rapid wealth. For him and other high-net-worth investors, crypto serves as insurance. It protects against global financial risks, inflation, and currency devaluation. Wealthy individuals focus on diversification. They spread their holdings across assets to ensure stability. XRP becomes one branch of a financial tree, safeguarding value if other investments falter. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 The Wealth Tree Metaphor Claver uses the metaphor of a tree to describe wealth. Planting seeds represents early investments. Nurturing them over the years builds a strong trunk — the core portfolio. As the trunk grows, branches form. These represent diversification, shielding wealth from potential losses. Fruit-bearing branches symbolize long-term gains, achieved without risking the entire fortune. Lessons for Everyday XRP Holders For retail investors, Claver’s advice encourages a shift in mindset. XRP should be viewed as a long-term strategic asset, not a speculative gamble. Holding XRP now positions individuals in a rare and potentially powerful cohort. Patience and disciplined investment may help secure a resilient financial future. Jake Claver’s message is clear: wealth doesn’t require constant accumulation. You only need to get rich once, and then protect it wisely.

The GeeFi Team sold 10 million GEE tokens , raised $500,000 , and welcomed over 1,800 early backers . This strong beginning, combined with rumors of potential listings on major exchanges, has analysts predicting that the current phase could sell out just as quickly. An Alternative with Real-World Utility Ripple (XRP) has recently seen its price trade sideways, prompting many investors to look for assets with more dynamic growth potential. GeeFi is emerging as a strong alternative, offering a complete ecosystem designed to give users total control over their digital finances. The project features a non-custodial wallet , a decentralized exchange ( GeeFi DEX ), and a crypto-linked debit card ( GeeFi Card ), all integrated into one unified platform for practical and secure asset management. The GeeFi Wallet is already available for download on Android, with an iOS version in active development. This progress is the result of dedicated work that began in 2023 and led to the project’s public launch in 2024. The team has consistently delivered updates, proving their commitment to building a user-focused platform that prioritizes security and financial autonomy. The GeeFi Presale Opportunity GeeFi has moved into the second stage of its presale, with tokens priced at just $0.06 . This price offers a calculated entry point, as investors are positioned for a guaranteed 667% return when the token launches at its planned listing price of $0.40 . To put the potential into perspective, a $1,200 investment today could grow to $40,000 if the token reaches a projected $2 valuation, representing a possible 3,233% ROI . The momentum from Phase 1 has carried into the current stage. In only a few days, nearly 30% of the Phase 2 token allocation has already been claimed. This equates to 4.5 million GEE tokens purchased and $250,000 raised, highlighting the intense demand from the investment community. Generate Passive Income Through Staking In addition to the presale opportunity, GeeFi provides robust staking features that allow token holders to earn substantial passive income. The platform includes a flexible staking option offering up to 10% APR without requiring users to lock up their liquidity. For those willing to commit for longer periods, the rewards become even more attractive: 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and an exceptional 55% APR for a 12-month lock-up. A referral program also adds a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made via your personal link. Why This Opportunity is Unique GeeFi’s combination of a successful presale, a clear product roadmap, and attractive earning potential makes it a standout project. Early participants are not just buying a token; they are securing a place in an ecosystem that aims to reshape how people interact with their digital assets. Opportunities to invest at the ground floor of a project with such a defined vision and demonstrated early traction are rare. Waiting could mean missing out on the significant returns that often come with early-stage support.

Access will be based on a waiting list, and prediction pairs will start with sports first. Polymarket is starting the distribution of its mass-adoption app after settling the regulatory requirements for prediction market companies. The app launch is marking the return of Polymarket after falling out with US regulators in 2022. As Polymarket previously planned, the rollout will be gradual, with a limited beta version based on a waiting list. To enter the waiting list and become a part of the expansion, users must download the currently available Polymarket app. Against all odds. Polymarket’s U.S app is now being rolled out to those on the waitlist. We’re launching with sports — followed by markets on everything. pic.twitter.com/WOoVMszrqc — Polymarket (@Polymarket) December 3, 2025 The app launched on the Apple Store, with an Android version coming soon. The competitive waiting list led to mass downloads, and the app received a 4.9-star rating after 29K reviews. Polymarket remains highly active after posting record volumes in October. The platform continues to tap global users through on-chain predictions. However, the highly popular current events markets will launch at a later date. The US-based launch will start with limited predictions on sports events. Polymarket kept adding new users in November In the past month, Polymarket almost repeated the record performance from October. The on-chain app brought in over 377K new accounts, after expanding by 400K new accounts in October. In total, the app had 494K monthly active traders in the whole of October, expecting similar results in the coming months. Polymarket expanded rapidly after announcing its upcoming ICO. The biggest driver for its growing popularity was wallet and social media partnerships. Daily volumes are also showing a trend of expansion, easily reaching a range of around $130M per day. Polymarket remains a leading on-chain prediction market, although competition is growing with new platforms. Polymarket launch almost resolves prediction pair The launch of the app waiting list affected the prediction pair anticipating Polymarket’s launch in the USA. Hours after the launch announcement, the pair was not yet resolved. The ‘yes’ token traded at $0.992, but trading was not closed. The outcome was disputed twice after a ‘yes’ proposal, and entered the final settlement process, which was predicted to take a few hours. The pair was highly active, reaching over $19M in total volumes. Polymarket announced its closed launch based on a waiting list, but the prediction pair has not resolved | Source: Polymarket The pair resolution is not considered valid, since Polymarket announced a waiting list launch. The discussion also recalled that Polymarket will consider a launch only after it starts accepting real money for trading resolution tokens. The pair may still resolve to ‘No’ based on these criteria, causing the ‘yes’ token to crash. The prediction pair also relied on the UMA protocol consensus, which has previously handled contentious issues. Polymarket continues to have rare events when the prediction pair cannot be resolved clearly, leading to prolonged discussions and exposure to the UMA voting mechanism. Don’t just read crypto news.

New predictions from research company IDC show the tech giant doing well, mostly because people really want its newest phones. The company’s also making a comeback in China, which matters a lot for its business. div]:bg-bg-000/50 [&_pre>div]:border-0.5 [&_pre>div]:border-border-400 [&_.ignore-pre-bg>div]:bg-transparent [&_.standard-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pl-2 [&_.standard-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,ul,ol,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pr-8 [&_.progressive-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pl-2 [&_.progressive-markdown_:is(p,blockquote,ul,ol,h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6)]:pr-8""> _*]:min-w-0 standard-markdown""> IDC forecasts Apple will ship 247.4 million iPhones in 2025, up 6% from last year and topping its previous record of 236 million units set in 2021 with the iPhone 13. What’s driving this? According to Nabila Popal, senior research director at IDC, it’s “thanks to the phenomenal success of its latest iPhone 17 series.” She pointed out that in China, “massive demand for iPhone 17 has significantly accelerated Apple’s performance.” Shipments refer to how many devices manufacturers send to their selling partners, think online retailers and physical stores. These numbers don’t tell you exactly how many phones got sold, but they show what kind of demand a company’s expecting. Now IDC says Apple’s shipments in China will jump 17% in the last three months of 2025 compared to last year. That’s big enough that the research firm changed its forecast for China’s entire smartphone market. They now expect 3% growth for the year instead of the 1% decline they’d predicted before. _*]:min-w-0""> Can Apple overtake Samsung? IDC isn’t alone in seeing good things ahead for Apple. As reported by Cryptopolitan last week, another research company called Counterpoint Research said Apple would ship more smartphones than Samsung in 2025. That hasn’t happened in 14 years. But there might be bumps coming. Apple could delay the basic version of its next phone, the iPhone 18, until 2027. That would mess with the company’s usual routine of launching all its new models every fall. IDC thinks this delay might cause shipments to drop 4.2% next year. Apple reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in October, and the numbers beat what analysts expected. The company also gave a strong outlook for its December quarter. CEO Tim Cook told CNBC’s Steve Kovach that revenue should rise at least 10%. “We expect total company revenue to grow by 10 to 12% year over year, we expect iPhone revenue to grow double digits, year over year, and we expect that that would make the December quarter the best ever in the history of the company,” Cook said. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had predicted Apple would hit $132.31 billion in December quarter sales and earnings of $2.53 per share. Apple’s guidance goes past those numbers. If revenue grows 11% over last year’s December quarter, the period would bring in $137.97 billion. Cook said the company feels good about these projections because customers have responded so well to the iPhone 17 devices . He called the reception “off the chart.” “We look at the results to date, the reception of the consumer on the very strong iPhone lineup,” Cook said. “We’re looking at traffic in our stores, which is up significantly year on year. We see enthusiasm around the world.” Net income hit $27.46 billion during the quarter. That compares to $14.29 billion in the same period last year, though that earlier figure was lower because of a one-time tax charge. For Apple’s fiscal 2025, total revenue came to $416 billion. That’s a 6% increase over 2024. Sales in the September quarter went up 8% from the year before. Want your project in front of crypto’s top minds?

Zade brings to the role more than 15 years of experience overseeing growth and operations at major companies, including Facebook, Coca-Cola and Sony, as well as a marketing-technology startup he co-founded. During his tenure at Bitget, the platform grew from a mid-tier exchange into one of the world’s top four by user base, reportedly reaching over 120 million registered users. In his joining letter , Zade stated he had “worked with institutions, regulators, builders, creators, and millions of retail users across six continents.” The appointment comes at a time of MEXC’s fundamental operational shift. In November, the exchange signed several structural partnerships with industry players, such as Hacken, to accelerate global expansion and strengthen compliance and transparency. Vugar Usi Zade’s appointment is part of this strategy. The newly appointed COO will lead MEXC’s international expansion efforts, focusing on regions such as Eastern Europe, Turkey, the CIS and Latin America — markets that the company has identified as high-potential growth corridors. In his new role, he will oversee market launches, compliance, regulation readiness and strategic go-to-market execution. “Vugar brings the rare combination of scale-building experience, transformation leadership, and regulatory discipline needed to help realize that mission,” said Cecilia Hush, Chief Strategy Officer at MEXC.” MEXC currently serves more than 40 million users across 170 markets. The company has positioned itself as a “user-first” exchange offering zero-fee spot trading and rapid token listings. With growing competition and tightening global crypto regulations, the platform’s next phase will likely require more robust compliance, institutional-grade operational discipline, and geographically diversified growth — factors that likely influenced the decision to bring in Usi. In a statement, Usi said he believes the next chapter for global exchanges lies in combining retail-friendly access with institutional-grade standards: “My focus is on fundamentally raising the standard for what a global, retail-first exchange should represent. My role is to help scale that mission globally through operational excellence, responsible market expansion, and a regulatory-first approach that strengthens trust across the entire ecosystem.” With this leadership upgrade, MEXC aims to redefine what a global retail-first exchange should look like: not just fast-growing but fully compliant, resilient, and capable of operating across diverse regulatory regimes.",Industry Thoughts,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-03 17:11:55

The amendment brings clarity to the structure of the proposed TDOG fund as competition grows among issuers preparing Dogecoin products. The updates arrive while the DOGE market shows renewed strength and investors turn to regulated vehicles for exposure. The filing signals meaningful progress, although the ETF’s final approval still rests with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Fee Disclosure and Operational Framework According to the latest S-1 amendment submitted to the SEC, 21Shares confirmed a 0.50% sponsor fee for its spot Dogecoin ETF. The company stated that the fee will accrue daily and be paid weekly in Dogecoin, covering nearly all operating costs associated with the trust. It added that the fee structure places TDOG near the midpoint of current spot crypto ETFs, offering what it described as a straightforward path for regulated DOGE exposure. The amendment also noted that any expenses tied to taxes, litigation, or indemnification would require the trust to sell DOGE to meet obligations. S-1 amendment, Source: SEC The filing maintained the delaying amendment and included the earlier 8(a) submission for effectiveness. 21Shares named The Bank of New York Mellon as the administrator, cash custodian, and transfer agent, while Anchorage Digital Bank and BitGo will share custodial responsibilities for the trust’s assets. The company affirmed Coinbase Custody Trust Company as the primary custodian and identified 21Shares US LLC as the seed capital investor for the product. The trust will use $1.5 million to purchase Dogecoin either before or up to the ETF’s listing on Nasdaq. The document also listed Wilmington Trust NA as trustee, Foreside Global Services as the marketing agent, and Cohen and Company as the accounting firm. The fund will trade under the ticker TDOG and track the CF Dogecoin-Dollar US Settlement Price Index. 21Shares described the ETF as a simple spot product that will hold only Dogecoin without leverage or active trading. The issuer also noted that transaction fees for creations and redemptions fall on authorized participants, with adjustments possible following notice from the sponsor. Growing Competition Among Dogecoin ETFs The filing comes as Dogecoin investment products gain momentum. Grayscale introduced its spot Dogecoin ETF on Nov. 24 after converting its existing trust, and Bitwise is preparing the BWOW fund. All three issuers aim to debut their Dogecoin ETFs later this month, pending regulatory clearance. These developments have increased market activity as investors anticipate broader access to DOGE through regulated platforms. 21Shares recently expanded its Dogecoin lineup by launching a leveraged 2x Dogecoin ETF on Nov. 20, targeting traders seeking amplified daily exposure. The arrival of these products contributed to a notable rise in Dogecoin’s performance across late November and early December. DOGE traded near $0.15 at press time after gaining roughly 11% in a single day, supported by more than $1.7 billion in trading volume.

Amid this momentum, both Bitcoin ( BTC ) and silver have reached new peaks, jostling for the crown of the year. Now, data indicates that silver has emerged as one of 2025’s standout performers, decisively outpacing Bitcoin as the year’s volatility reshapes the balance between traditional safe-haven assets and digital markets. The shift is evident in the Bitcoin-to-silver ratio, which has collapsed to 1,458 ounces of silver per Bitcoin, its lowest level since October 2023. The decline marks a dramatic reversal from the start of the year, when a single Bitcoin could buy roughly 3,500 ounces, according to data shared by the finance commentary platform The Kobeissi Letter in an X post on December 3. Silver Bitcoin ratio. Soutrce: The Kobeissi Letter The deterioration in the ratio reflects a sharp divergence in performance, with Bitcoin falling 27% since August, extending a broader downturn that has unsettled the crypto market. Silver, by contrast, has surged 53% over the same period, buoyed by renewed demand across investment channels and growing interest in precious metals amid rising economic uncertainty. The platform noted that this downturn in the ratio is one of the steepest on record, plunging 58% year-to-date and more than halving since late summer. While the current collapse echoes the 2022 bear-market slide, when the ratio fell 69% from 2,250 ounces per Bitcoin to around 700 ounces, the latest shift reflects a different market backdrop. This time, the move is driven not just by crypto weakness but by a broad rally in metals that has placed silver among the strongest commodities of the year. Silver’s massive 2025 rally Indeed, this comes as silver trades near fresh record highs around $58 per ounce, capping the metal’s strongest year since 1979. This rally is no surprise, considering that silver is attracting a surge of investor demand, with physical silver-backed ETFs adding 15.7 million ounces in November and recording inflows in nine of the past 11 months. Investors are rushing into the silver market: Physical silver-backed ETF holdings jumped +15.7 million ounces in November. Year-to-date, silver ETF holdings have increased in 9 out of the last 11 months.

Meanwhile, after reaching a record high above $126,000 in October, Bitcoin has suffered notable volatility, falling below the $100,000 support level and at one point dropping to $80,000.

The agency sent nine separate warning letters to the most active issuers in this area, such as Direxion, ProShares and Tidal, informing them that the planned products would not be subject to review. The letters stated that the risk levels of these ETFs could exceed the SEC's permitted limits based on fund assets. Therefore, the regulator asked the companies to either restructure their strategies or withdraw their applications entirely. The letter, sent to all applicants, stated, “We are concerned about the registration of ETFs that aim to provide leveraged exposure greater than 200% (2x).” This move stands out as a significant restraint in the era of lax regulation, which has recently seen crypto-linked ETFs, particularly those that have been gaining approval easily, have become increasingly widespread. These products, which have caught the SEC's attention, represent the most extreme examples of this trend due to their high leverage, daily reset mechanism, and exposure to individual stocks like Tesla and Nvidia, as well as highly volatile digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. One of the regulator's main concerns is that the “reference assets” used by funds in their risk metrics don't accurately reflect their target volatility. “Issuers were trying to go beyond the 2x limit, and the SEC was clearly reluctant to do so,” said Todd Sohn, an ETF strategist at Strategas. “They were trying to find a loophole by using certain definitions.” Related News: Investment Company CEO Speaks About Bitcoin: “I Own BTC, But I'm Worried About This Black Swan Event” Some of the funds mentioned in the warning letters were 5x leveraged ETFs recommended by Volatility Shares. These funds aimed to multiply daily returns by five times on highly volatile stocks like Tesla and Nvidia, as well as digital assets like Bitcoin and ETH. Currently, there are no single-stock ETFs with 3x or 5x leverage in the US; SEC regulations have long effectively limited the leverage level of such products to 2x. Leveraged ETFs, which multiply returns through options trading, have gained popularity, particularly among investors seeking quick returns. Trading volumes have increased sharply in the post-pandemic period, with the sector's total assets reaching $162 billion. However, these products have long been a target of criticism: their opaque nature and high risks are frequently cited as dangerous for amateur investors.

Yet while Ethereum seeks to regain bullish sentiment, early-stage crypto investors eager to identify top picks among new crypto coins promising more growth begin to increasingly focus on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). MUTM has quickly established itself as the best crypto to invest in for early-stage exposure, showing a combination of utility and investor demand that sets it apart from Ethereum and other established altcoins. Ethereum Poised to Breakout as It Enters Final Stage of Five-Year Bull Pennant Ethereum (ETH) could soon find itself at a critical point because analysts point out that this token could soon break free from the longest periods of consolidation in history—a five-year bull pennant that could now contain just completed final shake-out moves before breaking strongly upward once more. Although market sentiment among retail market players shows signs of ambivalence at times, institutional capital inflows into Ethereum have stepped up significantly, and Ethereum’s migration off centralized exchanges continues with heightened velocity still evident since July 2025 because of steadily lower supply. In circumstances whereby market players eagerly await seeing how Ethereum will perform next, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a new crypto coin receives increasing focus naturally enough. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Receives Widespread FOMO Mutuum Finance has rapidly established itself among the most promising blockchain projects of 2025 and has emerged as a major competitor within the DeFi sector. More than 18,350 persons have taken part in the presale so far, raising more than $19.08 million. Now, Phase 6 tokens can be acquired at $0.035. As the presale enters Phase 7, token pricing will rise by 20% to $0.04 – offering token holders another chance before reaching the launch pricing set for this exciting new crypto coin. Notably, Mutuum Finance sets itself apart among other cryptos with actual adoption and uses in mind, providing an attractive offering for crypto investors interested in more than just token growth within the popular DeFi sector. These elements combine to establish Mutuum Finance as the best crypto to invest in for early adopters seeking real utility and growth. What Is Being Created By Mutuum Finance And How It Functions Mutuum Finance serves as a decentralized community where members can lend, borrow money, and earn interest without having to part with their assets. The system incorporates two main platforms: markets based on pooled liquidity and isolated P2P lending spaces. In pooled markets, assets are pledged by users and corresponding mtTokens are received, which represent their holdings and generate yield income as borrowed assets are matched with liquidity. These mtTokens increase in value with time and thus form an important part of Mutuum’s interest distribution system. These will also be used for staking in the safety module and holders can be rewarded with MUTM tokens that originate from revenue protocols once they are long-term stakers. The P2P layer is an extension of Mutuum’s asset base coverage that accounts for lending and borrowing agreements for more volatile assets that don’t necessarily fit into main pool assets. The team has confirmed that the V1 protocol launch will occur on Sepolia testnet in Q4 2025. It will launch the basic functionalities of the system related to mtToken mechanics, collateral amounts and borrowing rates, interest rate models, and initial asset support for ETH and USDT. A clear public timeline of product release can itself serve as a source of momentum for initial adopters. In preparation for the initial on-chain release of Mutuum’s product, it appears that both investment activity and development milestones are well-synchronized at this point before embarking on the final phases of pre-sales. This makes MUTM a new crypto coin that investors should closely watch as the best crypto to invest in today. Ethereum comes close to $4,000; however, attention of investors shifts to the new DeFi project Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Phase 6 presale at $0.035 is 95% sold with $19M raised. Phase 7 presale shifts pricing to $0.04, further cementing its position as a top cryptocurrency and a new crypto coin with immense early-stage growth potential.

On Tuesday, the firm purchased an additional 28,315 Coinbase shares and 42,434 Bullish shares. Cathie Wood’s investment firm has increased its exposure to crypto companies by buying more shares of Bullish and Coinbase to add to its portfolio. The company’s trade filings revealed it had purchased 28,315 Coinbase shares for $7.5 million through its Ark Innovation exchange-traded fund (ARKK) on Tuesday. The recent purchase comes barely a week after the firm bought 62,166 Coinbase shares for $16.5 million across three of its exchange-traded funds, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF), and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW). The purchase comes amid a slight market recovery from major cryptocurrencies as well as crypto companies. Coinbase now accounts for 5.58% of ARKK fund holdings Here's every move Cathie Wood and Ark Invest made in the stock market yesterday 12/2 pic.twitter.com/uAlh4up9lU — Ark Invest Tracker (@ArkkDaily) December 3, 2025 The latest disclosures from Ark Invest’s website reveal that Coinbase is the second-largest holding in the ARKK fund, accounting for 5.58% of its total holdings. The investment is significant, considering Ark Invest’s strategy, which limits exposure to more than 10% of any individual stock. Other crypto-oriented companies, such as Circle Internet Group and Bitmine Immersion Technology, also rank among the top holdings by the ARK Innovation ETF. Ark Invest also purchased 42,434 Bullish shares for $1.8 million through its ARKK fund, according to the filings. The purchase comes just two weeks after the investment company purchased $10.2 million worth of Bullish shares. The company also added 1,951 Robinhood shares on Tuesday for $245,000 through its Ark Next Generation Internet ETF. Source: Google Finance . Coinbase and Bullish 1M Performance According to data from Google Finance, Coinbase and Bullish have recorded 0.21% and 4.96% gains, respectively, today. However, Coinbase is down 20.33% in the last month but has slightly recovered with a 6% rise YTD. On the other hand, Bullish is down 36.68% YTD and has declined by 14.33% in the last month. Coinbase is currently trading at $67.16 while Bullish shares retail at $7.20. Filings for December 1 show that the investment firm purchased 22,650 shares of Ark 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB) through its ARK Next Generation Internet ETF and another 48,850 ARKB shares through the ARK Innovation ETF. In late November, Cathie Wood explained that the crypto and AI industries were undergoing a liquidity squeeze. She said that the squeeze will reverse in the next few weeks and disputed claims from a research paper that claimed AI is a bubble. Wood also highlighted during the market update webinar that crypto will be a leading indicator when liquidity begins to flow. Ark Invest buys more crypto stocks amid market uncertainty Ark Invest recently purchased more crypto stocks amid prevailing market uncertainty in the crypto industry. In mid-November, Cryptopolitan reported that the investment firm purchased $15.6 million in Circle shares across its ETFs. ARK Next Generation Internet ETF bought 38,313 Circle shares, while ARK Innovation ETF purchased 130,595 shares. The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF also bought 20,033 Circle shares. On the same day, the company also purchased additional shares of Bullish crypto exchange, valued at $8.86 million, and BitMine, a crypto mining company, valued at $7.28 million.

Despite the drop, analysts argue that the trend is a reflection of growing confidence, strengthening demand from institutions, and a tightening supply backdrop that historically supports higher prices. Self-Custody, ETF Demand, and Derivatives Cleanup Shape the Trend According to XWIN Research Japan, the ongoing drain in Binance’s BTC reserves is not the warning sign it might appear to be at first glance. Instead, it means that long-term investors are shifting their assets into private wallets, which typically happens during confident market phases when large holders prepare to sit tight rather than sell. At the same time, capital is flowing into U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs from firms such as BlackRock and Fidelity, with custodians holding these assets off-exchange. With ETF balances climbing and liquidity shifting toward institutional platforms, centralized exchanges naturally see fewer BTC in their wallets. XWIN analysts wrote that this realignment is the mark of a maturing market structure rather than weakness. Recent turbulence in derivatives markets has also played a part in the dwindling reserves. The late-November slump triggered heavy liquidations across Asia-based traders, shrinking margin deposits and reducing the BTC held on Binance. A recent change of fortune in the asset’s valuation also had a similar effect, when more than $300 million in Bitcoin shorts were wiped out on December 2 as the premier cryptocurrency bounced back above $91,000. That spike in liquidations came just a day after the asset plunged below $85,000, exaggerating flows in and out of exchanges. Meanwhile, some users are also redistributing funds as Binance rolls out new compliance measures around the world, with XWIN claiming that while this shift has contributed to lower reserves, it merely reflects structural adjustments rather than an exodus prompted by fear. Market Structure Improving as Institutional Signals Strengthen XWIN is not alone in its upbeat outlook. Another market analytics outfit, Arab Chain, has pointed to additional signs from U.S. markets, which it says suggest the setup may be healthier than the recent volatility implies. The firm highlighted a positive reading on the Coinbase Premium Index, which is now at +0.03, after a month of persistent selling by U.S. investors. Historically, a higher premium often means there’s renewed interest from institutions, given that Coinbase acts as a primary channel for American funds. Liquidity measures on Binance have also begun to improve, and the price gap between Binance and Coinbase has narrowed, pointing to more balanced capital flows. According to Arab Chain, when both indicators move in the same direction, the market often enters a stabilization phase before pushing higher. Bitcoin’s latest price action supports that view. Over the past 24 hours, it has climbed about 7% and is now trading near $93,000 per CoinGecko data. Performance over the past week is also green, with BTC gaining 6% in that period, although it remains down by about 13% on the month after the sharp November decline.

The move comes just days after the Federal Reserve officially ended Quantitative Tightening (QT), a policy shift that immediately boosted liquidity expectations across all risk assets. With markets now pricing in an imminent interest rate cut, confidence has begun to return, and ETH is one of the first major assets to respond. Related Reading: Bitcoin Liquidation Dominance Hits Multi-Year High: The Real Cause Behind BTC’s Breakdown This rebound reflects more than just macro relief. According to data from Arkham, shared by Lookonchain, Bitmine continues to accumulate Ethereum at current prices, reinforcing bullish sentiment at a moment when many traders remain cautious. Bitmine’s persistent buying throughout the correction has become one of the most influential signals for on-chain analysts, suggesting that large players see long-term value even as the market wrestles with volatility. Reclaiming $3,000 places Ethereum back above a key psychological level, and the combination of supportive macro policy and whale accumulation provides a stronger foundation than the market had just weeks ago. Bitmine and Linked Wallets Expand Ethereum Holdings According to data from Arkham reported by Lookonchain, Bitmine has purchased another 18,345 ETH, worth approximately $54.94 million, just a few hours ago. This marks yet another large buy in a growing series of aggressive accumulation moves that Bitmine has made throughout the correction. Their continued willingness to buy at current levels signals strong confidence in Ethereum’s long-term value, even as the market navigates heightened volatility. Shortly after this report, Lookonchain highlighted activity from a newly created wallet, 0x52B7, which withdrew 30,278 ETH—valued at $91.16 million—from Kraken. The size and timing of the withdrawal have led analysts to speculate that this wallet may be linked to Bitmine or part of a broader accumulation strategy. Large withdrawals from exchanges typically indicate that the owner intends to hold the assets off-exchange, often for long-term storage or staking, rather than preparing to sell. If the wallet is indeed connected to Bitmine, this would bring their latest combined accumulation to nearly 50,000 ETH in a single day. Such behavior suggests strategic positioning ahead of potential macro-driven upside or internal confidence in Ethereum’s recovery. This kind of synchronized whale activity often precedes significant price shifts, reinforcing the idea that large players are preparing for a stronger market phase.

The recent bounce followed a deep corrective move that sent ETH from the $4,500 region down to the $2,700–$2,800 support zone, where buyers finally stepped in with conviction. The strong lower wicks around this area confirm that demand remains active, but Ethereum has yet to fully recover its bullish structure. Price now trades just below the 50 SMA, which sits near the $3,100–$3,150 zone—an important short-term resistance level. A clean break above this moving average would signal renewed momentum and increase the chances of retesting the $3,400–$3,600 range. Meanwhile, the 100 SMA and 200 SMA remain slightly above price, reflecting the broader downtrend that has dominated since September. Related Reading: Bitcoin Flashes Largest Hidden-Buying Spike of the Cycle Despite Losing $90K Level Volume has picked up slightly during the recovery, but it remains muted compared to the selling spikes seen during the drawdown. This indicates cautious buying rather than aggressive accumulation at these levels. To confirm a trend reversal, ETH must close above the 50 SMA and then challenge the cluster of resistance around $3,200–$3,300.

The network unlocked 1 billion XRP in two transfers, each containing 500 million tokens. The latest escrow movement directed 500 million XRP to the Ripple (9) address at 21:00 UTC. Another 500 million XRP moved to the Ripple (28) address shortly afterward. Both transfers remain idle at press time. Ripple often allocates these tokens for operational use, then returns unused amounts to escrow. This approach helps maintain supply discipline and prevents unexpected liquidity shocks. Besides, the controlled structure supports a predictable release pattern each month. XRP trades near $2.17 as of press time, with daily volume above $4 billion. The price shows a modest daily gain, although the weekly chart records a small decline. Consequently, traders continue watching whether new supply interacts with existing market pressure around familiar technical zones. Analysts Track XRP Resistance Near $2.30 Technical readings show XRP struggling to break above the $2.30 ceiling. XrpArthur noted that this level forms a battle area where sellers defend aggressively. The yellow zone on his chart marks a clear contest between buyers and sellers. Price now trades near $2.18, with $2.02 acting as the next key support. A daily close above $2.30 may shift momentum toward $2.45 and $2.50. Hence, traders consider this region a major inflection point. PrecisionTrade3 observed a bounce from the W2 0.618 Fibonacci level near $2. The analyst reported first resistance forming with a small bearish divergence. Source: X The chart suggests that XRP continues tracking Bitcoin’s trend. A break below $2.18 may trigger a retracement toward $2.075. Additional targets include $1.92 and $1.88 before a possible move into W3. Conclusion XRP enters December with renewed volatility, a completed escrow unlock, and firm technical boundaries. Buyers need strength above $2.30, while sellers defend the zone aggressively.

In 2027, the price range is expected to be between $59.93 and $71.39, with an average price of $61.59. In 2031, the range is likely to be between $267.69 and $326.17, with an average price of $277.23. AVAX exhibited wild price swings this year. This record came as the crypto market valuation peaked. It later reversed, shedding some of the profits later in the year. While the Avalanche ecosystem has been making strides, the AVAX price has left investors particularly questioning its trajectory. Will AVAX go up? Is AVAX a good investment? Let’s explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction from 2025 to 2031. Overview Cryptocurrency Avalanche Symbol AVAX Current price $14.29 Market cap $6.13B Trading volume $485.4M Circulating supply 429.08M All-time high $146.22 on Nov 21, 2021 All-time low $2.79 on Dec 31, 2020 24-hour high $14.29 24-hour low $13.58 Avalanche price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility (30-day variation) 10.14% 50-day SMA $17.12 200-day SMA $22.36 Sentiment Bearish Green days 12/30 (40%) Fear and Greed Index 28 (Fear) Avalanche price analysis As of December 3, AVAX’s price rose by 4.42% in 24 hours, aligning with the broader crypto and altcoin market momentum as its month-long drop slowed. Its trading volume dropped (2.38%), showing waning trader conviction. Over the last 30 days, it dropped by 15.17%. AVAX/USD 1-day chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView Last month, AVAX remained bearish, falling from $30 to the current levels at $15.. The coin now has a bearish Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 43.63, it is oversold territory below 30. The William Alligator trendlines show that its volatility is dropping. The MACD histograms (0.20) show positive market momentum. AVAX/USD 4-hour chart analysis AVAXUSD chart by TradingView The 4-hour chart highlights AVAX’s rally after breaking below all major moving averages that triggered a market sell-off. It now trades at $14, with rising volatility as it seeks support- failure to hold $14 will force it into bearish territory.

Technical analysis suggests Avalanche is bearish. The charts show it turned green today, aligning with the general market sentiment. The shorter timeframes show that it remains highly volatile. Why is AVAX down? AVAX rose 4.42% over the past 24 hours, diverging from its 30-day (-14.76%) and 1-year (-71.37%) downtrend. AVAX’s 24-hour rise reflects strategic accumulation by institutional players as Nasdaq-listed AVAX One acquired 9,377,475 AVAX ($110M) between November 5–23 at an average price of $11.73. Recent news AVAX’s Granite upgrade launches, promising faster transactions and lower fees. This major upgrade transforms how users interact with the Avalanche blockchain, delivering unprecedented speed and efficiency improvements that could reshape the entire ecosystem. Will AVAX reach $50? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX is expected to cross the $50 mark in 2027. Will AVAX reach $100? According to the Cryptopolitan price prediction, AVAX will reach $100 in 2028, with a maximum price of $106.00. Can Avalanche reach $1,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $1,000 mark before 2031. At that market capitalization, it could be more valuable than Ethereum. Can Avalanche reach $10,000? It remains highly unlikely that AVAX will cross the $10,000 mark before 2031. How much will Avalanche be worth in 2025? As the second half of 2025 unfolds, we anticipate it will trade between $19.06 and $33.36, with an average price of $29.46. Does Avalanche have a good long-term future? According to Cryptopolitan price predictions, AVAX will trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or negative regulations could invalidate this bullish theory. Is Avalanche a good crypto to buy? Chart analysis suggests that Avalanche is recovering and currently gearing up for a closer move to $27 despite the overall bearish momentum.

Avalanche historic price sentiment Avalanche price history by CoinGecko In July 2020, Avalanche completed its public sale, raising $42 million in less than $4.5 hours. The tokens were distributed after the mainnet launch in September. On Dec 31, 2020, it fell to an all-time low of $2.788. In September 2021, the Ava Labs Foundation received a $230 million investment from Polychain and Three Arrows Capital Group by purchasing the AVAX cryptocurrency. In November 2021, following an agreement with Deloitte to improve US disaster relief funding, AVAX moved to the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. At that time, AVAX moved to its all-time high at $146.22. In Aug 2022, a whistleblower, ‘crypto leaks’, published a report accusing Ava Labs of secret deals with a law firm to destabilize its competitors. Ava Labs CEO Emin Gün Sirer denied any involvement in a shady deal with the Roche Freedman law firm. In 2023, AVAX maintained a bullish trend from January to May, after which bears took control of the market. It resumed the positive momentum in October, rising to $49.96 In 2024, it crossed the $60 mark in March. The rise coincided with a record high in AVAX inscriptions, with over 100 million ASC-20 minted since their introduction in June 2023. The uptrend reversed in April 2024; by July, it had fallen to $24.40. In August, it was at $21, and in September and October, it was at $27. It turned bullish in November 2024, rising from as low as $23 to as high as $55 in December. It later corrected and traded at $42 into 2025. The drop continued into January; by June, it had fallen below $20. In July, it traded at the $18 level and $23 in September. In October, it rose above $30. It then reversed, and by December, it had dropped to $14.",Crypto Price Predictions|avax,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|AVAX|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|FIL|ICO|MARKET|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|APT|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-03 18:03:04

Recent price behavior, when viewed through technical charts and global macro events, suggests that XRP might be quietly preparing for its next move up. According to crypto‑analyst STEPH IS CRYPTO , the evidence increasingly points to a classic Wyckoff Reaccumulation phase unfolding, not distribution or a bearish top. Steph’s Case for Reaccumulation Steph argues that XRP’s recent price action — marked by extended sideways trading, repeated tests of support and resistance, and relatively muted volatility — matches textbook reaccumulation behavior. #XRP HOLDERS I GOT MAJOR XRP NEWS!!!! Watch asap! https://t.co/bAAR34YU4D pic.twitter.com/joVPaP5vZl — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) December 2, 2025 He observes a long period of consolidation after earlier rallies. In his words: “There is absolutely zero euphoria … basically zero retail interest.” He believes this lack of euphoria is a strong argument for accumulation, not distribution. He also points to technical divergence: on the daily chart, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has reportedly formed higher lows even as the price made lower lows. Steph interprets this as a bullish divergence, signaling weakening seller momentum and growing buyer strength — potentially foreshadowing a trend reversal. Why the Technical Setup Matters Reaccumulation, as defined in market‑structure theory, occurs when an asset pauses within an ongoing uptrend. Instead of topping out, price consolidates while “smart money” quietly absorbs supply from weaker hands. Recent independent analyses confirm that XRP has spent much of 2025 within a narrow ~$2.00–$3.30 trading range. According to some Fibonacci‑based projections overlaid on the reaccumulation structure, this setup could point toward significantly higher long‑term targets, including levels near $7.50 — assuming support holds and a proper breakout occurs. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Macro Tailwinds Reinforce the Bullish Case Beyond chart structures, the broader macroeconomic environment adds fuel to the bullish thesis for risk assets — including crypto. Following the easing of global monetary tightening and renewed institutional interest in digital assets , markets may be primed for fresh inflows. For a token like XRP, which combines technical setup with growing institutional adoption, these conditions could magnify any breakout. A Word of Caution Still, the path is not guaranteed. Analysts caution that the reaccumulation thesis could unravel if XRP loses key support, for example, below the $1.60–$1.70 band identified in some models. Repeated failures to break resistance near $2.90–$3.30 may prolong consolidation or trigger renewed volatility. Even Steph himself admits this scenario is a “game of probabilities,” not certainty. Nonetheless, given the confluence of technical structure and macroeconomic tailwinds, many long‑term holders and institutional watchers may find this a compelling moment to stay alert. In sum, the combination of a sustained consolidation, possible bullish divergence, and favorable external conditions suggests that XRP could be on the brink of a breakout.

Bitcoin’s sharp decline from October’s high near $126,000 to below $84,000 has compressed the value of Strategy’s holdings and pressured its MSTR stock , creating an unprecedented scenario that could force Strategy’s first meaningful Bitcoin sale since 2020. Two Critical Triggers for Strategy’s Bitcoin Sale Strategy CEO Phong Le outlined that selling Bitcoin would only occur under extremely specific conditions that must align simultaneously. The first trigger is if the company’s mNAV falls below 1.0, meaning its market capitalization drops to or below the value of the Bitcoin it holds. NEW: $MSTR CEO PHONG LE SAYS THEY COULD SELL $BTC TO PAY DIVIDENDS IF NEEDED — BUT ONLY BELOW 1X MNAV LEVEL. pic.twitter.com/umDERcgOSw — Rishith (@goswamirishith) November 30, 2025 The second condition is that capital access dries up entirely if investors refuse to purchase Strategy’s equity or preferred stock at viable terms. The prospect of Strategy offloading even a fraction of its Bitcoin holdings has created significant anxiety across the crypto market. Gnomo Labs Founder Gabo believes the first reaction zone for Bitcoin sits around $86,000-$88,000, but the critical support level lies at $79,000-$82,000, where long-term holders and institutions typically step in. Pierre Rochard, CEO of The Bitcoin Bond Company, offered a contrasting view. He told Cryptonews that Strategy would only face true financial jeopardy under a combination of government budget surpluses, declining national debt, and high real interest rates. He added: “ Without those factors in place, there is structural support for Strategy as fiat money printing drives Bitcoin adoption.” Rochard also downplayed the potential impact, noting: “The Bitcoin market has sustained more mass panics over the past 16 years than any other asset, as it climbed in value from $0 to more than $1 trillion.” Bitcoin Price Prediction: BTC Targets $100k Breakout Bitcoin is currently testing the $93,000 resistance zone, a structurally necessary level that coincides with a descending trendline and a supply block. MACD has flipped bullish with a strong cross above the signal line, suggesting buyers maintain control. Source: TradingView A decisive close above $93,000 would open the path toward $98,700, with larger Fibonacci targets at $103,000, $107,000, and eventually $110,000 if momentum accelerates. However, rejection at this level could trigger a brief retrace toward $90,000 before another breakout attempt. Investors Turn to Maxi Doge Amid Uncertainty While the market remains undecided on Bitcoin’s direction due to uncertainties surrounding Strategy’s position and broader macro factors, investors are increasingly exploring alternative opportunities like Maxi Doge ($MAXI) The Ethereum-based meme coin features a gym-enthusiast Doge mascot and positions itself as a high-energy lifestyle token with staking rewards and trading competitions. The presale has raised over $4.25 million , with the current token price around $0.000271 and hours remaining before the next price increase. Holders gain passive income through staking yields, with higher yields being offered on a first-come first first-served basis.

The token is up 9% over the past 24 hours, while posting a slight drop over the last seven days. After testing the $30–$33 support zone again this week, the price bounced and is now moving toward resistance around $36. Support Zone Holds as Price Attempts a Reversal HYPE has tested the same support area several times since June. Each time, the price held, and short-term buyers stepped in. The current chart shows two recent lows near this range, suggesting a double-bottom pattern may be forming. CryptoPulse noted , “This level has acted as a strong bounce area multiple times — and if price holds here, we could be looking at a potential double-bottom reversal pattern forming.” If the pattern plays out, a break above the $36–$38 resistance area would be needed. That level acted as a barrier in previous rallies. If cleared, the next targets could be $40 and $50 in the coming weeks. Interestingly, the MACD line has crossed above the signal line. The MACD reading is 0.098, while the signal line sits at -1.87. The histogram is now positive, showing early signs of momentum shifting. Source: TradingView The RSI is at 45 and rising above its own moving average of around 40. While still below 50, this shows improving short-term momentum. Neither indicator shows strong trends yet, but both reflect a change from recent weakness. Futures Traders Return as Open Interest Rises Futures open interest has increased to $1.57 billion after falling sharply in late November. This shows that more traders are opening positions as the price begins to recover. A rise in both price and open interest often signals growing market participation. Source: Coinglass Earlier periods with similar setups led to short-term rallies. But in past cases, quick jumps in open interest without follow-through in price have also caused liquidations. Current conditions suggest traders are positioning for a possible breakout, while watching for price confirmation. Meanwhile, Hyperliquid Strategies is expected to begin trading on Nasdaq under the ticker $PURR. The fund will hold 12.6 million HYPE tokens and $300 million in cash reserves. It will operate as a treasury reserve tied to the Hyperliquid ecosystem. Hyperliquid Daily reported , “Hyperliquid Strategies will operate as a HYPE token treasury reserve, holding approximately 12.6 million $HYPE tokens and $300 million in cash.” The move follows approval of a merger with Nasdaq-listed Sonnet, potentially creating a $1 billion digital asset treasury.

The initial phase sold out in just over a week, signaling powerful investor demand from the beginning. The GeeFi Team sold 10 million GEE tokens , raised $500,000 , and attracted a community of over 1,800 early supporters . This impressive start, along with rumors of potential listings on major exchanges, has analysts forecasting that Phase 3 could arrive quickly, creating urgency for investors. An Alternative with Tangible Utility Dogecoin has recently experienced notable price swings, reminding traders that hype-driven assets can be unpredictable. This has led many to seek projects with more tangible utility and stronger growth potential. GeeFi is emerging as a compelling contender, offering a complete ecosystem designed to give users full control over their digital funds. The project features a non-custodial wallet , a decentralized exchange ( GeeFi DEX ), and a crypto-linked debit card ( GeeFi Card ), all integrated into one unified platform for secure asset management. The GeeFi Wallet is already available on Android, with an iOS version in active development. This progress is the result of focused work that started in 2023, leading to the project’s public launch in 2024. The team’s consistent updates prove their dedication to building a user-first platform that emphasizes security and financial independence. The GeeFi Presale Opportunity GeeFi has advanced to the second stage of its presale, with tokens available at just $0.06 . This price point offers a calculated entry, as early investors are positioned for a guaranteed 667% return when the token launches at its planned listing price of $0.40 . To illustrate the potential, a $1,200 investment at today’s price could swell to $40,000 if the token achieves a projected $2 valuation, representing a possible 3,233% ROI . Momentum from Phase 1 has continued into the current stage. In just a few days, nearly 30% of the Phase 2 token allocation has already been sold. This translates to 4.5 million GEE tokens purchased and $250,000 raised, highlighting the intense demand from the investment community and the shrinking window of opportunity. Generate Passive Income Through Staking Beyond the presale gains, GeeFi provides robust staking mechanisms that enable token holders to earn substantial passive income. The platform includes a flexible staking option offering up to 10% APR without requiring users to lock their liquidity. For those willing to commit for longer periods, the rewards become even more attractive: 15% APR for one month , 22% APR for three months , and an exceptional 55% APR for a 12-month lock-up. A referral program also adds a 5% bonus in GEE tokens for every purchase made through your personal link. Why This Opportunity is Unique GeeFi’s combination of a successful presale, a clear product roadmap, and rewarding earning potential makes it a standout project in the current market. Early participants are not just buying a token; they are securing a place in an ecosystem that aims to reshape how people interact with their digital assets. Opportunities to invest at the ground floor of a project with such a defined vision and demonstrated early traction are rare.

This focus on utility and compliance, rather than speculative hype, has become the new benchmark for evaluating infrastructure projects. While major financial players like BlackRock and Franklin Templeton pioneer new financial products, the market is simultaneously tracking specialized protocols such as RentStac (RNS) , which are building the necessary frameworks to meet the technical and legal requirements of this institutional push. The first signal is the overwhelming demand for regulatory clarity and legal robustness in on-chain assets. The second is the persistent search for stable, predictable yield, contrasting sharply with the volatile returns of earlier DeFi models. Both signals point to a market maturing away from novelty and toward utility, demanding tangible asset backing and verifiable cash flows from real estate, a traditionally illiquid sector now facing rapid digitization. The Dual Signals: Compliance and Liquidity Demand The initial RWA signal stems from institutional reluctance to engage with assets lacking clear legal jurisdiction. Global financial bodies require tokenized assets to be protected by robust legal wrappers, a critical step toward mass adoption. This necessity is now driving the design of new protocols. Simultaneously, the second key signal involves the market’s pivot toward stability. After enduring several cycles of high inflation and rapid price swings, investors are prioritizing tokens that generate reliable, external income, such as rental cash flow. This demand is elevating the importance of utility tokens backed by yield-generating physical assets. Analysts view the successful integration of legal compliance with stable cash flow automation as the prerequisite for market acceptance. Institutional Focus: Why Legal Structure Matters The movement by major asset managers to explore tokenized funds highlights the foundational importance of legal structure. For an asset to be deemed viable for institutional investment, its digital representation must be immutably linked to its legal ownership. This requirement has formalized the use of legal entities as the crucial bridge between the physical and digital world. This market requirement directly influences the operational design of new protocols. For instance, RentStac’s framework addresses this issue by utilizing Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) . Each property introduced onto the platform is legally ring-fenced by a dedicated SPV. This structure ensures that the SPV legally holds the real estate , providing a layer of legal protection and clarity that satisfies institutional criteria, thereby directly translating physical ownership into a fractionally tokenized asset. RentStac’s Operational Framework and Tokenomics RentStac’s architecture is built to align with the dual market signals of compliance and stable yield generation. The operational flow centers on fractional tokenization , allowing large, expensive properties to be divided into small, accessible digital shares. The platform relies heavily on technology to automate revenue streams. Smart contracts are deployed to manage all economic flows , ensuring that rental income is automatically collected and distributed to the token holders without manual intervention. Furthermore, the platform operates on a non-custodial model , ensuring that participants retain control over their digital assets, a security feature demanded by sophisticated investors. The ecosystem is maintained through clearly defined roles: investor , who provides capital and receives yield; manager , who handles the physical operation of the properties; and validator , who ensures the integrity of the data and transactions on the blockchain. From a tokenomics perspective, the total supply of the RNS token is capped at 2 billion . The project has set its public presale price at 0.025 USD , establishing a clear entry point for early participants. The Evolution of Asset-Backed DeFi The growing observation of projects like RentStac confirms that the RWA sector is forcing the maturation of Decentralized Finance. The new standard requires tokens to be supported by provable assets, a shift away from earlier DeFi models often characterized by high token inflation or cyclical incentives. Analysts agree that the future success of on-chain real estate depends on the seamless marriage of legal conformity and technological efficiency. The SPV model, combined with automated smart contract logic, creates an environment where investors can seek yield derived from real-world rental income. This focus on “real yield” distinguishes the RWA segment from traditional crypto speculation. As the sector moves forward, the market will continue to prioritize protocols that successfully navigate the complex regulatory and technical demands of integrating physical assets with digital finance.

55311488,639001,1764788404,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/55311488.jpeg,Ethereum Network Fatigue? Monthly On-Chain Transactions Drops As Activity Slows Down,https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-network-fatigue/,"Over the past few weeks, the price of Ethereum has been on a downward trend due to a highly volatile market environment. ETH’s bearish action appears to have hampered on-chain activities, as evidenced by a decline in its total transactions carried out within a monthly period. A Quiet Month For The Ethereum Network Ethereum’s on-chain activity appears to have slowed down alongside the ongoing decline of ETH’s price. The blockchain, which is typically bustling with contract calls, exchanges, and transfers, now feels a little more roomy, suggesting a cooling pulse beneath the surface. After examining the Transactions on the Ethereum Network metric in the monthly time frame, Everstake.eth, a market analyst and the head of the ETH segment at Everstake, revealed that the blockchain has recorded its worst month of the year. While price has declined, ETH’s total transactions executed in a month, particularly November, experienced a cool-off. According to the data, the overall number of transactions carried out on the Ethereum network in November alone was approximately 32.2 million. Although this figure may seem large, it actually marks the lowest monthly count in the past 12 months. Such a drop in transactions may suggest the renewed waning appetite for the network. In addition to suggesting a retreat, this delay reads more like a collective pause as users catch their breath, procedures recalibrating, and the market adjusting to its new rhythm. Everstake.eth highlighted that this kind of cooldown usually occurs when the market moves into a wait-and-see phase. During this phase, capital is observed sitting on the sidelines while developers continue to build on the blockchain. Despite this trend, the network still records more than 33 million transactions in a quiet month, which reflects its robust strength. At a time like this, the expert noted that user behavior typically follows the market sentiment. As seen in the past, on-chain activity tends to cool down when volatility drops. However, Ethereum still retains the status as the most reliable network even during slow phases. With the Fusaka Upgrade set to hit the market , Everstake.eth predicts that ETH transactions will see explosive growth. “If this is the worst month, imagine what the best will look like after Fusaka rolls out. It will be huge,” the expert stated. ETH Active Transactions Pick Up The monthly transactions may have slowed down, but the active addresses on the Ethereum network are heating up again. Leon Waidmann, the head of research at On-Chain Foundation, reported that active addresses throughout the entire ecosystem, Layer 1 and Layer 2s, bounced back above 9.5 million this week. This surge points to a quiet resurgence of interest, utility, or a group readiness for the future. Waidmann highlighted that this marks the first meaningful reversal after several weeks of downside action. ETH layer 2s such as Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, and World Chain have witnessed a strong rebound following a period of decline. Furthermore, multi-chain activity is starting to stabilize after the drop in Q3. These factors are painting a bullish picture for the network and its price prospects.",Ethereum|Arbitrum|Base|ETH|ETH news|ETH Price|Ethereum Active Addresses|Ethereum fusaka upgrade|Ethereum network|ethereum news|ethereum price|ethusd|ETHUSDT|Everstake|everstake.eth|Leon Waidmann|On-chain Foundation|Optimism|World Chain,EN,0,0,ETH|MARKET|TRADING|ARB|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-03 19:00:04

The strategy involved raising $1.65 billion through a private investment in public equity (PIPE) deal, led by crypto heavyweights Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital, and the funds were earmarked to build the world’s largest corporate SOL treasury, positioning Forward as a publicly traded gateway for institutional participation in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. Forward Industries now holds over 6.9 million Solana tokens Forward Industries’ Solana treasury strategy was announced in September, and since then, it has rapidly built the largest Solana treasury in the world and established an institutional-grade foundation capable of compounding long-term SOL-per-share, according to Kyle Samani, Chairman of Forward Industries. “In just a matter of weeks, we have accumulated more than 6.9 million SOL, deployed nearly all of it across our high-performance validator infrastructure launched in October, and implemented tax-efficient strategies that meaningfully strengthened our capital position,” Samani said . “As we pursue initiatives such as bringing our equity on-chain and executing on accretive M&A, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to expand our SOL treasury and compound SOL-per-share.” According to him, this is just the beginning, and the company remains committed to delivering sustainable long-term shareholder value as it builds the primary public markets gateway to Solana. As things stand, Forward Industries Solana holdings make it the largest corporate treasury holder for Solana globally, representing over 1.1% of SOL’s circulating supply, most of which it has staked through its own validator infrastructure, generating 6.82–7.01% gross APY. It also recently launched fwdSOL, which is a liquid staking token backed by 25% of its treasury to enable DeFi yield optimization without selling underlying assets. Other notable companies accumulating SOL as a treasury strategy include Upexi, Solana Company, Defi Development Corp, and Sol Strategies. Between them, they hold around $10 million worth of Solana. While Upexi and Defi Development have proven themselves aggressive accumulators, their purchasing power trails behind Forward Industries’. Operational highlights included in the update Some of the operational highlights included in the update revealed the company has $1.65 billion private placement in public equity (“private placement”) led by Galaxy Digital, Jump Crypto, and Multicoin Capital. The financing closed on September 11, 2025, and marked the largest Solana-focused digital asset treasury raise to date. The company has also announced an at-the-market equity offering program and teamed up with financial technology firm Superstate to allow stockholders to tokenize and hold FWDI shares on the Solana blockchain. As part of the agreement, Forward Industries expects an equity stake in Superstate to further align interests and advance internet capital markets. Other highlights include the launch of a Forward Industries’ institutional-grade validator on the Solana blockchain, powered by DoubleZero, the establishment of a crypto advisory board with 25 inaugural members, and the authorization of a new share repurchase program to buy back up to $1 billion of the company’s common stock.

Related Reading: Bitcoin And The 2026 Fed Shift: Expert Says Markets Aren’t Ready The latest 31% surge was triggered by a series of developments that converged within days, most notably Coinbase’s approval to offer SUI trading to New York residents, a move that places the token inside one of the most heavily regulated crypto markets in the U.S. The rally also arrived immediately after one of the largest token unlocks of the month, an event that would normally dampen prices but instead saw buyers step in with force. SUI's price trends to the upside following a steep decline as seen on the daily chart. Source: SUIUSD on Tradingview New York Listing Boosts Liquidity and Institutional Demand SUI surged between 25% and 32% over the past 24 hours after Coinbase confirmed that New York residents can now buy and trade the token across its web and mobile platforms. The approval extends SUI’s reach into one of the most tightly regulated U.S. markets, strengthening its profile as a compliant layer-1 network and increasing accessibility for institutional investors. The listing comes at a notable time. On December 1, SUI unlocked approximately $82–86 million worth of tokens, increasing circulating supply by more than 0.5%. Large unlocks typically pressure prices, but SUI moved higher instead, signaling strong demand absorption. Trading volume has more than doubled, hitting roughly $1.5 billion, levels analysts say indicate genuine accumulation rather than short-lived speculation. The launch of USDsui, a fiat-backed stablecoin designed for payments and DeFi use across the Sui ecosystem, also contributed to renewed interest. Combined with Coinbase’s expansion, these developments have strengthened confidence in Sui’s broader market positioning. SUI Technical Indicators Point to Momentum Shift Price action shows that SUI recently rebounded from November’s lows near $1.12, climbing above the $1.60 support zone. Indicators such as RSI and MACD now suggest easing selling pressure and a potential shift in short-term momentum. Analysts note that breaking above the mid-Bollinger Band near $1.90 would confirm a broader trend reversal. SUI has also moved above the Keltner mid-band for the first time in weeks, with volume delta readings showing strong spot-market buying. The next major resistance sits between $1.80 and $1.95, followed by a wider zone extending to $2.30. A decisive close above $1.92 is viewed as critical for invalidating November’s downtrend. Rally Depends on Volume Holding Market watchers say the current rally hinges on sustained demand. If daily volume remains above $1.5 billion and price holds the $1.60–$1.67 support zone, institutional participation could continue to push the token higher toward the $1.90 level. Related Reading: $93K And Climbing: Analysts Say Bitcoin’s Push To $100K Has Begun However, weakening volume or a drop below $1.48 may signal that SUI has formed a local top. For now, sentiment remains constructive as the token benefits from increased U.S. accessibility, improving technical signals, and expanding ecosystem activity.

The site, tickmilleas(dot)com, was allegedly run by operators inside the Tai Chang scam compound, also known as Casino Kosai, in the village of Kyaukhat. Investigators say the website pretended to be a legitimate trading platform but instead pulled victims into a coordinated and highly deceptive crypto scheme. Federal Agencies Remove Thousands of Accounts, Apps in Crackdown on Tai Chang Scam Network An affidavit supporting the seizure links the Tai Chang compound to the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army and the Trans Asia International Holding Group Thailand Company Limited. Justice Department Announces Seizure of Tai Chang Scam Compound Domain Used in Cryptocurrency Investment Fraud https://t.co/VcpnUrjpyb — Criminal Division (@DOJCrimDiv) December 3, 2025 The department said both groups were sanctioned last year for ties to Chinese organized crime and their involvement in setting up scam centers across Southeast Asia. The domain seizure follows the recent launch of the District of Columbia’s Scam Center Strike Force and the takedown of two other domains tied to the same operation. Victims told the FBI that the tickmilleas(dot)com platform showed fake profits, staged deposits, and other fabricated data meant to make it look like their trades were performing well. Scammers reportedly walked victims through these fake trades to build trust, even though the entire system was controlled behind the scenes. Although the domain was only registered in early November 2025, investigators have already identified several victims who lost money within weeks. The DOJ has since replaced the site with a notice telling visitors the domain has been seized. Source: Tickmilleas.com The affidavit also says the domain directed people to download scam mobile apps from Google Play and the Apple App Store. After receiving warnings from the FBI, both companies removed several apps linked to the operation. Meta also took down more than 2,000 connected accounts after receiving information about the Tai Chang network. Federal officials say these actions reflect growing concern about crypto-related investment scams, which remain one of the most damaging categories of online crime in the United States. In 2024, the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center recorded more than 41,000 complaints tied to crypto investment fraud, totaling an estimated $5.8 billion in losses. DOJ Intensifies Crypto Crime Crackdown With New Charges, Seizures, and Sanctions The action comes during a period of intense federal activity against crypto-related crime. On November 20, prosecutors unsealed charges against former Olympic snowboarder Ryan Wedding , accusing him of running a Tether-based laundering network for drug money and allegedly ordering the murder of a federal witness in Colombia earlier this year.

Federal investigators also moved to seize more than $15 million in USDT connected to North Korea’s APT38 hacking unit, which they say carried out several major crypto exchange breaches in 2023.

In a separate case, prosecutors secured guilty pleas from five people accused of helping North Korean IT workers secretly obtain jobs in U.S. companies. Other recent enforcement steps include a civil forfeiture case tied to $584,741 in USDT linked to an Iranian national accused of supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ drone program. Additionally, in September, the DOJ sanctioned 19 entities in Myanmar and Cambodia for running forced-labor scam compounds used to operate large-scale crypto fraud networks.

Monero is an attractive investment because it emphasizes privacy and security, utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure transaction confidentiality, which has created a strong demand in the market . Its growing adoption across various use cases and a decentralized development model enhance its long-term potential. With a limited supply and increasing investor interest, Monero offers a unique opportunity for those seeking financial autonomy and privacy to invest in cryptocurrency. However, investors should remain cautious of regulatory risks and market volatility when considering Monero as part of their portfolio, making it essential to seek investment advice. Why is XMR up? Monero price analysis shows that XMR saw a sharp drop to $400 before finding support. Since then, the price has recovered to $406 mark where it trades at press time. Will XMR recover to its all-time high? Monero is expected to recover toward its all-time high of $518 by mid-2026 as the privacy chain continues to reduce its tech debt and progresses toward greater utility and privacy. However, the platform might have to overcome regulatory scrutiny and challenges before it can see mass adoption, as it remains highly speculative . How much will Monero be worth in 5 years? The Monero price prediction for 2030 suggests a minimum price of $1,048.76 and an average trading price of $1,142.11 . The maximum forecasted price is set at $1,208.35. Will XMR reach $1000? The chances of Monero (XMR) hitting $1,000 hinge on various factors, which will influence its future price movements. The adoption of privacy transactions and technological advances could increase demand. Favorable regulations and market sentiment toward privacy coins would also help. Yet, regulatory risks, competition, and market volatility creating an atmosphere of extreme fear are challenges that monero traders could face that could hinder significant growth. $1,000 is possible with favorable conditions, especially considering the current price but market dynamics and regulations will shape its path. Does XMR have a good long-term future? Monero (XMR) has the potential for a strong long-term future due to its focus on privacy and security, which makes it attractive to users seeking anonymity. However, many investors have concerns regarding privacy, regulatory scrutiny, and notoriety from being the favored medium for some past criminals, which impact the current Monero sentiment. Monero’s commitment to ring confidential transactions and the broader monero project gives it a solid foundation for long-term growth, but it must carefully navigate market and regulatory landscapes.

Monero historic price sentiment XMR price history Monero’s market value has changed dramatically since its launch in 2014, from less than $1 to over $475. May 2021 marked the highest point in Monero’s history. Monero’s price projections revealed the coin’s security. They provide investors with optimism that they will be freed from the persecution of some authorities simply by buying or selling Monero Across 2023, Monero’s price rose by 11.49%. The highest price was $278.56, and the lowest was $114.16. In January 2024, Monero stayed stable around the $150.00 mark as market momentum remained low. However, the stability was short-lived as February crashed to $101.95. However, XMR showed swift recovery as it closed the month near the $150.00 level again. In March and April 2024, XMR saw a steady decline from $150.00 to $120.00, where it found key support. In May 2024, XMR observed steady bullish pressure as the price rose from $120.00, approaching resistance at $150. In June 2024, Monero (XMR) traded within the $150 – $175 price range as either side struggled to make a clear breakthrough. In July, the crypto traded around the $155 mark as the price volatility remained relatively low. XMR opened trading at $156.05 in August and ended the month at $176.00, making remarkable gains. September was bearish for the asset, as the price declined below the $160 mark by the end of the month. In October, Monero observed a steep crash and has been making a swift recovery since then. In December, Monero made remarkable strides as the asset’s price broke past the $220 mark, albeit briefly as it closed the month below $200. In January, Monero saw a bullish January as the price rose from below the $200 mark to $238 by the end of the month. In February, the price fell towards the $215 mark as bears dominate the markets. In March, the price observes mixed momentum and closed the month slightly below $215. In April the consolidation continued until late into the month when it spiked past the $325 mark before ending the month around $275. In May the price continued rising rapidly as the bulls cruised past $300 ending the month around $320. During June the price continued to observe high volatility but observed low net change as the asset closed the month around $313. In July the price saw a huge spike in volatility as the price rose past $340 but the asset closed the month below the $310 mark. In August the price declined rapidly falling to the $260 mark by the month’s end. In September, the price rose to the $340 and while it did not maintain the level but managed to close the month above the $320 mark. In October the price continued to rise ending the month above the $340 mark, a trend separating it from most other cryptocurrencies that saw a decline during the period. In November, the bullish rally continued with XMR crossing the $400 mark by the end of the month.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XMR|FORKS|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-12-03 19:05:13

Many discussions focus on price action or legal battles, yet the true strength of XRP lies in its engineering. This reality becomes clearer when the ledger’s early design choices are connected to today’s advancing financial use cases. The latest reminder from the Ripple CTO brings this truth back into sharp focus, offering XRP holders a deeper understanding of why the technology still matters. Vet shared this message in a detailed post on X. His post included a video where Ripple CTO David Schwartz explained the technical roots behind the XRP Ledger’s unique structure. The comments he highlighted offer a rare look into the decisions that shaped the earliest features of the XRPL, including the first decentralized exchange in crypto. The Hidden Power in Leaderless Consensus David Schwartz explained that the XRP Ledger was built on a leaderless consensus model. This model prevents any single participant from acting as a block producer. Without block producers, no one can reorder transactions for personal benefit. ""Our technology was uniquely positioned for an asset exchange"" The leaderless consensus algorithm of the XRP Ledger, no dictator of the moment, made Arthur Britto come up with the very first DEX in crypto. I love you Arthur. https://t.co/42S8HpUafe pic.twitter.com/uL13clfiGi — Vet (@Vet_X0) December 1, 2025 No party can delay a cancellation. No actor can insert their own trade to capture a better price. This structure protects market fairness and removes incentives for manipulation. Arthur Britto’s Breakthrough on the First Crypto DEX According to Ripple CTO, Arthur Britto understood early that the leaderless model enabled something revolutionary. It allowed the creation of a decentralized asset exchange without the weaknesses seen in block-producer systems. If block producers controlled the sequence of events, they could exploit price shifts. They could capture arbitrage, deny transactions, or front-run users. The XRPL removed those risks at the protocol level. This breakthrough led Britto to design the first functioning decentralized exchange in crypto history. From Issued Assets to Early Stablecoins The CTO also noted that the team expanded this foundation by creating “issued assets.” These assets functioned like early stablecoins and offered a bridge into a multi-asset future. The XRPL became one of the first ledgers to support native trading between multiple assets without external smart contracts. This design enabled fast settlement, low fees, and direct asset conversion on-chain. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 A Technology Purpose-Built for Exchange By 2012, the team understood the significance of what they had built. The ledger’s design made it uniquely suited for asset exchange at scale. The combination of multi-asset support, leaderless consensus, and an embedded DEX created a trust-minimized environment for global value movement. These features are not new. They are foundational, and they continue to influence modern innovations across Ripple and XRPL-based projects. Why This Message Matters to XRP Holders The CTO’s explanation carries a clear message. XRP’s value is tied to robust engineering, not market speculation. The ledger remains a purpose-built settlement system with fairness embedded at its core. For holders, this reminder matters. It highlights a technology that was designed with intention, vision, and long-term utility. It reinforces that XRP is supported by infrastructure that still leads in areas the broader industry is only beginning to explore.

MSCI has an active consultation on the treatment of companies whose treasuries hold digital assets or whose business models are materially linked to them, with feedback windows running into January 2026, according to MSCI’s consultation materials. In parallel, Strategy’s leadership has acknowledged the option to sell Bitcoin under specific circumstances, a shift in tone after years of continuous accumulation. In a recent company update, Strategy CEO Phong Le described sales as a last-resort tool if balance-sheet metrics deteriorate, according to coverage and recordings of the briefing. MSCI’s Consultation and Index Mechanics MSCI’s review outlines scenarios in which index eligibility, classification, or weights could change if a firm’s risk profile is driven mainly by a digital asset rather than an operating business. Outcomes range from unchanged inclusion to adjusted treatment or removal, with implementation details and timing to follow the comment window. Any exclusion would force benchmark-tracking funds to rebalance according to index family rules, constituent weight, and transition procedures. Liquidity can absorb staged flows, yet turnover tends to spike on effective dates, and moves often amplify when both equity and crypto depth are thin. Strategy’s share price has traded with high Bitcoin beta, which can compound swings during tight liquidity. Strategy’s Toolkit If Price Pressure Persists Strategy built its position through cash, convertible debt, and at-the-market equity programs. Management has now described sales as a last-resort tool if balance-sheet metrics deteriorate, a framing that puts liquidity and capital costs ahead of a rigid buy-only stance. Strategy announces $1.44B USD Reserve and now hodls 650,000 $BTC . pic.twitter.com/FNFivMNQgh — Strategy (@Strategy) December 1, 2025 Sustained spot levels below recent add prices raise the effective cost of issuance and debt, while any equity-to-NAV discount can slow net additions. If sales occur, sequencing becomes a choice between faster de-risking to stabilize leverage and a paced approach to limit market impact, each with different implications for realized gains and tax outcomes. What Markets Watch Next On the index side, investors will look for the consultation’s conclusion, any grace period, and whether changes are phased. On the corporate side, filings will be read for updates to issuance plans, leverage targets, treasury language, and purchase cadence. Crypto-linked flows still shape the backdrop. Net creations in spot Bitcoin products, exchange balances, and order-book depth across BTC and ETH pairs help determine whether equity moves tied to crypto exposure settle or extend. When depth rebuilds and product creations turn positive together, risk typically steadies; when those series soften while index decisions approach, volatility can rise into the event window. The current Bitcoin bounce trims immediate pressure, yet policy signals and index rules still define the near-term path. MSCI’s review and Strategy’s contingency language now share a calendar, and together they will determine how crypto-heavy corporate exposure fits within mainstream equity benchmarks.

At the same time, a legal complaint filed in Ireland accused the company of helping Israel’s military scrub surveillance data from servers in Europe. It was the biggest single-day drop for Microsoft since November 18. The quota cuts happened inside Azure, where multiple divisions lowered sales targets for AI products after many salespeople missed their goals in the fiscal year that ended in June. One team had aimed for customers to increase spending on the Foundry marketplace by 50%. Less than 20% of the team hit that goal. In July, Microsoft lowered the target to 25% for the current year. Foundry is where businesses buy tools to build automated AI agents, separate from Microsoft’s more consumer-facing Copilot products. Microsoft says targets weren’t lowered, denies report When asked about the internal reset, a Microsoft spokesperson told The Information , “The Information’s story inaccurately combines the concepts of growth and sales quotas, which shows their lack of understanding of the way a sales organization works and is compensated.” They added, “Aggregate sales quotas for AI products have not been lowered, as we informed them prior to publication .” But it’s not just Microsoft. Some companies also allegedly told The Information that it’s still hard to calculate actual savings from using AI on routine tasks, and they’re concerned about the high cost of errors made by the models. The Foundry marketplace, the focus of these failed targets, is not the same thing as Copilot. Copilot bundles AI into Microsoft’s office tools. Foundry is for developers building agents from scratch. Most of the computing demand tied to AI workloads, though, still comes from OpenAI, which runs independently of Foundry. That relationship isn’t affected by the quota issue, but it doesn’t help with Foundry’s performance either. Complaint in Ireland says Microsoft helped hide Israeli surveillance The other problem for Microsoft landed the same day. An activist group filed a complaint with Ireland’s Data Protection Commission, accusing the company of violating EU privacy law by helping Israel’s military shift sensitive surveillance data out of Europe. The complaint was based on information from Microsoft employees and internal records. The complaint said that after a news article from The Guardian and Israeli outlets in early August revealed Microsoft’s servers stored millions of intercepted Palestinian phone calls, activity spiked. A day after that article came out, three accounts tied to the Israeli military requested higher data transfer limits on Microsoft’s Azure platform. Internal approvals followed. The amount of data in those accounts plunged immediately afterward. The company’s spokesperson allegedly responded, saying, “Our customers own their data, and the actions taken by this customer to transfer their data in August was their choice.” The spokesperson added, “These actions in no way impeded our investigatio n. That investigation led to a decision to cease some services in September, and ultimately to the customer storing their data with another provider.” The investigation involved employees who worked directly with Israeli officials and was supported by business records. The complaint demanded that the Irish commission launch an immediate probe and block Microsoft from processing military and government data where it breaches EU law. The European headquarters of Microsoft is located in Ireland, which gives the Irish Commission the job of enforcing the General Data Protection Regulation for the company. Meanwhile, Israel’s conduct in Gaza continues to draw criticism. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Israeli officials, accusing them of using starvation and deliberate attacks on civilians during the war. Israel denies the allegations. None of this is new for Microsoft, which has faced employee protests and outside pressure over its ongoing contract with Israel’s Ministry of Defense. But the events of Wednesday brought two serious problems to the front—a business miss on AI, and a global accusation over war data. Get seen where it counts.

The falloff matters because DATs have been one of Ethereum’s strongest sources of demand this year, often absorbing more tokens each month than the network issues. DAT Buying Weakens The figures from Bitwise, shared by analyst Max Shannon, show a steady decline in monthly ETH accumulation by DATs from July through November 2025. The data highlighted a stark progression: after scooping up 1.9 million ETH in August, treasury buying fell to 1.06 million in September, 670,000 in October, and finally just 370,000 in November. Analysts point to a challenging market environment as the primary cause. According to Shannon, the “treasury model, once seen as a successor to the ‘altcoin season,’ is rapidly losing momentum.” He noted that declining market values for these companies, a metric known as mNAV, are weakening their buying power. This has created a difficult cycle where falling crypto prices have led to the value of DAT holdings dropping, making it harder for them to raise new capital to buy more assets, which further pressures prices. This pressure is evident globally as seen in the recent shelving of a planned $500 million Ethereum DAT venture led by major Chinese crypto figures, including Huobi founder Leon Li Lin. Li cited poor market conditions and an unclear macro outlook as reasons for the pause. Bitmine Adds to its ETH Stockpile Still, not every buyer is retreating. According to Lookonchain, Tom Lee’s Bitmine just bought another 18,345 ETH worth about $55 million, adding to the company’s already massive 3.7 million ETH position. CoinGecko’s treasury dashboard shows that publicly listed firms now hold over 5.7 million ETH combined, with Bitmine alone accounting for more than half. DATs were previously seen as a structural force absorbing supply and providing consistent long-term demand. Between July and November, they accumulated more than 4 million ETH even as monthly issuance hovered near zero. While the recent slowdown doesn’t negate that impact, it does hint at a turning point where appetite is no longer keeping pace with the aggressive accumulation seen during mid-2025.

YZi Labs announced that it had issued a notice to 10X Capital, citing mismanagement, value-destructive actions, and threatened violations of contractual agreements, just a few months after the two parties partnered on a $500 million private investment in the company. The deterioration in their relationship has culminated in a proxy fight, with YZi Labs seeking to overhaul the board through a consent solicitation process filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). YZi Labs accuses 10X Capital of mismanagement The dispute centers on allegations that 10X Capital, which manages BNC’s digital asset treasury, plans to pivot away from accumulating BNB tokens despite representations made to investors during the summer financing round. YZi Labs , the family office of Binance founder Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, contends that company management has informed market participants of plans to abandon the BNB ecosystem for alternative cryptocurrencies such as Solana, contradicting the investment thesis that attracted backers. YZi Labs also claims that the recent moves by 10X Capital in collaboration with the current CEO of BNC have negatively impacted the company’s shares, adding that the BNC’s management, most of whom it claims were appointed by 10X, have misled shareholders and significantly damaged shareholder value through various actions. According to the family office, 10x “delayed disclosure of basic information about BNC’s assets, such as: BNB holdings, share counts, mNAV, and lack of a public dashboard providing market-standard treasury transparency similar to other DAT leaders.” It also claimed that there was a breach of fiduciary duty by David Namdar and Hans Thomas due to “their conflict of interest in refusing to amend BNC’s unconscionable AMA terms with 10X, and their promotion of competing Digital Asset Treasury (“DAT”) ventures, including the use of company resources to do so.” In its press release, YZi Labs stated that the combined impact of both accused parties has “led to severe underperformance of BNC’s stock relative to peers, trading approximately 19% below the pre-PIPE announcement level and 87% below the post-announcement level.” In contrast, it pointed out that BitMine Immersion Technologies Inc has performed way better, “rising 667% from its pre-announcement close and holding nearly flat, just 2% lower, post-announcement.” Proxy battle intensifies YZi Labs filed a preliminary consent statement with the SEC seeking stockholder support to expand the board and elect additional directors, a mechanism that allows shareholders to vote via written consent rather than waiting for a formal meeting. The firm directly owns roughly 2.15 million shares and holds warrants for more shares. The company demands that “10X, and its hand-picked directors and CEO, amend the BNC AMA and release to BNC’s shareholders the fundamental information expected of a publicly traded DAT, including an operational plan, an asset-management methodology, a risk framework, a reporting package, a personnel overview, and evidence of systems, controls, and infrastructure.” It also added that BNC shareholders should be provided with timely updates that reflect the amount of “BNB acquired and held, the number of outstanding shares of BNC, and other critical and market-standard information customarily disclosed by other DATs.” The notice from YZi Labs also demanded that 10X provide written confirmation by December 5 that it will comply with the BNB treasury strategy as represented to investors and “that it has not improperly disposed of BNB assets.” The smartest crypto minds already read our newsletter.

The company announced that co-founder Yi He has been appointed co-CEO alongside Richard Teng. This move is considered the biggest leadership shakeup since Changpeng Zhao (CZ) stepped down as CEO two years ago. Teng succeeded CZ as CEO in November 2023. While Yi He hasn't officially assumed the title of “director of customer service” since then, he is known as one of the most influential figures behind the scenes in Binance's corporate strategy. Yi He and Zhao have children together. CZ resigned from his position after pleading guilty to money laundering and sanctions violations in the US and was pardoned by US President Donald Trump in October. Analysts say the pardon eases years of regulatory pressure on Binance and could make it easier for the company to reconsolidate its US operations. INSEAD finance professor Ben Charoenwong argued that Yi He's appointment signaled a strategic expansion, saying: “Following the amnesty, the perception is this: It's time to expand our business. As a company, we were on the defensive for a long time due to regulatory pressures, but now we're transitioning to much more active management.” While not as visible in the media as Zhao, Yi He has been recognized as one of the most influential figures within Binance for years. He is considered a key figure behind BNB Chain's growth and largely responsible for the institution's institutional client division. He has also played an active role in coordinating major acquisitions like CoinMarketCap. Related News: A Proposal That Could Be Bad News for 10 Altcoin Networks on a Major Cryptocurrency Platform Is Being Debated Yi He, who has a background as a presenter on Chinese television, has cited his English proficiency as the primary reason for his less public profile. He first encountered the crypto industry at OKCoin in 2014, hiring Zhao as CTO at the time. He then invited him as an advisor when he founded Binance in 2017. Binance used the following statements in its statement on X: “Together with Teng, Yi will lead Binance's next phase of development. We will continue to build a reliable, transparent, and responsible platform for digital assets while strengthening our global regulatory foundations.” Binance, built from the ground up by CZ and Yi He, had become an industry leader over the years, capturing over 50% of global spot trading volume. However, ongoing tensions with regulators in numerous countries culminated in charges in the US in late 2023, with both Binance and CZ pleading guilty to charges of failing to implement anti-money laundering controls. *This is not investment advice.

The incident occurred at around 8:30 p.m. on November 29 in the car park of a pharmacy along Trincity Central Road, Trincity. The 52-year-old man reported the incident to the Arouca Police Station on Saturday. He said he had met with a 33-year-old man from Belmont with whom they’ve conducted cryptocurrency business for almost two years. Crypto wrench attacks rise in 2025 A 52-year old man in Trinidad was robbed of $86,000 when he went to buy cryptocurrency from a man in a pharmacy parking lot. Pro tip: don't bring bags of cash to randos in a parking lot. https://t.co/aLePjXX1dB — Jameson Lopp (@lopp) December 2, 2025 The victim told officers that he was sitting in his car before the other man joined him and got into the car with him. He also revealed that he gave the man $85,000 cash in a black bag, which was intended for the purchase of digital assets. According to a report by local media, two armed men dressed in hoodies attacked the victim shortly after giving the man the money. The victim stated that the robbers approached the car and knocked on both the passenger and driver windows before snatching the cash and cell phones. The robbers escaped in a getaway vehicle and left both men unharmed. Cryptopolitan reported last month that a thief disguised as a delivery driver robbed a San Francisco homeowner of $11 million in crypto. The robber was armed with a gun and bound the victim with duct tape before forcing him to hand over his wallet, credentials, along with a laptop and phone. Earlier last month, there was another crypto wrench attack involving a convicted Russian scammer and his wife. Both victims were found dead in the United Arab Emirates after they had met with a group of individuals posing as crypto investors. A local media outlet reported that Roman Novak was confronted by the men and was demanded to give access to their crypto wallets. According to the report, the robbers gained access to Novak’s wallets but found nothing inside. The assailants later murdered the couple and fled. UAE-based police revealed that Novak and his wife’s bodies were found dismembered and dumped in bags in the desert near the city of Fujairah. The authorities also tracked the group’s movements as they attempted to cover their tracks by wrapping vehicles before leaving the country for Russia. One assailant was also reportedly fleeing to Georgia. “We’re seeing a clear surge in ‘wrench attacks,’ where criminals torture or threaten victims to drain their wallets.” -David Richards, CEO of BlockchainUnmasked. An analysis by Jameson Lopp, co-founder and chief security officer at self-custody platform firm Casa, recorded over 60 physical crypto attacks in 2025 alone. Wrench attacks have increased from 32 attacks recorded for all of 2024. Richards argued that the rise in crypto prices has fueled the surge in crypto attacks. He also believes that criminals are leveraging sophisticated social media and other tech. He cited only 10 cases in France in the first half of 2025, with attacks in the U.S. up by 169%. Richards warns traders not to flaunt profits and successes Richards believes that some cases and attacks may have been unreported. He warned that there could be worse crypto wrench attacks through 2026 unless privacy tools and global law enforcement can coordinate at scale fast. The firm’s CEO added that Novak’s attack was not random, as he had previously scammed $500 million and had a previous conviction for fraud. He also stated that the attack was likely a case of revenge, as reported by local media. Richard noted that Novak was known for flaunting funds in Dubai and would tend to leave digital trails, making him an easier target. The crypto firm’s official urged retail advisers to remain as boring as possible and not flaunt their profits and successes. He also emphasized that crypto users should use multi-factor authentication and not just two-factor authentication.

MSCI is considering a policy to exclude companies whose business models rely heavily on cryptocurrency acquisitions from its indexes, arguing they resemble mutual funds. The decision is expected to be announced by January 15. According to JP Morgan, Strategy's removal from the MSCI USA and MSCI World indexes could lead to outflows of up to $8.8 billion if other index providers follow suit. Saylor, however, argues that these expectations are exaggerated: “I don’t think it makes any difference,” said the famous CEO, adding that JP Morgan’s fund outflow projections may not be accurate. Bitcoin's steepest monthly decline since mid-2021 in November directly impacted Strategy, whose balance sheet is heavily reliant on Bitcoin. Earlier this week, the company sharply revised down its year-end profit forecast, announcing a potential loss of up to $5.5 billion. A month earlier, the company had forecast a profit of $24 billion. Saylor noted that Strategy is inherently vulnerable to volatility: “The stock will naturally be volatile because the company is built on amplified Bitcoin. If Bitcoin falls by 30-40%, the stock will fall even more. That's the nature of this structure.” Saylor also argued that the company operates with 1.11 leverage and is capable of withstanding even a 95% crash in Bitcoin's price. Related News: SEC Surprises This Time - They Are Blocking Some Cryptocurrency Products from Entering the Market Strategy's inclusion in indices was a key driver of demand for its stock, particularly through MSCI-based ETFs and other passive investment vehicles. A potential delisting could raise questions about the company's ability to raise funds through equity and debt in the future. Among the new criteria MSCI is discussing is removing companies from its indexes if their digital asset positions exceed 50% of total assets. This directly targets companies like Strategy, which have a Bitcoin-heavy balance sheet. On the other hand, Saylor believes such a decision would not lead to any meaningful change in the company's operation or long-term strategy. *This is not investment advice.

Analysts contend that this pivotal development could usher in a considerable supply crunch for ETH, potentially boosting its price during a challenging period for the broader cryptocurrency market. Layer 2 Solutions To Boost ETH Burn According to analysts at Bull Theory, the Fusaka Upgrade integrates components from previous upgrades—Osaka, Fulu, and PeerDAS—but its most impactful feature is its resolution of one of Ethereum’s biggest challenges. Layers 2 (L2) solutions have long utilized Ethereum’s security while contributing minimal fees back to the network. Despite L2 solutions like Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync generating millions in fees from users, the fees recorded on Ethereum tended to diminish to nearly zero when they posted their data. Consequently, this meant that significant L2 activity did not result in substantial ETH being burned, even though approximately 85% of Ethereum transactions now occur on these Layer 2 solutions. Related Reading: Bitcoin Slump Claims New Victims: Leveraged ETFs Tied To Strategy Suffer Major Losses The Fusaka Upgrade fundamentally changes this dynamic. A key enhancement is EIP-7918, which mandates that Layer 2 transactions pay real fees to Ethereum. This adjustment ensures that every L2 transaction will contribute directly to the burning of ETH—something that was not previously guaranteed. The analysts assert that this feature represents one of the most significant value shifts since the introduction of EIP-1559. Post-Fusaka Projections The upgrade is further expected to broaden the scope of ETH burn from being predominantly derived from Layer 1 (L1) transactions to encompassing all L2 activity. Historically, most ETH burn has originated from mainnet transactions; thus, the network saw slight inflation in 2024–2025 as Layer 2s made transactions cheaper, leading to a decrease in ETH burn while staking continued to issue new ETH. Post-Fusaka, every L2 blob will incur a minimum cost, which will be burned. As Layer 2 adoption increases, the rate at which ETH is burned will also rise, contributing to increased scarcity of ETH. This enhancement positions Ethereum to shift back towards deflation for the first time in several years. Currently, ETH issues around 620,000 new tokens annually for stakers while burning approximately 350,000 tokens. This results in a net slight inflation. However, projections following the Fusaka Upgrade, even with conservative estimates, suggest that the additional burn from L2 activity could range from 200,000 to 400,000 ETH per year. Combined with existing burn rates, this could bring the total to over 600,000 ETH, leading to a net neutral or slightly deflationary state for ETH. More bullish models predict that if L2 adoption flourishes and demand for blobs rises, burn rates could soar to between 900,000 and 1.2 million ETH annually, resulting in a supply decrease of 200,000 to 300,000 ETH each year. Monetary Transformation For Ethereum? Another notable aspect of the Fusaka upgrade is PeerDAS, which enhances Layer 2 growth by reducing bandwidth requirements by 85%. This efficiency allows L2 solutions to publish more blobs at lower costs, resulting in increased fees and, consequently, more ETH burned. Related Reading: Analyst Says This Needs To Happen For The XRP Price To Rally Again The upgrade also increases the block gas limit from 36 million to 60 million, allowing more transactions to fit within each block. This increase means that more transactions can occur, leading to higher fees collected and a corresponding rise in burning. Furthermore, lower fees for transactions—such as swaps, bridges, on-chain gaming, and social applications—will likely drive more usage, resulting in increased transactions and higher ETH burn. Ultimately, the analysts believe that the Fusaka Upgrade represents a significant monetary transformation for Ethereum, indicating that the network is not only scaling but also beginning to monetize that scaling effectively.

Although these trends create a positive outlook for Ethereum, astute investors looking for exponential growth value find themselves moving beyond industry leaders to explore new chances in presale with fundamentally disruptive concepts. For those interested in what crypto to invest in now for life-altering returns, focus now shifts to yet another newcomer among DeFi tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , with rapid funding success. What’s Next For Ethereum? Although it’s exciting to see how well Ethereum is doing, it’s difficult for the crypto to increase at such an extraordinary rate because of Ethereum’s enormous market capitalization. The search for “the next big thing” in crypto, which can offer returns of 32x or more, usually results in finding innovative projects at an early phase of development such as Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Currently, the top crypto to invest in can often not only be measured with regard to market action but rather with regard to technology, presale action, or perhaps more importantly, what problem it seeks to solve within this digital age and space of crypto. It’s been determined that the answer to this search for crypto has settled on Mutuum Finance. Mutuum Finance presale reaches critical phase The Mutuum Finance presale has now reached an unprecedented status and has emerged as a promising solution for those puzzled about which crypto to invest in today for lasting prosperity. It has managed to raise an astonishing $19,080,000 with 18,290 holders registered with the presale that has now reached its sixth level with 95% occupancy. The cost of acquisition still stands at just $0.035, which is up 250% from level one. This phase is selling out rapidly; it will be the last chance to grab these MUTM tokens at this pricing level. The soon-to-follow phase will begin with almost 20% higher pricing at $0.04, while the initial pricing level has been established at $0.06, ensuring those involved with Phase 6 will experience an eye-opening 400% gain at market launch. It easily becomes apparent that this token qualifies for the best crypto to invest. The need to get involved is urgent because this opportunity to lock in MUTM at such an early bargain investment cost soon expires. For those still weighing and deciding which crypto to buy now, this represents not only an opportunity but the final chance before yet another cost increase to position themselves for what’s to come. The FOMO experience is well-founded with this project because of its strong momentum and planned increase leading to launch. Apart from these presale mechanics, Mutuum Finance offers more interaction with token holders with their leaderboard dashboard that resets every 24 hours. The leaderboard shows the top 50 token holders, with incentives for position number one every day in terms of a $500 MUTM reward if they conduct at least one transaction daily until reset at 00:00 UTC. Additionally, investment acquisition can now occur with any card with unlimited amounts . Securing The Future Of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance is more than just a token; it’s a building block for what could become an exciting new decentralized lending solution on blockchain technology. The team has now confirmed its product roadmap with plans to launch V1 of its lending protocol on Sepolia testnet in Q4 of 2025 with initial features including Liquidity Pools, mtTokens, and Debt Tokens supporting ETH and USDT loans and borrowing. This momentum is reinforced with a focus on security, with an independent audit of Mutuum’s lending and borrowing contracts ongoing at present with Halborn Security, which should serve to boost investment confidence. For those looking for where to invest their cryptocurrency dollars with optimal returns, Mutuum Finances offers a rare quartet of a well-developing presale phase and product development. A Final Opportunity For Strategic Positioning It’s evident what’s going on here. While there’s continued growth with Ethereum, there’s every reason to search for what crypto could break out next. And this search blooms straight into presale events like Mutuum Finance because this project has reached the end of its presale phase 6 and soon will trigger a boost while delivering innovative solutions with its DeFi protocols. The crypto to buy now ideally would offer not only a safe presale investment point but also a compelling roadmap; Mutuum Finance meets this description precisely.

However, there are still instances where the Dogecoin price has seen major crashes in the month of December, and that could play out once again here. Using data from the CryptoRank website, this report takes a look at how the Dogecoin price has performed in the month of December in recent years, based on its performance in November. Dogecoin Price Closes November In The Red The crypto market has had a rough couple of months, and the Dogecoin price has not been left out of this . The last quarter of the year has so far been incredibly bearish, with the meme coin suffering major price crashes in the last two years. CryptoRank data shows that both the months of October and November have ended with double-digit losses, with -20% and -21.3% declines, respectively. In recent years, the Dogecoin price ending the month of November in the red has led to similar bearish momentum in December. Looking at the last five years, spanning from the last bull cycle into the current one, the months where November has ended in the red have set the tone for the rest of the year. This was the case back in 2021, when the Dogecoin price saw a -23.4% loss in November, and the following month of December saw a similar -20.7% decline. Then again, in 2022, the trend played out again when November finished in -14.6% in the red, and then December followed up with an even bigger -34.7% crash. In 2025, the month of November ended with a -21.3% crash, and if this trend holds, then it means that the Dogecoin price could see a double-digit crash in December. Going by the similar previous performances , this could result in a 20% decline in the Dogecoin price . With the back-to-back declines from the last two months, the Dogecoin price seems to be on track to end the last quarter of the year in the red. So far, the Q4 returns have come out negative at -37.4%, marking the first time in the last four years that the meme coin will be ending Q4 in the red.",Dogecoin|Doge|DOGE news|doge price|dogecoin|Dogecoin news|dogecoin price|dogeusd|dogeusdt,EN,0,0,DOGE|MARKET|TRADING|CRYPTOCURRENCY,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-12-03 20:00:18

The Federal Reserve’s decision to formally end quantitative tightening has created a sense of anticipation across the crypto market. Liquidity inflows have shaped every major crypto cycle, and removing the multi-year drain on liquidity is expected to set the stage for healthier crypto market conditions and see the Bitcoin price push above $100,000 in the coming days. Policy Shift Meets A Market Still Searching For Direction The Fed has frozen its balance sheet at roughly $6.57 trillion after three years of balance-sheet reduction. Treasury runoff has stopped on December 1, though mortgage-backed securities will continue declining slowly. Related Reading: Finance Expert Says Bitcoin Price Growth Is In ‘Google 2017’ Phase, What This Means Ending QT means that the Fed is stepping away from the rapid balance-sheet reduction that tightened financial conditions throughout 2023 and 2024. The move comes after bank reserves fell to levels that threatened short-term funding stability, and the Fed made the move to halt any further liquidity drain. Crypto investors are expecting the end of QT to relieve some of the selling pressure that has contributed to the crypto industry in recent months. This is due to historical comparisons of how the industry played out in previous ends to QT. In 2019, when the Fed last ended QT, digital assets bottomed within weeks and then entered a strong recovery phase. That period represented a decisive low for altcoins and preceded Bitcoin’s rise from roughly $3,800 to $29,000 over the next year and a half. Interestingly, the entire crypto market’s short-term behavior is starting to show signs of bullishness. Particularly, the entire market is up by 7.2% in the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin leading the charge. However, cryptocurrencies are facing a different macro environment today, and the outlook is whether Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies can go on another extended bullish rally in the coming months. Why Is Bitcoin’s Reaction Delayed? Ending QT is a meaningful turning point, but it does not automatically flood the system with fresh liquidity. Benjamin Cowen, founder of IntoTheCryptoverse, offers one of the clearest explanations for what to expect. Related Reading: Financial Strategist Debunks Prediction That Bitcoin Price Will Reach $220,000 In 45 Days He noted that in 2019, the Fed announced QT would end on August 1, but the balance sheet continued falling through mid-August because previously scheduled Treasury maturities had not yet settled. It wasn’t until early 2020 that Bitcoin started to experience explosive gains. According to Cowen, the same dynamic applies now. Therefore, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet could continue edging lower for a few more weeks, meaning the first meaningful uptick in liquidity may not show up until early 2026. This delay suggests that traders hoping for an immediate boost or a quick return of Bitcoin above $100,000 are simply ahead of the cycle. The tightening phase has ended, but the actual recovery in liquidity has yet to begin.

He emphasizes that this is not a sudden price capitulation. Instead, it is a time-based test of investor patience. Compression and pressure in the charts suggest a looming decision point. According to him, the thesis hasn’t changed; only emotions are being tested. He warns that when the market appears boring, significant moves often start. Egrag Crypto explains that smart money uses time to exhaust weaker investors’ conviction. This phase is designed to test patience rather than crash markets outright. His analysis shows that charts and numbers remain reliable, but human patience often fails. Institutional Demand and Legal Clarity Support XRP The XRP market today is far different from previous years. Ripple and the SEC have fully resolved their dispute. Both parties withdrew appeals in mid-2025, ending regulatory uncertainty. #XRP – The Break-Before-The-Crash (Update) : Go back to my post from 2023 and look at the structure. TA: Do charts lie? No. Do math and numbers lie? No. What fails is people’s patience. Time: This is not price capitulation… This is time-based capitulation.… https://t.co/vIrpZIi70x pic.twitter.com/PLnuJzkwMr — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) December 3, 2025 Institutional interest has grown significantly . ETFs and other investment vehicles now bring millions of new potential investors to XRP. This influx of institutional capital reduces circulating supply and strengthens market resilience. Legal clarity and institutional adoption have shifted the market narrative in XRP’s favor. Technical and On-Chain Signals Technically, XRP has been trading around $2.20 in early December 2025. Recent movements indicate moderate selling from medium-term holders. On-chain data confirms that these holders are gradually reducing exposure. At the same time, inflows from new institutional investors have tightened supply. Analysts point to resistance between $2.445 and $2.460. If demand stalls, a retest of $2.00 or even $1.77 remains possible. The structure still shows a double-bottom formation, leaving potential for both downside and upside moves. We are on X, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) June 15, 2025 Balancing Fear and Opportunity Egrag Crypto’s warnings underscore the psychological dimension of markets. Investors may feel anxious as sideways trading tests their patience. However, structural factors support XRP resilience. Regulatory clarity, decreasing exchange supply, ETF inflows, and growing adoption reduce the risk of a sudden collapse. If these forces persist, XRP may avoid a breakdown and could enter a renewed bull phase. Traders should monitor wallet movements, institutional flows, and key resistance levels. Outlook The next weeks are crucial for XRP. Time-based pressure may exhaust weaker hands while testing the market’s structural strength. Investors should stay alert, watching technical indicators and market flows closely. XRP remains at a pivotal point, balancing between potential breakdown and renewed upward momentum. Egrag Crypto’s analysis highlights patience as a key factor, not panic. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Scaramucci describes Solana as a Layer-1 blockchain, similar to Ethereum, that enables very fast transactions in DeFi. According to Scaramucci, in the coming years, several major Layer-1 solutions like Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and Hyperliquid will form the “blockchain rail system,” and smart contracts and securities tokenization will occur on these infrastructures. “These can coexist; there doesn't have to be a single winner,” he says. “If there's more than one major player in cloud computing, there will be more than one mainnet in the tokenization world.” Referring to Solana's key features, Scaramucci summarizes the network's technical features as “cheap, very fast, and developer-friendly.” He notes that transaction fees are sub-penny and tens of thousands of transactions per second are possible. He argues that Solana's use of both proof-of-stake and time-stamping proof-of-history mechanisms increases transaction finality and speed. While not as distributed as Ethereum, he notes that the number of nodes on Solana is growing rapidly, making the network increasingly more distributed. Scaramucci notes that SkyBridge holds a significant amount of Solana on its balance sheet, and his motivation for writing the book was to explain the technology to both corporate clients and the traditional financial world. Related News: SEC Surprises This Time - They Are Blocking Some Cryptocurrency Products from Entering the Market In terms of his portfolio approach, he also likes Solana, Ethereum, and Avalanche, along with Bitcoin: “Five years ago, I was slammed by the traditional financial world for buying Bitcoin at an institutional level, but now they're all coming into the market. We're at a similar point today with Solana; I think in five years, when we look back, we'll say, 'It was a good entry level.'” On the regulatory front, Scaramucci argues that a more crypto-friendly framework has emerged under SEC Chairman Paul Atkins and President Donald Trump, which he argues is “transformative” for the industry. However, he argues that the “pendulum-like” regulatory approach in Washington poses the biggest risk to crypto, emphasizing that regulations for the industry must be bipartisan, transparent, and fair to consumers. He points to David Sachs' draft bipartisan executive order, which he presented at the beginning of the year, as a positive example. Scaramucci compares the adoption of Solana and other Tier-1 networks to the early internet and the wild swings Amazon experienced after its IPO. He recalls Amazon's 80-90% loss in value during the 2000 dot-com crash, saying, “If you have fundamentally good technology and a solid use case, you should hold it for the long term, despite the volatility.” *This is not investment advice.
