Over seven million email addresses from that incident are now in the public domain. The ecosystem became aware of the update via 23pds, SlowMist’s Chief Information Security Officer’s post on X. The OpenSea Response to the Initial Breach 23pds notes that this leakage of users’ email addresses increases the risks for the affected users. Primarily, malicious actors could target them in a phishing email scam to attempt to dispossess them of their funds. Although the leak initially occurred two years ago, in 2022, the data did not get widely circulated back then. However, the current development means all the information is accessible to everyone. This accessibility makes them most vulnerable to fraud attacks. Notable figures, companies, crypto influencers, and others in the crypto industry are among those whose email addresses have been compromised. Analysts suggest that the rate of phishing scams might spike as malicious actors have been known to target high-profile individuals and accounts . This allows them to rake in high financial reward if their attack is successful. Will Phishing Mail Scams Spike? For perspective, OpenSea realized in June that one of its employees for its email automation provider, Customer.io, had exploited their access to download users’ email addresses. This employee shared the downloaded addresses with an unauthorized third party. At the time, OpenSea proactively alerted its users to assume their information had been compromised. However, the full dataset remained under limited circulation until now, when it is publicly accessible to everyone, including malicious actors. 23pds post serves as a cautionary note for users to remain vigilant, especially those who might be affected by the leak. It taxed them to be on the lookout for suspicious emails and take appropriate security measures to protect themselves. Experts Call for Vigilance and Preventive Measures Notably, phishing scams lure users into parting with sensitive information. These include such details as login credentials and personal data by pretending to emanate from official channels. Tech experts have also urged users to beware of airdrops, buzz offerings , and other reward programs. They advised users to double-check any offer of free tokens with links in emails to claim such rewards as they could be phishing scams from fraudsters.

Leading the charge, Render has seen a notable 30% rise in price, aiming for an all-time high. In parallel, Token Spritz has formed a significant alliance with Atleta Network to push forward Web3 advancement. Yet, Web3Bay , often referred to as 3BAY, is transforming e-commerce. Its innovative approach connects traditional Web2 and futuristic Web3, allowing users to purchase digital assets and tangible goods with digital currency. Already, it has secured over $630,000 in its initial sales phase, proving increasing trust in its potential to overtake established e-commerce leaders like Amazon and Alibaba. Is Render Set to Reach New Peaks? Starting 2025 with momentum, Render has experienced a 30% increase in price, solidifying its position in the AI-driven digital asset market. Market experts suggest that Render’s price could climb to $11.50 and may even reach up to $14.32, marking new peaks. This progress comes after a tough 2024 for AI-driven digital assets like Render, which saw lackluster performances. Yet, Render’s journey to consistent growth faces challenges. Previous resistance at the $11.50 level has led to declines, and current patterns suggest possible downward adjustments from peak prices. Dropping below $6.50 might indicate a downturn, urging caution among digital asset holders. Token Spritz & Atleta Network Unite for Web3 Progress The partnership between Token Spritz and Atleta Network is a significant move for Web3 progress. Atleta’s layered blockchain architecture emphasizes a transparent, secure, and resilient digital environment. Together, they aim to create user-friendly decentralized applications (dApps) that meet a wide range of needs. Announced under the slogan “Together, Stronger,” this collaboration highlights their combined commitment to advancing Web3 through leading-edge technologies. Despite its potential, the success of this partnership hinges on overcoming scalability issues and ensuring steady user engagement. Although efficient, Atleta’s system may encounter competition from other blockchain platforms, which could affect its widespread adoption. Traditional E-Commerce Giants Face Challenge from Web3Bay’s Innovative Model Web3Bay is revolutionizing online commerce with its blockchain-based platform, which starkly contrasts with conventional methods by emphasizing transparency, security, and user empowerment. This model addresses critical concerns such as data privacy and centralized control which plague traditional platforms. By integrating cryptocurrency payments with standard methods like PayPal, Web3Bay provides a fluid shopping experience for a broad audience, enabling them to buy digital assets effortlessly. Its decentralized nature distinguishes it from industry giants like Amazon and Alibaba, who often receive criticism for data privacy breaches and high transaction fees. Blockchain technology ensures data security and ownership, fostering unmatched trust and access. With over 180 million 3BAY tokens sold in presales and $630,000 amassed, Web3Bay’s growing momentum underlines the market’s confidence in its novel approach to e-commerce. Currently, tokens are priced at $0.0039675, offering an early entry into the Web3Bay community, which could yield significant returns as it gains market presence. As the token price rises with each presale stage, early participants could see a substantial return on investment upon launch. As demand for decentralized platforms increases, acquiring 3BAY tokens now not only secures unique benefits but also ensures participation in a platform poised to redefine e-commerce’s future. With a limited number of 3BAY tokens available, the opportunity to join this groundbreaking shift is closing fast, urging potential buyers to act quickly. Capture the Moment! The expanding crypto market presents distinct opportunities, with Render and Token Spritz at the forefront. Render’s potential all-time high underscores its strong presence in the AI digital asset sphere. Meanwhile, Token Spritz’s collaboration with Atleta Network lays the groundwork for Web3 advancement. Among emerging projects, Web3Bay stands out as a transformative force in e-commerce. Its decentralized model merges Web2 and Web3 functionalities, enabling users to acquire digital assets and physical goods with enhanced security and transparency. As platforms that blend blockchain advantages with practical applications become increasingly sought after, the chance to secure 3BAY tokens at the current price is fleeting.

38917089,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=674650,1736809222,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Solana Consolidates In A Bullish Pattern – A Breakout ‘Could Spark A 40% Move’,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-consolidates-in-a-bullish-pattern-a-breakout-could-spark-a-40-move/,"Solana (SOL) finds itself at a critical juncture as the broader crypto market weathers a bearish consolidation phase. Since January 6, Solana has shed over 20% of its value, with losses extending to more than 33% since late November, reflecting the challenging conditions across the sector. Related Reading: XRP Scores A Lower High Break On Daily – ATH Next? This downturn has placed Solana under the spotlight as both investors and analysts closely monitor its next move. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Solana is currently consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern—a formation often seen during periods of indecision in the market. This pattern suggests that Solana could either break out and recover or break down and continue its descent, depending on upcoming market catalysts. A decisive move for Solana could set the tone for the weeks ahead. While the bearish sentiment weighs heavily on the market, Solana’s position as a leading altcoin keeps it in focus for investors seeking potential opportunities. All eyes are now on the symmetrical triangle as traders prepare for the volatility that a breakout or breakdown could bring. Will Solana regain its momentum, or is further downside in store? Solana Faces Critical Consolidation As Market Awaits Next Move Solana, often hailed as a market leader since 2023, has faced significant headwinds in recent weeks. The altcoin has struggled to maintain crucial support levels, with consistent losses placing it in a precarious position. Once a beacon of strength, Solana now finds itself grappling with bearish sentiment, testing investor patience and market resilience. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Solana is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle—a formation known for signaling potential volatility. According to Martinez, a breakout above $214 or a breakdown below $183 could trigger a 40% move in either direction, making this a critical moment for SOL. With the price currently hovering below the bearish target, a close below today’s levels could confirm a further correction and send Solana spiraling toward lower support zones. Despite these challenges, not all hope is lost. Solana’s robust fundamentals and its historical ability to recover could pave the way for a quick bounce or a period of sideways consolidation. A reversal in market sentiment, driven by macro or ecosystem-specific catalysts, could propel Solana back into bullish territory. However, the path forward depends heavily on how SOL navigates the current triangle formation. Related Reading: Whales Buy 470 Million Dogecoin In 48 Hours As Price Tests Crucial Demand Level – Details As investors brace for potential volatility, the coming days will likely determine whether Solana can reclaim its leadership status or succumb to further selling pressure. A decisive move is imminent, and market participants are keeping a close eye on these critical price levels. Will Solana defy the bears and stage a recovery, or is a deeper correction on the horizon? The next steps will define Solana’s trajectory in this uncertain market climate. SOL Tests Key Demand Level Solana is currently trading at $177, testing the critical support provided by the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA). This level has historically served as a stronghold for bullish reversals, making it a pivotal area for SOL to defend in the face of broader market declines. The ongoing market downturn has placed significant pressure on Solana, highlighting the importance of maintaining the $175 level. If the price can stabilize and hold above this mark, it may signal a potential rebound or at least a pause in the bearish momentum. However, failing to secure support here could result in further downside, with the next significant support zone around $155. Market participants are closely monitoring these levels as Solana navigates this critical phase. The daily close will be crucial in determining whether SOL can maintain its structure and build a foundation for recovery or if it risks deeper corrections. A breakdown below the $175 mark would likely intensify selling pressure, potentially triggering additional losses as the market searches for equilibrium.

Among these, 1Fuel has emerged as a leading contender. This development reflects a broader market trend in which meme coin investors—like Shiba Inu and PEPE owners—are increasingly leaning toward tokens that provide both functionality and long-term value. With an ongoing presale selling over $135,000,000 coins at $0.015 per token, 1Fuel is swiftly emerging as the best cryptocurrency to buy right now. Read on to find out why. Shiba Inu and PEPE: Recent market performances At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, especially among meme coins like PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Though the SHIB ecosystem has grown, particularly with the Shibarium Layer-2 network, which has completed over 600 million transactions—the Shiba Inu coin has seen recent reductions in market value. According to CoinGecko, SHIB's price has dropped -8.4% over the past seven days, underperforming both the global cryptocurrency market and GMCI 30 Index coins. Meanwhile, PEPE was introduced in 2024 to renowned exchange platforms such as Coinbase and Binance.US. has also experienced some devaluation in the past days. The price of Pepe has dropped 12.9% over the past seven days, underperforming both the global cryptocurrency market and Ethereum Ecosystem coins. Although the recent underperformance by SHIB and PEPE does not diminish their overall market value, a prevailing sense of caution lurks among meme coin investors due to the inherently speculative nature of these tokens. 1Fuel’s DeFi value proposition 1Fuel's prominence stems from its capacity to bridge the gap between speculative buzz and actual use. Unlike Shiba Inu and PEPE, which gained momentum through virality and community driven movements, 1Fuel is founded on utility driven applications that meet the evolving demands of the DeFi industry. The network offers a wide range of offers for investors on the lookout for the best cryptocurrency investment. 1Fuel allows users the liberty to choose the coin they intend to trade. The wallet then simplifies all related intricacies, ensuring that cross chain transactions are straightforward. Cross chain transactions can be pricey, especially if they include several phases, such as linking fees and token swaps. But 1Fuel lessens these expenses by identifying and implementing the most effective transaction procedures. 1Fuel’s edge over meme coins Shiba Inu and PEPE owners are no strangers to risky moves and speculative operations.

Namun, para analis memprediksi bahwa tahun ini akan menjadi puncak bull market. Jika prediksi tersebut benar, ini mungkin menjadi waktu yang sempurna untuk menambah kripto baru ke dalam portofolio Anda. Berikut adalah 5 kripto terbaik untuk dibeli demi potensi keuntungan hingga 100x tahun ini: Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe adalah proyek baru yang menghadirkan angin segar bagi sektor meme coin. Proyek ini menghidupkan kembali semangat pergerakan Wall Street Bets tahun 2021, membangun komunitas pedagang sehari-hari yang bersatu untuk mengalahkan whale di permainan mereka sendiri. Dengan memanfaatkan karakter utama siklus ini, yaitu Pepe, proyek ini menawarkan serangkaian alat perdagangan dan hadiah komunitas untuk membantu anggotanya meraih kemenangan di pasar. Fitur-fiturnya meliputi sinyal perdagangan, pilihan meme coin, grup insider trading, staking, dan hadiah perdagangan. Pendekatan ini menciptakan efek flywheel; semakin efektif upaya perdagangan komunitas, semakin besar dana yang mereka miliki, yang dapat kembali diarahkan ke token $WEPE . Kombinasi utilitas dan elemen meme ini menarik minat banyak investor. Dalam sebulan, presale Wall Street Pepe berhasil mengumpulkan lebih dari $47,5 juta. Harga saat ini adalah $0.00036647, tetapi akan terus meningkat selama ICO, dengan kenaikan harga berikutnya dijadwalkan hari ini. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi Wall Street Pepe di sini . Solaxy Solaxy hadir untuk mengatasi masalah kemacetan yang dihadapi oleh blockchain Solana dengan membangun layer 2 pertama untuk blockchain tersebut. Layer 2 Solaxy menggabungkan transaksi dan memprosesnya di luar jaringan utama, sehingga membebaskan ruang blok Solana sekaligus menawarkan throughput transaksi yang lebih cepat dan lebih murah. Solusi ini juga menangani masalah kegagalan transaksi Solana. Berdasarkan data dari Dune Analytics, 41,78% transaksi di jaringan Solana gagal kemarin. Solaxy menyediakan lingkungan yang lebih stabil, di mana transaksi non-vote dapat diproses tanpa hambatan. Selain itu, token $SOLX dapat dibeli di jaringan Ethereum. Tim Solaxy berupaya menjembatani dua ekosistem kripto terbesar, menggabungkan volume tinggi Solana dengan infrastruktur DeFi Ethereum yang kokoh. Saat ini, $SOLX tersedia untuk dibeli melalui presale token, yang telah mengumpulkan $10 juta sejauh ini. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi presale Solaxy di sini . Flockerz Flockerz adalah meme coin yang sedang bersiap untuk terdaftar di bursa setelah mencapai kesuksesan besar dalam presale. Proyek ini dibangun berdasarkan ide desentralisasi, memberikan otonomi penuh kepada komunitasnya untuk menentukan arah masa depan proyek. Flockerz membangun organisasi otonom terdesentralisasi (DAO) di mana pengguna dapat memberikan suara pada semua keputusan penting, seperti pengelolaan anggaran, strategi pemasaran, dan bahkan proyek mana yang akan diajak bermitra. Selain itu, Flockerz memperkenalkan konsep inovatif bernama Vote-to-Earn, di mana pengguna dibayar untuk berpartisipasi dalam voting di DAO. Pendekatan ini meningkatkan keterlibatan komunitas sekaligus mendorong pengambilan keputusan yang lebih efektif. Flockerz akan terdaftar di bursa dalam 8 hari ke depan. Namun, saat ini masih menjalani presale token yang telah mengumpulkan $9,8 juta. Dengan permintaan yang tinggi dan peluncuran di bursa yang semakin dekat, ini mungkin menjadi kesempatan terakhir untuk membeli $FLOCK dengan harga rendah saat ini. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi presale Flockerz di sini . Best Wallet Token Best Wallet adalah dompet kripto baru yang saat ini mengalami pertumbuhan yang sangat pesat. Basis pengguna dompet ini meningkat dengan tingkat pertumbuhan bulanan sebesar 50%, membuktikan bahwa fitur-fitur inovatifnya berhasil menarik perhatian komunitas kripto. Fitur-fitur yang ditawarkan meliputi kartu debit kripto, agregator presale, bursa desentralisasi untuk spot dan derivatif, agregator staking, serta dukungan untuk lebih dari 60 blockchain.

Sementara itu, Best Wallet telah mengumpulkan $7 juta dari presale, menunjukkan potensi keuntungan yang signifikan bagi para investor. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi presale Best Wallet Token di sini . Meme Index Meme Index adalah platform investasi meme coin terdesentralisasi pertama di dunia. Platform ini memungkinkan pengguna untuk membeli keranjang “baskets” meme coin yang terdiversifikasi dalam satu transaksi. Dengan platform ini, investor dapat dengan mudah mendapatkan eksposur yang terdiversifikasi di sektor meme coin dengan cara yang belum pernah dilakukan sebelumnya. Beberapa bursa terpusat seperti Bitpanda dan Swissborg memang menawarkan keranjang meme coin, tetapi hanya satu jenis. Sebaliknya, Meme Index menyediakan empat jenis keranjang yang berbeda. Keranjang ini bervariasi mulai dari volatilitas rendah hingga sangat tinggi, sehingga dapat memenuhi kebutuhan investor dengan berbagai tingkat toleransi risiko dan kondisi pasar. Investor yang lebih berhati-hati mungkin memilih keranjang dengan volatilitas rendah. Di sisi lain, pedagang dapat memanfaatkan keranjang ini selama masa ketidakpastian pasar. Dalam periode bullish, investor biasanya beralih ke keranjang volatilitas tinggi untuk memaksimalkan potensi keuntungan. Token $MEMEX memegang peran sentral dalam operasional platform ini. Token ini memberikan akses ke platform, hak governance, serta hak untuk staking. Saat ini, presale untuk $MEMEX sedang berlangsung dan telah mengumpulkan $2,3 juta.

Dengan hasil presale yang luar biasa dari proyek-proyek ini, minat investor semakin meningkat, menunjukkan potensi besar untuk pertumbuhan nilai token di masa mendatang. Jika Anda mencari peluang untuk memaksimalkan keuntungan di tengah pasar yang bergejolak, token-token ini layak dipertimbangkan. Tidak ada waktu yang lebih baik untuk bertindak selain sekarang. Dengan presale yang sedang berlangsung dan momentum yang terus berkembang, ini adalah kesempatan emas untuk menjadi bagian dari proyek-proyek yang menjanjikan ini.

38918238,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=642872,1736811031,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38918238.jpeg,Top Nvidia clients delay orders of Blackwell racks due to technical glitches,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-nvidia-clients-delay-blackwell-orders/,"Overheating issues associated with ‘Blackwell’ racks have reportedly led Nvidia’s top customers to delay orders of the AI chip maker’s latest offering. A rack is a structure used in data centers to house chips, cables, and other essential equipment. The news comes at a time when the Biden administration announced new AI rules that raised concerns among investors, leading to a sharp sell-off in AI-related stocks, including Nvidia whose shares went down 4% in early trading Monday. Clients reportedly cut on Blackwell orders It was reported that the first shipments of racks with Blackwell chips overheated and exhibited glitches in the way chips connected to one another. According to reports, Nvidia’s major customers, that is Microsoft, Amazon’s cloud division, Alphabet’s Google, and Meta Platforms are said to have cut some orders of the chipmakers’ Blackwell GB200 racks. Reports also show that so-called hyperscalers had each placed Blackwell rack orders worth $10 billion or more. Due to this development, some customers are said to be waiting for an improved version of the racks or acquire the existing older AI chips from the manufacturer. GB200 racks with at least 50,000 Blackwell chips were being planned to be installed in Microsoft’s Pheonix facilities, the report added. However, key partner OpenAI asked Microsoft to provide it with an older generation of Nvidia’s ‘Hopper’ chips as delays popped up. Since there are other purchasers of the overheating GB200 server racks, it is now unclear how the order cuts would impact the chipmaker’s sales. The company, together with other AI-related firms is already affected by the introduction of new AI rules under the Biden administration, which include export restrictions. The Information initially reported about Blackwell’s overheating late last year adding this was going to affect other tech firms like Meta and Google that rely on the technology for their data centers. The Information further reported that the overheating arose from chips placed in server racks that were meant to support up to 72 units. As part of efforts to limit the challenge, Nvidia reportedly requested vendors to repeatedly rebuild racks. Nvidia might miss its targets The Blackwell AI chips were first unveiled in March and were supposed to hit the market in the second quarter but faced delays in deliveries subsequently affecting client deployment schedules. A Tom’s Hardware report indicated that the Blackwell AI chips release was already delayed by several months because Nvidia was working on a design flaw that affected production yields. The chips combine two silicon components into one unit meant to run times quicker than past versions in jobs like chatbot answer creation. In November Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company was on track to exceed an earlier target of recording several billions in revenue from Blackwell chips in its fourth fiscal quarter. It waits to be seen how the chipmaker will achieve this with myriad of challenges arising. It comes as AI chip and technology exports are being further restricted by the US government, potentially hurting Nvidia’s sales. The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that will limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop AI, part of an effort to preserve America’s six-to-18 month advantage on AI over rivals such as China. The proposed framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict 120 countries to the chips used for data centers and AI products. Nvidia said on Monday that the proposal was not well thought after. “The proposal is misguided and said that it threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.” Nvidia. Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve US companies’ advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, that “it’s critical to preserve America’s leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips.” “The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving, and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.” A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put US companies at a disadvantage.

But one rising token in 2025 is drawing attention away from their LINK and XRP holders as investors seek out new blockchain projects that promise bigger & better returns. Let’s look at the key factors that led to this change in priorities and what it means for the investors in these new OFT tokens. Chainlink (LINK): A Pioneer in Decentralized Oracles Chainlink’s most famous attribute, yet most frequently miscomprehended, is its architecture that serves as the foundation of decentralized oracles through its structured approach in which smart contracts securely and reliably access professional external information. Chainlink has played a key role in the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi), allowing for communication between on-chain and off-chain systems. It remains one of its most valuable features. Chainlink, now priced at roughly $20.10 , has demonstrated steady growth, with this year's performance at 39.63%. The gain is indeed impressive, but it feels low when compared with the appreciation of newer projects. With the advent of new blockchain opportunities like 1Fuel, many LINK holders are reassessing their strategies to add future-yielding cryptos investments to their arsenal. Chainlink’s tech is absolutely crucial, but as the market matures, it will probably also have slightly less appeal to higher-risk, higher-reward investors. This is where 1Fuel’s approach is vital, as it comes with features that solve scalability, efficiency, and interoperability problems. XRP: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments In pioneering faster and cheaper cross-border payments, XRP has enabled this revolution. XRP is a token developed by Ripple Labs that combines traditional finance with blockchain systems through its use in the remittance market. Partnerships with leading financial firms made it an accepted token for international transactions. XRP as at the time of writing, trades at $2.54 and this is a long way since its turbulent history. Still, questions about its sustainable growth remain, given regulatory restrictions and the volatility of the market. Stressing these revolutionary aspects, it has also pushed some investors to see the light in future-oriented crypto investments such as 1Fuel that translate innovation, and untapped potential. 1Fuel makes a strong case for XRP holders. With more of the market focusing on security and function, the project’s emphasis on user privacy, transaction efficiency, and cross-chain compatibility is timely. It also allows investors to be a part of its presale stages and benefit from its growth from the ground up. 1Fuel: The Emerging Contender 1Fuel (OFT) stands out as one of the most mentioned projects of 2025 in the blockchain ecosystem. It solves some of the most salient challenges to date, like interoperability, scalability, and sustainability, making it one of the most exciting emerging blockchain opportunities in the entire ecosystem today. 1Fuel has also achieved tremendous investor confidence, which has allowed it to surpass over $1 million raised in its presale stages. Stage 3 of the presale is now selling tokens at $0.015 each , with a 20% purchase bonus, making it a very appealing option for early investors. Market analysts expect re-entering onto 1Fuel to produce 1000% returns post-launch, and this has received notable insight from Chainlink and XRP investors. Moreover, the project's roadmap for 2025 and even beyond, includes connections to DeFi platforms and unique staking mechanisms. This forward-thinking approach has made them a powerhouse to be reckoned with ahead of competition within the token market and if you are looking for better gains than Chainlink and XRP, then look no further. Conclusion Investment strategies must be constantly re-evaluated due to the state of the cryptocurrency market. XRP and Chainlink holders will find a powerful opportunity awaiting the emergence of 1Fuel to enhance their portfolios. 1Fuel's innovative concept and consistent presale results are a promising combination for a project that's definitely one to watch.

In a Jan. 13 statement, Tether revealed that it had secured authorization to operate as a digital asset service provider and stablecoin issuer in El Salvador. The company cited the nation’s “forward-thinking policies, favorable regulatory environment, and growing Bitcoin-savvy community” as key reasons for the move. “This decision is a natural progression for Tether as it allows us to build a new home, foster collaboration, and strengthen our focus on emerging markets,” said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. He added, “By rooting ourselves [in El Salvador], we are not only aligning with a country that shares our vision in terms of financial freedom, innovation, and resilience but is also reinforcing our commitment to empowering people worldwide through decentralized technologies.” The relocation follows reports that Ardoino and Tether’s Chief Operating Officer, Claudia Lagorio, purchased property and became naturalized citizens of El Salvador in 2024. Cointelegraph reached out to Tether for further comment but received no response at the time of publication. El Salvador and Bitcoin Adoption Since President Nayib Bukele announced plans to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, El Salvador has become a hub for cryptocurrency initiatives. In 2023, Tether pledged support for one of the country’s renewable energy projects, including geothermal energy facilities. Ardoino has reportedly met with Bukele on several occasions, expressing support for the president’s efforts to attract businesses and new residents. While Bukele has claimed Bitcoin adoption has been a “net positive” for the nation, some expected benefits have yet to materialize. As of December, the Salvadoran government reported holding over 6,000 BTC, valued at more than $550 million.

Now, as holders attempt new tokens in 2025, established project leaders such as Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) will pave the way, like in 2024. Currently, there is one token making huge rounds in the market, a project that analysts are claiming could yield huge returns this year, and that token is none other than 1Fuel . With that in mind, what does the migration to 1Fuel mean for the performance and prospects for Cardano and Solana? Cardano (ADA): A Blockchain With a Strong Foundation Since its launch, Cardano , one of the main players in the crypto space, has increasingly become known for security, scalability and sustainability. Today, Cardano (ADA) serves as an open-source proof-of-stake blockchain platform founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson along with philosophy on formal verification as well as peer reviewed research. There’s a large community behind in it, and an enviable list of investors who apparently like its approach to blockchain development. As of early 2025, Cardano's current price of $1.01 has remained fairly stable for a while and has seen low volatility. Its ecosystem goes on expanding with an increasing number of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts being deployed on the platform, its growth nevertheless appears to have hit a divergence from that of other altcoins. 1Fuel has rapidly become an attractive opportunity to maximize returns for Cardano holders seeking to invest their assets elsewhere. Given its unique offerings and impressive presale results, Cardano investors are considering how high the price may go in the coming months. Solana (SOL): High-Speed Performance Meets Scalability Solana has emerged as one of the fastest-growing blockchain networks owing to its super-fast transaction speeds and low fees. With over 65,000 transactions per second , it has become a leading platform for different decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, NFT projects, and dApps. Solana’s blockchain is also extremely scalable, which is a major differentiator in a space where a lot of blockchains face congestion during peak utilization periods. As of now in January 2025, the price of Solana is a pretty solid one, we see it at $189 but it does not mean that its journey on the market was smooth. Even with the performance, Solana's price has been turbulent, weighed down by network collapses and other blockchain projects' competition. For these types of investors who have benefitted from the earlier years of Solana, 1Fuel provides the opportunity to migrate into yet another potentially more stable, high-growth token. With the 1Fuel presale gaining momentum, many Solana holders are questioning if now is the right moment to diversify into this exciting new asset. The Growing Interest in 1Fuel: What Sets It Apart? A major driving force behind the growing popularity of 1Fuel is its capacity to fulfill existing demand in the blockchain ecosystem. While others like Cardano and Solana are working well but on specific niches, 1Fuel has its sights set on new things that pull in a much larger crowd. With development focused on making DeFi more useful for investors, the platform cross-chain functionality will likely be a key part of enabling better cross-platform interaction. 1Fuel presale success, even before the official launch, is indicative of this token's appeal with analysts indicating that 1Fuel is likely to outperform the current market leaders Cardano and Solana in the coming years. Conclusion Although Cardano and Solana are still two popular options among cryptocurrency investors, 1Fuel has been attracting more interest from those seeking fresh opportunities. With the project continuing to build its momentum, Cardano and Solana holders are starting to pay very close attention to this emerging token, asking themselves if it's now time to diversify and take advantage of 1Fuel's growth potential into 2025 and beyond.

The incoming order will reverse a regulatory guideline that has shaped how financial institutions account for and custody digital assets, reports the Washington Post. “…Trump is expected to issue executive orders on the first day of his presidency that may address issues including “de-banking” and the repeal of a controversial crypto accounting policy requiring banks holding digital assets to count them as liabilities on the bank’s own balance sheet, according to a person involved with the conversations.” The expected executive order is designed to reverse SAB 121, an SEC guideline that requires certain financial entities to list even the crypto assets they hold on behalf of customers as liabilities. Crypto proponents say the guideline blocks financial institutions’ ability to enter the digital asset arena. A bill aiming to eliminate SAB 121 recently passed both the House and the Senate, but President Biden vetoed the bill.

Her concerns, outlined in a detailed 31-page letter, focus on Bessent’s stance on crypto regulation, financial deregulation, tax policies, and the challenges faced by small banks. Senator Elizabeth Warren Presses Treasury Nominee Bessent on Crypto and Tax Policies In a 31-page letter to Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent, Senator Elizabeth Warren emphasized the need for clear crypto oversight. She questioned whether the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) should have authority over stablecoins to address risks like money laundering and sanctions evasion. Warren urged Bessent to provide a plan for regulating crypto companies that pose threats to financial stability. Moreover, on tax policy, Warren challenged Bessent’s support for the 2017 tax cuts enacted during the Trump administration, which added $4.5 trillion to the federal deficit. She criticized his “3-3-3” strategy, which proposes reducing taxes, lowering the deficit, and boosting economic growth. The anti-crypto Senator demanded specifics on how Bessent would enforce the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) and address the carried interest loophole. Concerns Over Deregulation and Financial Stability Additionally, Warren scrutinized Bessent’s endorsement of deregulation, linking it to the 2008 financial crisis and the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). She cited the Federal Reserve’s report blaming weakened regulations for SVB’s failure. More so, the anti-crypto Senator asked whether Bessent agreed with the assessment. Senator Warren asked, “Do you agree with this assessment? What’s your plan to ensure deregulation doesn’t cause another banking crisis?” Nevertheless, Warren highlighted the importance of upholding the Dodd-Frank Act, which was designed to prevent financial crises. She sought assurance that Bessent would enforce these crypto regulations and avoid policies that could lead to another economic downturn. Decline of Small Banks and Community Banking The senator also pointed out the decline of small banks, which dropped from 84% of all U.S. banks in 1994 to 52% by 2022. She raised concerns about the survival of community banks and their role in supporting small businesses. Warren questioned Bessent’s strategy to ensure smaller banks can thrive amid industry consolidation and financial instability. She also asked for Bessent’s views on proposals to limit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) ability to sell failing banks to large institutions. Warren emphasized the need for bipartisan measures to raise deposit insurance limits for small businesses. Similarly, Elizabeth Warren criticized Republican-led efforts to cut $20 billion from the IRS budget. She warned of the impact of enforcing tax compliance for large corporations. More so, the anti-crypto Senator questioned how Bessent would maintain audit quality and recover revenue without adequate funding. Despite questioning by Senator Warren on crypto policies, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed Scott Bessent as a pro-innovation choice for Treasury Secretary. Garlinghouse expressed optimism for XRP and crypto progress under Bessent, signaling potential clarity on the Ripple-SEC case.

While Dogecoin’s momentum has since slowed, this experienced investor has set their sights on a new opportunity: PropiChain . PropiChain is being hailed as the next millionaire-making crypto, combining blockchain, AI, and real estate innovation. Here’s why this trader, and many others, believe PropiChain could be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. From Dogecoin Fame to Spotting Hidden Gems Dogecoin’s rise was nothing short of amazing, with prices soaring from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of $0.70. For early adopters, it was a life-changing event. However, Dogecoin’s current performance has slowed down, leaving investors searching for the next big thing. That’s where PropiChain steps in. PropiChain is designed to revolutionize the $300 trillion real estate market. The Dogecoin millionaire sees PropiChain as a transformative project, offering practical applications and massive growth potential that make it a standout in the crowded crypto market. What Makes PropiChain Different? PropiChain allows fractional ownership of high-value properties, breaking down barriers to real estate investment. For example, instead of needing $1 million to invest in a luxury property, you can buy fractional shares for as little as $100. This opens up real estate opportunities to everyday investors who were previously excluded from the market. This also means you can earn a portion of the rental income proportionate to your investment. It’s a tangible, ongoing revenue stream in addition to potential token appreciation. PropiChain also integrates cutting-edge AI to provide predictive market insights. Investors receive tools for anticipating trends, assessing market dynamics, and making informed decisions. For example, the platform can identify high-demand property types or forecast rental yields, helping you optimize your portfolio. Another feature is the metaverse integration. Investors can explore properties virtually, allowing them to assess layouts, locations, and features without ever leaving their homes. This immersive experience bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds, making international property investment more accessible than ever. Moreover, blockchain ensures secure and transparent transactions, eliminating the risk of fraud. Every property token and transaction is recorded immutably, providing investors with peace of mind. Additionally, smart contracts automate processes like rental payments, reducing delays and costs. PropiChain Presale: A Millionaire-Making Opportunity? PropiChain’s presale is generating significant attention, with over $2 million raised so far. Now in Stage 2, tokens are priced at $0.011, with prices expected to rise to $0.023 in Stage 3. The Dogecoin trader who turned $1,000 into $3 million believes PropiChain’s real-world utility and market potential could lead to a 30,000% surge. That means a $1,000 investment today could potentially grow to $300,000 in the future. This opportunity isn’t just for crypto veterans. PropiChain’s presale provides an affordable entry point for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio with a promising AI-driven altcoin. Why PropiChain Could Surpass Dogecoin While Dogecoin relies largely on community-driven hype, PropiChain offers real-world value. Its focus on solving inefficiencies in the real estate market gives it an edge, especially as investors increasingly prioritize utility over speculation. The Dogecoin millionaire’s endorsement underscores PropiChain’s potential to deliver exponential returns. It’s a chance to be part of a project that’s not just about token value but also about reshaping a trillion-dollar industry. Conclusion With endorsements from experienced investors and a clear roadmap for growth, PropiChain is well positioned to become the next millionaire-making crypto. Don’t wait until prices climb higher in Stage 3. Secure your spot in the presale now and join the ranks of early adopters who stand to benefit from PropiChain’s game-changing potential.

The current Polkadot price analysis suggests continuing volatility, provoking queries about its prospective performance. Simultaneously, the Bitget Token (BGB) expansion is progressing with significant cross-chain integrations and targeted strategies aimed at augmenting its utility and market value. Concurrently, Web3Bay (3BAY) is capturing significant interest in the Web3 e-commerce sector with a remarkable $630K presale, having sold over 180 million coins. At a modest price of $0.0039675, Web3Bay provides an opportunity for investors to support a platform dedicated to user autonomy, scalability, and community-oriented governance. Armed with a definitive roadmap and innovative functionalities like Layer-2 scaling and DAO governance, Web3Bay is setting itself up as a frontrunner in the decentralized e-commerce landscape. Current Trends in Polkadot Price Analysis Suggest Market Uncertainty The ongoing Polkadot price analysis indicates heightened volatility as DOT faces challenges in maintaining stability. Currently trading around $6.71, Polkadot has witnessed an 11.62% decrease, stirring unease among investors. The technical indicators suggest a downward trend, with the token positioned below the 20-day moving average and a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 41.88, indicating subdued buyer interest. Polkadot price analysis also underscores a critical support level at $6.50, beneath which further declines could escalate selling pressures. On-chain metrics reveal $1.23 million in long liquidations, exacerbating the downward trend. Nevertheless, certain analysts hold a cautiously optimistic view, suggesting a potential rally towards the $20 threshold if Polkadot can surpass key resistance levels. Investors remain vigilant for any indicators of a market turnaround amid these challenging conditions. BGB Expansion Enhances Ecosystem Capabilities The Bitget Token (BGB) expansion is forging ahead, driven by its recent integration with Morph Chain that facilitates effortless cross-chain transfers, thus amplifying BGB’s presence in decentralized finance. Newly established liquidity pools, like the one on Bulbaswap, have amassed over $1.1 million, providing staking incentives to participants. Furthermore, BGB Token expansion strategy includes a strategic buyback and burn initiative, designed to decrease supply and augment its long-term value. Future plans to incorporate BGB with payment systems such as PayFi highlight Bitget’s dedication to broadening BGB’s utility across both decentralized and traditional markets. Web3Bay: Fusing E-Commerce with Web3 Crypto Innovations Web3Bay is reshaping online commerce through its blockchain-integrated platform, merging traditional e-commerce functionalities with cutting-edge Web3 crypto innovations. Priced at only $0.0039675, Web3Bay has successfully raised over $630K, distributing more than 180 million coins. The platform’s vision to empower users with comprehensive control over their data and assets while shopping on the Web3Bay platform is rapidly gaining traction. With aims to facilitate worldwide, unrestricted transactions and incentivize user engagement through its native 3BAY token, Web3Bay is pioneering a new era in online commerce. At its essence, Web3Bay is committed to extensive scalability and democratic governance. It is transitioning towards a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which will allow token holders to influence the platform’s strategic direction. This commitment to fostering user participation positions Web3Bay not just as another crypto endeavor but as a leader in the decentralized e-commerce revolution. To support anticipated growth, Web3Bay is integrating Layer-2 solutions like rollups to manage high transaction volumes efficiently while maintaining both speed and cost-effectiveness. Its plans to introduce NFT marketplaces, staking opportunities, and cross-chain functionality further underline its strategic expansion initiatives. For those observing from the sidelines, this presale offers a unique opportunity to invest early in a project with a transparent roadmap and a firm commitment to community and scalability. Web3Bay isn’t merely constructing a platform—it’s crafting the future of online commerce, where not participating now could mean missing out on a significant opportunity for substantial growth. In Conclusion As we observe significant movements across various blockchain projects, Polkadot price analysis continues to indicate market challenges as it attempts to stabilize, prompting caution among traders regarding future directions. In parallel, the Bitget Token (BGB) expansion is reinforcing its ecosystem with cross-chain integrations, liquidity enhancements, and strategic supply reduction tactics, bolstering its long-term potential. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is emerging as a formidable force in the Web3 crypto landscape, having raised over $630K and sold 180 million tokens. This project is revolutionizing e-commerce through user empowerment, scalability, and decentralized governance, presenting an attractive proposition for those eager to invest in the future of online commerce.

However, this volatility has led some whales to lose confidence and dump their holdings, impacting the market today. Crypto Whale Dump $22 Million of SOL On January 13, 2024, Whale Alert, a blockchain-based transaction tracker, posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a crypto whale had dumped 122,620 SOL tokens worth $21.75 million onto the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. However, the wallet address remains unknown. 122,620 #SOL (21,748,048 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Kraken https://t.co/HIUF9pQDDf — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 13, 2025 This notable dump was witnessed in the market when SOL fell below its crucial support level of $175 and approached the $168 level. This initially shifted market sentiment and indicated that SOL had broken down from its crucial support level, signaling bearish price action. However, as sentiment cooled down, SOL rebounded above the support level and appears to be recovering. Solana (SOL) Price Action and Key Level According to expert technical analysis, the key level for SOL in the upcoming days is $175. SOL remains bullish as long as it holds this support level. If it sustains this level, there is a strong possibility that it could soar by 22% to reach $220 in the future. Source: Trading View Currently, the altcoin has returned to its consolidation zone, where it has remained for the last four trading days. For intraday traders, if SOL closes an hourly candle above the $193 mark, there is a strong possibility that it could witness a price surge of over 7% to reach the $207 mark. However, Solana’s bullish thesis will only hold if SOL maintains itself above the $175 level, otherwise, it may fail. Bullish Signal From Technical Analysis On the positive side, despite this price decline, SOL has held itself above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating an uptrend. Additionally, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near the oversold area, signaling a potential price recovery that traders and investors are anticipating. Current Price Momentum Currently, SOL is trading near $183.3 and has experienced a price decline of over 2.50% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume surged by 240%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors, potentially driven by SOL’s current discounted price.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-14 00:02:11

Through its X platform , Coinbase posted that the transfers for PNUT will be available on Coinbase and Coinbase Exchange in regions where Trading is supported; it further clarified: Trading will begin on or after 9 AM PT on January 14 2025 if liquidity conditions are met. Once this asset is sufficiently supplied, trading on our PNUT-USD trading pair will launch in phases. Support for PNUT may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions. ~Coinbase PNUT is gaining popularity as most exchanges continue to list it PNUT has been growing popular and gaining attention from different crypto exchanges. KuCoin was the first to announce the listing of the meme coin in early November before it began trading on November 11, 2024. Coinbase’s announcement was timely for the crypto, as it caused the coin to jump almost 30% to trade at $1.29. This is a significant shift, considering that the coin is very new in the market. Currently, the meme coin’s market capitalization stands at $1.28 billion. The New York Department of Conservation blessed the crypto society with its euthanization of squirrel mascot PNUT began with the New York Department of Conservation euthanizing a squirrel mascot named Peanut. The incident was controversial, making it viral and trending on social media. Soon, the meme transformed into a digital asset with a massive following on Crypto Twitter, reaching a significant market value. The meme coin trades above its peers, including POPCAT and MOG COIN. Its presence in serious crypto exchange platforms like Binance and Coinbase may grow the token tenfold.

Meme coins are taking over, and 2025 is shaping up to be the year of hilarious innovation paired with serious gains. Whether you’re a seasoned degen or a fresh-faced investor, the ever-evolving meme coin ecosystem offers something for everyone. These quirky tokens bring more than laughs—they deliver financial potential. Leading the charge is BTFD Coin, the breakout sensation smashing presale records with over $5.1 million raised, 64 billion coins sold, and a community of 8,200+ Bulls cheering it on. And it’s not just the numbers turning heads— BTFD Coin’s 90% APY on staking is redefining passive income opportunities in the crypto world. Hot on its heels is Notcoin (NOT), which thrives on dip-buying opportunities, and the audacious Book of Meme (BOME), bringing decentralization to meme culture. Together, they make up the trio of top new meme coins to buy this year, and each is here to shake up the space. BTFD Coin: 90% Staking APY That’ll Have You Saying “Bull-yah!” Let’s talk about BTFD Coin, the project that’s practically screaming, “Buy the dip!” It’s not just a meme; it’s a lifestyle. The presale numbers alone are jaw-dropping: over $5.1M raised, and that’s just the appetizer. But the main course? A game-changing staking feature with an insane 90% APY. Translation: your crypto can make more crypto, faster than you can say “Lambo.” Why Staking Matters for You Imagine this: You invest $3,000 into BTFD Coin at its current presale price of $0.000142 per token. That nets you approximately 21,126,760 BTFD Coins. Now, let’s say the price skyrockets to $0.0006 (a conservative projection, given the hype). Your tokens would then be worth a whopping $12,675, not including staking rewards. Factor in the 90% APY, and your wallet’s doing happy flips. More Than Just Staking BTFD Coin isn’t a one-trick pony. Its ecosystem is packed with features, from a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that rewards players with convertible in-game tokens to a vibrant community led by the “Bulls Squad” —a cast of characters as dynamic as the coin itself. Add Ethereum’s scalability and Layer 2 solutions into the mix, and you’ve got a project built to last. With momentum like this, there’s no reason to sit on the sidelines. Join the movement, stake your claim (literally), and watch your portfolio grow. Notcoin (NOT): A Tap-to-Earn Pioneer with Dip-Buying Power Remember when games were just for fun? Notcoin says, “Let’s make it profitable, too.” This community-driven token got its start in a viral Telegram game that brought thousands into the web3 space with a simple tap-to-earn mechanic. Today, NOT is more than a game; it’s a thriving ecosystem where users can explore web3 products, contribute to projects, and earn tokens. Why NOT’s Dip is a Win At $0.006063, NOT’s price has dipped 7% in the last 24 hours, creating a prime opportunity for dip buyers. Its market cap of $621M and growing adoption across Telegram and beyond suggest that the token is far from a fleeting trend. With a max supply nearing its cap, scarcity could drive future price increases, making now the perfect time to hop aboard. A Platform for Builders Notcoin isn’t just for gamers. Developers can showcase their web3 products to an active, engaged community, creating a collaborative environment that benefits everyone involved. Whether you’re a builder, investor, or casual user, NOT offers avenues for participation—and profit. Book of Meme (BOME): Decentralized Storage Meets Meme Culture If you thought memes were just for laughs, think again. Book of Meme (BOME) is here to immortalize internet culture on the blockchain. This experimental project leverages decentralized storage solutions like Solana, Arweave, and IPFS to create a digital compendium of memes that will outlast even the most persistent TikTok trends. The Numbers Behind the Laughs Currently priced at $0.005417, BOME has seen a slight dip of 5%, but its $373M market cap shows there’s strong interest in its vision. With over 68 billion tokens in circulation, this project is all about creating a lasting impact on the decentralized social media space. Why BOME Stands Out The concept of preserving meme culture as an immutable, blockchain-based artifact is as innovative as it is hilarious. Combine this with trading opportunities, and you’ve got a recipe for long-term engagement. Plus, its storage expansions to Bitcoin inscriptions signal big plans for the future. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Meme-ment Meme coins have evolved into more than just jokes—they’re now platforms for community, creativity, and profit. If you’re looking for the top new meme coins to buy this year, BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Book of Meme deserve a place on your radar. BTFD Coin’s presale and staking APY are setting new standards, offering investors a chance to grow their portfolios exponentially. With Notcoin’s web3 integration and BOME’s innovative take on meme preservation, this trio is as diverse as it is exciting. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. Get in on BTFD Coin’s presale now and be part of the movement that’s redefining meme coins. Sign up today and stake your claim in the future of crypto!

What are his views on crypto?,https://crypto.news/bo-hines-is-a-future-exec-of-the-u-s-crypto-council-what-are-his-views-on-crypto/,"Hardly a well-known name in the crypto industry, former college football player and the young politician, Bo Hines, 29, got a high-profile appointment as an executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, (or the “Crypto Council”) position on Dec. 23, 2024. What are his views on crypto? Not surprisingly, Bo Hines is a pro-crypto politician – if he wasn’t, Trump wouldn’t have appointed him, given the bold support for crypto from the U.S. President-elect. Read more: Bo Hines named executive director of Donald Trump’s crypto council For years, Hines has been a consistent Joe Biden critic and a passionate Donald Trump supporter. This loyalty didn’t go unnoticed, and Trump endorsed Hines when the latter was fighting for the U.S. House seat in North Carolina in 2022. Trump called Hines an “America First patriot,” a “winner both on and off the field,” and “fighter for Conservative values.” Thankfully, Hines’ views on crypto are far from being conservative. Throughout the years, Hines made only a few statements concerning cryptocurrencies. Although Hines was never an avid crypto evangelist, his statements clearly show that he sees cryptocurrency and decentralized finance as a remedy to various problems on the national and individual levels. The statement from the Bo Hines For Congress website: Hines disapproves of overregulation and CBDCs One of these statements is a part of the program that can be found on the website dedicated to Hines’ run for Congress. The mention of DeFi is found in the Economy section of the website. As an ultra-patriot, Hines begins with the importance of the protection of American jobs and business at home and leans on the America First policies that will discourage businesses from fleeing the USA. Then, Hines speaks about the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector as a way to boost individual financial independence and inclusion, which is rather a commonplace opinion. Hines starts to show his vision when he states that he sees overregulation as a threat to innovation and future development of the DeFi sector. As a part of the Crypto Council, Hines will have to overcome many challenges in facilitating a balanced and delicate crypto regulation. Seemingly, during the Congress campaign, Hines saw the DeFi as the self-regulating ecosystem based on principles of free market, empowering individuals and institutions to grow in terms of finance. The emphasis on individuals was crucial for Hines, as he stated that crypto gives individuals control over their funds and opportunities. Another important statement that can be found on the Congress campaign website is Hines’ strong disapproval of the adoption of central banks’ digital currencies. Hines sees CBDCs as a threat to financial sovereignty and a violation of the decentralization principles. Bo Hines on X: free speech and individual empowerment in finance The only time Hines mentioned crypto on X before their appointment to the Crypto Council was on Jan. 17, 2024, when he called crypto “an epitome of individual empowerment in finance” and stressed that the government shouldn’t step in the organic growth of the sector. Ironically, now Hines is the one who’s stepping. We’ll see if he’s able to let the sector grow. “Decentralized finance is the way of the future if regulators don’t crush it,” he concluded. Cryptocurrency is the epitome of individual empowerment in finance. We don’t need the government stepping in and slapping burdensome regulations on financial innovation. This new sector needs the freedom to grow organically. Decentralized finance is the way of the future if… — Bo Hines (@BoHines) January 16, 2024 On many occasions, Hines took to X to support freedom of speech. The Bo Hines For Congress website mentions that free speech is “under assault from the Authoritarian Left in our country” and names free speech as one of the conditions for flourishing Democracy. https://twitter.com/BoHines/status/1365362692668739585 While Hines was speaking about the importance of freedom of expression on many occasions, in his remarks, he never made a connection between censorship resistance and blockchain. Considering the fact that blockchain is great for facilitating immutable, transparent, inclusive, and censorship-resistant networks, Hines, as a free speech maxi and crypto proponent, will probably appreciate the potential of blockchain in this regard. Despite all the dedication to free speech, Hines has been silent about his plans as an executive director of the Crypto Council. Following the appointment, Bo Hines expressed gratitude to his patron, Donald Trump and said he’s thrilled to work alongside David Sacks, a “Crypto Czar,” appointed by Trump earlier. Hopefully, soo,n we’ll learn what the Crypto Council is going to bring to the table.

Recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributors sheds light on Tron’s expanding ecosystem and revenue surge, presenting a compelling case for its role in blockchain technology’s ongoing evolution. One major highlight is the substantial increase in Tron’s daily on-chain revenue. According to the data shared by the analyst, Crazzyblockk, this rise has been driven by the network’s enhanced gas fee revenue and higher transaction volumes. Additionally, Tron’s price movement appears to be now becoming interesting as it approaches critical support and resistance levels, which could dictate its near-term trajectory. Related Reading: TRON Reclaims Its Crown With 43% Dominance In Altcoin Transactions Daily Revenue Growth Reflects Network Utility Tron’s daily on-chain revenue has grown by 119% since January 1, 2024, a metric closely tied to rising gas usage and increased transaction activity on its blockchain, according to CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk. This surge as disclosed by the analyst highlights Tron’s scalability in “processing high transaction volumes” while maintaining “cost efficiency.” The revenue growth also highlights the network’s expanding adoption within the decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract ecosystems. The network’s ability to generate substantial gas fee revenue serves as a benchmark for blockchain performance, with Tron’s figures signaling growing user engagement and utility. The analyst wrote: The year-to-date revenue expansion signals increasing user demand and network utility, further solidifying Tron’s position as a leading blockchain for high-speed, low-cost operations. Crazzyblockk also suggests that this trend reflects the network’s economic viability and its strengthening position among blockchains optimized for high-speed and low-cost operations. Additionally, this development is especially significant as blockchain networks compete to attract developers and investors with notable decentralized applications. The analyst concluded by noting: With this explosive momentum in daily revenue, Tron is setting a new standard for blockchain economic models. Investors, developers, and users alike should keep a close watch as this trend continues to reshape decentralized finance and smart contract adoption. Tron Approaches Key Level Meanwhile, from a technical perspective, Tron has reached a critical level near its 1-Year Moving Average (MA) plus two standard deviations, at approximately $0.25. Darkfost another CryptoQuant analyst warned that failing to hold this level could result in a decline to its 1-Year MA support of around $0.15. However, the analyst highlighted Tron’s ecosystem growth offers optimism for long-term investors. Related Reading: TRON Founder Justin Sun Expected to Meet Trump as Potential Web3 Advisor The network has seen notable activity, including a sharp increase in the USDT volume on its blockchain, which rose from $8 billion in early 2023 to $27 billion by late 2024. This growth points to strong adoption and an influx of capital into the Tron network. Additionally, metrics like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicate that TRX was recently oversold, a condition that in the past has often preceded bullish momentum.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS.

The hype stems from 1Fuel selling over 135 million units of tokens worth $1.24 million with the potential for a market surge. Analysts’ expectations for a potential 5,000% gain from its current presales price of $0.015 have drawn in a lot of savvy investors looking to multiply their portfolio balance significantly, a move SOL and WIF offers no more. SOL is on the losing end SOL’s performance has been largely bearish, with investors recording losses across all timeframes. In the past month, it saw a drawdown of 18.58% and a past week loss of 14.90% according to CoinMarketCap . In the past 24 hours, it has continued its losing streak with a 1.47% decline. Analysts say should its market volume keep rising from its current level of $2.02 billion, then SOL’s fall will inevitably occur. Some analysts who are less optimistic say that SOL could get flipped by DOGE, a major memecoin in the market, based on the rate at which SOL’s market capitalization has been declining, dropping from over $100 billion down to $88.77 billion at press time. While one memecoin, DOGE, could pull an impressive move, the situation appears different with WIF another memecoin, as investors are moving away from it. WIF goes against investors’ predictions The sentiment for WIF is bearish, meaning the current downfall in the market could likely intensify moving forward. In the past month and week, WIF investors have lost 51.05% and 30.65% respectively, and the route downward is becoming more apparent with its 6.20% loss in the past 24 hours as indicated on CoinMarketCap . On the TradingView chart , WIF is in a more troubled state with the asset crossing below a critical support line at 1.4783, which is known to house buying pressure. Should the daily candle close below this support line, then WIF will begin another phase of continued decline, till it locates the next support level. With WIF and SOL failing to meet investors’ criteria, they have now turned to the best cryptocurrency, 1Fuel as the better alternative. 1Fuel: Best alternative to SOL and WIF With doubts setting in among top cryptocurrencies in the market, analysts have begun shifting to assets analysts consider will secure their investment and, more importantly, provide long-term gain. This is where 1Fuel comes in, as analysts predict the asset will return the most market gain in 2025 when it launches alongside its peer-to-peer exchange and cryptocurrency wallet. 1Fuel’s wallet will include some of the most innovative crypto wallet features in the market, that’s rarely functional in the market. Its multichain feature, being the most discussed, will support transactions across multiple chains without being hindered by high gas fees, utilizing multiple bridges, or wallets. This one-click settles everything in just a single action and uses 1Fuel as the native token to facilitate this in the market. Other aspects of the wallet analysts and investors are also excited about are the security functions, DeFi utility, and its on/off ramp supports. Conclusion Finding the best cryptocurrency to invest in isn’t a hassle anymore, as analysts say 1Fuel is the solution and the pathway to recording 5,000% in the coming trading sessions. Unlike SOL and WIF, 1Fuel remains in a state where it isn’t struggling and doesn’t appear to struggle in any way, based on analysts’ projections.

The Revenue Switch, a mechanism designed to distribute 100% of Usual’s ( USUAL ) protocol revenue to USUALx stakers, has been launched by the USUAL token and USD0 stablecoin ecosystem creators. While the initiative marks a significant step forward for decentralized finance, its debut is accompanied by ongoing community concerns about recent changes to the protocol’s redeem function. Activated on Jan. 13, 2025, the Revenue Switch enables USUALx stakers to receive protocol-generated revenue, estimated at $5 million per month, directly in USD0. This mechanism links token value to actual earnings, aiming to incentivize long-term staking and support sustainable protocol growth. Starting today UTC+0, the Revenue Switch was activated for USUALx holders. Those holding their USUALx positions throughout this week will be eligible for the distribution of last week’s collateral revenues. ​ More details here & on the dApp: https://t.co/syOdYwHXW5 ​ The 1:1… — Usual (@usualmoney) January 13, 2025 As of Jan. 14, 2025, the USUAL token is trading at $0.5319, with a market capitalization of $275.68 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $194.6 million. Approximately 36.53% of the token supply is staked, offering an annual yield of 275%, 42% in USD0 rewards, and 233% in USUAL. USUAL 1D chart | Source: CoinmarketCap Despite the excitement surrounding the Revenue Switch, the protocol has faced criticism over its decision to update the redeem function for USD0 stablecoins. The new feature allows for temporary suspension of redemptions under specific conditions, such as during periods of market volatility or liquidity constraints. While USUAL has clarified that this change is intended to maintain stability in extreme scenarios, it has raised concerns about the concentration of control and potential implications for decentralization.

The Revenue Switch aims to enhance the utility of USUAL tokens, stabilize returns for stakers, and provide a transparent mechanism for revenue distribution. USUAL has also indicated plans to refine its model in the coming months, incorporating advanced staking and governance frameworks inspired by the “veModel” used in other DeFi projects. As USUAL navigates these developments, the success of the Revenue Switch may serve as a proof of concept for revenue-based tokenomics , potentially influencing future practices in the sector.
