Over seven million email addresses from that incident are now in the public domain. The ecosystem became aware of the update via 23pds, SlowMist’s Chief Information Security Officer’s post on X. The OpenSea Response to the Initial Breach 23pds notes that this leakage of users’ email addresses increases the risks for the affected users. Primarily, malicious actors could target them in a phishing email scam to attempt to dispossess them of their funds. Although the leak initially occurred two years ago, in 2022, the data did not get widely circulated back then. However, the current development means all the information is accessible to everyone. This accessibility makes them most vulnerable to fraud attacks. Notable figures, companies, crypto influencers, and others in the crypto industry are among those whose email addresses have been compromised. Analysts suggest that the rate of phishing scams might spike as malicious actors have been known to target high-profile individuals and accounts . This allows them to rake in high financial reward if their attack is successful. Will Phishing Mail Scams Spike? For perspective, OpenSea realized in June that one of its employees for its email automation provider, Customer.io, had exploited their access to download users’ email addresses. This employee shared the downloaded addresses with an unauthorized third party. At the time, OpenSea proactively alerted its users to assume their information had been compromised. However, the full dataset remained under limited circulation until now, when it is publicly accessible to everyone, including malicious actors. 23pds post serves as a cautionary note for users to remain vigilant, especially those who might be affected by the leak. It taxed them to be on the lookout for suspicious emails and take appropriate security measures to protect themselves. Experts Call for Vigilance and Preventive Measures Notably, phishing scams lure users into parting with sensitive information. These include such details as login credentials and personal data by pretending to emanate from official channels. Tech experts have also urged users to beware of airdrops, buzz offerings , and other reward programs. They advised users to double-check any offer of free tokens with links in emails to claim such rewards as they could be phishing scams from fraudsters.

Leading the charge, Render has seen a notable 30% rise in price, aiming for an all-time high. In parallel, Token Spritz has formed a significant alliance with Atleta Network to push forward Web3 advancement. Yet, Web3Bay , often referred to as 3BAY, is transforming e-commerce. Its innovative approach connects traditional Web2 and futuristic Web3, allowing users to purchase digital assets and tangible goods with digital currency. Already, it has secured over $630,000 in its initial sales phase, proving increasing trust in its potential to overtake established e-commerce leaders like Amazon and Alibaba. Is Render Set to Reach New Peaks? Starting 2025 with momentum, Render has experienced a 30% increase in price, solidifying its position in the AI-driven digital asset market. Market experts suggest that Render’s price could climb to $11.50 and may even reach up to $14.32, marking new peaks. This progress comes after a tough 2024 for AI-driven digital assets like Render, which saw lackluster performances. Yet, Render’s journey to consistent growth faces challenges. Previous resistance at the $11.50 level has led to declines, and current patterns suggest possible downward adjustments from peak prices. Dropping below $6.50 might indicate a downturn, urging caution among digital asset holders. Token Spritz & Atleta Network Unite for Web3 Progress The partnership between Token Spritz and Atleta Network is a significant move for Web3 progress. Atleta’s layered blockchain architecture emphasizes a transparent, secure, and resilient digital environment. Together, they aim to create user-friendly decentralized applications (dApps) that meet a wide range of needs. Announced under the slogan “Together, Stronger,” this collaboration highlights their combined commitment to advancing Web3 through leading-edge technologies. Despite its potential, the success of this partnership hinges on overcoming scalability issues and ensuring steady user engagement. Although efficient, Atleta’s system may encounter competition from other blockchain platforms, which could affect its widespread adoption. Traditional E-Commerce Giants Face Challenge from Web3Bay’s Innovative Model Web3Bay is revolutionizing online commerce with its blockchain-based platform, which starkly contrasts with conventional methods by emphasizing transparency, security, and user empowerment. This model addresses critical concerns such as data privacy and centralized control which plague traditional platforms. By integrating cryptocurrency payments with standard methods like PayPal, Web3Bay provides a fluid shopping experience for a broad audience, enabling them to buy digital assets effortlessly. Its decentralized nature distinguishes it from industry giants like Amazon and Alibaba, who often receive criticism for data privacy breaches and high transaction fees. Blockchain technology ensures data security and ownership, fostering unmatched trust and access. With over 180 million 3BAY tokens sold in presales and $630,000 amassed, Web3Bay’s growing momentum underlines the market’s confidence in its novel approach to e-commerce. Currently, tokens are priced at $0.0039675, offering an early entry into the Web3Bay community, which could yield significant returns as it gains market presence. As the token price rises with each presale stage, early participants could see a substantial return on investment upon launch. As demand for decentralized platforms increases, acquiring 3BAY tokens now not only secures unique benefits but also ensures participation in a platform poised to redefine e-commerce’s future. With a limited number of 3BAY tokens available, the opportunity to join this groundbreaking shift is closing fast, urging potential buyers to act quickly. Capture the Moment! The expanding crypto market presents distinct opportunities, with Render and Token Spritz at the forefront. Render’s potential all-time high underscores its strong presence in the AI digital asset sphere. Meanwhile, Token Spritz’s collaboration with Atleta Network lays the groundwork for Web3 advancement. Among emerging projects, Web3Bay stands out as a transformative force in e-commerce. Its decentralized model merges Web2 and Web3 functionalities, enabling users to acquire digital assets and physical goods with enhanced security and transparency. As platforms that blend blockchain advantages with practical applications become increasingly sought after, the chance to secure 3BAY tokens at the current price is fleeting.

38917089,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=674650,1736809222,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Solana Consolidates In A Bullish Pattern – A Breakout ‘Could Spark A 40% Move’,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-consolidates-in-a-bullish-pattern-a-breakout-could-spark-a-40-move/,"Solana (SOL) finds itself at a critical juncture as the broader crypto market weathers a bearish consolidation phase. Since January 6, Solana has shed over 20% of its value, with losses extending to more than 33% since late November, reflecting the challenging conditions across the sector. Related Reading: XRP Scores A Lower High Break On Daily – ATH Next? This downturn has placed Solana under the spotlight as both investors and analysts closely monitor its next move. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Solana is currently consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern—a formation often seen during periods of indecision in the market. This pattern suggests that Solana could either break out and recover or break down and continue its descent, depending on upcoming market catalysts. A decisive move for Solana could set the tone for the weeks ahead. While the bearish sentiment weighs heavily on the market, Solana’s position as a leading altcoin keeps it in focus for investors seeking potential opportunities. All eyes are now on the symmetrical triangle as traders prepare for the volatility that a breakout or breakdown could bring. Will Solana regain its momentum, or is further downside in store? Solana Faces Critical Consolidation As Market Awaits Next Move Solana, often hailed as a market leader since 2023, has faced significant headwinds in recent weeks. The altcoin has struggled to maintain crucial support levels, with consistent losses placing it in a precarious position. Once a beacon of strength, Solana now finds itself grappling with bearish sentiment, testing investor patience and market resilience. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Solana is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle—a formation known for signaling potential volatility. According to Martinez, a breakout above $214 or a breakdown below $183 could trigger a 40% move in either direction, making this a critical moment for SOL. With the price currently hovering below the bearish target, a close below today’s levels could confirm a further correction and send Solana spiraling toward lower support zones. Despite these challenges, not all hope is lost. Solana’s robust fundamentals and its historical ability to recover could pave the way for a quick bounce or a period of sideways consolidation. A reversal in market sentiment, driven by macro or ecosystem-specific catalysts, could propel Solana back into bullish territory. However, the path forward depends heavily on how SOL navigates the current triangle formation. Related Reading: Whales Buy 470 Million Dogecoin In 48 Hours As Price Tests Crucial Demand Level – Details As investors brace for potential volatility, the coming days will likely determine whether Solana can reclaim its leadership status or succumb to further selling pressure. A decisive move is imminent, and market participants are keeping a close eye on these critical price levels. Will Solana defy the bears and stage a recovery, or is a deeper correction on the horizon? The next steps will define Solana’s trajectory in this uncertain market climate. SOL Tests Key Demand Level Solana is currently trading at $177, testing the critical support provided by the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA). This level has historically served as a stronghold for bullish reversals, making it a pivotal area for SOL to defend in the face of broader market declines. The ongoing market downturn has placed significant pressure on Solana, highlighting the importance of maintaining the $175 level. If the price can stabilize and hold above this mark, it may signal a potential rebound or at least a pause in the bearish momentum. However, failing to secure support here could result in further downside, with the next significant support zone around $155. Market participants are closely monitoring these levels as Solana navigates this critical phase. The daily close will be crucial in determining whether SOL can maintain its structure and build a foundation for recovery or if it risks deeper corrections. A breakdown below the $175 mark would likely intensify selling pressure, potentially triggering additional losses as the market searches for equilibrium.

Among these, 1Fuel has emerged as a leading contender. This development reflects a broader market trend in which meme coin investors—like Shiba Inu and PEPE owners—are increasingly leaning toward tokens that provide both functionality and long-term value. With an ongoing presale selling over $135,000,000 coins at $0.015 per token, 1Fuel is swiftly emerging as the best cryptocurrency to buy right now. Read on to find out why. Shiba Inu and PEPE: Recent market performances At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, especially among meme coins like PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Though the SHIB ecosystem has grown, particularly with the Shibarium Layer-2 network, which has completed over 600 million transactions—the Shiba Inu coin has seen recent reductions in market value. According to CoinGecko, SHIB's price has dropped -8.4% over the past seven days, underperforming both the global cryptocurrency market and GMCI 30 Index coins. Meanwhile, PEPE was introduced in 2024 to renowned exchange platforms such as Coinbase and Binance.US. has also experienced some devaluation in the past days. The price of Pepe has dropped 12.9% over the past seven days, underperforming both the global cryptocurrency market and Ethereum Ecosystem coins. Although the recent underperformance by SHIB and PEPE does not diminish their overall market value, a prevailing sense of caution lurks among meme coin investors due to the inherently speculative nature of these tokens. 1Fuel’s DeFi value proposition 1Fuel's prominence stems from its capacity to bridge the gap between speculative buzz and actual use. Unlike Shiba Inu and PEPE, which gained momentum through virality and community driven movements, 1Fuel is founded on utility driven applications that meet the evolving demands of the DeFi industry. The network offers a wide range of offers for investors on the lookout for the best cryptocurrency investment. 1Fuel allows users the liberty to choose the coin they intend to trade. The wallet then simplifies all related intricacies, ensuring that cross chain transactions are straightforward. Cross chain transactions can be pricey, especially if they include several phases, such as linking fees and token swaps. But 1Fuel lessens these expenses by identifying and implementing the most effective transaction procedures. 1Fuel’s edge over meme coins Shiba Inu and PEPE owners are no strangers to risky moves and speculative operations.

Namun, para analis memprediksi bahwa tahun ini akan menjadi puncak bull market. Jika prediksi tersebut benar, ini mungkin menjadi waktu yang sempurna untuk menambah kripto baru ke dalam portofolio Anda. Berikut adalah 5 kripto terbaik untuk dibeli demi potensi keuntungan hingga 100x tahun ini: Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe adalah proyek baru yang menghadirkan angin segar bagi sektor meme coin. Proyek ini menghidupkan kembali semangat pergerakan Wall Street Bets tahun 2021, membangun komunitas pedagang sehari-hari yang bersatu untuk mengalahkan whale di permainan mereka sendiri. Dengan memanfaatkan karakter utama siklus ini, yaitu Pepe, proyek ini menawarkan serangkaian alat perdagangan dan hadiah komunitas untuk membantu anggotanya meraih kemenangan di pasar. Fitur-fiturnya meliputi sinyal perdagangan, pilihan meme coin, grup insider trading, staking, dan hadiah perdagangan. Pendekatan ini menciptakan efek flywheel; semakin efektif upaya perdagangan komunitas, semakin besar dana yang mereka miliki, yang dapat kembali diarahkan ke token $WEPE . Kombinasi utilitas dan elemen meme ini menarik minat banyak investor. Dalam sebulan, presale Wall Street Pepe berhasil mengumpulkan lebih dari $47,5 juta. Harga saat ini adalah $0.00036647, tetapi akan terus meningkat selama ICO, dengan kenaikan harga berikutnya dijadwalkan hari ini. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi Wall Street Pepe di sini . Solaxy Solaxy hadir untuk mengatasi masalah kemacetan yang dihadapi oleh blockchain Solana dengan membangun layer 2 pertama untuk blockchain tersebut. Layer 2 Solaxy menggabungkan transaksi dan memprosesnya di luar jaringan utama, sehingga membebaskan ruang blok Solana sekaligus menawarkan throughput transaksi yang lebih cepat dan lebih murah. Solusi ini juga menangani masalah kegagalan transaksi Solana. Berdasarkan data dari Dune Analytics, 41,78% transaksi di jaringan Solana gagal kemarin. Solaxy menyediakan lingkungan yang lebih stabil, di mana transaksi non-vote dapat diproses tanpa hambatan. Selain itu, token $SOLX dapat dibeli di jaringan Ethereum. Tim Solaxy berupaya menjembatani dua ekosistem kripto terbesar, menggabungkan volume tinggi Solana dengan infrastruktur DeFi Ethereum yang kokoh. Saat ini, $SOLX tersedia untuk dibeli melalui presale token, yang telah mengumpulkan $10 juta sejauh ini. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi presale Solaxy di sini . Flockerz Flockerz adalah meme coin yang sedang bersiap untuk terdaftar di bursa setelah mencapai kesuksesan besar dalam presale. Proyek ini dibangun berdasarkan ide desentralisasi, memberikan otonomi penuh kepada komunitasnya untuk menentukan arah masa depan proyek. Flockerz membangun organisasi otonom terdesentralisasi (DAO) di mana pengguna dapat memberikan suara pada semua keputusan penting, seperti pengelolaan anggaran, strategi pemasaran, dan bahkan proyek mana yang akan diajak bermitra. Selain itu, Flockerz memperkenalkan konsep inovatif bernama Vote-to-Earn, di mana pengguna dibayar untuk berpartisipasi dalam voting di DAO. Pendekatan ini meningkatkan keterlibatan komunitas sekaligus mendorong pengambilan keputusan yang lebih efektif. Flockerz akan terdaftar di bursa dalam 8 hari ke depan. Namun, saat ini masih menjalani presale token yang telah mengumpulkan $9,8 juta. Dengan permintaan yang tinggi dan peluncuran di bursa yang semakin dekat, ini mungkin menjadi kesempatan terakhir untuk membeli $FLOCK dengan harga rendah saat ini. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi presale Flockerz di sini . Best Wallet Token Best Wallet adalah dompet kripto baru yang saat ini mengalami pertumbuhan yang sangat pesat. Basis pengguna dompet ini meningkat dengan tingkat pertumbuhan bulanan sebesar 50%, membuktikan bahwa fitur-fitur inovatifnya berhasil menarik perhatian komunitas kripto. Fitur-fitur yang ditawarkan meliputi kartu debit kripto, agregator presale, bursa desentralisasi untuk spot dan derivatif, agregator staking, serta dukungan untuk lebih dari 60 blockchain.

Sementara itu, Best Wallet telah mengumpulkan $7 juta dari presale, menunjukkan potensi keuntungan yang signifikan bagi para investor. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi presale Best Wallet Token di sini . Meme Index Meme Index adalah platform investasi meme coin terdesentralisasi pertama di dunia. Platform ini memungkinkan pengguna untuk membeli keranjang “baskets” meme coin yang terdiversifikasi dalam satu transaksi. Dengan platform ini, investor dapat dengan mudah mendapatkan eksposur yang terdiversifikasi di sektor meme coin dengan cara yang belum pernah dilakukan sebelumnya. Beberapa bursa terpusat seperti Bitpanda dan Swissborg memang menawarkan keranjang meme coin, tetapi hanya satu jenis. Sebaliknya, Meme Index menyediakan empat jenis keranjang yang berbeda. Keranjang ini bervariasi mulai dari volatilitas rendah hingga sangat tinggi, sehingga dapat memenuhi kebutuhan investor dengan berbagai tingkat toleransi risiko dan kondisi pasar. Investor yang lebih berhati-hati mungkin memilih keranjang dengan volatilitas rendah. Di sisi lain, pedagang dapat memanfaatkan keranjang ini selama masa ketidakpastian pasar. Dalam periode bullish, investor biasanya beralih ke keranjang volatilitas tinggi untuk memaksimalkan potensi keuntungan. Token $MEMEX memegang peran sentral dalam operasional platform ini. Token ini memberikan akses ke platform, hak governance, serta hak untuk staking. Saat ini, presale untuk $MEMEX sedang berlangsung dan telah mengumpulkan $2,3 juta.

Dengan hasil presale yang luar biasa dari proyek-proyek ini, minat investor semakin meningkat, menunjukkan potensi besar untuk pertumbuhan nilai token di masa mendatang. Jika Anda mencari peluang untuk memaksimalkan keuntungan di tengah pasar yang bergejolak, token-token ini layak dipertimbangkan. Tidak ada waktu yang lebih baik untuk bertindak selain sekarang. Dengan presale yang sedang berlangsung dan momentum yang terus berkembang, ini adalah kesempatan emas untuk menjadi bagian dari proyek-proyek yang menjanjikan ini.

38918238,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=642872,1736811031,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38918238.jpeg,Top Nvidia clients delay orders of Blackwell racks due to technical glitches,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-nvidia-clients-delay-blackwell-orders/,"Overheating issues associated with ‘Blackwell’ racks have reportedly led Nvidia’s top customers to delay orders of the AI chip maker’s latest offering. A rack is a structure used in data centers to house chips, cables, and other essential equipment. The news comes at a time when the Biden administration announced new AI rules that raised concerns among investors, leading to a sharp sell-off in AI-related stocks, including Nvidia whose shares went down 4% in early trading Monday. Clients reportedly cut on Blackwell orders It was reported that the first shipments of racks with Blackwell chips overheated and exhibited glitches in the way chips connected to one another. According to reports, Nvidia’s major customers, that is Microsoft, Amazon’s cloud division, Alphabet’s Google, and Meta Platforms are said to have cut some orders of the chipmakers’ Blackwell GB200 racks. Reports also show that so-called hyperscalers had each placed Blackwell rack orders worth $10 billion or more. Due to this development, some customers are said to be waiting for an improved version of the racks or acquire the existing older AI chips from the manufacturer. GB200 racks with at least 50,000 Blackwell chips were being planned to be installed in Microsoft’s Pheonix facilities, the report added. However, key partner OpenAI asked Microsoft to provide it with an older generation of Nvidia’s ‘Hopper’ chips as delays popped up. Since there are other purchasers of the overheating GB200 server racks, it is now unclear how the order cuts would impact the chipmaker’s sales. The company, together with other AI-related firms is already affected by the introduction of new AI rules under the Biden administration, which include export restrictions. The Information initially reported about Blackwell’s overheating late last year adding this was going to affect other tech firms like Meta and Google that rely on the technology for their data centers. The Information further reported that the overheating arose from chips placed in server racks that were meant to support up to 72 units. As part of efforts to limit the challenge, Nvidia reportedly requested vendors to repeatedly rebuild racks. Nvidia might miss its targets The Blackwell AI chips were first unveiled in March and were supposed to hit the market in the second quarter but faced delays in deliveries subsequently affecting client deployment schedules. A Tom’s Hardware report indicated that the Blackwell AI chips release was already delayed by several months because Nvidia was working on a design flaw that affected production yields. The chips combine two silicon components into one unit meant to run times quicker than past versions in jobs like chatbot answer creation. In November Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company was on track to exceed an earlier target of recording several billions in revenue from Blackwell chips in its fourth fiscal quarter. It waits to be seen how the chipmaker will achieve this with myriad of challenges arising. It comes as AI chip and technology exports are being further restricted by the US government, potentially hurting Nvidia’s sales. The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that will limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop AI, part of an effort to preserve America’s six-to-18 month advantage on AI over rivals such as China. The proposed framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict 120 countries to the chips used for data centers and AI products. Nvidia said on Monday that the proposal was not well thought after. “The proposal is misguided and said that it threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.” Nvidia. Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve US companies’ advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, that “it’s critical to preserve America’s leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips.” “The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving, and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.” A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put US companies at a disadvantage.

But one rising token in 2025 is drawing attention away from their LINK and XRP holders as investors seek out new blockchain projects that promise bigger & better returns. Let’s look at the key factors that led to this change in priorities and what it means for the investors in these new OFT tokens. Chainlink (LINK): A Pioneer in Decentralized Oracles Chainlink’s most famous attribute, yet most frequently miscomprehended, is its architecture that serves as the foundation of decentralized oracles through its structured approach in which smart contracts securely and reliably access professional external information. Chainlink has played a key role in the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi), allowing for communication between on-chain and off-chain systems. It remains one of its most valuable features. Chainlink, now priced at roughly $20.10 , has demonstrated steady growth, with this year's performance at 39.63%. The gain is indeed impressive, but it feels low when compared with the appreciation of newer projects. With the advent of new blockchain opportunities like 1Fuel, many LINK holders are reassessing their strategies to add future-yielding cryptos investments to their arsenal. Chainlink’s tech is absolutely crucial, but as the market matures, it will probably also have slightly less appeal to higher-risk, higher-reward investors. This is where 1Fuel’s approach is vital, as it comes with features that solve scalability, efficiency, and interoperability problems. XRP: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments In pioneering faster and cheaper cross-border payments, XRP has enabled this revolution. XRP is a token developed by Ripple Labs that combines traditional finance with blockchain systems through its use in the remittance market. Partnerships with leading financial firms made it an accepted token for international transactions. XRP as at the time of writing, trades at $2.54 and this is a long way since its turbulent history. Still, questions about its sustainable growth remain, given regulatory restrictions and the volatility of the market. Stressing these revolutionary aspects, it has also pushed some investors to see the light in future-oriented crypto investments such as 1Fuel that translate innovation, and untapped potential. 1Fuel makes a strong case for XRP holders. With more of the market focusing on security and function, the project’s emphasis on user privacy, transaction efficiency, and cross-chain compatibility is timely. It also allows investors to be a part of its presale stages and benefit from its growth from the ground up. 1Fuel: The Emerging Contender 1Fuel (OFT) stands out as one of the most mentioned projects of 2025 in the blockchain ecosystem. It solves some of the most salient challenges to date, like interoperability, scalability, and sustainability, making it one of the most exciting emerging blockchain opportunities in the entire ecosystem today. 1Fuel has also achieved tremendous investor confidence, which has allowed it to surpass over $1 million raised in its presale stages. Stage 3 of the presale is now selling tokens at $0.015 each , with a 20% purchase bonus, making it a very appealing option for early investors. Market analysts expect re-entering onto 1Fuel to produce 1000% returns post-launch, and this has received notable insight from Chainlink and XRP investors. Moreover, the project's roadmap for 2025 and even beyond, includes connections to DeFi platforms and unique staking mechanisms. This forward-thinking approach has made them a powerhouse to be reckoned with ahead of competition within the token market and if you are looking for better gains than Chainlink and XRP, then look no further. Conclusion Investment strategies must be constantly re-evaluated due to the state of the cryptocurrency market. XRP and Chainlink holders will find a powerful opportunity awaiting the emergence of 1Fuel to enhance their portfolios. 1Fuel's innovative concept and consistent presale results are a promising combination for a project that's definitely one to watch.

In a Jan. 13 statement, Tether revealed that it had secured authorization to operate as a digital asset service provider and stablecoin issuer in El Salvador. The company cited the nation’s “forward-thinking policies, favorable regulatory environment, and growing Bitcoin-savvy community” as key reasons for the move. “This decision is a natural progression for Tether as it allows us to build a new home, foster collaboration, and strengthen our focus on emerging markets,” said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. He added, “By rooting ourselves [in El Salvador], we are not only aligning with a country that shares our vision in terms of financial freedom, innovation, and resilience but is also reinforcing our commitment to empowering people worldwide through decentralized technologies.” The relocation follows reports that Ardoino and Tether’s Chief Operating Officer, Claudia Lagorio, purchased property and became naturalized citizens of El Salvador in 2024. Cointelegraph reached out to Tether for further comment but received no response at the time of publication. El Salvador and Bitcoin Adoption Since President Nayib Bukele announced plans to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, El Salvador has become a hub for cryptocurrency initiatives. In 2023, Tether pledged support for one of the country’s renewable energy projects, including geothermal energy facilities. Ardoino has reportedly met with Bukele on several occasions, expressing support for the president’s efforts to attract businesses and new residents. While Bukele has claimed Bitcoin adoption has been a “net positive” for the nation, some expected benefits have yet to materialize. As of December, the Salvadoran government reported holding over 6,000 BTC, valued at more than $550 million.

Now, as holders attempt new tokens in 2025, established project leaders such as Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) will pave the way, like in 2024. Currently, there is one token making huge rounds in the market, a project that analysts are claiming could yield huge returns this year, and that token is none other than 1Fuel . With that in mind, what does the migration to 1Fuel mean for the performance and prospects for Cardano and Solana? Cardano (ADA): A Blockchain With a Strong Foundation Since its launch, Cardano , one of the main players in the crypto space, has increasingly become known for security, scalability and sustainability. Today, Cardano (ADA) serves as an open-source proof-of-stake blockchain platform founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson along with philosophy on formal verification as well as peer reviewed research. There’s a large community behind in it, and an enviable list of investors who apparently like its approach to blockchain development. As of early 2025, Cardano's current price of $1.01 has remained fairly stable for a while and has seen low volatility. Its ecosystem goes on expanding with an increasing number of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts being deployed on the platform, its growth nevertheless appears to have hit a divergence from that of other altcoins. 1Fuel has rapidly become an attractive opportunity to maximize returns for Cardano holders seeking to invest their assets elsewhere. Given its unique offerings and impressive presale results, Cardano investors are considering how high the price may go in the coming months. Solana (SOL): High-Speed Performance Meets Scalability Solana has emerged as one of the fastest-growing blockchain networks owing to its super-fast transaction speeds and low fees. With over 65,000 transactions per second , it has become a leading platform for different decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, NFT projects, and dApps. Solana’s blockchain is also extremely scalable, which is a major differentiator in a space where a lot of blockchains face congestion during peak utilization periods. As of now in January 2025, the price of Solana is a pretty solid one, we see it at $189 but it does not mean that its journey on the market was smooth. Even with the performance, Solana's price has been turbulent, weighed down by network collapses and other blockchain projects' competition. For these types of investors who have benefitted from the earlier years of Solana, 1Fuel provides the opportunity to migrate into yet another potentially more stable, high-growth token. With the 1Fuel presale gaining momentum, many Solana holders are questioning if now is the right moment to diversify into this exciting new asset. The Growing Interest in 1Fuel: What Sets It Apart? A major driving force behind the growing popularity of 1Fuel is its capacity to fulfill existing demand in the blockchain ecosystem. While others like Cardano and Solana are working well but on specific niches, 1Fuel has its sights set on new things that pull in a much larger crowd. With development focused on making DeFi more useful for investors, the platform cross-chain functionality will likely be a key part of enabling better cross-platform interaction. 1Fuel presale success, even before the official launch, is indicative of this token's appeal with analysts indicating that 1Fuel is likely to outperform the current market leaders Cardano and Solana in the coming years. Conclusion Although Cardano and Solana are still two popular options among cryptocurrency investors, 1Fuel has been attracting more interest from those seeking fresh opportunities. With the project continuing to build its momentum, Cardano and Solana holders are starting to pay very close attention to this emerging token, asking themselves if it's now time to diversify and take advantage of 1Fuel's growth potential into 2025 and beyond.

The incoming order will reverse a regulatory guideline that has shaped how financial institutions account for and custody digital assets, reports the Washington Post. “…Trump is expected to issue executive orders on the first day of his presidency that may address issues including “de-banking” and the repeal of a controversial crypto accounting policy requiring banks holding digital assets to count them as liabilities on the bank’s own balance sheet, according to a person involved with the conversations.” The expected executive order is designed to reverse SAB 121, an SEC guideline that requires certain financial entities to list even the crypto assets they hold on behalf of customers as liabilities. Crypto proponents say the guideline blocks financial institutions’ ability to enter the digital asset arena. A bill aiming to eliminate SAB 121 recently passed both the House and the Senate, but President Biden vetoed the bill.

Her concerns, outlined in a detailed 31-page letter, focus on Bessent’s stance on crypto regulation, financial deregulation, tax policies, and the challenges faced by small banks. Senator Elizabeth Warren Presses Treasury Nominee Bessent on Crypto and Tax Policies In a 31-page letter to Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent, Senator Elizabeth Warren emphasized the need for clear crypto oversight. She questioned whether the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) should have authority over stablecoins to address risks like money laundering and sanctions evasion. Warren urged Bessent to provide a plan for regulating crypto companies that pose threats to financial stability. Moreover, on tax policy, Warren challenged Bessent’s support for the 2017 tax cuts enacted during the Trump administration, which added $4.5 trillion to the federal deficit. She criticized his “3-3-3” strategy, which proposes reducing taxes, lowering the deficit, and boosting economic growth. The anti-crypto Senator demanded specifics on how Bessent would enforce the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) and address the carried interest loophole. Concerns Over Deregulation and Financial Stability Additionally, Warren scrutinized Bessent’s endorsement of deregulation, linking it to the 2008 financial crisis and the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). She cited the Federal Reserve’s report blaming weakened regulations for SVB’s failure. More so, the anti-crypto Senator asked whether Bessent agreed with the assessment. Senator Warren asked, “Do you agree with this assessment? What’s your plan to ensure deregulation doesn’t cause another banking crisis?” Nevertheless, Warren highlighted the importance of upholding the Dodd-Frank Act, which was designed to prevent financial crises. She sought assurance that Bessent would enforce these crypto regulations and avoid policies that could lead to another economic downturn. Decline of Small Banks and Community Banking The senator also pointed out the decline of small banks, which dropped from 84% of all U.S. banks in 1994 to 52% by 2022. She raised concerns about the survival of community banks and their role in supporting small businesses. Warren questioned Bessent’s strategy to ensure smaller banks can thrive amid industry consolidation and financial instability. She also asked for Bessent’s views on proposals to limit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) ability to sell failing banks to large institutions. Warren emphasized the need for bipartisan measures to raise deposit insurance limits for small businesses. Similarly, Elizabeth Warren criticized Republican-led efforts to cut $20 billion from the IRS budget. She warned of the impact of enforcing tax compliance for large corporations. More so, the anti-crypto Senator questioned how Bessent would maintain audit quality and recover revenue without adequate funding. Despite questioning by Senator Warren on crypto policies, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed Scott Bessent as a pro-innovation choice for Treasury Secretary. Garlinghouse expressed optimism for XRP and crypto progress under Bessent, signaling potential clarity on the Ripple-SEC case.

While Dogecoin’s momentum has since slowed, this experienced investor has set their sights on a new opportunity: PropiChain . PropiChain is being hailed as the next millionaire-making crypto, combining blockchain, AI, and real estate innovation. Here’s why this trader, and many others, believe PropiChain could be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. From Dogecoin Fame to Spotting Hidden Gems Dogecoin’s rise was nothing short of amazing, with prices soaring from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of $0.70. For early adopters, it was a life-changing event. However, Dogecoin’s current performance has slowed down, leaving investors searching for the next big thing. That’s where PropiChain steps in. PropiChain is designed to revolutionize the $300 trillion real estate market. The Dogecoin millionaire sees PropiChain as a transformative project, offering practical applications and massive growth potential that make it a standout in the crowded crypto market. What Makes PropiChain Different? PropiChain allows fractional ownership of high-value properties, breaking down barriers to real estate investment. For example, instead of needing $1 million to invest in a luxury property, you can buy fractional shares for as little as $100. This opens up real estate opportunities to everyday investors who were previously excluded from the market. This also means you can earn a portion of the rental income proportionate to your investment. It’s a tangible, ongoing revenue stream in addition to potential token appreciation. PropiChain also integrates cutting-edge AI to provide predictive market insights. Investors receive tools for anticipating trends, assessing market dynamics, and making informed decisions. For example, the platform can identify high-demand property types or forecast rental yields, helping you optimize your portfolio. Another feature is the metaverse integration. Investors can explore properties virtually, allowing them to assess layouts, locations, and features without ever leaving their homes. This immersive experience bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds, making international property investment more accessible than ever. Moreover, blockchain ensures secure and transparent transactions, eliminating the risk of fraud. Every property token and transaction is recorded immutably, providing investors with peace of mind. Additionally, smart contracts automate processes like rental payments, reducing delays and costs. PropiChain Presale: A Millionaire-Making Opportunity? PropiChain’s presale is generating significant attention, with over $2 million raised so far. Now in Stage 2, tokens are priced at $0.011, with prices expected to rise to $0.023 in Stage 3. The Dogecoin trader who turned $1,000 into $3 million believes PropiChain’s real-world utility and market potential could lead to a 30,000% surge. That means a $1,000 investment today could potentially grow to $300,000 in the future. This opportunity isn’t just for crypto veterans. PropiChain’s presale provides an affordable entry point for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio with a promising AI-driven altcoin. Why PropiChain Could Surpass Dogecoin While Dogecoin relies largely on community-driven hype, PropiChain offers real-world value. Its focus on solving inefficiencies in the real estate market gives it an edge, especially as investors increasingly prioritize utility over speculation. The Dogecoin millionaire’s endorsement underscores PropiChain’s potential to deliver exponential returns. It’s a chance to be part of a project that’s not just about token value but also about reshaping a trillion-dollar industry. Conclusion With endorsements from experienced investors and a clear roadmap for growth, PropiChain is well positioned to become the next millionaire-making crypto. Don’t wait until prices climb higher in Stage 3. Secure your spot in the presale now and join the ranks of early adopters who stand to benefit from PropiChain’s game-changing potential.

The current Polkadot price analysis suggests continuing volatility, provoking queries about its prospective performance. Simultaneously, the Bitget Token (BGB) expansion is progressing with significant cross-chain integrations and targeted strategies aimed at augmenting its utility and market value. Concurrently, Web3Bay (3BAY) is capturing significant interest in the Web3 e-commerce sector with a remarkable $630K presale, having sold over 180 million coins. At a modest price of $0.0039675, Web3Bay provides an opportunity for investors to support a platform dedicated to user autonomy, scalability, and community-oriented governance. Armed with a definitive roadmap and innovative functionalities like Layer-2 scaling and DAO governance, Web3Bay is setting itself up as a frontrunner in the decentralized e-commerce landscape. Current Trends in Polkadot Price Analysis Suggest Market Uncertainty The ongoing Polkadot price analysis indicates heightened volatility as DOT faces challenges in maintaining stability. Currently trading around $6.71, Polkadot has witnessed an 11.62% decrease, stirring unease among investors. The technical indicators suggest a downward trend, with the token positioned below the 20-day moving average and a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 41.88, indicating subdued buyer interest. Polkadot price analysis also underscores a critical support level at $6.50, beneath which further declines could escalate selling pressures. On-chain metrics reveal $1.23 million in long liquidations, exacerbating the downward trend. Nevertheless, certain analysts hold a cautiously optimistic view, suggesting a potential rally towards the $20 threshold if Polkadot can surpass key resistance levels. Investors remain vigilant for any indicators of a market turnaround amid these challenging conditions. BGB Expansion Enhances Ecosystem Capabilities The Bitget Token (BGB) expansion is forging ahead, driven by its recent integration with Morph Chain that facilitates effortless cross-chain transfers, thus amplifying BGB’s presence in decentralized finance. Newly established liquidity pools, like the one on Bulbaswap, have amassed over $1.1 million, providing staking incentives to participants. Furthermore, BGB Token expansion strategy includes a strategic buyback and burn initiative, designed to decrease supply and augment its long-term value. Future plans to incorporate BGB with payment systems such as PayFi highlight Bitget’s dedication to broadening BGB’s utility across both decentralized and traditional markets. Web3Bay: Fusing E-Commerce with Web3 Crypto Innovations Web3Bay is reshaping online commerce through its blockchain-integrated platform, merging traditional e-commerce functionalities with cutting-edge Web3 crypto innovations. Priced at only $0.0039675, Web3Bay has successfully raised over $630K, distributing more than 180 million coins. The platform’s vision to empower users with comprehensive control over their data and assets while shopping on the Web3Bay platform is rapidly gaining traction. With aims to facilitate worldwide, unrestricted transactions and incentivize user engagement through its native 3BAY token, Web3Bay is pioneering a new era in online commerce. At its essence, Web3Bay is committed to extensive scalability and democratic governance. It is transitioning towards a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which will allow token holders to influence the platform’s strategic direction. This commitment to fostering user participation positions Web3Bay not just as another crypto endeavor but as a leader in the decentralized e-commerce revolution. To support anticipated growth, Web3Bay is integrating Layer-2 solutions like rollups to manage high transaction volumes efficiently while maintaining both speed and cost-effectiveness. Its plans to introduce NFT marketplaces, staking opportunities, and cross-chain functionality further underline its strategic expansion initiatives. For those observing from the sidelines, this presale offers a unique opportunity to invest early in a project with a transparent roadmap and a firm commitment to community and scalability. Web3Bay isn’t merely constructing a platform—it’s crafting the future of online commerce, where not participating now could mean missing out on a significant opportunity for substantial growth. In Conclusion As we observe significant movements across various blockchain projects, Polkadot price analysis continues to indicate market challenges as it attempts to stabilize, prompting caution among traders regarding future directions. In parallel, the Bitget Token (BGB) expansion is reinforcing its ecosystem with cross-chain integrations, liquidity enhancements, and strategic supply reduction tactics, bolstering its long-term potential. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is emerging as a formidable force in the Web3 crypto landscape, having raised over $630K and sold 180 million tokens. This project is revolutionizing e-commerce through user empowerment, scalability, and decentralized governance, presenting an attractive proposition for those eager to invest in the future of online commerce.

However, this volatility has led some whales to lose confidence and dump their holdings, impacting the market today. Crypto Whale Dump $22 Million of SOL On January 13, 2024, Whale Alert, a blockchain-based transaction tracker, posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a crypto whale had dumped 122,620 SOL tokens worth $21.75 million onto the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. However, the wallet address remains unknown. 122,620 #SOL (21,748,048 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Kraken https://t.co/HIUF9pQDDf — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 13, 2025 This notable dump was witnessed in the market when SOL fell below its crucial support level of $175 and approached the $168 level. This initially shifted market sentiment and indicated that SOL had broken down from its crucial support level, signaling bearish price action. However, as sentiment cooled down, SOL rebounded above the support level and appears to be recovering. Solana (SOL) Price Action and Key Level According to expert technical analysis, the key level for SOL in the upcoming days is $175. SOL remains bullish as long as it holds this support level. If it sustains this level, there is a strong possibility that it could soar by 22% to reach $220 in the future. Source: Trading View Currently, the altcoin has returned to its consolidation zone, where it has remained for the last four trading days. For intraday traders, if SOL closes an hourly candle above the $193 mark, there is a strong possibility that it could witness a price surge of over 7% to reach the $207 mark. However, Solana’s bullish thesis will only hold if SOL maintains itself above the $175 level, otherwise, it may fail. Bullish Signal From Technical Analysis On the positive side, despite this price decline, SOL has held itself above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating an uptrend. Additionally, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near the oversold area, signaling a potential price recovery that traders and investors are anticipating. Current Price Momentum Currently, SOL is trading near $183.3 and has experienced a price decline of over 2.50% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume surged by 240%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors, potentially driven by SOL’s current discounted price.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-14 00:02:11

Through its X platform , Coinbase posted that the transfers for PNUT will be available on Coinbase and Coinbase Exchange in regions where Trading is supported; it further clarified: Trading will begin on or after 9 AM PT on January 14 2025 if liquidity conditions are met. Once this asset is sufficiently supplied, trading on our PNUT-USD trading pair will launch in phases. Support for PNUT may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions. ~Coinbase PNUT is gaining popularity as most exchanges continue to list it PNUT has been growing popular and gaining attention from different crypto exchanges. KuCoin was the first to announce the listing of the meme coin in early November before it began trading on November 11, 2024. Coinbase’s announcement was timely for the crypto, as it caused the coin to jump almost 30% to trade at $1.29. This is a significant shift, considering that the coin is very new in the market. Currently, the meme coin’s market capitalization stands at $1.28 billion. The New York Department of Conservation blessed the crypto society with its euthanization of squirrel mascot PNUT began with the New York Department of Conservation euthanizing a squirrel mascot named Peanut. The incident was controversial, making it viral and trending on social media. Soon, the meme transformed into a digital asset with a massive following on Crypto Twitter, reaching a significant market value. The meme coin trades above its peers, including POPCAT and MOG COIN. Its presence in serious crypto exchange platforms like Binance and Coinbase may grow the token tenfold.

Meme coins are taking over, and 2025 is shaping up to be the year of hilarious innovation paired with serious gains. Whether you’re a seasoned degen or a fresh-faced investor, the ever-evolving meme coin ecosystem offers something for everyone. These quirky tokens bring more than laughs—they deliver financial potential. Leading the charge is BTFD Coin, the breakout sensation smashing presale records with over $5.1 million raised, 64 billion coins sold, and a community of 8,200+ Bulls cheering it on. And it’s not just the numbers turning heads— BTFD Coin’s 90% APY on staking is redefining passive income opportunities in the crypto world. Hot on its heels is Notcoin (NOT), which thrives on dip-buying opportunities, and the audacious Book of Meme (BOME), bringing decentralization to meme culture. Together, they make up the trio of top new meme coins to buy this year, and each is here to shake up the space. BTFD Coin: 90% Staking APY That’ll Have You Saying “Bull-yah!” Let’s talk about BTFD Coin, the project that’s practically screaming, “Buy the dip!” It’s not just a meme; it’s a lifestyle. The presale numbers alone are jaw-dropping: over $5.1M raised, and that’s just the appetizer. But the main course? A game-changing staking feature with an insane 90% APY. Translation: your crypto can make more crypto, faster than you can say “Lambo.” Why Staking Matters for You Imagine this: You invest $3,000 into BTFD Coin at its current presale price of $0.000142 per token. That nets you approximately 21,126,760 BTFD Coins. Now, let’s say the price skyrockets to $0.0006 (a conservative projection, given the hype). Your tokens would then be worth a whopping $12,675, not including staking rewards. Factor in the 90% APY, and your wallet’s doing happy flips. More Than Just Staking BTFD Coin isn’t a one-trick pony. Its ecosystem is packed with features, from a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that rewards players with convertible in-game tokens to a vibrant community led by the “Bulls Squad” —a cast of characters as dynamic as the coin itself. Add Ethereum’s scalability and Layer 2 solutions into the mix, and you’ve got a project built to last. With momentum like this, there’s no reason to sit on the sidelines. Join the movement, stake your claim (literally), and watch your portfolio grow. Notcoin (NOT): A Tap-to-Earn Pioneer with Dip-Buying Power Remember when games were just for fun? Notcoin says, “Let’s make it profitable, too.” This community-driven token got its start in a viral Telegram game that brought thousands into the web3 space with a simple tap-to-earn mechanic. Today, NOT is more than a game; it’s a thriving ecosystem where users can explore web3 products, contribute to projects, and earn tokens. Why NOT’s Dip is a Win At $0.006063, NOT’s price has dipped 7% in the last 24 hours, creating a prime opportunity for dip buyers. Its market cap of $621M and growing adoption across Telegram and beyond suggest that the token is far from a fleeting trend. With a max supply nearing its cap, scarcity could drive future price increases, making now the perfect time to hop aboard. A Platform for Builders Notcoin isn’t just for gamers. Developers can showcase their web3 products to an active, engaged community, creating a collaborative environment that benefits everyone involved. Whether you’re a builder, investor, or casual user, NOT offers avenues for participation—and profit. Book of Meme (BOME): Decentralized Storage Meets Meme Culture If you thought memes were just for laughs, think again. Book of Meme (BOME) is here to immortalize internet culture on the blockchain. This experimental project leverages decentralized storage solutions like Solana, Arweave, and IPFS to create a digital compendium of memes that will outlast even the most persistent TikTok trends. The Numbers Behind the Laughs Currently priced at $0.005417, BOME has seen a slight dip of 5%, but its $373M market cap shows there’s strong interest in its vision. With over 68 billion tokens in circulation, this project is all about creating a lasting impact on the decentralized social media space. Why BOME Stands Out The concept of preserving meme culture as an immutable, blockchain-based artifact is as innovative as it is hilarious. Combine this with trading opportunities, and you’ve got a recipe for long-term engagement. Plus, its storage expansions to Bitcoin inscriptions signal big plans for the future. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Meme-ment Meme coins have evolved into more than just jokes—they’re now platforms for community, creativity, and profit. If you’re looking for the top new meme coins to buy this year, BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Book of Meme deserve a place on your radar. BTFD Coin’s presale and staking APY are setting new standards, offering investors a chance to grow their portfolios exponentially. With Notcoin’s web3 integration and BOME’s innovative take on meme preservation, this trio is as diverse as it is exciting. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. Get in on BTFD Coin’s presale now and be part of the movement that’s redefining meme coins. Sign up today and stake your claim in the future of crypto!

What are his views on crypto?,https://crypto.news/bo-hines-is-a-future-exec-of-the-u-s-crypto-council-what-are-his-views-on-crypto/,"Hardly a well-known name in the crypto industry, former college football player and the young politician, Bo Hines, 29, got a high-profile appointment as an executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, (or the “Crypto Council”) position on Dec. 23, 2024. What are his views on crypto? Not surprisingly, Bo Hines is a pro-crypto politician – if he wasn’t, Trump wouldn’t have appointed him, given the bold support for crypto from the U.S. President-elect. Read more: Bo Hines named executive director of Donald Trump’s crypto council For years, Hines has been a consistent Joe Biden critic and a passionate Donald Trump supporter. This loyalty didn’t go unnoticed, and Trump endorsed Hines when the latter was fighting for the U.S. House seat in North Carolina in 2022. Trump called Hines an “America First patriot,” a “winner both on and off the field,” and “fighter for Conservative values.” Thankfully, Hines’ views on crypto are far from being conservative. Throughout the years, Hines made only a few statements concerning cryptocurrencies. Although Hines was never an avid crypto evangelist, his statements clearly show that he sees cryptocurrency and decentralized finance as a remedy to various problems on the national and individual levels. The statement from the Bo Hines For Congress website: Hines disapproves of overregulation and CBDCs One of these statements is a part of the program that can be found on the website dedicated to Hines’ run for Congress. The mention of DeFi is found in the Economy section of the website. As an ultra-patriot, Hines begins with the importance of the protection of American jobs and business at home and leans on the America First policies that will discourage businesses from fleeing the USA. Then, Hines speaks about the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector as a way to boost individual financial independence and inclusion, which is rather a commonplace opinion. Hines starts to show his vision when he states that he sees overregulation as a threat to innovation and future development of the DeFi sector. As a part of the Crypto Council, Hines will have to overcome many challenges in facilitating a balanced and delicate crypto regulation. Seemingly, during the Congress campaign, Hines saw the DeFi as the self-regulating ecosystem based on principles of free market, empowering individuals and institutions to grow in terms of finance. The emphasis on individuals was crucial for Hines, as he stated that crypto gives individuals control over their funds and opportunities. Another important statement that can be found on the Congress campaign website is Hines’ strong disapproval of the adoption of central banks’ digital currencies. Hines sees CBDCs as a threat to financial sovereignty and a violation of the decentralization principles. Bo Hines on X: free speech and individual empowerment in finance The only time Hines mentioned crypto on X before their appointment to the Crypto Council was on Jan. 17, 2024, when he called crypto “an epitome of individual empowerment in finance” and stressed that the government shouldn’t step in the organic growth of the sector. Ironically, now Hines is the one who’s stepping. We’ll see if he’s able to let the sector grow. “Decentralized finance is the way of the future if regulators don’t crush it,” he concluded. Cryptocurrency is the epitome of individual empowerment in finance. We don’t need the government stepping in and slapping burdensome regulations on financial innovation. This new sector needs the freedom to grow organically. Decentralized finance is the way of the future if… — Bo Hines (@BoHines) January 16, 2024 On many occasions, Hines took to X to support freedom of speech. The Bo Hines For Congress website mentions that free speech is “under assault from the Authoritarian Left in our country” and names free speech as one of the conditions for flourishing Democracy. https://twitter.com/BoHines/status/1365362692668739585 While Hines was speaking about the importance of freedom of expression on many occasions, in his remarks, he never made a connection between censorship resistance and blockchain. Considering the fact that blockchain is great for facilitating immutable, transparent, inclusive, and censorship-resistant networks, Hines, as a free speech maxi and crypto proponent, will probably appreciate the potential of blockchain in this regard. Despite all the dedication to free speech, Hines has been silent about his plans as an executive director of the Crypto Council. Following the appointment, Bo Hines expressed gratitude to his patron, Donald Trump and said he’s thrilled to work alongside David Sacks, a “Crypto Czar,” appointed by Trump earlier. Hopefully, soo,n we’ll learn what the Crypto Council is going to bring to the table.

Recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributors sheds light on Tron’s expanding ecosystem and revenue surge, presenting a compelling case for its role in blockchain technology’s ongoing evolution. One major highlight is the substantial increase in Tron’s daily on-chain revenue. According to the data shared by the analyst, Crazzyblockk, this rise has been driven by the network’s enhanced gas fee revenue and higher transaction volumes. Additionally, Tron’s price movement appears to be now becoming interesting as it approaches critical support and resistance levels, which could dictate its near-term trajectory. Related Reading: TRON Reclaims Its Crown With 43% Dominance In Altcoin Transactions Daily Revenue Growth Reflects Network Utility Tron’s daily on-chain revenue has grown by 119% since January 1, 2024, a metric closely tied to rising gas usage and increased transaction activity on its blockchain, according to CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk. This surge as disclosed by the analyst highlights Tron’s scalability in “processing high transaction volumes” while maintaining “cost efficiency.” The revenue growth also highlights the network’s expanding adoption within the decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract ecosystems. The network’s ability to generate substantial gas fee revenue serves as a benchmark for blockchain performance, with Tron’s figures signaling growing user engagement and utility. The analyst wrote: The year-to-date revenue expansion signals increasing user demand and network utility, further solidifying Tron’s position as a leading blockchain for high-speed, low-cost operations. Crazzyblockk also suggests that this trend reflects the network’s economic viability and its strengthening position among blockchains optimized for high-speed and low-cost operations. Additionally, this development is especially significant as blockchain networks compete to attract developers and investors with notable decentralized applications. The analyst concluded by noting: With this explosive momentum in daily revenue, Tron is setting a new standard for blockchain economic models. Investors, developers, and users alike should keep a close watch as this trend continues to reshape decentralized finance and smart contract adoption. Tron Approaches Key Level Meanwhile, from a technical perspective, Tron has reached a critical level near its 1-Year Moving Average (MA) plus two standard deviations, at approximately $0.25. Darkfost another CryptoQuant analyst warned that failing to hold this level could result in a decline to its 1-Year MA support of around $0.15. However, the analyst highlighted Tron’s ecosystem growth offers optimism for long-term investors. Related Reading: TRON Founder Justin Sun Expected to Meet Trump as Potential Web3 Advisor The network has seen notable activity, including a sharp increase in the USDT volume on its blockchain, which rose from $8 billion in early 2023 to $27 billion by late 2024. This growth points to strong adoption and an influx of capital into the Tron network. Additionally, metrics like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicate that TRX was recently oversold, a condition that in the past has often preceded bullish momentum.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS.

The hype stems from 1Fuel selling over 135 million units of tokens worth $1.24 million with the potential for a market surge. Analysts’ expectations for a potential 5,000% gain from its current presales price of $0.015 have drawn in a lot of savvy investors looking to multiply their portfolio balance significantly, a move SOL and WIF offers no more. SOL is on the losing end SOL’s performance has been largely bearish, with investors recording losses across all timeframes. In the past month, it saw a drawdown of 18.58% and a past week loss of 14.90% according to CoinMarketCap . In the past 24 hours, it has continued its losing streak with a 1.47% decline. Analysts say should its market volume keep rising from its current level of $2.02 billion, then SOL’s fall will inevitably occur. Some analysts who are less optimistic say that SOL could get flipped by DOGE, a major memecoin in the market, based on the rate at which SOL’s market capitalization has been declining, dropping from over $100 billion down to $88.77 billion at press time. While one memecoin, DOGE, could pull an impressive move, the situation appears different with WIF another memecoin, as investors are moving away from it. WIF goes against investors’ predictions The sentiment for WIF is bearish, meaning the current downfall in the market could likely intensify moving forward. In the past month and week, WIF investors have lost 51.05% and 30.65% respectively, and the route downward is becoming more apparent with its 6.20% loss in the past 24 hours as indicated on CoinMarketCap . On the TradingView chart , WIF is in a more troubled state with the asset crossing below a critical support line at 1.4783, which is known to house buying pressure. Should the daily candle close below this support line, then WIF will begin another phase of continued decline, till it locates the next support level. With WIF and SOL failing to meet investors’ criteria, they have now turned to the best cryptocurrency, 1Fuel as the better alternative. 1Fuel: Best alternative to SOL and WIF With doubts setting in among top cryptocurrencies in the market, analysts have begun shifting to assets analysts consider will secure their investment and, more importantly, provide long-term gain. This is where 1Fuel comes in, as analysts predict the asset will return the most market gain in 2025 when it launches alongside its peer-to-peer exchange and cryptocurrency wallet. 1Fuel’s wallet will include some of the most innovative crypto wallet features in the market, that’s rarely functional in the market. Its multichain feature, being the most discussed, will support transactions across multiple chains without being hindered by high gas fees, utilizing multiple bridges, or wallets. This one-click settles everything in just a single action and uses 1Fuel as the native token to facilitate this in the market. Other aspects of the wallet analysts and investors are also excited about are the security functions, DeFi utility, and its on/off ramp supports. Conclusion Finding the best cryptocurrency to invest in isn’t a hassle anymore, as analysts say 1Fuel is the solution and the pathway to recording 5,000% in the coming trading sessions. Unlike SOL and WIF, 1Fuel remains in a state where it isn’t struggling and doesn’t appear to struggle in any way, based on analysts’ projections.

The Revenue Switch, a mechanism designed to distribute 100% of Usual’s ( USUAL ) protocol revenue to USUALx stakers, has been launched by the USUAL token and USD0 stablecoin ecosystem creators. While the initiative marks a significant step forward for decentralized finance, its debut is accompanied by ongoing community concerns about recent changes to the protocol’s redeem function. Activated on Jan. 13, 2025, the Revenue Switch enables USUALx stakers to receive protocol-generated revenue, estimated at $5 million per month, directly in USD0. This mechanism links token value to actual earnings, aiming to incentivize long-term staking and support sustainable protocol growth. Starting today UTC+0, the Revenue Switch was activated for USUALx holders. Those holding their USUALx positions throughout this week will be eligible for the distribution of last week’s collateral revenues. ​ More details here & on the dApp: https://t.co/syOdYwHXW5 ​ The 1:1… — Usual (@usualmoney) January 13, 2025 As of Jan. 14, 2025, the USUAL token is trading at $0.5319, with a market capitalization of $275.68 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $194.6 million. Approximately 36.53% of the token supply is staked, offering an annual yield of 275%, 42% in USD0 rewards, and 233% in USUAL. USUAL 1D chart | Source: CoinmarketCap Despite the excitement surrounding the Revenue Switch, the protocol has faced criticism over its decision to update the redeem function for USD0 stablecoins. The new feature allows for temporary suspension of redemptions under specific conditions, such as during periods of market volatility or liquidity constraints. While USUAL has clarified that this change is intended to maintain stability in extreme scenarios, it has raised concerns about the concentration of control and potential implications for decentralization.

The Revenue Switch aims to enhance the utility of USUAL tokens, stabilize returns for stakers, and provide a transparent mechanism for revenue distribution. USUAL has also indicated plans to refine its model in the coming months, incorporating advanced staking and governance frameworks inspired by the “veModel” used in other DeFi projects. As USUAL navigates these developments, the success of the Revenue Switch may serve as a proof of concept for revenue-based tokenomics , potentially influencing future practices in the sector.

Beberapa sinyal teknikal, seperti Golden Cross dan pantulan dari zona $91.000-$92.000, mengindikasikan bahwa bull run crypto masih jauh dari kata selesai. Dengan potensi besar Bitcoin untuk melakukan comeback, ini adalah kesempatan emas untuk berinvestasi pada altcoin. Waktu terbaik untuk membeli token ini adalah saat presale berlangsung. Artikel ini menghadirkan 4 presale altcoin terbaik yang mendominasi pasar saat ini. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Presale Crypto Terbaik Secara Keseluruhan di 2025 Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) memberikan sinyal trading dan wawasan pasar crypto kepada investor ritel yang sebelumnya hanya dapat diakses oleh investor Wall Street. Tujuan utamanya adalah membangun komunitas aktif yang dapat mengurangi kekuasaan para crypto whale dan memberikan kesempatan yang lebih adil bagi investor kecil. Token ini memulai presale di akhir 2024 dan hingga saat ini telah berhasil mengumpulkan lebih dari $47,5 juta. Saat ini, setiap token dihargai $0.00036647 , tetapi fase berikutnya dari presale akan dimulai dalam beberapa jam, sehingga sekarang adalah waktu terbaik untuk membeli dengan harga termurah. Menurut beberapa ahli, $WEPE bisa menjadi token dengan performa terbaik di tahun 2025. Alasan utamanya adalah, meskipun beberapa meme coin hanya bersifat tren yang bisa memudar kapan saja, $WEPE menawarkan solusi nyata terhadap masalah manipulasi pasar oleh crypto whales , sehingga menciptakan lapangan bermain yang adil untuk semua. Beberapa analis bahkan menyebut bahwa $WEPE berpotensi melampaui $PEPU, yang harganya melonjak 500% setelah peluncuran. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi presale Wall Street Pepe di sini . 2.

Meanwhile, a newer altcoin dubbed RCO Finance (RCOF) is gaining significant attention, with its presale setting the stage for a potential surge in value, offering a stark contrast to Dogecoin’s current trajectory. Dogecoin Price Momentum Slows Down Dogecoin (DOGE) , once the darling of social media-driven crypto spikes, seems to have hit a plateau. Currently trading at around $0.33, the memecoin has seen a significant decline from around $0.4 at the start of the year. Dogecoin has consistently struggled to break past key resistance levels, with its momentum notably cooling off. Technical indicators like the 50-day EMA suggest potential bearish trends, with the token falling below its short-term moving averages. The market sentiment around the future of Dogecoin price is mixed, with some analysts predicting a possible climb to $0.45 if it manages to overcome current resistance, yet the overall momentum appears to be waning. RCO Finance Bullish Outlook Post-Presale As Dogecoin price momentum slows, RCO Finance’s presale is capturing the spotlight with its promise of substantial returns. Currently in its fourth and second-last presale stage, the RCOF token is priced at $0.07770, having already surged 509% from its initial presale price of $0.01275. The excitement around RCOF is palpable as the final presale stage is set to push the token’s price to $0.21420, which is a 175% increase from the current stage. Once the presale concludes, and RCOF is expected to get listed on exchanges with at a price range of $0.4 to $0.6, with analysts forecasting an explosive growth thereafter. The anticipation is that within weeks of its official listing and platform launch, RCOF could see its value increase by up to 50,000%, driven by the innovative features of the RCO Finance platform and the growing interest in AI-integrated financial solutions. The RCO Finance Platform Innovative Features RCO Finance is not just another cryptocurrency project; it’s a comprehensive financial ecosystem in its final development stages, set for launch post-presale. Central to its appeal is an AI-powered Robo Advisor that crafts personalized investment strategies for users, leveraging real-time data from global financial sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. The RCO Finance Robo Advisor promises to democratize sophisticated investment techniques, making them accessible to users regardless of their financial acumen. Additionally, RCO Finance will offer access to over 120,000 tradable assets across 12,500 asset classes, including both traditional and blockchain-based assets, thereby providing vast diversification options. Another groundbreaking aspect is its KYC-free ecosystem, which prioritizes user privacy, allowing for seamless and anonymous engagement in DeFi markets. Security is also paramount, with the platform’s smart contract undergoing rigorous auditing by SolidProof , enhancing investor confidence. Furthermore, the RCOF token follows a deflationary tokenomics model, where unsold tokens are burned, potentially increasing the token’s value over time. These features, combined with the current enthusiasm for crypto AI solutions, are expected to propel RCO Finance to new heights, positioning RCOF not just as a competitor to Dogecoin but as a potential leader in the next wave of financial technology. For those looking for a cryptocurrency with immense potential, they could consider RCO Finance (RCOF) , especially now that the token is yet to be listed on crypto exchanges seeing that it is projected to explode after listing and the launch of its native platform.

In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Credible Crypto tells his 453,200 followers on the social media platform X that the smart contract platform looks set to skyrocket – but not before it dips and presents a solid entry for long-term holders. ‘[Ethereum] is setting up for a face-melting rally later this year. Just be patient and take advantage of the dips for now. $2,500-$2,800 is the dream buy zone if we manage to get it down the road.” Credible Crypto goes on to note that Ethereum is close to hitting his downside target. “Now about 80% to my downside target – seeing some LTF (lower time frame) absorption here so maybe we are due for some relief before taking the lows. Let’s see.” Source: Credible Crypto/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH will drop to support at $3,000. Ethereum is trading for $3,255 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours. Moving on to the dog-themed memecoin dogwifhat ( WIF ), the trader says he ultimately sees the meme asset plunging below a psychological price point. “My last post [about WIF] was when I closed a long on it at $2.85 because it looked weak. I was hoping for a move to the equal highs for a short down to $1 but we melted. Currently trading at mid-range where I think we could see some relief but I’m not interested in longing it anymore. Surprised we’ve left behind those equal highs so maybe we go back for them but ultimately I think sooner or later we will see sub $1.” Source: Credible Crypto/X WIF is trading for $1.50 at time of writing.

Comparative Analysis: PCHAIN vs. XRP and Cardano (ADA) While XRP and Cardano have made significant strides in the blockchain arena, PCHAIN’s AI-driven approach offers distinct advantages. Unlike XRP and Cardano, PCHAIN is a real-world asset (RWA) AI altcoin backed by the $600 trillion global real estate market. The token enjoys the stability of real estate in a volatile crypto space. The volatility of the crypto market has greatly impacted both XRP and Cardano, with the Ripple token losing over 31% of its value since its all-time high. Similarly, ADA has lost over 69% since its all-time high. The impact of the crypto market volatility on both XRP and Cardano underscores the importance of a stable real-world asset backing a project. Looking at XRP, Cardano, and the AI-powered PCHAIN’s prospects, leading market analysts project a staggering 40,000% growth potential for PCHAIN within Q1 2025. The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the United States SEC has cast a shadow of uncertainty on the future of XRP. Additionally, the developmental challenges facing the Cardano blockchain are also a major concern for investors considering the ADA token’s long-term viability. PropiChain: Redefining the Future of Global Real Estate Transactions Aside from its revolutionary artificial intelligence feature, Propichain also deploys the Metaverse, smart contracts, and RWA tokenization technology to power the future of real estate. Metaverse-Powered Virtual Real Estate Exploration The platform is revolutionizing real estate by integrating Metaverse technology, offering users an immersive way to explore properties. Instead of relying on physical site visits, buyers can embark on interactive 3D virtual tours, scouting properties from anywhere in the world. This cutting-edge feature eliminates geographical limitations, allowing buyers and sellers to connect seamlessly, negotiate deals remotely, and expedite transactions. Minimizing the need for in-person visits reduces costs, saves time, and enhances accessibility, making real estate transactions more efficient and globally inclusive. Automated Transactions with Smart Contracts PropiChain uses blockchain-based smart contracts to streamline real estate transactions, bringing unparalleled transparency and efficiency. Whether handling lease agreements, rental renewals, or property sales, smart contracts automate the entire process, eliminating the need for intermediaries like brokers and agents. Real Estate Tokenization: Expanding Investment Opportunities Through real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, PropiChain democratizes access to high-value real estate investments. The platform enables fractional ownership by converting premium properties into digital tokens, allowing a broader range of investors to participate in lucrative real estate markets. This innovative approach removes traditional financial barriers, providing investors with new opportunities to diversify their portfolios without requiring full ownership. Conclusion PCHAIN’s integration of artificial intelligence capabilities positions it as a formidable contender in the crypto market, with the potential to outperform established players like XRP and ADA in Q1 2025. With Its projected 40,000% growth, your $1000 investment in the ongoing presale will potentially yield over $382,520 in profit in Q1 2025. The ongoing second presale round has already raised over $800,000 after the project raised more than $1.3 million in the first presale round. After this presale round, the token will increase by over 109% for the final presale round. Join the PCHAIN presale now to buy the token on the cheap and make unprecedented gains. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , a remarkable feat that shows the project’s readiness for bigger things in the market. BlockAudit , a top blockchain security firm, audited the smart contract and found zero vulnerabilities.

Addressing a full ballroom of executives and investors, Saylor said : “It works for any company. Every company has a choice to make: “Cling to the past” by purchasing Treasury bonds, executing buybacks and dividends, or “embrace the future” by using Bitcoin as digital capital.” Michael Saylor Saylor defends Bitcoin strategy as MicroStrategy continues aggressive purchase Saylor’s comments followed MicroStrategy’s latest announcement about its Bitcoin purchases, including a $243 million acquisition, marking the 10th consecutive week of purchasing the cryptoasset. He took a jab at companies like Microsoft and Nvidia for not following his company’s example, saying, “We’re the people building with steel, and they’re building with wood.” A slide in his presentation showed that 70 companies currently hold Bitcoin. “What’s the downside? Well, you just get rich,” he added. MicroStrategy shares have risen approximately 9.71% this year, reaching $317.75 per share as of 1:43 p.m. on Monday in New York, while Bitcoin has fallen 1.8% during the same period. The Virginia-based company now owns over 2% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist, totalling roughly $41 billion. In closing, Saylor urged executives to make the right decision for their families, countries, and investors: “Adopt Bitcoin.” Donald Trump continues to engage crypto leaders Following Trump’s re-election, several high-profile crypto executives visited Mar-a-Lago. Trump recently invited Michael Saylor to his estate in Mar-a-Lago to discuss Bitcoin further. This isn’t the first time he’s done something like this. In 2024, for example, Trump invited American Bitcoin mining giants to learn more about the industry and what he needs to do to best support them. Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, has also met with Trump to discuss policies related to the sector. A few weeks ago, Saylor said he would be open to advising Donald Trump on Bitcoin. Now, with him at Mar-a-Lago, that may come to pass. As the President-elect prepares for his inauguration, major tech and crypto firms, including Circle, Microsoft, Google, and Apple, have opened their wallets, hoping to get a seat in the inaugural committee. These contributions come as Trump’s administration prepares to take a stance on digital assets, with many industry leaders positioning themselves to influence the upcoming policy changes.

Is it groundbreaking tech, real-world impact, or riding the momentum of presales? As of January 13, 2025, Ondo Finance is shaking things up with its upcoming token unlock, and Litecoin is keeping its place as a steady market contender. But the real buzz is around Qubetics (TICS) . With its presale setting new records and solving real-world issues, it’s no wonder analysts are predicting massive gains. If you’re hunting for the Best Altcoins to Join for Long Term, these three projects should be on your radar. While Ondo and Litecoin bring innovation and reliability to the table, Qubetics ($TICS) is addressing practical issues like secure online access with its decentralized VPN. Let’s explore why these altcoins are making waves and why Qubetics is leading the charge. Qubetics (TICS): Redefining Online Security with Decentralized VPN Qubetics (TICS) is rapidly gaining momentum in the crypto space with its innovative blockchain solutions. Offering unmatched scalability and real-world impact, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in the next wave of blockchain technology. With a growing community and significant ROI potential, it’s a token to watch for long-term growth. Currently in its 17th presale stage, Qubetics has raised over $9.5 million, sold 417 million $TICS tokens, and attracted over 14,300 holders . At $0.0501 per token, the presale is massive. Analysts predict $TICS will hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, delivering a 398.73% ROI, with projections reaching $15 after the mainnet launch—a jaw-dropping 29,824% gain. One of the standout applications of Qubetics is its decentralized VPN (dVPN). Imagine a world where your online activity is private, secure, and immune to centralized control.

It’s clear that $TICS is redefining what’s possible in blockchain, making it one of the Best Altcoins to Join for Long Term. Ondo Finance (ONDO): Innovating Tokenomics Ondo Finance is making waves with its upcoming token unlock event, slated to release $2.38 billion worth of tokens. While the market has seen ONDO dip to $1.2250—a 43% decline from its December peak—this falling wedge pattern suggests a potential rebound. Ondo’s strategic approach to tokenomics is designed to encourage long-term growth, even amidst broader market corrections. Ondo is more than just token unlocks.

Trading at $98.70, it’s seen a slight dip of 4.94% but remains one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies out there. Despite the SEC’s lowered likelihood of approving a spot Litecoin ETF—down to 42% from 60%—Litecoin’s real strength lies in its consistency. Litecoin is often called the “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold,” and for good reason. Its fast transaction speeds and low fees make it a favorite for everyday transactions. Picture yourself grabbing a coffee at your local shop and paying with crypto. Litecoin makes this process as smooth as using a debit card. From businesses integrating crypto payments to individuals exploring blockchain for the first time, Litecoin offers a user-friendly experience.

The crypto market is buzzing with opportunities, and projects like Helium (HNT) and Fantom (FTM) are making headlines.

With its innovative multi-chain wallet and recent 10% price increase, Qubetics is offering investors a front-row seat to massive gains. Qubetics is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a game-changing platform designed to solve real-world blockchain problems.

Currently in its 17th stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0501, with over $9.5 million raised and more than 14,300 holders. Over 417 million tokens have been sold, and the price increases by 10% every Sunday at midnight. This built-in price surge creates urgency for investors looking to get in early on the action. Analysts are predicting huge returns for $TICS . By the end of the presale, $TICS could hit $0.25, offering a 398.73% ROI. If it reaches $1 post-presale, that’s a staggering 1,894.93% ROI. And the upside doesn’t stop there. If $TICS climbs to $5 or $6, the ROI could skyrocket to 9,874.66% or even 11,869.60%. The most optimistic predictions have it reaching $10 or $15, translating to gains of 19,849.33% to 29,824.00%. For example, a $1,000 investment now would give you approximately 19,950 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that $1,000 turns into nearly $19,950. If it jumps to $10, your investment skyrockets to $199,500. This kind of return easily makes Qubetics one of the best coins to join this week. Helium Expands Its Decentralized Wireless Network Helium (HNT) continues to make waves with its decentralized wireless network designed for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The project boasts a market cap of $871.45 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $14.81 million. Helium’s network growth is fueled by its innovative Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) consensus mechanism, which allows users to set up Hotspots that provide wireless coverage and earn HNT tokens. The recent expansion of its network has attracted more participants, leading to improved connectivity and increased token utility. Helium’s ability to scale its network and integrate with IoT solutions positions it as a serious contender for long-term growth. As the demand for decentralized wireless infrastructure rises, Helium is proving to be one of the best coins to join this week for investors seeking solid, tech-driven projects. With its focus on solving real-world connectivity issues, Helium is showing strong potential for growth in the booming IoT sector. Its commitment to decentralization and network expansion makes it a solid choice for both new and experienced crypto investors. Fantom Faces Market Uncertainty After Coinbase Suspension Fantom (FTM) is under pressure following Coinbase’s decision to suspend its trading. This unexpected move has led to speculation about Fantom’s future price movements. Analysts suggest that this suspension could cause further price drops, affecting investor confidence. However, Fantom’s underlying technology and commitment to scalability still hold long-term promise. Despite the immediate challenges, Fantom’s high-speed, low-cost blockchain infrastructure remains a valuable asset. If the project can navigate this period of uncertainty, it could recover and continue to attract developers and users. For now, however, investors are watching closely to see how the market reacts. Although Fantom is facing short-term volatility, its innovative technology still makes it a project worth monitoring. For risk-tolerant investors, Fantom could be a strategic addition among the best coins to join this week, provided it regains market stability. Why These Altcoins Deserve a Spot in Your Portfolio Helium, Fantom, and Qubetics each bring something unique to the crypto market. Helium is building a decentralized wireless network that’s growing rapidly, while Fantom’s high-speed blockchain could rebound after navigating its current challenges.

38923594,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=674500,1736820018,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Now Capitulating: Bottom Here?,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-short-term-holders-capitulating-bottom/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin short-term holders have started selling at a loss. Here’s what this could mean for the cryptocurrency’s price. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Just Dipped Under 1 As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) of the short-term holders has declined into the red zone recently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Plummets To Neutral: Reversal Signal? The “SOPR” here refers to an on-chain indicator that tells us whether the BTC investors are selling their coins at a profit or loss. The metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin being sold/transferred on the network to see what price it was transacted at prior to this. If the last transfer price of the coin was less than the current spot value it’s being sold at now, then its sale could be assumed to be leading to profit realization. Similarly, transactions of the tokens of the opposite type correspond to loss-taking. The SOPR adds up the profits and losses being realized across the network in this manner and calculates what their ratio stands at. In the context of the current topic, the SOPR of only a particular segment of the sector is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). This cohort is made up of the investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. When the indicator has a value greater than 1, it means the STHs as a whole are selling their coins at a profit. On the other hand, it is under the threshold implies loss realization is dominant among these holders. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin STH SOPR over the past decade: As is visible in the above graph, the 7-day SMA of the Bitcoin STH SOPR shot up to high levels above the 1 mark during the last couple of months of 2024, implying the group was participating in significant profit-taking during the asset’s run to new all-time highs. This wasn’t anything unusual, as STHs have historically proven themselves to represent the fickle-minded side of the market, who sell at first sight of any major change in the market, like a rally or crash. Predictably, with the market downturn that has followed in the last few weeks, the STHs have shown another shift, as their profit-taking has calmed down and loss-taking has started taking over. The 7-day SMA of the indicator has declined to 0.99, which suggests the loss realization is now just ahead of the profit realization. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Explains What Could Trigger Ethereum Rally To $6,000 From the chart, it’s apparent that past capitulation events have generally coincided with tops for Bitcoin. So far, though, the level of loss-taking isn’t anything too notable, which may suggest the indicator could have to decline a bit more before BTC finds a bullish reversal. BTC Price Bitcoin has erased the recent recovery as its price has seen another 3% plunge during the past day, which has taken it to $91,600.

FIL Shows Uncertainty and Web3 Grows Fast,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-hits-630k-in-days-as-its-community-vision-gains-traction-fil-shows-uncertainty-and-web3-grows-fast/,"The blockchain sector is growing as various projects adapt and widen their scope. Recent Filecoin price analysis suggests uncertainty, with difficulties in sustaining a rise despite positive signs and technical backing. Concurrently, the Web3 ecosystem is progressively expanding through strategic alliances that link decentralized and conventional finance, paving the way for broader use. In e-commerce, Web3Bay (3BAY) is rapidly advancing, gathering over $630K in a few days and distributing 180 million tokens. With a token price of only $0.0039675, Web3Bay offers a smarter way to buy digital assets, enhanced by community-led governance and special purchasing discounts. Mixed Signals in Filecoin’s Market Trends Filecoin price analysis reveals inconsistent performance as FIL tries to regain its footing. Currently trading around $5.14, Filecoin is showing recovery signs after finding support near $4.85. Technical indicators like a Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 56 hint at a cautiously optimistic sentiment. However, resistance near $8.42, at the 61.8% Fibonacci level, could be crucial for future gains. While there is enthusiasm for the potential of Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) to boost decentralized storage, obstacles from large cloud storage firms and regulatory ambiguities persist. Thus, Filecoin price analysis calls for careful optimism, with stakeholders keeping a close watch on market dynamics. Growing Impact of the Web3 Ecosystem The Web3 ecosystem is on an upward trajectory as it forges connections between decentralized and traditional financial systems. For example, Pyth Network’s collaboration with Revolut underscores how decentralized protocols can enhance the financial industry by offering real-time data to blockchain applications, making the Web3 ecosystem more approachable for the average user. This trend is encouraging more conventional financial entities to consider decentralized ventures, showing potential for wider adoption. As the Web3 ecosystem matures, innovations in data sharing, security, and decentralized finance (DeFi) are making practical applications more feasible for daily use. The ongoing integration of decentralized and centralized financial practices is solidifying the foundation of the Web3 ecosystem and guiding its future expansion. Web3Bay: The Smarter, More Secure Way to Buy Digital Assets! Web3Bay is revolutionizing e-commerce by integrating blockchain technology with a user-centric approach. Having raised over $630K and sold 180 million of its 3BAY tokens at just $0.0039675 each, Web3Bay stands out for its strong focus on community, integrity, and user empowerment. The platform ensures user control over their data and assets without intermediaries or hidden costs. Community governance is central, enabling users to directly influence the evolution of the marketplace. As Web3Bay moves towards becoming a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), 3BAY token holders will gain voting rights on future developments, ensuring a transparent and inclusive decision-making process. Moreover, purchasing digital assets on Web3Bay with 3BAY tokens grants a 5% discount, enhancing transaction value. Web3Bay also prioritizes scalability, incorporating Layer-2 solutions like rollups to efficiently manage high transaction volumes. Plans to launch NFT marketplaces, staking options, and cross-chain functionalities are underway, aiming to further improve the platform’s capabilities. For those keen on the future of decentralized e-commerce, Web3Bay presents a unique opportunity. More than just a marketplace, it’s a movement dedicated to empowering its users and delivering value through a community-focused approach. Web3Bay is actively constructing the future landscape of online commerce! Decentralized Projects: Forging the Path to Tomorrow! Decentralized technologies are increasingly influencing the future of digital markets. Filecoin price analysis reflects the ongoing struggle to maintain growth in a fiercely competitive storage sector, while the expanding Web3 ecosystem continues to merge decentralized and traditional finance through key partnerships. Together, these developments demonstrate the growing acceptance of blockchain solutions across various industries. Leading this evolution is Web3Bay, significantly enhancing how users buy digital assets. Since launching its presale, Web3Bay has quickly raised over $630K and sold more than 180 million tokens, now priced at merely $0.0039675. These tokens not only offer exclusive purchasing discounts but also grant governance rights to their holders. By focusing on community, transparency, and scalability, Web3Bay is setting the stage for the future of decentralized e-commerce.

This $0.07 AI altcoin shows great potential to outperform DOGE’s explosive growth. With its AI-driven tools, real-world asset integration, deflationary model and early-stage advantage, RCOF offers a more innovative and sustainable investment opportunity than DOGE. This AI altcoin is setting a new standard for altcoins, offering greater utility and growth potential. Why Dogecoin Millionaires See AI Altcoins as Smarter Bets Dogecoin millionaires are transitioning from speculative assets like Dogecoin to AI altcoins offering more tangible value. Here’s why. As the 7th largest crypto by market cap, DOGE is the king of memecoins, growing to this position thanks to speculative interest and meme appeal. However, over the last few years, Dogecoin has experienced significant price swings, the most recent being a 21% drop in December 2024. Its mature market position and lackluster performance have investors questioning the sustainability of its returns, which have been diminishing since its meteoric rise in 2021. To hedge against further losses, some Dogecoin investors are moving to high-growth AI altcoins. There’s a growing preference for altcoins that offer more tangible value. Compared to AI altcoins with real-world applications and innovative solutions, Dogecoin lacks the underlying utility many investors now seek. Due to their innovative features, many of these AI altcoins have high ROI potential, attracting Dogecoin investors who are eager to capitalize. RCO Finance: The $0.07 AI Altcoin Set to Outrun DOGE’s 2021 Rally While DOGE delivered impressive returns during its 2021 rally, RCOF’s innovative features and practical utility greatly boost its potential and could see RCOF deliver greater gains than Dogecoin did during its rally. Prices at just $0.07, this altcoin offers the chance to turn a modest investment into life-changing gains. At the core of RCOF is the robo-advisor, an AI-powered tool that offers personalized support and investment guidance based on your preferences.

This personalization is a game changer and helps you easily create a profitable portfolio you are comfortable with, even if you have no experience. For beginners, it curates its recommendations in easy-to-understand formats so you are not overwhelmed and can confidently make sound decisions. It also offers educational resources enabling novices to boost their knowledge and skills in crypto trading and how to navigate financial markets.

It can automatically execute trades on your behalf and rebalance your portfolio as needed. This saves you time and effort since you don’t have to check and adjust your portfolio manually. With real-world asset integration, this AI altcoin offers more investment and diversification opportunities. This inclusion gives more users exposure to traditional assets and helps increase liquidity for otherwise illiquid assets. This tokenization allows you to buy them using cryptocurrency eliminating the need to convert it to fiat currency. This unique feature expands its utility and appeals to a broader investor base. Built on blockchain technology, RCOF ensures transparency, security, and low fees. Its non-KYC approach makes it accessible to investors worldwide, breaking down geographical barriers​. Its smart contracts have also been thoroughly audited by SolidProof. Ride the RCOF Wave and Outrun DOGE’s 2021 Gains The Dogecoin millionaire’s confidence in RCOF highlights its potential to outperform DOGE’s legendary 2021 rally.

While the XRP price faces regulatory challenges and market volatility, PropiChain , an emerging AI altcoin, is gaining momentum with its innovative real-world applications in real estate. PCHAIN is projected to reach $2 as it transforms the crypto landscape. With XRP’s growth potential uncertain, investors are increasingly turning to PropiChain for its strong fundamentals and high upside. XRP Price Analysis: Why Ripple Faces Challenges in Reaching $10 Ripple’s XRP price has remained trapped in a narrow range, with significant resistance at $3 and strong support at $2. Despite occasional short-term bullish reversals, the XRP price has struggled to maintain upward momentum. The market sentiment surrounding XRP is largely cautious, with traders reluctant to commit to substantial positions without a clear breakout signal. Also, regulatory challenges continue to weigh on the XRP price performance. Without a favorable resolution, XRP may find it difficult to attract the level of institutional and retail investor interest required to push its price toward the $10 milestone. For now, the XRP price remains in a consolidation phase. A decisive breakout above $3 could spark renewed bullish momentum, paving the way for a potential rally. However, a breakdown below $2 would likely trigger additional selling pressure, pushing the XRP price lower. In contrast, emerging altcoins like PropiChain are gaining attention for their innovative approaches and untapped growth potential, making them a compelling alternative to XRP. PropiChain: The AI Altcoin Set to Outpace XRP PropiChain has quickly gained traction as a standout in the crypto market, combining blockchain technology and AI to revolutionize real estate investment. Unlike XRP, which faces headwinds from regulatory scrutiny, PropiChain offers a forward-thinking solution to real-world challenges in the property sector. One of PropiChain’s most attractive features is real estate tokenization, which enables the division of high-value properties into smaller, affordable units. This approach makes real estate investment accessible to a broader audience. For instance, an investor with just $500 can own a fraction of a luxury property valued at $1 million. This is a level of inclusivity traditional real estate markets rarely offer. Also, the AI-powered analytics enhance the investment process by providing data-driven insights into property trends and market conditions. These tools help investors make informed decisions, reducing risk and increasing the potential for high returns. Additionally, PropiChain’s metaverse integration allows users to explore virtual property environments, adding a futuristic and engaging dimension to real estate. Overall, PropiChain uses blockchain to address industry-specific issues like real estate scams and inefficient transaction processes. Smart contract automation ensures seamless and secure transactions, while blockchain transparency provides an immutable record of ownership. With investors increasingly seeking utility-driven projects, PropiChain’s practical approach could see its value soar, potentially surpassing XRP in growth potential. PropiChain Presale: A $2 Target Within Reach The PropiChain presale has captured significant investor interest, already raising close to $3 million. Currently priced at $0.011 in stage 2, this is an exceptional opportunity for forward-thinking investors to join the project before its price climbs to $0.023 in a few weeks. For those who invest now, the potential returns are staggering. For example, an early $1,000 investment could yield nearly $181,000 if PropiChain reaches its projected $2 target. Comparatively, the XRP price has struggled to sustain momentum, with regulatory hurdles casting doubt on its ability to reach $10. Even if it does, an investment of $1,000 at its current price of $2.31 will only yield about $4,000. The contrast highlights why investors are shifting their focus to utility-driven projects like PropiChain. Conclusion XRP’s ongoing challenges, from regulatory hurdles to market stagnation, have made its $10 price target seem distant. While Ripple continues to navigate uncertain waters, PropiChain is forging ahead with a clear and innovative vision. Its presale success and projected growth underscore its potential to deliver impressive returns, making it a standout in the crypto market. As the presale progresses, the current stage represents the most advantageous entry point for investors. Waiting until later stages or after its market debut could mean paying significantly higher prices.

On Tuesday, the company announced that it is officially launching ""Soneium,"" a general-purpose blockchain platform. The team behind Sony Block Solutions Labs (SBSL), a joint project between Sony Group and Singapore-based Startale Labs, describes Soneium — technically a layer-2 network atop Ethereum — as ""a versatile general-purpose blockchain platform"" built to support a diverse ecosystem of gaming, finance and entertainment apps. According to SBSL, the launch comes after a four month-long test period that involved participation from 14 million wallets. Sony's network is yet more evidence that traditional technology companies might again be keen on blockchain's ability to connect and commercialize the future of media. The chain is aimed towards ""bridging the gap between web2 and web3 audiences, especially for the creators, fans and community,” SBSL said in a statement shared with CoinDesk. “The platform prioritizes user-centric design, simplifying blockchain interactions and evolving web3 from a niche hobby into an everyday experience.” The team tapped Optimism’s OP Stack to build out their network — a customizable framework that lets developers use optimistic rollup technology to transact on Ethereum quickly and at a low cost. Other companies using the OP Stack include the U.S. crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, which use the tech to power their popular Base and Ink networks. Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange, and Worldcoin, the Sam Altman-founded digital passport, also use OP Stack to power their layer-2 blockchain networks. In many cases, the Optimism Foundation, which stewards the development of the OP Stack, has awarded grants to companies that agreed to use its tech. SBSL declined to comment on how many OP tokens they would receive as part of this deal, though previous reporting indicates that Optimism's grants can be substantial. In August 2023, Coinbase received up to 118 million OP tokens — worth $182 million at the time, or $192 million at today's prices — to use OP Stack for Base chain. CoinDesk also reported that Kraken received up to 25 million OP tokens, worth roughly $100 million, when it agreed to use the OP Stack in January 2024 (now worth $42 million). Similar grants are doled out by Optimism competitors like Polygon and Arbitrum, each of whom is dueling to build its own interconnected web of blockchains.

With a new bull market on the horizon, several digital assets are showing the potential to rise exponentially. Five cryptos BigBossInu, Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), and Polkadot (DOT) are well-positioned to follow in the footsteps of previous market leaders. Let’s dive into why these altcoins are primed for significant growth. BigBossInu’s Presale Shakes Up the Crypto Market BigBossInu is creating excitement in the crypto industry with a highly successful presale that’s drawing eager investors. Seen as a high-reward opportunity for those who join early, BigBossInu is quickly gaining momentum. With its presale interest peaking, this promising asset has become one of November’s top cryptos to watch. BigBossInu’s innovative approach and strategic growth plan suggest it’s set for considerable success in the months to come. >>>>>> Solana (SOL) has recovered well, currently trading around $197. Buyers have managed to push it above key resistance levels, but SOL is facing resistance at $200. If it can break above this, it could rise towards $250. However, if sellers regain control, SOL could dip back to $160. Polygon (MATIC) has established itself as a leading Layer-2 solution that enhances Ethereum’s scalability, offering faster transactions at lower costs. As demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology grow NEAR Protocol (NEAR) As the next bull market gains momentum, NEAR’s potential to grow and attract more innovation positions it as a crypto to watch, with analysts expecting it to follow the growth trajectory of platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Polkadot (DOT) has made a notable upward move, breaching its resistance at $7.50 and climbing 6.1% within the last week. This development is being seen as a strong indicator of recovery, suggesting that DOT may soon experience a breakout. As it inches closer to concluding its accumulation phase, there’s increasing optimism among market experts. >>> Conclusion As the market gears up for its next major bull run, these five cryptos BigBossInu, Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), and Polkadot (DOT) are showing the potential to deliver exponential gains. With innovative technology, strong communities, and strategic market positioning, they have what it takes to follow in the footsteps of Ethereum and Solana, rewarding early investors with impressive returns. For those looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto growth, investing in BigBossInu could be a game-changing move.

In 2028, AR will range range between $63.77 and $77.30, with an average price of $66.05. In 2031, Arweave (AR) could reach a maximum price of $215.04. Arweave (AR) is a unique cryptocurrency that underpins a decentralized, permanent data storage solution, setting it apart in the blockchain space. As Arweave’s ecosystem continues to grow, interest in its price trajectory has increased among investors and analysts alike. This price prediction explores potential future movements of AR, considering factors like market trends, technological advancements, and overall crypto market sentiment. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for those looking to invest or engage with Arweave’s long-term vision of decentralized, permanent data storage. Overview Cryptocurrency Arweave Ticker AR Current price $15.30 Market cap $1,004,725,882.55 Trading volume $67,299,502 Circulating supply 65,652,466 AR All-time high $90.94 Nov 05, 2021 All-time low $0.4854 May 27, 2020 24-hour high $15.49 24-hour low $14.02 Arweave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $21.00 Volatility (30-day variation) 10.87% 50-day SMA $ 20.11 200-day SMA $ 22.58 14-Day RSI 40.97 Sentiment Bearish Fear and greed index 61 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) Arweave price analysis: AR faces bearish momentum with slight recovery signs TL;DR Breakdown Arweave resistance is present at $16.87. The coin’s support is present at $14.03. AR shows slight recovery from oversold levels in the short term. The Arweave price analysis for January 14 shows a downtrend. AR is down 1.18% over the last 24 hours, lost 19.23% in 7 days, and -30.54% in 30 days. AR/USD 1-day chart: Indicators suggest weak capital inflow The Arweave (AR) daily chart shows bearish momentum, with the price currently trading below the middle Bollinger Band at $16.87. The CMF at -0.04 suggests weak capital inflows, indicating limited buying pressure. Indicators suggest weak capital inflow The MACD is in a bearish crossover, with the histogram in the negative zone, reflecting continued selling pressure. If AR fails to reclaim the $16.87 level, it may test the $14.03 support. A breakout above $16.87 could signal a recovery toward $19.71, but the overall sentiment remains bearish for now. Arweave 4-hour price analysis: AR shows slight signs of recovery The 4-hour Arweave (AR) chart shows a modest recovery, with the price trading near $15.27 but still below the 20-period SMA at $15.47, indicating bearish resistance. The RSI at 39.65 suggests the coin is recovering from oversold levels but remains below neutral territory, reflecting weak buying momentum. AR shows slight signs of recovery The BBP (Bull Bear Power) at 0.106 indicates a slight improvement in sentiment but remains within a low range. For AR to continue its recovery, it needs to break above the 20-day SMA. Failing to do so may result in further consolidation or downward pressure.

Momentum is weak, so it’ll need stronger market support to see real growth. Is Arweave a good investment? Arweave looks promising for long-term investors in decentralized data storage, with strong partnerships like Solana and Polygon and backing from Coinbase Ventures. However, crypto volatility means investing in Arweave requires careful risk assessment and management. Will AR reach $50? AR could reach $50, especially since it hit an all-time high of around $90 in November 2021. With strong market momentum and growing adoption, it’s possible, but it depends on broader market trends and ecosystem growth. Will AR reach $100? AR reaching $100 is possible, but it would require strong market momentum, widespread adoption of its decentralized storage solutions, and continued ecosystem growth. Does Arweave have a good long-term future? Arweave shows strong long-term potential. Recent partnerships, like integrations with Transak and 4EVERLAND, as well as collaborations with Ethereum through WeaveVM and acquisitions like Odysee and Solarplex, highlight its expanding ecosystem and growing user base. Its focus on decentralized storage and strategic growth makes it a promising project for the future.

Pepe Unchained vs. BlockDAG Meme Culture Meets Blockchain Innovation Pepe Unchained and BlockDAG are two well-known projects that mix funny images with blockchain progress. Pepe Unchained, made on Ethereum’s extra layer, has got more than $73 million in its early sale, giving quicker deals and cheaper costs for meme coin trade. Its next part, Pepe’s Pump Pad, wants to make it easier to create meme coins which helps fans. BlockDAG uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) method to make things bigger and quicker as a Layer-1 blockchain. With more than $158 million collected and a 2240% jump in coin worth during its presale, BlockDAG attracts wider group of people, such as builders and companies; it gives easy-code tools for different apps that are not centered around one place. Pepe Unchained looks at the small meme coin market, but BlockDAG’s all-around way make͏s it a big part of blockchain setup. Investors should think about their goals and risk levels when looking at these projects. Why Lightchain AI Could Reach $1 First by 2025 While Pepe Unchained Coin and BlockDAG each present unique strengths, Lightchain AI appears to have the greatest potential to reach the $1 milestone ahead of the others. Several factors support this projection. Currently priced at $0.0048 during its presale phase, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is anticipated by analysts to achieve $1 by 2025. This growth is expected to be driven by its groundbreaking integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Key elements fueling this potential include its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for completing AI computations, significantly improving network scalability and efficiency. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) facilitates seamless deployment of AI-powered applications, making it highly attractive to developers and enterprises seeking advanced solutions. The project’s deflationary tokenomics further enhance its appeal; by burning a portion of transaction fees, scarcity is increased, potentially driving up the token’s value as demand grows.

As SHIB seeks stability amidst market fluctuations, another cryptocurrency, RCO Finance (RCOF), is setting the stage for potential exponential growth through its ongoing presale , hinting at a market upside that could reach 30,000%. Shiba Inu Price Prediction Shiba Inu has experienced a mix of volatility and consolidation in recent weeks. The price of SHIB, as shown on CoinGecko , has been hovering around $0.000021, down from above $0.000043 in December 2024. SHIB seems to be facing resistance, possibly due to its limited utility and an increasingly saturated meme coin market. Analysts suggest that while there’s potential for SHIB to continue its upward trajectory if market conditions remain favorable, the lack of significant developments in its ecosystem might hinder long-term growth. The current sentiment around Shiba Inu is cautiously optimistic, with some predicting a modest rise to $0.00003 by the end of the first quarter if bullish trends persist, but the road ahead remains uncertain without new catalysts. RCO Finance Presale Setting the Stage for a Bull Run RCO Finance’s presale has been making waves, currently in its fourth stage with the RCOF token priced at $0.0777, showcasing a 509% surge from its initial offering. The next and final presale stage, the Bonus Round, is set to see the token’s price increase by 175% to $0.2142, offering additional incentives for early investors. Once the presale concludes, RCOF is expected to be listed on exchanges with a price range of $0.4 to $0.6, which could lead to a dramatic 30,000% surge in value within weeks post-listing and platform launch. This optimistic scenario is fueled by the strong momentum and investor interest during the presale stages, coupled with the innovative features of the upcoming RCO Finance platform. RCO Finance Platform: A Glimpse into the Future of Decentralized Finance As RCO Finance nears the end of its token presale, the platform itself is in the final stages of development, poised to redefine decentralized finance. At the heart of RCO Finance is an AI-powered Robo Advisor that democratizes sophisticated investment strategies, making them accessible to all users regardless of their financial acumen. This tool uses machine learning to analyze vast amounts of market data, offering personalized investment recommendations that adapt in real time to market changes. Beyond the AI advisor, RCO Finance boasts an extensive array of over 120,000 tradable assets across 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized real-world assets like real estate and commodities, providing investors with unprecedented diversification options. Privacy is also a key selling point with its KYC-free ecosystem set to appeal to those who prioritize anonymity in financial dealings. Security and trust are further enhanced by a smart contract audited by SolidProof , ensuring the platform’s integrity and investor confidence. There is also a deflationary mechanism in place, where unsold RCOF tokens are burned, possibly increasing scarcity post-presale leading to an increase in value over time. Given these features, RCO Finance is not just another DeFi platform but a potential market disruptor, with the RCOF token expected to capitalize on these innovations, contributing to its anticipated meteoric rise, especially with the current hype around AI in cryptocurrency. While the Shiba Inu price prediction remains tied to market sentiment and lacks new utility, RCO Finance’s strategic presale and forthcoming platform launch offer a compelling narrative of growth and innovation, potentially leading to significant returns for investors in the burgeoning world of crypto AI.

A transfer of 30 million XRP (approximately $76.1 million) from Upbit to an unknown wallet has captured market attention, indicating heightened activity among large holders. This comes as analysts and the crypto community closely monitor ongoing developments in Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), along with the imminent January 15 deadline for the agency’s appeal-related filing. XRP Price Eyes New ATH As Whales Move $76.1M In a recent report from Whale Alert, 30 million XRP worth $76.1 million was moved from Upbit, a South Korea exchange, to an unknown wallet. Such large transactions are often viewed as potential precursors to price volatility. Some of the analysts have noted that whales are known to make large movements that can be interpreted as either accumulation or preparation for large transactions. In the past, such transactions have been linked with the changes in the XRP price trend some analysts have forecasted that the currency may rise by double digits. EGRAG Crypto, a renowned market analyst, in a recent move pointed out that XRP is displaying a rare “Megaphone Bottom” formation that may indicate an upward trend. At the moment, this technical formation has a win rate of above 70%, and the analyst is predicting an ATH of $8 if it happens. XRP Breaks Out of Symmetrical Triangle The XRP price recently emerged from a symmetrical triangle pattern, which is a bullish signal, meaning that the price may rise to $4. The symmetrical triangles are formed when price action converges and forms a triangle where the tops and bottoms converge to form the triangle. A breakout above the upper trendline is generally taken as a positive sign by the traders aligning a recent XRP price predition . According to market analyst World of Charts, XRP price could increase by 60% in the coming days if it breaks out. Using the maximum height of the triangle on the breakout point sets the first target at $4. This surge is inline with the legal fight of Ripple which has still been on the rise, thus positively influencing the market. Some of the latest developments such as a ruling that certain documents submitted in connection with Ripple’s summary judgment motion should be sealed have also boosted investors’ confidence. SEC Deadline Approaches Amid Legal Uncertainty The SEC has until January 15 to submit its brief on the merits of the appeal regarding Judge Analisa Torres’s decision in the Ripple case. This comes after the agency filed its Notice of Appeal in October 2023 regarding the ruling that the normal sales of XRP are not securities under the Howey Test. Lawyers have noted that this is not unusual for filings to be submitted on the last day. According to Marc Fagel, a retired securities lawyer, “In thirty years of litigation, I would estimate that I have seen a lawyer file a brief before it was due once or twice.” However, it is still unclear if the SEC will continue the appeal to the next administration. SEC Chair Gary Gensler and Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw are to resign on January 20, and former Commissioner Paul Atkins, who is known to be pro-crypto, could join the commission which may change the agency’s stance on the Ripple case. Market Analysts Remain Optimistic Analysts remain optimistic about XRP price potential, citing legal developments and bullish chart patterns. Crypto trader “Dark Defender” pointed out that XRP price is now in the final stages of its “throwback” after breaking a triangle pattern. He predicted that there is high possibility through which the cryptocurrency may hit a new ATH of $4.4 within the next few days. Concurrently, the XRP community is also focused on Ripple’s leadership, including the recent meetings between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Although specific information has not been provided, many in the community see these contacts as a positive sign which which may set ground for an XRP price breakout.

King Pepe on Solana (PEPESOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, King Pepe on Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and King Pepe on Solana could become the next viral memecoin. King Pepe on Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy King Pepe on Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for King Pepe on Solana by entering its contract address – xArnFwydB12BkKVXKy436TwCrSSfFcC7kXx7p2fGEWh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESOL.

Despite some positive price action, the market has not yet confirmed a breakout. Historically, breakouts from triangle patterns tend to show strong upward movement. However, the rally observed earlier this week did not maintain this momentum. XRP briefly rose from around $2.20 to $2.60, but the necessary breakout has not materialized. Micro Support Levels A key support level at $2.39 was identified as critical for maintaining the uptrend. Although the price briefly dipped below this level, it remains relevant. There is a possibility that the price will revisit this support zone, especially if the market moves upward in a corrective structure before retesting it. Triangle Pattern Still in Play The current price action suggests that the triangle pattern (A-B-C-D-E) is still intact. While the price broke above the D-wave high for a short period, it did not hold. For confirmation of the pattern’s completion, a break above $2.72 is required. If the price does not break above this level, the pattern may extend or evolve into a more complex structure. Market Sentiment and Bitcoin’s Influence The broader cryptocurrency market is under downward pressure, largely due to Bitcoin’s recent price movement. XRP has been impacted, but the effect has been mostly on a micro level. No significant support levels have been breached, and the overall market structure remains intact. The key invalidation point for the current triangle pattern is at $1.96—if this level is broken, a major shift in market structure is likely. Possible Downside Scenarios While the triangle pattern suggests a potential upward breakout, a more complex structure like a WXY correction could also unfold. In this case, the price may move downward before resuming upward momentum.

This decline has sparked debates about its future trajectory, with analysts closely examining major market metrics to understand where BTC’s price action could likely be headed next. Among these, CryptoQuant contributor Percival’s detailed insights shed light on Bitcoin’s current state, offering an in-depth look at key market trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Plummets To Neutral: Reversal Signal? Bitcoin Market Dynamics And Key Indicators Percival’s analysis highlights Bitcoin’s seasonal behavior, which has consistently influenced its price patterns in recent years. Historically, the final months of the year see increased sell-side pressure, often extending into January. This year is no different, with institutional profit-taking and broader macroeconomic factors playing a significant role. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin has shown resilience, maintaining a $90,000 support level despite heavy selling pressure. According to Percival, Bitcoin has experienced a 13% decline in Open Interest, much of it attributed to institutional activity on platforms like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also seen a reduction in monthly inflows, dropping from $14 billion to $6.6 billion. These declines reflect broader market sentiment but also highlight Bitcoin’s ability to sustain critical support levels. On the sell side, Percival noted that December saw substantial pressure, with outflows reaching $200 million per day. However, this trend eased in January, with sell-side risk indicators showing a balanced market. This can be attributed to the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (STH MVRV) remaining in a favorable zone, signaling that short-term investors are not facing unbearable losses. This stability suggests that short-term holders are unlikely to contribute to further downward pressure, creating an environment that supports Bitcoin’s $90,000 floor. Demand Trends and Future Scenarios While sell-side pressure has diminished, demand dynamics remain a critical factor in Bitcoin’s outlook. Percival highlighted a slight slowdown in on-chain volume, though it continues to hover around a healthy $12 billion across exchange inflows and outflows. Related Reading: 8 Bitcoin Price Predictions For 2025: What Banks, Hedge Funds And Experts Say This level of activity indicates that Bitcoin still retains strong market interest despite recent price declines. Percival also pointed to a potential risk in the gap between the STH MVRV average of 1 and the short-term holder cost base of $88,000. This gap could act as a “breathing space” for external market events to influence Bitcoin’s price, potentially challenging its ability to maintain the $90,000 support. However, for now, the balance between demand and sell-side risks suggests a period of consolidation rather than a significant further decline. Percival wrote: The odds favor the $90K floor, but beware! There is a gap in the STH MVRV between 1.08 and the average at 1 (STH cost base $88), and this difference can become the “breathing space” for an eventual external scenario, zeroing the possibility of going deeper!

This marks another loss for the SEC, following a string of defeats in recent crypto-related cases. Court Rebukes SEC’s Actions Coinbase has won its petition for a writ of mandamus at the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which rebuked the SEC for denying its request for clearer rules regarding the regulation of digital assets. The court found the SEC’s order insufficiently reasoned and arbitrary, stating that it was “conclusory” and “capricious.” This ruling forces the SEC to reconsider its stance and provide a more thorough explanation for its refusal to create specific rules governing crypto regulations. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, took to Twitter to celebrate the victory, stating: “We just won our petition for a writ of mandamus at the Third Circuit rebuking the SEC for its order denying our rulemaking petition.” He said that the court’s decision highlighted the SEC’s failure to provide adequate reasoning for its actions. We just won our petition for a writ of mandamus at the Third Circuit.

A Pattern of Losses for the SEC This ruling adds to a growing list of defeats for the SEC under Gensler’s leadership. The agency has been called out for its arbitrary decision-making in multiple cases, including the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF rejection, where the SEC was similarly criticized for its lack of justification.

Shiba Inu’s burn rate has jumped by 4100% due to increased whale transactions, while Ethereum’s price analysis indicates a critical point. Yet, Web3Bay (3BAY) captures headlines with its notable presale achievements. With $630K raised and 175 million coins already sold in its presale, Web3Bay is proving its potential in leveraging Web3 for e-commerce. Now in its third presale stage, Web3Bay continues to draw interest from crypto enthusiasts and early adopters. Ethereum Price Analysis: Struggles at $3,721 Resistance Level Ethereum is currently facing challenges as it struggles to break the $3,721 resistance mark. After peaking at $4,107 in December 2024, the market is looking for stability. Recent trends show an increase in Ethereum holdings, with 1.52 million ETH accumulated by a certain group over the last week, suggesting optimism for a price recovery. Despite some resilience, market sentiment is mixed. Indicators like Liveliness suggest ongoing liquidations, with some investors remaining cautious. A reduction in selling pressure could help Ethereum gain momentum, but the market’s outlook is presently guarded. Whale Driven Shiba Inu Burn Rate Skyrockets by 4100% A massive transaction resulting in the burning of 21 million SHIB tokens has led to a 4100% surge in the Shiba Inu burn rate. This increase, accompanied by $751 million in whale transactions in one day, indicates a growing interest from large-scale investors. However, despite the burn rate increase, SHIB’s price has fallen by 11% amidst a broader market downturn. This shows the complex interaction between supply adjustments and market sentiment, where a high burn rate does not immediately translate to price stability. Web3Bay: The Future of Online Shopping! Web3Bay is a decentralized platform that utilizes the full potential of Web3 to create a secure and transparent online marketplace for buying and selling digital assets. Setting itself apart from traditional e-commerce sites, Web3Bay offers unmatched security, inclusivity, and transparency. This platform melds blockchain’s best features—immutability, transparency, and security—with a straightforward interface, making decentralized shopping accessible and user-friendly. Web3Bay ushers in a new era for e-commerce, granting users complete control over their transactions and cultivating a community-led marketplace. Web3Bay has been in the spotlight recently due to its thriving presale, which has successfully raised over $630,000 and sold more than 175 million tokens across 28 stages. Each stage of the presale escalates the token price, offering substantial benefits to early supporters. Currently, Web3Bay tokens are priced attractively at $0.0039675, making them some of the most accessible on the market. Early investors are projecting an extraordinary return on investment (ROI) of 6,430% at launch. This strategic pricing model rewards early participants and lays a solid foundation for the platform’s official launch, thereby enhancing the long-term value for all token holders. The ongoing presale underscores the escalating interest in Web3Bay and emphasizes the importance of getting involved now. As the presale progresses, the price of 3BAY tokens is set to increase, presenting a prime opportunity for new investors to acquire tokens at a minimal initial investment. Act swiftly to capitalize on the upcoming price surge. Wrapping Up! From the significant rise in Shiba Inu’s burn rate due to whale activity to Ethereum’s price struggle at $3,721, the digital asset market is bustling with opportunities and challenges. However, Web3Bay stands out as a promising project that revolutionizes how digital assets are traded in Web3 for e-commerce. The presale’s success with over $630,000 raised and 175 million 3BAY tokens sold underscores strong market confidence. The current low token price and projected ROI position Web3Bay as an appealing choice for those ready to invest in its potential.

The price is still showing positive signs and could clear the $2.550 resistance. XRP price gained over 4% and rallied above the $2.450 zone. The price is now trading above $2.4650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The Federal Reserve ’s Jan. 29 meeting looms large as markets eagerly await clarity on interest rate policy. With a 97.3% probability that rates will remain steady at 4.25%-4.5%, according to market forecasts, and just a slim 2.7% chance of a 25 bps cut, the Fed’s decision is increasingly tied to incoming data. Chair Jerome Powell clarified in the December meeting that future rate cuts would hinge on economic indicators—a point reinforced by the central bank’s gradual shift, with three recent rate cuts of 50 bps in September, 25 bps in November, and 25 bps in December. For the crypto market and Bitcoin ( BTC ), which is currently trading at $94,840 and down nearly 7% this past week, the Fed’s decision could spark either renewed interest or further pressure. BTC 6-month price chart | Source: crypto.news Let’s explore the key economic data and their potential crypto impact. Economic indicators: A mixed bag for the Fed Inflation remains the Fed’s nemesis, but recent numbers suggest the battle is far from over. December’s Consumer Price Index is forecast to rise 2.8% from 2.7% in November, marking its third consecutive monthly increase and the highest since July 2024. Core CPI—a favored measure by the Fed that excludes volatile food and energy prices—is projected to have risen 0.2%, keeping the annual rate at 3.3%. Economists from Wells Fargo warn that inflationary pressures may linger due to fading disinflationary tailwinds, such as improved supply chains and falling commodity prices. Meanwhile, the job market continues to defy expectations. December’s payroll data showed an impressive 256,000 new jobs, surpassing consensus forecasts. A resilient labor market raises doubts about the Fed’s need for further easing, as employment strength could sustain consumer spending and economic activity. Yet, it also complicates the Fed’s task of balancing inflation control without triggering a sharp slowdown. Adding to the puzzle, long-term Treasury yields climbed to 4.8%, their highest level since late 2023. Historically, yields nearing 5% have coincided with stock market corrections, as noted by Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer. The dollar index also surged to levels unseen since November 2022, pushing the euro at parity with the dollar—a sign of tighter financial conditions that may already be doing some of the Fed’s work. What this means for Bitcoin and the crypto market Bitcoin’s recent price dip—down 12.5% from its all-time high of $108,268 on December 17, 2024—hints at a broader risk-off sentiment in financial markets. If the January CPI report confirms sticky inflation or resilient growth, the Fed may hold steady or even signal a longer pause before additional easing. Additionally, a rise in Treasury yields and strong dollar often weighs on global assets, including crypto, as it increases the relative cost of holding non-dollar-denominated investments. All these outcomes could dampen Bitcoin’s recovery prospects, as the crypto market thrives on expectations of easy monetary policy. The crypto market’s recent behavior shows a high correlation with risk sentiment on Wall Street, where the Nasdaq dropped 0.4% during the Jan. 13 session, mirroring the cautiousness reflected in Bitcoin’s price sentiment.",News|economy|Federal Reserve|Inflation,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-14 04:12:53

Some crypto are catching their eye for its potential to generate 500x gains. Alongside XRP, seasoned investors are turning their attention to BigBossInu, Ethereum (ETH), Injective (INJ), and SEI. Here’s why these digital assets are becoming popular picks for high-growth potential in the coming years. BigBossInu: Revolutionizing Crypto with Its Explosive Presale BigBossInu is rapidly shaking up the crypto market, with its presale igniting strong demand from investors. This opportunity promises massive rewards for early backers. As anticipation builds, BigBossInu is one of the hottest cryptos to track. Armed with cutting-edge features and an ambitious roadmap, BigBossInu is set to deliver game-changing growth in the months to come, making it a prime candidate for 500x gains. >>>>>> Ethereum is showing stability at $3,470 after a slight dip along with Bitcoin over the past 24 hours. The crypto market remains mixed in its sentiment, with Ethereum ETF approval generating little change in price. Traders are on the lookout for the next significant move. Ripple (XRP) skyrocketed nearly 98% following Ripple’s partial win against the SEC, briefly climbing to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, the price has since cooled, settling around $2.037 as market enthusiasm fades. The win has also prompted major exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken to relist XRP. Injective (INJ) is making waves in the DeFi space with its focus on decentralized derivatives and cross-chain trading. Its cutting-edge protocol enables users to trade a wide variety of financial markets in a decentralized manner. INJ’s innovative approach has attracted attention, especially from XRP holders, who see Injective as a promising investment alongside BigBossInu for massive returns. Sei recently achieved an all-time high of $0.589 and continues to trade around $0.60, reflecting a bullish trend. The increase comes after its listings on Binance and Coinbase, as well as a notable rise in transaction activity. With its efficient Layer-1 blockchain, Sei is emerging as a formidable player in high-speed trading. >>> Conclusion XRP investors looking to diversify and find the next big opportunity, BigBossInu, Ethereum (ETH), Injective (INJ), and SEI offer high-potential rewards. BigBossInu, in particular, is gaining traction for its potential to deliver 500x gains, making it one of the most exciting cryptos to watch in the coming years. As always, thorough research and strategic planning are essential when investing in cryptocurrencies. With the right approach, these digital assets could help investors achieve substantial financial success.

The ETF, named iShares Bitcoin ETF, aims to provide Canadian investors with access to BlackRock’s flagship U.S. spot Bitcoin fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Cboe Canada stated that the fund will allocate “all or substantially all of its assets” to IBIT. The Canadian ETF will trade under the ticker IBIT, identical to its U.S. counterpart. Additionally, shares denominated in U.S. dollars will be available under the ticker IBIT.U. Helen Hayes, BlackRock’s head of iShares Canada, commented, “The iShares Fund provides Canadian investors with a way to gain exposure to bitcoin and helps remove the operational and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly.” This ETF joins a growing list of over a dozen Bitcoin ETFs already trading on Canadian exchanges, according to Nasdaq. The IBIT.U shares will be listed in Canada but priced in U.S. dollars, as confirmed by Cboe Canada. Growing Demand for Bitcoin ETFs BlackRock’s U.S. IBIT ETF has rapidly become the most sought-after Bitcoin fund globally. Since its January 2024 launch, the fund has recorded over $37 billion in net inflows, as reported by Farside Investors. U.S. Bitcoin ETFs collectively experienced more than $35 billion in net inflows throughout the year, equating to roughly $144 million daily. This figure also accounts for $20 billion in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a fund launched in 2013 with higher management fees compared to newer options. In November, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $100 billion in net assets for the first time, Bloomberg Intelligence reported. JPMorgan noted in December that Bitcoin is becoming a key portfolio component for investors seeking to hedge against inflation and geopolitical risks. Sygnum Bank suggested that surging institutional inflows in 2025 could create demand shocks, driving Bitcoin prices higher.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-14 04:20:00

Here’s how",https://timestabloid.com/with-xrp-expert-says-ripple-will-have-the-largest-ipo-in-history-of-the-world-heres-how/,"Ripple, a leading blockchain company, is at the center of speculation about achieving the largest Initial Public Offering (IPO) in history. Saudi Aramco, the oil giant that currently holds the record, raised $25.6 billion during its IPO in 2019 and has a valuation of $1.93 trillion as of 2023. Crypto expert Zach Rector drew a compelling comparison between Ripple and Saudi Aramco, likening Ripple’s extensive XRP holdings to Aramco’s oil reserves. XRP, the digital asset closely associated with Ripple, is increasingly seen as a vital resource, similar to oil in the firm’s strategic importance and potential for global utility. This analogy highlights the transformative potential of Ripple’s technology and the critical role of XRP in its business model. Rector’s statement has amplified discussions around Ripple’s IPO, drawing attention to the company’s unique position in the evolving digital economy. Ripple will have the largest IPO in the history of the world. In fact, it’s very fitting that the largest IPO so far was from an oil company. Ripple = Saudi Aramco XRP = Oil Very similar setup with Ripple having significant “proven reserves” (XRP) to use an oil term. pic.twitter.com/CEHCQ4FEqm — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) January 12, 2025 Brad Garlinghouse Reveals Ripple’s Massive XRP Holdings In a recent interview with Citizens JMP Bank, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse spoke about the company’s valuation and growing dominance in the cryptocurrency sector. While Ripple was previously valued at $11 billion, Garlinghouse revealed that the amount of XRP held by Ripple has now surpassed $100 billion. This staggering figure underscores Ripple’s significant growth and ability to leverage XRP for liquidity solutions and cross-border payment innovations. These developments have led to increased speculation about Ripple’s IPO potential, with many in the crypto community believing it could eclipse Saudi Aramco’s record. Twitter user LeeLong24 pointed out that Ripple’s substantial XRP holdings suggest its valuation could far exceed previous estimates, further fueling a potential IPO’s anticipation.

By partnering with financial institutions , banks, and payment providers, Ripple has demonstrated its ability to reduce costs and enhance the efficiency of cross-border payments. With the global adoption of its technology accelerating, Ripple’s strategic positioning is stronger than ever. X user, VoxLibertas emphasized the historic nature of Ripple’s rise, calling it the emergence of a company that could become the most significant in history. Such sentiments reflect the broader optimism in the blockchain industry about Ripple’s potential to redefine financial systems. The comparison between Ripple and Saudi Aramco reflects the shifting tides in global industries. Where oil once defined economic power, digital assets like XRP may become the cornerstone of the future financial ecosystem. Ripple’s IPO, if it materializes, has the potential to mark a defining moment in the history of blockchain technology and the global economy.

It says this pause is part of efforts to upgrade its compliance suite, which aims to maintain its security standards and prevent misuse by bad actors. Backlash and Clarification In a January 12 announcement , the exchange stated, “To enhance the security of our platform and safeguard against bad actors, we have made the decision to temporarily pause crypto withdrawals till January 28th, 2025.” Mudrex also reassured users that INR withdrawals remain unaffected, crypto deposits are fully functional, and all funds are completely safe and secure. Despite these promises, the announcement has received backlash within the crypto community. Crypto trader Vivan Live brought the matter to the attention of users on X, advising them to remove their funds immediately by converting their assets into INR to avoid potential issues. Another community member, Aakash Athawasya, voiced skepticism about Mudrex’s intentions, alleging that the exchange never truly allowed such functionalities and only offered price exposure without ownership. He also warned users to avoid the platform and instead use on-chain solutions, citing personal losses on Indian exchanges. However, founder Alankar Saxena responded to the criticism, defending Mudrex’s long-standing support for crypto deposits and withdrawals. He noted that the company had always allowed users to access their funds freely, even when other similar entities limited such functionalities due to regulatory and operational challenges. The temporary suspension comes amid rapid growth for the company, with its user base reportedly rising 200% and its December 2024 trading volumes increasing 20-fold to $200 million. Regulatory Pressures Mudrex’s decision to halt crypto withdrawals also coincides with another exchange, Bybit, temporarily restricting services to its Indian customers effective January 12, 2025. The company blamed recent regulatory developments and the continuation of previous restrictions for its decision. As a result, customers can no longer open new trades or access products on the platform. However, fund withdrawals remain available. While India was ranked highly in the 2024 Crypto Adoption Index, it still maintains high levies on digital assets, including a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) and a 30% flat rate as income tax on crypto earnings. In December last year, authorities in the country accused several crypto exchanges, including Binance and WazirX, of evading tariffs. According to Pankaj Chaudhary, Minister of State for Finance, Nest Services Ltd, a company linked to Binance, faces nearly $87 million in unpaid Goods and Services Tax (GST) demands.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS.

A report from 404 Media reveals that Meta-owned Facebook has been removing links to Pixelfed, a decentralized competitor to Instagram. Links to pixelfed.social are being flagged as “spam” and swiftly deleted. Meta’s censorship of competitors contradicts its commitment to free expression AJ Sadauskas first noticed the censorship of Pixelfed on Bluesky , a competitor to X founded in 2019 by Jack Dorsey. Sadauskas posted screenshots showing Pixelfed links being removed from Facebook “within seconds.” Another Bluesky user, Johan Vandevelde, shared that the automatic deletions weren’t limited to Pixelfed but also extended to other Facebook competitors. He said: “Someone was asking for [Facebook] alternatives, and I gave a link to Mastodon. My comment was immediately removed, also because of ‘spam.” – Johan Vandevelde On January 7, Meta published a news release titled “More Speech and Fewer Mistakes,” written by the company’s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan. The release featured a five-minute video from Zuckerberg, who vowed that Meta would “get back to its roots around free expression.” Along with reducing moderation, Meta also announced the elimination of third-party fact-checkers in favor of a community notes model similar to X’s. Meta’s policy shift faces criticism amid political pressures Meta’s shift in policy was praised by US President-elect Donald Trump, who suggested it was a response to threats he had made against the company. However, some of Meta’s top executives , including Michael McConnell, co-chair of the company’s oversight board, criticized Zuckerberg for “bowing to political pressure” ahead of Trump’s inauguration. While the apparent censorship of Pixelfed could be seen as Meta trying to prevent the promotion of direct competitors rather than stifling free speech, it seems at odds with the company’s newly stated vision. The Wall Street Journal’s Editorial Board commented that Meta’s changes seem more focused on mending political relationships than advancing free speech. The Editorial Board stated that such changes may be in part motivated by Meta’s desire to rebuild ties with Republicans poised to take control of Washington and avoid regulation. The board added that Zuckerberg is also clearly responding to the message sent by voters in electing Trump.

Amid this performance, some analysts consider BTC’s price will likely see another drop before the flagship crypto aims for new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Tagged As Crypto’s ‘Most Cursed’ Coin—What’s Haunting It? Bitcoin Needs Daily Close Above $91,000 On Monday, Bitcoin shook off the weekend gains, dropping 5.8% to $90,300, its lowest price since November 18. The flagship crypto ended last week with an overall positive performance, nearing $96,000 and closing Friday above $94,000. This performance was held throughout the weekend, with Bitcoin moving between the $93,700 and $95,900 price range the past two days. This week started with seven straight red 1-hour candles, dropping below $91,000 for the first time since the December 19 correction and dipping lower than the December 5 pullback. However, Bitcoin bounced after dropping below this key level, recovering the recently lost mark. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital stated that BTC’s daily close will dictate the next move, suggesting it needs a close above $91,000 to confirm the reclaim. The analyst explained, “Last week, Bitcoin was deviating beyond the Range High resistance of $101,000. This week, Bitcoin is potentially deviating below the Range Low support of $91,000.” He asserted that BTC closed above the $101,000 range high last Monday but failed to retest it into new support after the breakout, reverting to the $91,000-$101,000 range. For this week, Rekt Capital added that even if Bitcoin closes the day below the $91,000 range low, it will likely need to turn that level into resistance for its price to drop into the $87,000-$91,000 range. Nonetheless, he stated that Bitcoin generally needs to close above this key level to persevere in its current range but noted that “a lot can change through the day.” Is A Dip To $87,000 Coming? Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC’s monthly returns tend to be “patchy and predominately bearish” in January. As CoinGlass data shows, Bitcoin’s performance has been mostly bearish in January. Since 2013, BTC has started the year in red seven times, including 2025’s current performance. According to the post, the market usually “picks up” in February. He added that the higher timeframe levels that are “teasing to be lost as support” are “likely to be reclaimed” in the future. Meanwhile, Altcoin Sherpa considers that “1 last liquidation wick” is due before “we reverse for BTC.” The analyst also suggested that Altcoins are likely to drop another 30%-50% before the Altseason. Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that a “bunch of shorts have entered the market in the past few hours.” The trader noted that “price just keeps slowly dribbling back down” as these positions are usually “punished” when bulls are in control. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Teeters on the Edge: Is a Steep Decline Next? Daan explained, “At some point, the shorts will have to close out, but they probably won’t do so before pushing the market down further, combined with the spot selling from Coinbase.” And added that “the slow grinds down end in a violent wick, after which shorts take profit, and we see a (local) bottom.” Additionally, the trader highlighted the similarities between BTC’s performance between December 2023 and January 2024 and December 2024 and January 2025. If history were to repeat, Bitcoin’s next move could be a correction to the $87,000 support, followed by a consolidation period in the new range. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $91,700, a 2.9% decline in the daily timeframe.

While investors are anticipating the inauguration of the pro-crypto Trump administration to inspire a market uptrend, a recent governmental approval may have tempered investors’ optimism and altered the direction of Bitcoin price predictions. Ethereum (ETH), another top crypto coin, has also continued its fall, and investors are now out for a dark horse that could save the day. Top among them is the new Remittix ($RTX) project which has continued to make headlines for weeks now. The new DeFi project has raised excitement in the crypto market with its PayFi solution, and experts believe the project has enough potential to live up to the bullish hype it’s getting right now. More details on Remittix and the top two cryptos coming up. Silk Road BTC Sale Approval Impacts Bitcoin Price Predictions It’s just a few weeks into 2025, and Bitcoin has already had a roller-coaster experience in the crypto market. Recall that the BTC price set a new ATH at $108K just before Christmas last year. After a minor relapse in the last few days of 2024, the BTC price made a bullish dash for its ATH again earlier this year before the general market crash. Lately, there have been quite a number of bullish Bitcoin price predictions tipping BTC for another rally in anticipation of a new US administration. However, such predictions have now been dealt a big blow as Bitcoin now faces uncertain times following a major regulatory development. The US Department of Justice has approved the sale of 69,370 Bitcoins seized from the Silk Road marketplace at over $6 billion. This news marks the end of a long legal battle, but its impact on BTC could be disastrous. The BTC price is now trading at $95,000, a weekly 3.15% dip. Many experts are rethinking their Bitcoin price predictions, with some developing cold feet about. Ethereum Price Dips 16%: Will ETH Rebound? Before the recent market-wide setback, Ethereum has been quite unimpressive considering how bullish Bitcoin and other top altcoins like Solana got late last year. Although ETH briefly crossed the $4,000 mark in December, the coin soon could not sustain its bullish momentum and is now struggling to stay above $3,200. At $3,068, the Ethereum price has now dipped 26% in the past month, mirroring the overall bearishness in the crypto market. ETH investors are cautious as Ethereum ETFs are experiencing outflows, and Ethereum’s staking yield continues to drop. With such uncertainty clouding the Ethereum price trajectory, ETH holders can only hope for a rebound, especially if the coin can defy the general downtrend in the market. Viral Remittix ($RTX) Steals the Spotlight As Bitcoin and Ethereum struggle to regain momentum due to regulatory pressures and market volatility, the crypto market is jumping on Remittix ‘s dream of a PayFi solution that addresses the problems of crypto-to-fiat transactions. Remittix’s PayFi technology supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and allows for direct transfers into more than 30 fiat currencies across the world. The project is the newest gift of innovation from the DeFi sector. With the entire crypto market egging it on, the Remittix platform would be going head-to-head with traditional payment institutions like Stripe and Wise. Without any hidden fees or conversion delays, there is no doubt that Remittix has what it takes to hold its own. The project’s native $RTX token has quickly gained traction, with presale numbers doing impressive numbers. In a market where Bitcoin and Ethereum are battling bearish pressure, Remittix has earned a reputation as one of the most promising cryptos in 2025. The $RTX token begins its profit journey with up to 800% in its presale for early birds. It gets even better after launch as experts project that the demand for Remittix’s PayFi solution would create a huge demand that could pump the $RTX token by up to 5,000% . The $RTX presale is in high demand and selling out fast. Buy now and lock in short and long-term gains.

As reported by Seek Alpha on Jan. 13, Brett Knoblauch , who is the Head of Crypto and Digital Assets Research at Cantor Fitzgerald, said that he believes the MicroStrategy (MSTR) stocks would reach $613. Currently, the average price of MSTR on Wall Street sits at $518. If MSTR reaches $613, its stock prices would boost up roughly 20%. Cantor Fitzgerald just boosted their price target on $MSTR from $518 to $613. 👀 Getting a little cliche to say Trump insiders know something, but I like the bullishness. — Bitcoin Overflow (@btc_overflow) January 13, 2025 Knoblauch predicts the uptick in the shares for MSTR as the firm has “developed a capital markets flywheel that allows it to accretively add bitcoin on a per share basis”, he wrote in a note. He also credits Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) post-U.S. election surge as a factor which buoyed MSTR, which is why the company raised about 18 billion dollars in capital in November and December of 2024, Cantor adds. You might also like: 3 potential catalysts to reverse crashing Bitcoin and altcoin prices The expert also calculated that MicroStrategy can issue $6.7 billion of equity, $2 billion preferred , $18 billion of debt and another 287K BTC to support his prediction. MicroStrategy is expected to continue to enjoy a yield greater than 10% on Bitcoin until 2025- this could mean an additional $400 million for the U.S. treasury through MicroStrategy, believes Knoblauch. “Ultimately, we are expecting 2025 to be another year where MSTR delivers a BTC yield above 10%, which would suggest treasury operations profits of more than $4B.” Brett Knoblauch MicroStrategy’s “21/21” plan, wherein the firm wants to accumulate $42 billion worth of BTC over the next three years, has already been set in motion. The corporate giant started buying BTC since Aug. 2020 where it acquired 21,454 BTC for approximately $250 million at an average price of about $11,653 per BTC. The firm’s most recent purchase was made yesterday, on Jan 13, where it bought around 2,530 BTC for $243 million, further fueling the market optimism. As of today, MicroStrategy has 450K BTC in its portfolio. In the past 24 hours, MSTR’s price has surged 0.49% to $328.40 , whereas BTC’s price has shot up +0.43% to $94,932, a close alignment in terms of percentage gains. This similarity comes from MicroStrategy’s strong correlation with the price of BTC since the company’s strategy is primarily based on its BTC ownership and acquisitions, and its stock is, therefore, sensitive to fluctuations in the value of BTC.

As Sony steps into the world of blockchain, it seeks to empower fans and creators alike, allowing communities to connect globally while protecting their rights. The tech giant launched two new projects on the layer 2 network: a NFT-based fan marketing platform and a crypto exchange services platform. Here’s What Sony’s Soneium Platform Has to Offer Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Sony’s Soneium is a layer-2 network designed with the goal of inspiring creativity and emotion for its users. The Sony Blockchain Solution Labs (BSL) stated that the launch of layer-2 platform seeks to transcend social, economic, and regional barriers thereby creating an open internet wherein ideas can thrive and value can flow freely and equitably. Being an open-to-all platform, Soneium is a public blockchain that fosters inclusivity without limitations. It leverages the OP Stack and Superchain technology developed by the Optimism Foundation to deliver a cutting-edge blockchain experience. Speaking on the mainnet launch, Jun Watanabe, Chairman, Sony Block Solutions Labs, said: “Soneium is built to transcend boundaries, empowering innovation and collaboration. At Sony BSL, we’re proud to create a platform redefining how communities and creators interact with the internet.” Sony announced Soneium Layer-2 blockchain last year in August 2024. Since then, it has announced developers to test several applications on the “Soneium Minato” testnet. Furthermore, they have also introduced several applications, spanning entertainment, including games, NFTs, and social platforms, as well as financial and other utility-focused apps. The network has surpassed 14 million accounts and verified over 47 million transactions. Stablecoin issuer Circle was quick to announce a collaboration with Sony to introduce its USDC stablecoin on the Soneium Layer-2, in a push into the Web3 industry. Two Key Projects Launched on the Layer-2 Blockchain The official press release from Sony shows that two new projects will launch on the Soneium mainnet soon. The first is the NFT-based fan marketing platform provided by SNFT Inc. Starting February 2025, this fan marketing platform will go live offering comprehensive support for companies engaging in NFT initiatives. This covers everything from execution to the analysis of fan engagement metrics tied to NFTs . The service will enable businesses to easily issue NFTs, opening new opportunities for fan interaction and creating engaging user experiences to strengthen relationships. Unlike many Web3 platforms that require separate crypto wallet setups, the new platform will feature an integrated web-based wallet with social login functionality. In another development, S.BLOX Corporation has rebranded its “WhaleFin” platform into “S. BLOX” to enhance user experience for crypto trading as well as interacting with apps on Soneium. The platform is a crucial addition, as crypto assets serve as primary payment methods within Soneium’s Web3 applications. To celebrate the launch, S.BLOX Corporation has kicked off a promotional campaign starting today. Users who open a new account and trade crypto assets will receive BTC worth 3,000 yen as a reward.

38931420,https://coinpaper.com/6892/uniswap-wallet-faces-security-warning-as-critical-flaw-exposed,1736832600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Uniswap Wallet Faces Security Warning as Critical Flaw Exposed,https://coinpaper.com/6892/uniswap-wallet-faces-security-warning-as-critical-flaw-exposed,"Cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain projects are facing heightened scrutiny as significant technical changes and potential vulnerabilities come to light. South Korea's Upbit has issued a cautionary notice regarding Internet of Services Token (IOST) as it undergoes a major layer-2 transition, potentially impacting its tokenomics and market stability. Meanwhile, security concerns have emerged over Uniswap’s Web3 wallet, with a reported vulnerability that could compromise user funds if exploited. Uniswap Web3 Wallet Users Urged to Stay Vigilant as ScaleBit Reports Critical Vulnerability On Jan. 13, ScaleBit, a subsidiary of security auditing firm BitsLab, raised alarms about a critical vulnerability in Uniswap’s Web3 wallet. According to ScaleBit, the flaw could potentially compromise ”all stored assets” within the wallet. This revelation has sent ripples across the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, sparking concerns over wallet security. In a statement, ScaleBit detailed the purported flaw, which allows attackers with physical access to a device to bypass authentication mechanisms and extract the wallet’s mnemonic phrase. This phrase, commonly referred to as a ”seed phrase,” is a unique string of 12 to 24 random words. It serves as a master key, granting full control over a wallet’s assets from any device. ScaleBit’s statement highlighted the gravity of the issue, stating, “Anyone with access to an unlocked device can obtain the wallet’s mnemonic phrase in under three minutes. This vulnerability persists even in the latest version of the app.” Given the critical nature of mnemonic phrases in securing digital assets, this vulnerability poses a significant risk. ScaleBit advised Uniswap Wallet users to avoid lending their devices to others until a patch is deployed. The reported vulnerability comes against a backdrop of increasing cybersecurity threats in the cryptocurrency industry. In 2024, losses due to exploits surged by 40% compared to the previous year, reaching approximately $2.3 billion, according to cybersecurity firm Cyvers. Access control breaches, especially in centralized exchanges (CEXs) and custodial platforms, contributed significantly to this rise. Deddy Lavid, co-founder and CEO of Cyvers, emphasized that these breaches highlight the urgent need for robust security measures. Despite the alarming annual figures, the last months of 2024 showed a noticeable decline in losses from crypto scams, exploits, and hacks . Blockchain security firms CertiK and PeckShield reported significantly lower figures in December compared to earlier months. CertiK Findings: December saw $28.6 million in known losses, down from $63.8 million in November and $115.8 million in October. PeckShield Analysis: A similar trend was observed, with hack-related losses in December totaling $24.7 million—a 71% decrease from November. These reductions reflect improved security measures across the industry, though vulnerabilities like the one reported by ScaleBit underline the persistent challenges. The Importance of User Vigilance As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, incidents like the reported Uniswap wallet vulnerability bring attention to the need for user awareness and proactive measures. Web3 wallets, touted for their decentralization and user control, must be paired with robust security protocols to mitigate risks. Recommendations for Users: Avoid sharing or lending devices containing Web3 wallets. Regularly update wallet software to ensure access to the latest security patches. Enable additional layers of security, such as device-level encryption and biometric authentication, where available. Use hardware wallets for added protection when holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency. As one of the leading decentralized exchanges, Uniswap’s response to this vulnerability will be closely watched by the community. A timely patch and transparent communication will be critical to maintaining user trust. Until then, Uniswap Wallet users are advised to exercise caution and follow security best practices to safeguard their assets. The cryptocurrency sector’s reliance on trustless systems necessitates unwavering attention to security. Incidents like the ScaleBit report serve as stark reminders that even widely used platforms can harbor vulnerabilities. Strengthening security infrastructure and fostering collaboration between wallet developers and auditors will be essential in ensuring the continued growth and resilience of DeFi. Upbit Issues Warning on IOST Ahead of Layer-2 Transition and Major Tokenomic Overhaul In related news, South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit has issued a cautionary notice regarding the Internet of Services Token (IOST), following an advisory from the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA). The warning aims to alert investors about significant changes tied to IOST’s upcoming transition to a layer-2 blockchain, which is expected to bring considerable shifts in the tokenomics and network structure. IOST, a blockchain project focusing on decentralized applications (DApps) with a strong emphasis on scalability and high throughput, is preparing to migrate to a layer-2 blockchain in the coming weeks. This move is anticipated to significantly enhance the project’s efficiency, transaction capacity, and fee structure. As part of this transition, IOST plans to issue approximately 21.3 billion new tokens. These will be allocated strategically to support validator rewards, user incentives, community engagement, and ecosystem development. Token Distribution Breakdown: 60%: Validator rewards to strengthen network security and encourage participation. 20%: Airdrops aimed at incentivizing users and fostering adoption. 8%: Community incentives to drive engagement. 5%: Developer grants for building on the ecosystem. 4%: Governance funding managed through the Nexus DAO. 3%: Team compensation and operational costs. This phased token supply expansion is designed to support the network’s transition while mitigating risks associated with sudden market fluctuations. On Jan. 13, Upbit released a notice urging caution to IOST investors, citing the upcoming structural and tokenomic changes. Upbit’s advisory aligns with DAXA’s protocol of flagging digital assets undergoing significant changes or exhibiting unusual market activity. The goal is to ensure transparency and safeguard investor interests amid shifts in market dynamics. The Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA), a consortium of leading South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges , plays a crucial role in maintaining market integrity. By monitoring digital assets and issuing warnings when necessary, DAXA aims to establish unified standards across the industry. The decision to transition to a layer-2 blockchain was finalized following IOST’s second governance vote, which concluded on Jan. 12. Additionally, the move is expected to bridge IOST’s current layer-1 network with its new, more efficient infrastructure. This shift is anticipated to improve transaction speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining a strong focus on decentralized governance through the Nexus DAO. The issuance of new tokens and the broader network overhaul come with inherent risks. Sudden supply expansions can lead to price volatility, particularly in the short term, as the market adjusts to the new dynamics. However, IOST’s phased rollout and detailed allocation plan aim to minimize disruptions and create long-term value for its ecosystem. The IOST advisory comes at a time when South Korea is intensifying its oversight of the cryptocurrency sector. Recent incidents, such as the $50 million Upbit hack attributed to North Korea and investigations into 600,000 Know Your Customer (KYC) violations, demonstrate the country’s proactive stance on regulatory compliance and investor protection. Meanwhile, the caution surrounding IOST places the spotlight on the importance of transparency and communication during periods of significant change, particularly as the global cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve. What’s Next for IOST Investors? As the IOST transition progresses, investors are encouraged to closely monitor updates from both the project team and their respective exchanges. Upbit has assured its users that it will maintain open communication with IOST’s developers to provide timely information and safeguard assets. Key Recommendations for Investors: Stay informed about the project’s updates and the timing of the layer-2 transition. Exercise caution when trading or holding IOST during this period of change. Consider the potential for short-term volatility and align trading strategies accordingly. IOST’s planned migration to a layer-2 blockchain represents a bold step forward in its mission to enhance scalability and network efficiency. However, as with any major overhaul, the transition introduces complexities and potential risks. Upbit’s cautionary notice and DAXA’s involvement show the importance of vigilance and transparency in navigating these changes. While the road ahead may be uncertain in the short term, IOST’s commitment to decentralized governance and ecosystem growth positions it as a noteworthy contender in the blockchain space. Investors and stakeholders alike will be watching closely as the project enters this transformative phase.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|UNI,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-14 05:30:00

It aims to give the regulator insight into how foreign agencies address challenges related to emerging payments and digital assets. The release said that the first TRE secondment will begin next month, with DFS and the Bank of England exchanging senior staff with expertise in emerging payments and digital assets. The Transatlantic Regulatory Exchange will enhance crypto regulation expertise The TRE program will start in February and last six months, with participants visiting the Bank of England for more learning. According to Harris, those undertaking the program are expected to return to the US well-equipped with adequate knowledge of regulating financial services, including cryptocurrency. Harris, who is in charge of the New York regulator, was earlier working at the White House under Obama’s presidency. According to Partnership for New York City President and CEO Kathy Wylde, the Transatlantic Regulatory Exchange is a program that underscores the importance of New York and London as twin engines of the global finance system. This initiative reinforces DFS’s role as a preeminent global regulator, driving responsible innovation and economic opportunity in the city and state while protecting the global financial system. The United Kingdom and the United States pursue regulatory initiatives The NYDFS is responsible for crypto regulations in New York, where most crypto firms have been taking refuge due to its welcoming business and regulatory environment. The financial regulator oversaw the execution of the BitLicensing scheme in 2015 when it approved projects such as Ripple Labs’ RLUSD stablecoin in December. Although the end game is unclear, the Bank of England has had its challenges handling cryptocurrency regulations. The central bank’s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, is expected to monitor firms’ cryptocurrency exposure and propose UK digital assets rules.

Meanwhile, companies like Semler Scientific are increasing their Bitcoin holdings, with Semler now holding 2,321 BTC worth $192 million. MicroStrategy also surpassed 450,000 BTC after its recent purchase. Despite recent price volatility tied to macroeconomic factors, Bitcoin's supply on exchanges has hit a seven-year low, which signals strong institutional demand and potential for future price growth. Canadian Investors Gain Access to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is introducing a new Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Cboe Canada to provide Canadian investors with access to its flagship US spot Bitcoin fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This Canadian ETF, which is named iShares Bitcoin ETF, will allocate nearly all its assets to IBIT and trade under the same ticker. Additionally, shares denominated in US dollars will carry the ticker IBIT.U . Helen Hayes, BlackRock’s head of iShares Canada, shared that the fund offers Canadian investors an efficient way to gain Bitcoin exposure while eliminating the complexities of directly holding the cryptocurrency. (Source: Cboe Canada ) This launch adds to the growing list of Bitcoin ETFs available in Canada , with over a dozen already trading on local exchanges. BlackRock’s US IBIT ETF was launched in January of 2024, and has become a very dominant player in the global Bitcoin ETF market after attracting over $37 billion in net inflows . Collectively, US Bitcoin ETFs recorded $35 billion in net inflows last year, despite the large outflows from older products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which faced stiff competition because of its higher management fees. The growth of Bitcoin ETFs also reflects the shift in investor sentiment where Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a critical asset for hedging against inflation and geopolitical risks. In November, US Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $100 billion in net assets for the first time, and analysts project another $48 billion in net inflows for 2025. JPMorgan’s December report also shed some light on Bitcoin’s growing importance in diversified portfolios, driven by record capital inflows into crypto markets. Asset manager Sygnum Bank suggested that rising institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs could trigger serious demand shocks which could potentially propel Bitcoin’s price to new highs in 2025. Semler Scientific Boosts Bitcoin Holdings Semler Scientific, a healthcare technology company, bought an additional 237 Bitcoin for approximately $23 million, paying just over $98,000 per coin. This acquisition was funded by stock sales and operating cash flow, and brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 2,321 BTC, which is valued at close to $192 million. (Source: Semler Scientific ) Over $120 million in stock has been issued by the company to finance its Bitcoin acquisitions and other activities. This increased its Bitcoin yield, which is the ratio of BTC holdings to outstanding shares, from 72.6% to 99.3%. This metric was originally popularized by MicroStrategy, and it serves as a key performance indicator for companies integrating Bitcoin into their corporate strategy. Semler’s leadership believes that investing in Bitcoin has been pivotal in transforming the company from a struggling “zombie” entity that barely survived on minimal earnings, into a more dynamic operation. Semler joins other companies like Hoth Therapeutics , Genius Group , and Rumble in following the Bitcoin-buying playbook that was established by MicroStrategy. Bitcoin holdings (Source: Bitcoin Treasuries ) Corporate Bitcoin treasuries now hold more than $54 billion collectively, and Semler ranks 13th in size. MicroStrategy leads the pack with a Bitcoin treasury exceeding $40 billion. This trend certainly reflects growing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Some well known investors like Paul Tudor Jones echoed this sentiment, while asset manager VanEck pointed out that even US state governments are adding Bitcoin to their portfolios to mitigate fiscal risks. MicroStrategy Surpasses 450,000 Bitcoin Milestone MicroStrategy also reached a new milestone in its Bitcoin holdings by surpassing 450,000 BTC after a $243 million investment during the recent market dip. The company’s total Bitcoin acquisition now stands at $28.2 billion, with an average purchase price of $62,691 per Bitcoin. Founder and chairman Michael Saylor revealed the latest purchase , which was made at an average price of $95,972. Hedge funds and some other institutional players, including Semler Scientific, also took advantage of the price drop. Bitcoin’s recent volatility was influenced by macroeconomic factors. The cryptocurrency fell below $92,000 after the release of strong US labor market data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Jan. 9. Analysts attribute the decline to concerns over the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening in 2025, which delayed expectations of rate cuts until late July. This made Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies much less attractive to some investors who are reverting to being reactive to broader economic trends. Bitcoin’s price reached an all-time high of over $100,000 in December of 2024 after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory, but now faces challenges tied to the anticipated slower pace of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite this, continued institutional buying proves that there is still some confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, even as macroeconomic uncertainties weigh on short-term price movements. Bitcoin’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit 7-Year Low Bitcoin reserves on crypto exchanges have fallen to a near seven-year low after reaching 2.35 million BTC on Jan. 13, according to CryptoQuant data . This level was last seen in June of 2018, when Bitcoin traded just above $7,000. Bitcoin exchange reserves (Source: CryproQuant ) The decline in exchange reserves is largely attributed to institutional buying, with hedge funds and spot Bitcoin ETFs acquiring large amounts of BTC during the recent dip. André Dragosch , head of research at Bitwise, pointed out the increased market exposure to Bitcoin by hedge funds. The diminishing Bitcoin supply on exchanges fueled speculation about a potential supply shock, which is a phenomenon where strong demand meets reduced availability that could lead to upward price pressure. In December, spot Bitcoin ETFs purchased nearly three times the number of coins mined, which tightened the supply as Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $108,300 on Dec. 17. Analysts suggest this dynamic may contribute to Bitcoin’s recovery to and beyond the $100,000 psychological mark, though low trading volumes are still a barrier to any major rally. Ryan Lee , chief analyst at Bitget Research, noticed reduced selling pressure and potential consolidation as Bitcoin stabilizes around its current levels. However, he stated that trading volume on daily timeframes is still subdued, which indicates a lack of decisive momentum to break key resistance levels. The broader crypto market is also experiencing low trading activity, with volumes across major assets falling to levels last seen before the US elections in November 2024. This “trading paralysis” reflects fear and uncertainty but may also increase the probability of market rebounds, according to market intelligence platform Santiment . Despite the current challenges, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Predictions for late 2025 suggest a potential cycle top above $150,000, driven by an anticipated $20 trillion increase in the global money supply, which could direct $2 trillion into Bitcoin investments.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-14 05:39:19

The cornerstone investor for the round’s final close was Fulgur Ventures, a venture capital firm with a focus on Bitcoin technologies, alongside new and existing strategic and financial backers, according to an official announcement . Notably, Sygnum’s team members also participated, maintaining majority ownership with the co-founders and board. Sygnum Raised Over $40M in January 2023 The milestone comes shortly after Sygnum raised over $40 million in January 2024, led by Milan-based asset manager Azimut Holding, at a $900 million valuation. Earlier, in its Series B funding round in January 2022, Sygnum raised $90 million with backing from notable Asia-based investors like Sun Hung Kai & Co., Animoca Brands, and SBI Holdings. “Sygnum’s market-tested infrastructure, digital asset-native team and global ecosystem makes them the ideal partner to co-develop innovative Bitcoin-related financial products and technologies – as well as for future collaborations with other Fulgur portfolio companies,” Oleg Mikhalsky, a partner at Fulgur Ventures, said. Sygnum plans to utilize the new funds to enhance its Bitcoin technology offerings, expand its institutional infrastructure, and strengthen compliance operations.

With licenses in Switzerland, Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein, the firm is strategically positioning itself for growth, particularly in MiCA-compliant EU markets. “Sygnum reaching Unicorn status is a strong validation by the market of our business model, strategy and team,” co-founder and CEO Mathias Imbach said. Sygnum reported operational profitability in 2024, driven by significant growth in its trading products, including crypto spot, derivatives, FX, and traditional securities. The company’s annual trade volume surged over 1,000% year-over-year, and it now manages more than $5 billion in assets for 2,000 clients across 70 countries. In recent years, Sygnum has launched several innovative services, including Sygnum Connect, a 24/7 multi-asset settlement network, and Sygnum Protect, which enables institutional clients to trade on major crypto exchanges securely. Partnerships with Fidelity International, Matter Labs, and Hamilton Lane have further advanced its tokenization initiatives, while collaborations with Chainlink have brought fund NAV data on-chain. Sygnum Predicts Bitcoin to Soar in 2025 Bitcoin could experience significant price increases in 2025, driven by a surge in institutional investment, according to a report from Sygnum Bank. The bank said that traditional institutional investors, such as pension and sovereign wealth funds, are beginning to allocate capital to crypto assets, which could trigger substantial demand. The institutional demand is met with a minimal supply of Bitcoin , especially considering a significant portion is held by long-term investors and rarely traded. This scarcity amplifies the impact of any investment, potentially leading to substantial price appreciation as demand increases. Sygnum’s Head of Research, Katalin Tischhauser, previously projected that spot Ethereum ETFs would attract $5 to $10 billion in their first year. While Ethereum ETFs have garnered $2.5 billion in net inflows over six months, Bitcoin ETFs have significantly outperformed, drawing $18.9 billion during the same period.

It’s Been Talked About Since 2017 But What Is The Likelyhood In 2025?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-to-1-its-been-talked-about-since-2017-but-what-is-the-likelyhood-in-2025/,"Is Dogecoin (DOGE) merely another pipe dream in the meme coin market, or will it at last reach the much awaited $1 mark? Dogecoin is still a promising asset among crypto aficionados even as recent whale action fuels hope despite short-term volatility. On the other hand, Remittix (RTX) , a rising star, is revolutionizing the cross-border payment sector with innovative ideas and a cheap presale pricing in the meantime. Which one of these top crypto coins contain the secret to huge rallies in 2025? Read on to find out the key elements and forecasts influencing the long-term direction of RTX and DOGE. Dogecoin Rollercoaster: Can the Memecoin Regain Momentum? With more than a 16% dip in the past week, the Dogecoin price has lately seen bearish times. Bearish momentum pulled the meme coin down to the $0.32 support zone following the surge to the $0.40 resistance level. Reflecting a bearish period for one of the top meme coins in the market, the Dogecoin price has dropped almost 19% over the previous month. Still, community sentiment is quite positive since Dogecoin aficionados are anticipating a significant bullish comeback. Fascinatingly, Dogecoin whales bought 140 million DOGE worth $55 million in one day, indicating ongoing belief in the long-term viability of the memecoin. Looking at the Dogecoin price chart exposes a month-long consolidation between $0.42 and $0.26, therefore stressing the volatility of the meme coin. With a 9.06% price volatility, data from CoinCodex indicates Dogecoin saw green days on 47% of the past 30 days. TradingView data adds another level of complication when technical indicators show conflicting signals. The MAs and MACD imply increasing buy momentum while the CCI and Momentum Oscillator flash sell signals on the Dogecoin price chart. Keeping Dogecoin firmly among the top crypto coins to monitor, this discrepancy suggests a probable future surge. Looking ahead, experts still see great promise for Dogecoin. A 2025 Dogecoin price prediction shows a wide range of possibilities by implying the memecoin might trade within a range of $0.27 to $1.33. Strong community support and active whale activity as the meme coin consolidates indicate likely growth prospects. Remittix: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments for Digital Age Remittix leads in transforming cross-border payments as the globe progresses in the digital age. Moreover, Remittix addresses one of the most urgent issues in global finance by smoothly linking crypto and fiat for effective international transactions, therefore combining the potential of cryptocurrencies with conventional banking institutions.

Priced at only $0.0199 during its presale and expected to see gains in excess of 2,000% the RTX utility token presents early investors with a great chance for exponential returns! Dogecoin (DOGE) vs. Remittix (RTX): The Smart Bet for 2025 Although the road to the $1 mark is still a rollercoaster ride for Dogecoin (DOGE) driven by bullish community sentiment and whale activity, the volatility and confusing signals make the memecoin’s near-term future uncertain. Conversely, Remittix (RTX) shows up as a lighthouse of consistency and creativity in the cryptocurrency field. Remittix is set aside as a really transforming platform by its innovative approach to cross-border payments, safe blockchain architecture, and unsurpassed utility for both individuals and companies. Valued at just $0.0199 during its presale, the RTX token offers investors with an exponential growth potential. Meanwhile, the presale is fast selling out as a result of a huge demand for the limited token supply.

The space has divided into two where one believes this is ending the bull market while for others it is just another opportunity. Market sentiment feels more fearful than opportunism. A Fearful Drop or a Golden Chance? The mention of Bitcoin slipping below $90K in various online discussions caused a stir. While fear usually signals market uncertainty, history shows it can also signal a rebound. The crypto greed and fear index sits at 46, which leans toward fear. But many investors are now talking about strategies to turn this into profit. Keywords like “buy,” “sell,” and “money” used on various social media posts, show how focused people are on making the right moves. Source : Sentiment Social media plays a huge role in understanding market sentiment. Terms like “btc” and “90K” have been trending, shaping how people feel about the market. It’s like a domino effect. Fear spreads fast, but so does optimism when buyers see potential in the chaos. Is Politics Driving Crypto Sentiment? The buzz isn’t just about Bitcoin. Conversations about Donald Trump’s potential return to power have stirred speculation about a “Trump pump.” Could his presidency impact crypto prices? Some think his policies might bring a surge, while others stay cautious. Either way, politics and crypto seem more connected than ever. The top trending topics in crypto are heavily revolving around Bitcoin's temporary drop to under $90K and Trump's inauguration next week. Regarding the former, the fact that '$90K' was being spammed across social media was a great fear signal that would foreshadow a bounce. pic.twitter.com/gL2GY1Lm6S — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 14, 2025 Beyond Bitcoin, there’s chatter about bull and bear markets, not just in crypto but in stocks too. Words like “week” and “cap” show how much attention people are giving to short-term trends. Everyone’s trying to predict the next move, balancing between risk and reward. What to Expect With Bitcoin recovering from its brief dip, the market remains unpredictable. Fear might be lingering, but history favors the bold. Will Trump’s presidency play a role? Could social media drive another spike? One thing’s clear—crypto is as exciting as ever, with opportunities hiding in the chaos.

This is part of a larger $100 million crackdown aimed at cleaning up Wall Street’s act. Robinhood’s sins? A 2021 data breach that exposed millions of user emails and names, sloppy record-keeping for its fractional share trades, and a lack of attention to regulations that govern everything from cybersecurity to customer communications. The SEC didn’t hold back in detailing Robinhood’s failures. Between 2019 and 2023, the company fell short on several federal compliance requirements. For instance, the broker violated Regulation SHO, which exists to curb abusive short-selling practices. Add that to the list of issues, including their inability to secure customer data and maintain records legally required for their trading operations. A closer look at Robinhood’s “crimes” Robinhood’s 2021 data breach was a big one. Hackers exploited weaknesses in its systems, gaining access to names and email addresses of millions of users. The breach was a major hit to the company’s reputation, but that wasn’t the only issue regulators uncovered. Between April 2019 and July 2022, Robinhood failed to implement solid identity theft protection policies, leaving customers vulnerable to fraud. From June to November 2021, Robinhood ignored a known vulnerability in its cybersecurity systems. That negligence allowed unauthorized access to sensitive customer information. The SEC also slammed the company for failing to investigate suspicious transactions between January 2020 and March 2022. These lapses led to delays in filing legally required Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), a critical part of financial compliance. The SEC order didn’t stop there. Robinhood was called out for failing to maintain some of its customer communications between 2020 and 2021. This included emails and other correspondence that federal law mandates must be preserved. According to the SEC’s acting director of enforcement, Sanjay Wadhwa, these failures went beyond compliance. “When firms fall short of those obligations, the consequences go far beyond deficient document productions,” Wadhwa said. Robinhood didn’t deny the allegations. Instead, the company issued a statement calling the violations “historical.” Lucas Moskowitz, the firm’s general counsel, said, “We are well-positioned to continue leading the industry in developing the innovative products and services our customers want and need.” Robinhood also made it clear they’re eager to move forward under a new SEC administration, just like the rest of us. Wall Street firms face steep penalties Robinhood wasn’t the only target in this regulatory sweep. The SEC also fined 12 other firms for record-keeping violations, collectively raking in $63 million in penalties. The violations? Using unofficial communication channels like messaging apps that sidestepped record-keeping requirements. Blackstone topped the list of offenders, agreeing to pay $12 million in fines. KKR followed with $11 million, while Charles Schwab shelled out $10 million. Other firms, including Apollo Capital Management, TPG Capital Advisors, and divisions of the Carlyle Group, were hit with $8.5 million penalties each. Santander US Capital Markets paid $4 million, and PJT Partners got away with the smallest fine: $600,000. In Blackstone’s case, senior managing directors had been using unapproved platforms since at least December 2019. These platforms allowed them to share sensitive information about client trades and investment strategies outside of legal channels. The SEC’s investigation revealed that this kind of communication violated federal securities laws requiring firms to maintain records of their activities. The agency’s crackdown is part of a larger effort to enforce strict compliance across the financial industry. Over the past few years, banks alone have paid billions in fines for similar violations, and this latest wave of penalties shows the SEC isn’t letting up anytime soon. Sanjay Wadhwa echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of compliance for maintaining market integrity. “It is essential to the Commission’s broader efforts to protect investors and promote the integrity and fairness of our markets that broker-dealers satisfy their legal obligations,” Wadhwa said. But despite the fine, Robinhood’s finances are in decent shape. The company is set to post its fifth consecutive quarter of profitability. In the third quarter of this year, it reported a net income of $150 million, proving that the penalty likely won’t hurt its bottom line too much. Still, the regulatory scrutiny doesn’t look good for a company that’s already had its fair share of public controversies. Robinhood became a household name during the 2021 GameStop trading frenzy, where it faced backlash for restricting trades during the stock’s meteoric rise. Since then, the company has been trying to rehabilitate its image, but this latest fine is another reminder that it still has a long way to go.

Bitcoin (BTC) may be king, but altcoins are gaining traction for outsized returns. From the established Ethereum (ETH) to the fast-growing BigBossInu, these assets are positioned for remarkable gains. These top picks are expected to soar before the market fully rallies: BigBossInu’s Presale Soars: A Lucrative Opportunity for Investors BigBossInu is taking the crypto space by storm, with its presale generating massive interest from early adopters. Seen as a high-reward venture, those who get in early can seize this lucrative opportunity. With a surge in investor enthusiasm, BigBossInu is a top cryptocurrency to monitor. Backed by bold features and a future-focused roadmap, BigBossInu is primed for explosive growth. >>>>>> Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $93,480. Analysts suggest that BTC is showing signs of stability after dropping from the $105,000 support level. The market is anticipating a potential breakout in the coming yesr, with some analysts predicting a move toward 110,000 if momentum continues to build. Ethereum (ETH) has recently been recovering from previous lows, now trading around $3,385. A bullish setup suggests that if ETH can push past key resistance at $3,500, it could move higher above $4,000. However, if selling pressure builds, a drop below $3,000 could occur before any further upward moves. Sei (SEI) has been one of the top performers among altcoins, surging by over 43% in the last 30 days. Despite the recent rally, SEI might experience a short-term pullback due to overbought conditions, with analysts warning that the price could dip to $0.31 before possibly resuming its upward trajectory. >>> Polkadot (DOT) is seeing renewed activity as well, with recent developments driving interest. DOT holders recently received a token airdrop, which has contributed to increased network engagement. Currently trading above $6, analysts are watching for a potential recovery if broader market conditions improve. Conclusion As the crypto market gears up for a rally, altcoins like BigBossInu, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Sei, and Polkadot offer strong potential for significant returns. BigBossInu’s presale, Ethereum’s recovery, and Polkadot’s network activity highlight these assets for growth. Investors aiming to capitalize on market momentum could see gains before 2024, but thorough research and risk assessment are essential in this volatile space.

The rise of meme coins proves that investors can embrace humor while cashing in on serious returns. With innovations like play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, blockchain memes, and even AI-crafted tokens, the meme coin revolution is in full swing. These aren’t your run-of-the-mill assets; they’re a cultural phenomenon turning crypto investing into a joyful experience. One of the brightest stars of this movement is BTFD Coin, currently smashing records with over $5.1 million raised in its presale and 64 billion coins sold. Beyond the staggering numbers, this meme coin introduces a four-level P2E game that blends entertainment and earning potential seamlessly. Joining BTFD Coin at the forefront of innovation are Book of Meme (BOME), decentralizing meme culture, and Turbo Token, an AI-designed experiment that’s captivating the crypto community. Together, they represent the top new meme coins to join this year, offering unique opportunities to laugh, play, and profit. BTFD Coin: Where Bulls Play and Earn BTFD Coin isn’t just a token; it’s an experience. Its P2E game takes players through four levels of excitement, each brimming with opportunities to earn in-game rewards that are convertible to BTFD tokens. Picture this: you’re navigating a fun, challenge-filled environment while building your token stash—all without leaving the game. Whether you’re a seasoned gamer or someone who dabbles for fun, the BTFD ecosystem ensures there’s something for everyone. But let’s crunch some numbers, shall we? Imagine investing $4,000 at today’s presale price of $0.000142. You’d snag over 28 million BTFD tokens. If the price jumps to $0.0006 (a realistic prediction based on its roadmap and community growth), your investment could soar to an impressive $16,800. Now, that’s a game where everyone wins! The fun doesn’t stop there. Aside from gaming, BTFD Coin boasts staking rewards with a jaw-dropping 90% APY , a roadmap packed with community-driven milestones, and the dynamic Bulls Squad characters that make investing more personal and engaging. With so much happening, there’s no better time to join the herd. Book of Meme (BOME): Decentralized Memes for the Digital Age What if memes could live forever? Book of Meme (BOME) answers that question with its bold mission to preserve meme culture on the blockchain. Powered by Solana, Arweave, and IPFS, this project immortalizes viral moments in a digital compendium while also embracing degen trading and gambling. In short, it’s a cultural time capsule with a wild twist. Currently priced at $0.005417, BOME has a live market cap of over $373 million, making it a significant player in the meme coin universe. While the price dipped nearly 5% in the last 24 hours, seasoned investors know that fluctuations are often opportunities in disguise. Turbo Token: The AI-Driven Meme Coin Revolution Meet Turbo Token, the world’s first meme coin designed by AI.

Most major crypto tokens were trading down significantly Monday after an exuberant rally around the time of the new Congress convening in Washington. By Monday afternoon in Chicago, Bitcoin had fallen some 10% for the week’s trading. Meanwhile, Ethereum had fallen by 18% from its average crypto exchange market price seven days earlier. BNB was also trading down some 8.5%, and Solana had fallen by 20% under its intraday high price of $2.21 on Jan. 6 as delegates to the new Congress took their seats for the current session. However, the entire crypto market bounced off on Monday morning. Just wanted to express appreciation for President @realDonaldTrump and so many people, both inside & outside of government, supporting @DOGE . I am confident that the American people will be happy with the outcome. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 13, 2025 What probably didn’t hurt Dogecoin’s price on Monday was another implicit shout-out from Elon Musk. After naming his advisory office to the new president, the DOGE for Department of Government Efficiency, Musk can rally for cheaper government and Dogecoin in one post. Now that’s efficient. 1. DOGE Sentiment Data Marks Dip Over? According to an analysis by blockchain insights firm Santiment, Dogecoin’s sentiment reading Monday favors the world’s first popular meme coin, which has its own blockchain—a fork from Bitcoin on Dec. 6, 2013. “Since its top exactly one month ago, Dogecoin has shed -28% of its market cap,” wrote Santiment last week in a Thursday note to the blockchain market analytics engine’s users. “Crowd sentiment has been near its lowest point over the past year,” Santiment added. “(This) means there is actually some nice upside to be a daring contrarian toward DOGE (in particular) if crypto markets begin to trend upward again.” Earlier in the month, TradingLounge’s Peter Mathers spotted an Elliot Wave formation that could see Dogecoin rally to above $0.48— and potentially as far as $0.61, Mathers wrote on Jan. 6. 2. Bullish Exchange Signals Data from derivatives markets is also hinting at another rally for Dogecoin soon. To start the month, over 81% of all open interest in Dogecoin futures on Binance was long for DOGE. 3. Crypto Whale Sized Bites Whales bought over 470 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/d7oPvnfB6o — Ali (@ali_charts) January 10, 2025 Crypto whale activity in the DOGE pool in January is another sign that Dogecoin is about to make another big splash in crypto markets. In a 48-hour period on Jan 9 and 10, blockchain whales bought 470 million Dogecoin in 48 hours, according to a recent update from sharp whale watcher Ali Martinez. It’s not the first time whales made big moves in Dogecoin this January. Earlier in the month, they bought a billion DOGE tokens in under 24 hours. That follows up on whales buying the Dogecoin dip in late December as well, so support from large sum traders is strong with this one.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is over 60, indicating strong buying interest. The high stochastic value suggests that momentum is on the rise. If the price moves past the resistance level at $0.4553, it could continue its upward trend. Over the past six months, Dogecoin has increased by nearly 200%, hinting at significant growth potential. With the anticipated altcoin season and a bullish crypto market, there's optimism that DOGE may reach higher levels. However, keeping an eye on the support level at $0.2695 is important in case of any market fluctuations.

SOL is central to the ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. Solana avoids sharding and second-layer solutions, aiming for high capacity without added complexity. This makes SOL attractive to developers and investors, especially those interested in hosting high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, SOL's focus on scalability and speed may enhance its appeal as a promising cryptocurrency. Conclusion Despite limited short-term potential for SOL and others, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success.

King Pepe on Solana (PEPESOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, King Pepe on Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and King Pepe on Solana could become the next viral memecoin. King Pepe on Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy King Pepe on Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for King Pepe on Solana by entering its contract address – xArnFwydB12BkKVXKy436TwCrSSfFcC7kXx7p2fGEWh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-14 07:37:00

As a result, SOL and XRP tokens have picked up upside momentum, showing signs of an upcoming rally. Moreover, the development comes amid speculation that Donald Trump’s administration will greenlight new crypto ETFs already submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). JPMorgan’s Report on SOL ETF and XRP ETF JPMorgan has forecasted that Solana ETF and XRP ETF could collectively bring an inflow of approximately $15 billion within a year. This is based on the portion of market cap that Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have put on paper. Notably, Bitcoin ETFs were approximately $108 billion in assets in the first year, representing around 6% of its total market cap. Similarly, Ether ETFs reached around $12 billion in assets, reflecting a portion of 3% after six months of launch. JPMorgan has applied the same adoption rate to Solana ETFs and XRP ETFs to reach the final number of $3 billion to $8 billion for each. Matthew Sigel on X has reiterated the same sentiment with a few community members. He came forward to share his opinion by calling ETFs a game changer for SOL and XRP liquidity. Interestingly, JPMorgan has forecasted a brighter future for SOL and XRP ETFs days after its CEO Jamie Dimon expressed skepticism on Bitcoin despite massive demand from its clients. Performance of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Spot Ether ETFs have performed well since their respective launches, which forms a timeline of 12 months for BTC and around 6 months for Ether. Historical cumulative inflows for Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Spot Ether ETFs stand at $35.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, according to data by Farside Investors. BlackRock leads the inflows chart for both BTC and ETH. The ETF issuer has recorded an inward flow of $37.6 billion in Spot Bitcoin ETF and $3.6 billion in Spot Ether ETF. Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Spot Ether ETFs, on January 13, recorded an outflow of $284.1 million and $39.4 million, applicable in the same order. That was the third consecutive day that both major US crypto ETFs registered outflows. Nevertheless, the confidence in crypto ETFs is evident with the Trump Administration likely to get into action from the first day. SOL and XRP Price Performance Solana and Ripple tokens are showing upticks now that JPMorgan has forecasted a bullish future for their respective ETFs. SOL price is up by 2% in the last 24 hours, exchanging hands at around $185.81. There is a massive surge of 156.75% in its 24-hour trading volume with a reasonable decline of 4.65% in its open interest, as per Coinglass. XRP price is up by more than 2% during the same time window, trading at an approximate value of $2.53. Its 24-hour trading volume has increased by 71.65% and open interest is up by 0.30%.

Public construction firm Ming Shing Group has joined the list of non-tech companies diversifying into cryptocurrency, investing $47 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ) to enhance liquidity and boost asset value. In a Jan. 13 press release , the Hong Kong -based company, mainly engaged in wet trades works like plastering and tile laying, announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lead Benefit, purchased 500 Bitcoins at an average price of $94,375 per BTC. Ming Shing said the funds came from idle reserves and viewed the Bitcoin purchase as a “short-term investment to capture the potential appreciation of Bitcoin and increase its assets.” “The company considers that Bitcoin market is highly liquid and the Bitcoins can be easily disposed to fund the company’s wet trade works business, if required.” Ming Shing You might also like: China’s central bank spotlights Hong Kong’s crypto licensing system in new report Lead Benefit was incorporated in December 2024, with Ming Shing as its ultimate shareholder.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong is also exploring ways to embrace cryptocurrency. Legislator Wu Jiexhuang recently suggested that the region consider adding Bitcoin to its national reserves to strengthen financial security. As crypto.news reported earlier , Wu proposed that regulators first study the effects of U.S.-issued Bitcoin exchange-traded funds on the market before making any decisions about including BTC in reserves.

Cardano's ADA: The Eco-Friendly Crypto Shaping the Future Cardano, with its native coin ADA, is making waves in the crypto world. Built for flexibility and sustainability, it lets developers create decentralized apps and games using smart contracts. What sets it apart is its eco-friendly approach; it uses the energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism instead of the energy-hungry proof-of-work model. This means users can store value, make payments, and stake ADA without leaving a hefty carbon footprint. Cardano splits its blockchain into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This innovative design could enable up to a million transactions per second, making it incredibly fast and efficient. Since introducing native tokens in March 2021, Cardano offers secure, low-fee smart contract interactions, setting new standards in blockchain efficiency.

According to a Wired Italia report , this marks the first time in Italy, a credit institution concluded a direct crypto transaction. Some employees of the largest Italian bank first flagged the crypto purchase and sale on the imageboard website 4Chan . “As of today (Monday), Intesa Sanpaolo owns 11 Bitcoins. Thank you all for the teamwork”, said Niccolò Bardoscia, head of digital assets trading & investments at Intesa Sanpaolo in a mail. However, Bardoscia did not reveal further information on Intesa Sanpaolo’s motivations for choosing BTC or its future crypto strategies. It is unclear whether the move signals the bank’s intent to expand its crypto services. Last November, Intesa Sanpaolo expanded the remit of its digital assets desk to cover spot trading for crypto. The biggest lender in Italy had previously only traded crypto options, futures, and exchange-traded funds. However, the spot trading isn’t yet up and running. Milan-based Intesa Sanpaolo has worked with Ripple Custody (formerly Metaco), to facilitate tokenised asset custody. Intesa’s move mirrors a growing trend among traditional financial institutions exploring cryptos. Italy’s Crypto Tax Revisions The bank’s Bitcoin investment came when the country overhauled its crypto taxation laws , particularly focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) capital gains. In December 2024, Italy’s Senate finalised the tax rates for crypto capital gains, confirming a 26% tax for 2025. Further, the parliament approved a government proposal to increase the withholding tax on Bitcoin profits to 33% in 2026. In July 2024, Intesa became the sole institutional investor in Italian development bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti’s digital bond issuance . The move marked a significant step in digital asset adoption in Italy. Besides, the implementation of the European MiCA Regulation marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for crypto service providers across the EU. The European Union set a Dec. 30 deadline for its member states to implement MiCA, although not all countries have managed to. In Italy, the MiCA Decree , the Legislative Decree of September 5, 2024, assigns critical responsibilities to the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (Consob) and the Bank of Italy. It designs them as the primary national authorities for overseeing compliance with MiCA’s provisions.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit called the SEC’s move “arbitrary and capricious,” signaling that the regulator might have bitten off more than it can chew with its aggressive stance against the crypto industry. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, shared the news, saying, “We just won our petition for a writ of mandamus at the Third Circuit.” We just won our petition for a writ of mandamus at the Third Circuit. Rebuking @SECGov for its order denying our rulemaking petition, the Court held that the ""SEC’s order was conclusory and insufficiently reasoned, and thus arbitrary and capricious, we grant Coinbase’s petition… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) January 13, 2025 He highlighted the court’s rebuke of the SEC’s “insufficiently reasoned” denial of Coinbase’s petition, adding that Judge Stephanos Bibas had flagged looming constitutional concerns over the SEC’s enforcement tactics. According to Paul, the decision sends a strong message: regulators can’t simply enforce laws without providing clear rules upfront. Judges call out the SEC The court’s ruling stopped short of forcing the SEC to draft specific rules for cryptocurrency but made it clear that the agency owes an explanation. Coinbase’s original petition sought clarity on a crucial question: when do digital assets qualify as securities? Without clear guidance, crypto companies have been left in a legal gray zone, navigating unpredictable enforcement actions rather than established rules. Judge Bibas, known for his blunt rulings, criticized the agency’s reliance on enforcement without prior guidance, pointing out that new technologies like crypto come with unique risks that require proactive regulation—not just retroactive penalties. This isn’t the first time the SEC has been called out for its handling of the crypto industry, but the Coinbase case could mark a turning point. By forcing the SEC to explain its reasoning, the court has essentially demanded more transparency from the agency, which has long maintained that most cryptocurrencies, apart from Bitcoin, are securities and therefore fall under its jurisdiction. Coinbase fights on multiple fronts While Coinbase celebrates this partial victory, the company is still deep in the trenches of another legal battle with the SEC. Last year, Judge Katherine Failla denied Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against it, setting the stage for a high-stakes court fight over whether crypto tokens listed on Coinbase’s platform qualify as securities. Failla’s ruling leaned heavily on the Howey Test, a decades-old legal standard used to determine whether an asset is a security. She rejected Coinbase’s argument that crypto should be considered a “major question” of economic significance, which would limit the SEC’s authority. Instead, she sided with the agency’s claim that many of the cryptocurrencies offered on Coinbase’s platform, such as Solana, are investment contracts. However, Failla’s ruling wasn’t the end of the road. She granted Coinbase permission to file an interlocutory appeal, allowing the company to challenge her decision before a final verdict. This appeal is important because it could fast-track a definitive ruling on whether crypto tokens are securities, potentially reshaping how the entire industry operates. “We appreciate the Court’s careful consideration,” Paul said after the decision. “On to the Second Circuit we go.” The appeal could add to the complexity. While some judges, like Failla, appear to back the SEC’s arguments, others have pushed back. For instance, the judge overseeing the Ripple case ruled that not all transactions involving XRP qualify as securities. The SEC’s enforcement-first strategy has been a source of frustration for the crypto industry, which has repeatedly called for clear guidelines. Under Chair Gary Gensler, the agency has ramped up its crackdown on crypto companies, bringing high-profile lawsuits against Ripple, Coinbase, and other major players. Gensler has argued that most crypto tokens are securities and that companies are violating the law by failing to register them with the SEC.

According to Gryphon Digital’s press release , the Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining firm plans to use the recently acquired asset to further expand on its AI and high-performance computing data center infrastructure. Gryphon’s deal with Captus is expected to close before or some time in April 2025. Based on the agreement, Gryphon Digital will pay Captus $27 million CAD or equal to $18.7 million, which already includes $3 million CAD ($2 million) worth of four-year-long restricted shares given to the incoming Captus management team. If the deal does not close, then the Captus team will have to return the restricted shares. The 850 acre industrial site has the potential to scale up to 4 gigawatts in capacity and grants Gryphon access to dual natural gas supply, grid connection, water resources, as well as rapid fiber connection providers. Analysts conclude Gryphon could stand to gain $1.5 million in annual revenue per megawatt, though VanEck’s research believes Bitcoin mining revenue related to AI and HPC could reach up to $9.11 million per MW. At full capacity, the asset has the potential to generate over $5 billion of annual revenue for Gryphon. You might also like: Bitcoin miners tap billions in funding to counter energy challenges Chief Executive Officer of Gryphon Digital, Steve Gutterman, stated that the acquisition of Captus Energy’s asset marks a transformative moment for Gryphon as it hopes to expand its reach into the AI and HPC infrastructure market. “The combination of dual natural gas supply, on-site carbon sequestration and abundant water access makes it one of the few locations in North America with all the critical elements needed for large-scale AI computing,” said Gutterman. He added part of the Captus Energy team, led by Chief Executive Officer of Captus Generation Harry Andersen, will be joining the Gryphon under the signed agreement. “We believe that the Captus acquisition, when combined with our recent British Columbia acquisition and the additions to our team, fundamentally transform Gryphon’s trajectory and potential scale,” he said. In December, Gryphon also acquired a natural gas site in British Columbia with an initial 100 MW generation capacity and scalability of up to 1 GW. The projected power cost related to the site could sit below $0.03 per kWh.

An SEC order made public on Jan. 13 claims that Robinhood Securities LLC and Robinhood Financial LLC committed over 10 violations of securities law provisions ranging from failures in reporting suspicious activity to safeguarding customer information, among others, “between at least 2018 and April 2024.” According to the commission, “both firms admitted certain findings in the order and agreed to be censured,” with Robinhood Securities consenting to pay a $33.5 million penalty and Robinhood Financial agreeing to pay a $11.5 million penalty, bringing the total settlement to $45 million. Robinhood’s violations From January 2020 through March 2022, the company failed to promptly investigate and report suspicious activity, undermining its obligations under anti-money laundering laws. Additionally, between April 2019 and July 2022, Robinhood failed to implement adequate identity theft protection policies, exposing customers to heightened risks of fraud, the order stated. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities also plagued the platform. Notably, between June and November 2021, Robinhood failed to address known risks related to remote system access, resulting in a third party gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data from millions of users. Robinhood also failed to maintain and preserve off-channel communications and some customer communications between 2020 and 2021, violating federal securities laws. Additionally, from May 2019 through December 2023, Robinhood failed to comply with Regulation SHO, which governs short-selling practices, in its fractional share trading and stock lending programs. You might also like: Robinhood’s Dan Gallagher declines potential SEC leadership role The SEC order further noted that both entities violated multiple rules under federal securities laws, including provisions designed to protect customer privacy and ensure accurate record-keeping and reporting. Further, Robinhood Securities also admitted to errors in over 11,800 Electronic Blue Sheets submitted to the SEC over a five-year period, which led to inaccurate reporting of at least 392 million transactions. EBS are formal data requests used by regulators to monitor trading activity and investigate potential market abuses. Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, stressed the importance of broker-dealers meeting their legal obligations to uphold market integrity and fairness in a statement , noting that such compliance is “essential to the Commission’s broader efforts to protect investors and promote the integrity and fairness,” of the financial markets. Robinhood’s crypto businesses were not mentioned in the order or included in the scope of these violations; however, that doesn’t mean the company is out of the water. Last year, the brokerage firm received a Wells notice from the SEC. According to a regulatory filing submitted at the time, the SEC’s staff recommended pursuing enforcement action over Robinhood’s cryptocurrency listings, custody practices, and platform operations. The commission currently has ongoing civil enforcement cases against several high-profile crypto firms, including Binance , Coinbase , and Ripple Labs .

Bitcoin Unveiled: The Future of Money Without Banks Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. It was created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto to be a new kind of money. Unlike traditional money, Bitcoin doesn't need banks or governments to work. Instead, it operates on a technology called blockchain, which is like a shared record kept by many computers around the world. People can send Bitcoins directly to each other, and these transactions are verified by miners. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex puzzles, and as a reward, they earn new Bitcoins. Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins, making it scarce. Every four years, there's an event called ""halving,"" where the reward miners get is cut in half. This reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are made and can impact how profitable mining is. In today's market, Bitcoin still holds a strong position compared to other cryptocurrencies. Its technology is proven, and it's seen by many as ""digital gold."" While new coins come and go, Bitcoin's potential to change how we think about money remains strong. For those looking at the current market, Bitcoin could still be an attractive choice due to its established network and the trust it has built over the years. Conclusion While Bitcoin eyes $200K in the 2025 bull run, XYZVerse's unique sports memecoin aims for 1,000x growth, making it a standout opportunity.

In June of 2023, incensed by the chicanery of crypto exchange FTX, the SEC sued Binance and Binance.US, as well as their owner Changpeng Zhao for charges that included violations of securities laws. Later, Binance agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities, and Zhao served some jail time. Binance.US, which is a separate legal entity from Binance Global, was not involved in that settlement at all. The firm remains locked in litigation stalemate with the SEC today, having been forced to endure the last 18 months denuded by the assault on its business, operating as a crypto-to-crypto only exchange. “We’ll never get recompense for the damage the SEC did to us,” said Binance.US's interim CEO Norman Reed. “Within two weeks of that lawsuit, we’d lost thousands of customers, billions of dollars went out the door and we were later forced to lay off 70% of our staff. Institutions and banks ran away from us because the SEC said we were another fraudulent firm like FTX. It's ironic that a U.S. financial regulator would essentially create a bank run at a company, which is what they did.” Thankfully there’s light at the end of the tunnel for Binance.US. Reed said he expects to have USD fiat services revitalized and working in the next few weeks; the firm is poised for a dramatic comeback, courting partnerships with banks and in dialogue with state regulators once more. Binance.US doesn’t want or need to play the victim, Reed added, having stoically carried on amid restraining orders, reporting obligations and the loss of banking partners. But in light of a new U.S. administration and the end of Gensler’s ultra-vindictive leadership at the SEC, Reed – himself a former regulatory officer at the SEC – wants to speak out about what he sees as an injustice. “The DOJ looked at us, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District looked at us. The CFTC looked at us. OFAC and FinCEN looked at us – and when I say they ‘looked,’ I mean they did a thorough examination of us – but they all left us alone. We were outside of what happened to Binance Global and CZ. The only entity that went after us was the SEC,” Reed said. The debanking of crypto businesses (and executives in some cases), known colloquially as “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 ,” has also become a talking point of late, with the likes of a16z boss Marc Andreessen and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse discussing it in public. The debanking of Binance.US is Chokepoint in action, Reed said. It involved the SEC hitting up the exchange’s partners and fear mongering with subpoenas. Once the lawsuit was brought, the reputational risk was too high and payment processors backed away thanks to their correspondent banks being spooked, he said. “In the intervening period we approached hundreds of banks and financial institutions,” Reed said. “None of them would bank us. Because we were a cauldron of fraud, according to the SEC.” Shortly after Binance.US was sued, the SEC attempted to put the firm out of business with a temporary restraining order that would have frozen all its assets, Reed said. The regulator claimed Binance.US was defrauding clients, abusing client accounts and sending money overseas. “But in court the SEC lawyers were forced to say they had found no evidence of this,” Reed said. “Of course that didn't stop them continuing to issue press releases about us. They are supposed to be the good guys, the regulators, wearing the white hats.” The one thing Binance.US does have in common with Binance.com is that Zhao (widely known as “CZ”) remains the beneficial owner of both firms. Reed said it’s been months since he spoke to Zhao, recalling the time the then-Binance CEO asked him to take over the lead at Binance.US. “At the time, I felt like I'd been nominated captain of the Titanic after it hit the iceberg, to go down with the ship,” Reed said. “But we didn’t give up, and we’re a stronger company today than we’ve ever been. I've been telling my team for over a year that when we save this company and actually make it successful again, this will be some kind of case study.”",Finance,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|SPONSORED|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-14 07:48:12

However, the RSI at 62.49 suggests Bitcoin is nearing overbought levels, and a high Stochastic of 94.50 may indicate an upcoming price correction. The MACD at 220.22 shows positive momentum. Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $103,705. Surpassing this could push the price toward $111,272, offering potential gains of 8% and 16%. Support levels lie at $88,572 and $81,005, with possible declines of 5% and 13%. Based on current data, Bitcoin may see short-term volatility, but long-term growth potential remains strong. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum has seen some notable price changes recently. In the past week, its price has decreased by 4.22%. Over the last month, it has dropped by 8.91%. However, looking at the past six months, Ethereum has gained 4.00%. Currently, the price ranges between $3399.33 and $3772.29. Based on these figures, Ethereum might experience a rise soon. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 58.08, indicating neutral momentum. The Stochastic value is high at 93.25, suggesting the asset is nearing overbought territory. The MACD level is positive at 0.1529, hinting at potential upward movement. These indicators point toward a possible price increase in the short term. The nearest resistance level is $3909.76. If Ethereum breaks through this, it could climb to the second resistance at $4283, representing an increase of around 9% and 19% respectively from the current price. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3163.84, with a second support level at $2790.88. Falling to these supports would mean decreases of approximately 7% and 18%. The price is above both the 10-day SMA of $3274.13 and the 100-day SMA of $3429.36, which may support further growth. Solana (SOL) Over the past week, Solana (SOL) dropped by 7.85%. In the last month, it fell by 10.27%. However, over six months, SOL has risen by 34.96%. This shows that while there have been recent declines, the coin has grown over the longer term. SOL is currently trading between $192.85 and $226.85. The nearest support level is $172.30. This means if the price falls, it might stop there. The nearest resistance level is $240. If the price rises, it might face a hurdle there. The next resistance is at $274, which could be a significant gain if reached. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $190.34, and the 100-day average is $201.73. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 55.01, suggesting the coin is in a neutral zone. The Stochastic is high at 89.82, which might mean the coin is overbought. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.08937. Based on this data, SOL's price could either rise or fall. Key levels to watch are the support at $172.30 and the resistance at $240. XRP (XRP) XRP's price has seen minor declines recently. Over the past week, it decreased by 3.65%. In the past month, it dropped by 2.55%. Despite this, over the last six months, XRP surged by 339.28%. The current price ranges between $2.09 and $2.61. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 53.84, which is neutral. The stochastic indicator is at 80.14, suggesting the asset might be overbought. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0002449, indicating bearish momentum. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $2.30 and $2.34, pointing to price consolidation. If XRP's price rises, it may face resistance at $2.81. Moving above this could push it towards the next resistance level at $3.32, which would be an increase of about 27% from the current upper price range. On the downside, if the price falls, it may find support at $1.79. Dropping to the second support level at $1.28 would represent a decline of about 39% from the current price. The market's next moves will depend on whether it breaks through resistance or support levels.

Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, says that Bitcoin could soon be one of the best-performing assets in 2025. But there’s a catch it needs to drop further before it can truly soar. As bitcoin already seeing a price drop from its ATH to currently at $94K. So, let’s see what Tom Lee Bitcoin’s prediction says. Tom Lee’s Prediction for Bitcoin In a recent interview with CNBC , Lee explained that a 15% drop in Bitcoin’s price from its peak is not unusual for such a volatile asset. He explains that this type of correction is common and follows global liquidity trends. Lee also mentioned that we are still in the early stages of Bitcoin’s halving cycle, a factor that historically influences Bitcoin’s price. However, Fundstrat’s technical team predicts Bitcoin could dip another $20,000 before it begins to bounce back. Even Lee suggests that Bitcoin might drop to around $70,000 before it starts to recover. He believes this is a key level where Bitcoin could stabilize after a price drop. Bitcoin as a Long-Term Investment However, he further mentions that Bitcoin could fall even lower, possibly to $50,000, before starting its upward trend again. For those considering buying Bitcoin, Lee advises taking a long-term approach . He suggests that trying to time the market might work for some, but it’s not the safest strategy. He encourages investors to view Bitcoin as a long-term investment, with strong growth potential in the years ahead. Key Dates to Watch for Bitcoin’s Lee also points out that January 15 is a crucial date to watch. That’s when the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data will be released, which could impact Bitcoin’s price. Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates later in the month will be important for the broader market, including Bitcoin. Big Gains in 2025 Despite short-term challenges, Lee remains confident that Bitcoin will perform well in the long term. Analysts from institutions like VanEck and Bitwise are also optimistic, predicting that Bitcoin could hit between $180,000 and $200,000 by the end of 2025. This would be a huge leap, especially if the U.S. establishes a Bitcoin reserve.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-14 07:57:50

Shiba Inu’s TREAT token goes live today, with major exchanges like KuCoin and Gate.io offering airdrops to incentivize user engagement within the ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from a drop below $90,000 to near $95,000, with industry leaders forecasting strong momentum for the cryptocurrency in 2025. XRP Price Explosion in the Making? Ripple’s XRP passed through enhanced turbulence in the past few days. Over the weekend, its price pumped to almost $2.60 but the start of the business week offered pain for the bulls. On January 13, XRP followed the broader decline of the cryptocurrency market and dipped below $2.40. The last 24 hours, though, witnessed a substantial resurgence and the asset is currently worth $2.53 (per CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko According to many industry participants, XRP has much more room for growth in the near future due to some key upcoming factors. Some of those include Donald Trump’s inauguration as America’s 47th President and the resignation of the SEC’s Chairman Gary Gensler. The Republican has shown a pro-crypto stance during his presidential campaign, while the agency’s leader is considered a huge enemy of the digital asset sector. “XRP is gonna make a big move on January 20 because of Trump taking office and Gary Gensler resigning,” one popular X user predicted . Other market observers envisioning an incoming price pump include CRYPTOWZRD and WSB Trader Rocko. The former claimed XRP “has flipped previous resistance to support” of around $2 and is now ready to jump to a new all-time high of $4 and then $8. They said such a scenario would mimic the pre-bull run in 2017 and the subsequent rally the following year. For their part, WSB Trader Rocko referred to XRP’s price chart as “the most bullish in crypto.” According to them, Ripple’s recent introduction of its stablecoin (RLUSD) and the company’s potential connections with Donald Trump’s future administration could drive the token to reach new peaks. TREAT on the Way Shiba Inu has recently taken the main stage due to a major development related to its ecosystem. As CryptoPotato previously reported , the meme coin TREAT ( which is designed to enhance utility and engagement across the network’s projects) is scheduled to go live today (January 14). The leading cryptocurrency exchanges that have already embraced the token include KuCoin, Gate.io, Bitget, MEXC Exchange, and others. Some of those have even announced special airdrops to users. Gate.io has promised to distribute 1,000,000 TREAT, KuCoin will airdrop 3,000,000 coins, while Bitget users will split 87,450,000 tokens. Those willing to apply for the offer should create an account at the aforementioned platforms . Then, they must visit Shiba Inu’s official website, provide a user ID, and deposit the designated address. Once those details are submitted, the accounts will be whitelisted and “ready to receive TREAT tokens.” BTC Price Outlook Last but not least, we will focus on the primary cryptocurrency, whose price swings have been more than evident lately. BTC started the week trading at approximately $95,000. Shortly after, though, the bears suppressed the valuation below $90,000, the lowest point observed in two months. However, the bulls have recovered much of the lost ground in the past several hours, with BTC currently trading just south of $95K. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The price resurgence coincides with some optimistic forecasts coming from industry participants. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley , for one, said 2025 could be the year for Bitcoin and crypto, which has “so many tailwinds and so few headwinds.” Those willing to explore additional price predictions and check whether now is a good time to hop on the bandwagon as investors can take a look at our dedicated video below: The post Bullish Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions, Upcoming Shiba Inu (SHIB) Developments, and More: Bits Recap Jan 14 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Ripple (XRP) Price|Shiba Inu (SHIB),EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|SHIB|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-14 07:58:06

What are the factors behind this rapid adoption? According to a recent study by BlackRock, global crypto adoption reached 300 million users in just 12 years—a pace around 43% faster than the adoption of mobile phones and about 20% faster than the internet. By comparison, mobile phones took 21 years to hit the 300-million mark, while the internet reached that milestone in 15 years. Cryptocurrency adoption has outpaced both mobile phones and the internet, achieving 300 million users in just 12 years compared to 15 years for the internet and 21 years for mobile phones. Source: BlackRock The global investment firm also stated that the adoption is buoyed by demographic trends such as “digital natives,” wherein younger generations are more open to Bitcoin ( BTC ) adoption than GenX and Baby Boomers, reads the report. Meanwhile, Empower , a U.S. based financial services company, researched 1,009 American individuals, which supports BlackRock’s views. The poll found that 34% of Gen Z respondents chose cryptocurrencies over cash- the highest rate among any age group. Moreover, according to Stilt , a platform for financial products and resources for immigrants, Buyers in the Gen Z and Millennial age groups account for nearly 94% of all crypto buyers, leaving just over 6% for those over 40. Zooming in on each cohort, Gen Z buyers outnumber Gen X by a factor of 3.5 and Baby Boomers by 14.3. Meanwhile, Millennials outnumber Gen X by 15.5 times and Boomers by 62.9 times—reflecting just how firmly crypto is dominated by younger generations.

Cryptocurrency Capital Inflows Have Seen A Notable Drop Recently As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, capital inflows for the cryptocurrency sector have slowed down over the past month. Capital enters (or exits) the digital asset market through mainly three asset classes: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the stablecoins. It’s only once that inflows have made it to these coins that they rotate out into the altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Now Capitulating: Bottom Here? Thus, the flows related to these assets could be assumed to represent the netflows for the cryptocurrency sector as a whole. As for how the flows can be calculated, the Realized Cap indicator can be used in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Realized Cap is an on-chain capitalization model that determines the total value of any given asset by assuming that the real value of any token in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the network. The last transaction of any coin is likely to be the last point at which it changed hands, so the price at that time would denote its current cost basis. Since the Realized Cap sums up this value for all tokens in the circulating supply, it essentially measures the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the asset. Bitcoin and Ethereum capital netflows can be equated with the changes taking place in this indicator. For stablecoins, there isn’t any need for this model as their price is always fixed around the $1 mark, so changes in their combined market cap serve as a sufficient method for finding capital flows. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day flows related to the three asset classes over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the total netflows related to the cryptocurrency sector have been positive during the last few months, implying that a net amount of capital has been coming into the various assets. The 30-day inflows appear to have peaked last month, however, as they have since been following a downward trajectory. In this period, the metric’s value has declined from $134 billion to $58 billion, representing a decrease of more than 56%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Plummets To Neutral: Reversal Signal? “This points to a significant reduction in investment activity,” notes Martinez. The slowdown in capital inflows could be why Bitcoin and other assets have switched to a bearish trajectory recently. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly fell under the $91,000 mark earlier in the day, but it appears the coin has since retraced back above it as its price is now trading around $91,800.

XRP Set for a Breakout as Altcoin Season Looms XRP is bouncing between $2.27 and $2.67. The current momentum shows promise.

Though the MACD slightly dips, the RSI and stochastic hint at potential upward movement. As the market anticipates a massive altcoin season, XRP might soar, rewarding investors aiming for significant returns.

Join the Feline Frenzy! $CATZILLA Is on the Rise—Claim Your Share Today! Uniswap's Next Move: Ready for a Bullish Breakout? Uniswap (UNI) is currently moving between $12.14 and $15.38. It faces resistance at $17 and support at $10.64. With a simple moving average over the last 10 days at $12.62, it's barely above the current price range. The RSI at 30.51 hints it's oversold, suggesting a possible rally. Recent changes show a 28.88% drop over the last month but a 52.12% increase over six months, indicating potential for a comeback. If UNI breaks $17, it could aim for $20, marking a nearly 30% rise from the upper range. The market conditions and bullish sentiment around altcoins could be the push UNI needs to climb higher. Solana Eyes Bullish Breakout Amidst Market Resilience Solana is currently trading between $172.62 and $213.70. The coin has dropped over a week and month, but not by more than what a single bullish run could recover. It finds support at $156.83 and resistance at $238.99, suggesting room for a potential rise. Although its RSI and MACD levels signal a cautious approach, Solana has a chance to climb. Surpassing the resistance could push the price towards $280.07, a gain of about 30% from the upper limit of its current range. A possible altcoin season might be the ideal period for such a surge. Keep an eye on market trends for further direction. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET): A Hidden Gem Poised for a Surge FET is showing resilience amid a tough market, trading between $1.15 and $1.55. Despite a recent drop, with a 1-week loss of about 25.5% and a 1-month decrease of around 33.6%, it sits above the key $1.01 support. FET faces resistance at $1.80, but its potential shines through. If a bullish trend prevails, surpassing the $1.80 mark could push it to the next target of $2.20, representing an approximate 41% increase from its current level. The RSI and stochastic indicators hovering in oversold territory suggest potential upward momentum. Watch for FET to capitalize on the upcoming altcoin season and its path to recovery and growth. Ethena (ENA) Shows Potential for Growth Amidst Current Correction Ethena (ENA) has been experiencing a dip, with current prices between $0.73 and $1.16. It sits below both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.80 and $0.89, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 41.38 and stochastic at 38.57 suggest it's approaching the oversold zone. The MACD level is slightly negative, which indicates a slowdown. However, the coin has gained over 74% in the last 6 months, showing its potential. If momentum picks up, it could test the nearest resistance at $1.43, leading to over 60% growth if it reaches the second resistance level at $1.86. Conclusion While UNI, SOL, FET, and ENA show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to all. Offering a remarkable 700% ROI during its presale—from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages—it combines governance, rewards, and staking features to unite enthusiasts against crypto villains.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 147,700 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may be repeating a pattern witnessed in 2023 and 2024. The trader shares a chart suggesting that BTC may correct to around $82,000 and touch the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level before coming back to life. The Fibonacci retracement level is a tool used by traders to identify potential entry and exit points for an asset based on the Fibonacci sequence of numbers. “Short-term BTC volatility IF the pattern were to repeat.” Source: Dave the Wave/X While Dave the Wave is short-term bearish on BTC, he highlights that a move to $82,000 may set up BTC for a 119% surge. “Would BTC at $82,000 odd be so bad if it then enabled a move to $180,000…?” Source: Dave the Wave/X Zooming out, Dave the Wave believes that Bitcoin will print a bull market top in about seven months based on his logarithmic growth curve (LGC) channel. The analyst uses his version of logarithmic growth curves (LGCs), which aim to forecast Bitcoin’s market cycle highs and lows while filtering out short-term volatility. “The suggestion of a mid-year BTC peak here: the price has previously peaked when the one-year moving average hits the midway mark of the LGC channel.” Source: Dave the Wave/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $94,502.

The platform has gained traction in the booming field of prediction markets, allowing users to speculate on the probability of real-time events. The company stands out among its offshore competitors because it operates under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, the company has seen regulatory problems recently. The CFTC recently threw out Kalshi’s plans to offer contracts on election outcomes with a decision that is currently under appeal. Kalshi appears to be taking steps to move past the minor setback with the evolution of its platform, the expansion of its offerings, and perhaps, its decision to bring Donald Trump Jr. on as a strategic advisor. The move has already given Kalshi extra visibility, and that attention might help it close the gap with Polymarket in the predictions market. Why Donald Trump Jr.? Donald Trump Jr. recently achieved Republican elite status thanks to the central role he played in returning his father to office. It is unsurprising that Kalshi wants him to bring that Midas touch, and maybe influence, to its platform. Don Jr. seems to have the ears of the president-to-be, seeing that he lobbied vigorously for his friend J.D. Vance to get a seat at the table. Don Jr. will also bring his wealth of experience in business and media to Kalshi. In addition to his new advisory role, he serves on the board of Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind the conservative social media platform Truth Social. Kalshi may have just taken a strategic step ahead of Polymarket by snagging Don Jr. when they did. As stated earlier, the company has been facing many regulatory huddles, which is a side effect of creating a product in a heavily regulated industry. However, with Don Jr.’s endorsement, doors could open for the platform within conservative circles, where skepticism of traditional media and enthusiasm for alternative platforms are gradually becoming the order of the day. In a statement, Trump Jr. expressed enthusiasm for the potential prediction markets have to disrupt traditional mainstream media and alter how people engage with information. “Prediction markets are a powerful tool for democratizing information and enabling individuals to make informed bets on real-world events,” Trump Jr. said. His role at Kalshi will involve advising on strategic partnerships, expanding the company’s user base, and navigating the platform’s growth as it competes in a heavily regulated industry. It may also be a way to safeguard the company from future regulation, especially with Don Jr., the president’s oldest son and republican superstar, heavily invested in the platform. In recent times, presidents have gotten away with showing leniency and favoritism toward family members. Case in point: Hunter Biden received a full pardon because his father just happens to be the POTUS. Kalshi is going all in on the US markets Polymarket cannot operate on US soil, and US residents are prohibited from using the platform “officially.” Still, platforms like Polymarket present stiff competition for Kalshi because they have a first-mover advantage as they are located offshore and operate outside the reach of US regulators. By aligning itself with Don Jr., Kalshi expects to leverage his influence to draw attention to its regulated, legally compliant platform that caters specifically to US residents. Kalshi has been around since 2018, but it will now renew efforts to stay relevant. It got a slice of the action in November because a US appeals court lifted a freeze on it in October, allowing the site to list contracts that allow for bets on the election. On the night of the election, over 500,000 people were using Kalshi simultaneously — both to place bets and to monitor the election results. Bettors invested $476 million into the presidential race’s outcome on Kalshi while Polymarket’s site says people spent more than $3.6 billion betting on the race even though US users weren’t legally allowed to participate. If Kalshi succeeds with US residents, it will become the go-to platform for a liquidity-rich market. “Nothing is as salient as the presidential election,” Xavier Sottile, the head of markets at Kalshi says. Kalshi is already adding contracts for the outcomes of the second Trump administration. It has options on whether Musk or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be given Cabinet positions and the removal of taxes on tips. It even has events about Trump getting impeached for a third time. The bets on these pale in comparison to the election bonanza, but Sottile says there are enough of them and enough interest for Kalshi to seize the smaller moments. The race for supremacy Polymarket’s success in predicting Trump’s win has thrown prediction markets to the forefront of event forecasting. Many believe they are very accurate, and for good reasons. People are more decisive with their money, so they pick outcomes they think will happen, not just ones they want to happen. “When they actually put their money behind what they say, they’re putting themselves out there,” says Koleman Strumpf, a professor of economics at Wake Forest University. He believes that prediction markets will last a long time and only get bigger. Similar platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket have already been popping up. In late October 2024, Robinhood started offering election betting, and there’s also PredictIt, which is a platform operated by Victoria University in New Zealand focused specifically on US politics. The race is on, and every platform will be working hard to keep its users satisfied with various updates and upgrades. Kalshi has started the year hot by signing on Don Jr. and is well on the way to becoming a US sweetheart where prediction is concerned.

Historically, Bitcoin and the DXY have shown an inverse correlation , leading many analysts to predict that a significant movement for Bitcoin might be approaching. Crypto educator Quinten Francois noted that high DXY levels have historically coincided with Bitcoin price fluctuations. He emphasized, “When DXY was this high, BTC was at $20,000. Something big is brewing.” This sentiment is echoed by HZ, a crypto researcher, who warned that the surging DXY could trigger a global credit crunch, harm liquidity, and strain markets. “If you’re overleveraged, you’re standing on a trapdoor,” he added. The financial analytics platform Barchart has also reported increased bullishness on the dollar among hedge funds, marking the highest confidence since early 2019. This aligns with the DXY’s current role as a safe haven amid global economic uncertainties. Meanwhile, market research firm Capital Hungry noted that recent DXY strength has been driven by trade tariff concerns. Upcoming economic reports, including PPI and CPI data, are expected to heavily influence market direction. If these indicators suggest cooling inflation, the DXY may retreat, creating opportunities for risk assets like Bitcoin to rebound . Capital Hungry predicted that if Bitcoin stays above $94,000, it could climb to $99,000. However, a stronger-than-expected DXY could push prices lower. A high DXY not only affects cryptocurrencies but also impacts global markets, particularly emerging economies. A strong dollar can increase economic strain, reducing liquidity and potentially causing downturns. Conversely, any easing in the DXY could support risk assets, including Bitcoin. In August, the DXY dipped to its lowest point of 2024, which coincided with a brief Bitcoin rally, further reinforcing their inverse relationship. Institutional developments are adding to the optimism surrounding Bitcoin. BlackRock’s newly launched BTC ETF is viewed as a milestone, signaling growing confidence in Bitcoin from major financial institutions. Many believe this endorsement strengthens Bitcoin’s legitimacy and potential for widespread adoption. Despite these positive signs, Bitcoin remains at a crossroads. The DXY’s direction will likely play a key role in determining the cryptocurrency’s next major move. While a stronger dollar exerts downward pressure, any reversal in the DXY could pave the way for Bitcoin’s resurgence. Investors are closely watching whether Bitcoin can overcome the challenges posed by the DXY’s ascent.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-14 08:11:15

With its current RSI at 36.00, it signals that SHIB is oversold. This could mean an opportunity for a price rise. If bullish momentum picks up, SHIB might test the second resistance level at $0.0000308833, which means over 20% potential gain from the current range. Though short-term changes show drops, the last 6 months saw a rise of over 5%. If momentum continues, altcoin season could bring a significant boost. Keep an eye on breaking through resistance for more gains. Title: Pepe Coin Poised for Growth Despite Recent Dips Pepe (PEPE) has been bouncing within a tight range, from $0.00001579 to $0.00002055. It recently fell by over 21% in a week, and more than 34% this past month. Yet, with a relative strength index around 33, it's close to being oversold, meaning it might bounce back. The nearest resistance sits at $0.00002335. If it breaks through, the next target is $0.00002812. Though the coin has declined in the short term, its 6-month gain still shows a 32% rise. This suggests potential for bullish moves if it rebounds off the support level of $0.00001382. Pepe's long-term trends hint at possible growth ahead. CHILLGUY Set for a Rebound: Is Now the Perfect Buy Opportunity? Just a chill guy (CHILLGUY) is at an intriguing price point, currently between $0.0891 and $0.1865. The RSI is low and the stochastic is also on the lower side, both indicating potential for a rebound. The nearest resistance is at $0.2504. If CHILLGUY breaks through, it could climb further to the next resistance at $0.3478. With the current price movement and indicators, CHILLGUY seems poised for growth. It has potential for gains exceeding 30-60% if market conditions favor an uptrend. The MACD is slightly negative but shows signs of reversal. CHILLGUY is in a prime spot, suggesting a possible rally ahead. Pudgy Penguins Set for Potential Breakout Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) currently hovers between $0.0576 and $0.1113. It's testing resistance at $0.1467, with support at $0.0393. The 10-day moving average of $0.0684 is below the 100-day average of $0.0815, hinting at consolidation. The MACD is slightly negative at -0.0035, suggesting mild bearish pressure. If it breaks past $0.1467, a surge to around $0.2004 is possible, which would be a substantial percentage increase. However, if it dips below support, expect a retraction. With the general crypto sentiment leaning bullish, keep an eye out for a potential push upward. Conclusion While SHIB, PEPE, CHILLGUY, and PENGU may have limited short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero offering a 700% ROI in its presale. With triple utility and a mission to bring financial freedom, Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains by acquiring $CATZILLA tokens.

Developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs, a collaboration between Sony Group and Web3 infrastructure provider Startale, Soneium aims to revolutionize entertainment, gaming, and finance with blockchain technology. After a successful testnet phase, Soneium now boasts 15 million active wallets and over 47 million transactions. “With Soneium Mainnet, we take the next step in creating an open internet that connects cultures and brings people onchain,” Sony announced. The platform’s mainnet launch follows the earlier deployment of the testnet “Soneium Minato,” which allowed developers and users to explore the network’s capabilities. Blockscout data reveals that Soneium’s blockchain already has 6.8 million blocks, with an average block time of just 2 seconds. The platform supports a vast ecosystem, including 7.3 million contracts and a range of applications developed during its testnet phase. Over 32 projects from the “Soneium Spark” incubation program, selected from more than 1,700 submissions, are now live, alongside additional independent apps spanning NFTs, gaming, and finance. Sony’s vision for Soneium is ambitious yet clear: to create a blockchain-powered internet where creativity thrives, and users are empowered to adopt Web3 technology. “Our mission is to make Web3 more accessible while fostering innovation and collaboration,” said Sota Watanabe, Director of Sony Block Solutions Labs. To support these goals, Soneium has introduced several infrastructure services to enhance user experience. The Fan Marketing Platform, developed by SNFT Inc., provides a one-stop solution for companies launching NFT projects , covering everything from execution to data analysis. Additionally, Soneium’s S.BLOX crypto exchange services offer new opportunities for creators and brands to explore blockchain technology. Sony’s move into Web3 follows its acquisition of the Japanese crypto exchange WhaleFin in 2023, which it later renamed S.BLOX. This acquisition laid the groundwork for Sony’s broader Web3 strategy, enabling it to provide robust crypto services and tools. In a significant partnership, Soneium has teamed up with Chainlink to implement its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This collaboration enhances Soneium’s ability to connect with other blockchains, making it easier for developers to create cross-chain solutions and ensuring seamless integration across the ecosystem. The launch of the Soneium mainnet represents a seamless transition for projects developed on the testnet, thanks to consistent network specifications. This approach ensures that apps created during the test phase can easily migrate to the production environment, reducing friction for developers and users. Sony first announced Soneium’s development in August 2024, emphasizing its potential to shape the future of entertainment, gaming, and finance through blockchain. With the mainnet now live, Soneium is positioned to become a cornerstone of Web3 innovation, fostering creativity and providing practical applications for a wide range of industries. By prioritizing accessibility and user experience, Sony is setting the stage for a new era in blockchain adoption , proving its commitment to leading in Web3 technologies.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|LINK|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-14 08:14:37

The stablecoin (USDH) was created to “avoid the common freezing and transfer restrictions of traditional digital currencies.” The Huione website adds that “USDH is not restricted by traditional regulatory agencies.” Prior to the launch of USDH, users on Huione were almost exclusively using tether (USDT). Tether froze one of Huione Pay’s accounts in July 2024 after a wallet received funds linked to a theft attributed to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. The company also released its own chat service to make it less reliant on third-party apps like Telegram. The report claims that Huione has facilitated $24 billion worth of transactions including a large portion of the funds used in infamous pig butchering scams. It is a Chinese-language market and has links to Huione Group, a Cambodian conglomerate.

The altcoin reached a high of $1.32 in the fourth quarter of 2024 but has been steadily declining. In the last 24 hours, ADA has lagged behind its rivals, rising just 0.65%. According to the data from CoinMarketCap, ADA is currently trading at $0.9507, down 69.18% from its all-time high of $3.10 reached over three years ago.

38944986,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=643037,1736845211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38944986.jpeg,US regulators to investigate Crypto.com over football futures trading,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/regulators-crypto-football-futures-trading/,"Crypto.com is in hot water with federal regulators over its new football futures trading contracts. These contracts let users bet on the outcomes of major games, including the Super Bowl, and they’ve triggered a full-blown inquiry by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The five-member agency is reportedly voting on whether to launch a 90-day review, a move that could lead to a ban if the contracts are found to break gaming laws. The contracts, launched on Crypto.com’s Chicago-based derivatives exchange just days before Christmas, let users over 18 place bets on football outcomes without directly naming NFL teams or games. A regulatory review is now underway, but the CFTC doesn’t have the authority to immediately pull the plug on trading. This means the contracts will likely remain available even after the Super Bowl on February 9, unless the commission’s decision leads to a ban. CFTC weighs legality of football bets Crypto.com submitted its filings for the football contracts on December 19. Legally, the CFTC gets one business day to review such filings before trading can start, but with the holidays and a looming government shutdown, regulators didn’t have time to act. Now with scrutiny mounting, questions are being raised about whether the contracts align with U.S. gaming laws. “This isn’t a decision the current leadership of the CFTC should be making,” a Crypto.com spokesperson said, expressing frustration that the issue is being addressed so close to a leadership transition at the agency. Crypto.com isn’t the only firm facing such challenges. Back in 2021, ErisX introduced similar contracts, but they withdrew their proposal before the CFTC could vote to ban them. Crypto.com’s contracts, however, are live—and causing quite a stir. On its app, Crypto.com allows users to bet on the Super Bowl or AFC championship, listing options like “hometown celebration” to describe contracts tied to team victories. These contracts are priced at $100 each, with individual traders capped at 2,500 contracts or $250,000 in notional value. Market makers though, can hold up to 250,000 contracts. Nationwide reach shakes up the market Crypto.com’s move into sports betting is a direct challenge to traditional platforms like DraftKings and FanDuel, which operate state by state. Crypto.com sidesteps that limitation by offering trading across all 50 states. While sportsbooks set odds and take on the financial risk of payouts, Crypto.com simply facilitates trades between two parties and collects a small fee. The platform’s contracts add to a crowded but fragmented market. Mobile sports betting is legal in 30 states and Washington, D.C., with unregulated platforms like Polymarket also allowing bets on events like the Super Bowl. But Crypto.com’s nationwide reach has raised eyebrows among both competitors and regulators. The CFTC has long been wary of contracts tied to sports, war, assassination, and other prohibited activities. However, a recent legal decision in late 2024 opened the door for regulated exchanges to offer political prediction markets, indirectly granting a pathway for contracts like Crypto.com’s football futures. Nick Lundgren, Crypto.com’s Chief Legal Officer, defended the contracts, saying, “Having CFTC oversight ensures market integrity, manipulation controls, and availability in all 50 states.” Regulatory uncertainty ahead The CFTC’s stance on event contracts remains very uncertain. In 2024, the agency drafted—but never finalized—a rule defining “gaming” in such markets. This proposed rule would have banned trading on politics, sports, and other events deemed “against public interest.” Rostin Behnam, the outgoing CFTC chairman, recently commented on the issue, saying, “The line between what’s legal and illegal, what’s permitted and impermissible, is getting blurrier. This moves us far from the original purpose of derivatives markets.” Behnam is stepping down on January 20 and leaving the commission entirely on February 7. His departure comes just as President Trump’s administration, which is expected to take a more crypto-friendly approach, prepares to appoint new leadership. The president is yet to name Behnam’s successor though, but everyone’s expecting a pro-crypto figure. That’s just how Trump rolls now.

Long’s comments came following the news that President Donald is likely to repeal the crypto account policy aka SAB 121, which required banks holding digital assets to count them as liabilities. Ripple President Anticipates Tokenized Asset Growth in 2025 Ripple President Monica Long, in an X post , expressed optimism about the expansion of tokenized assets in the banking sector during 2025, subject to regulatory clarity in the United States. In a recent statement on social media, Long highlighted that 15 of the world’s 25 largest banks have already piloted tokenized asset initiatives. She noted: “I expect several of them to launch market-ready offerings in the US in 2025 IF they have clarity from the US government to engage with crypto.” The Ripple President believes that this should no longer be an issue moving into 2025. Ultimately, such a development would pave the way for broader adoption of tokenized assets within the financial industry. Long’s comments came following the news that President Trump will issue executive orders on first day of his presidency such as repealing the controversial crypto policy of SAB 121 which forces banks to report crypto assets as liabilities. Following Donald Trump’s inauguration next week, the crypto industry is expecting a sea change in crypto regulatory framework from the President-elect. Trump’s Executive Order on Crypto Policy One of the sources familiar with the matter said that “Trump has made it clear that this is a priority”. Speaking on this, financial analyst Frank Chaparro stated that Trump’s decision would play a transformative role, allowing large banks to enter the crypto custody space. Chaparro noted that once major financial institutions begin offering crypto custody services, it could revolutionize the market structure by introducing credit and significantly increasing liquidity. “Credit equals more liquidity,” he stated, emphasizing its potential to act as a “major tailwind” for the cryptocurrency sector. Chaparro further suggested that this development could help temper market volatility, marking a pivotal moment for the broader adoption and stabilization of digital assets. Ripple’s XRP adoption will also get a major boost, which has faced major headwinds due to XRP lawsuit . It will be interesting to see what major changes does the next US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has to bring for the crypto industry. In a detailed 31-page letter to Bessent, anti-crypto Senator Elizabeth Warren has raised pointed questions over the changes in crypto policy.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-14 09:04:00

ARE YOU READY? pic.twitter.com/hBwQxcRn55 — Treat (@treatsforShib) January 13, 2025 SHIB Price Shows Signs of Reversal Amid Market Adjustments Shiba Inu price is displaying potential signs of recovery after experiencing significant declines in recent weeks. Despite a 10% drop over the past week and a 20% decline for the month, SHIB has managed to post a modest 2% daily gain. At the time of writing, the SHIB price is trading at $0.00002133, signaling early signs of a possible price rebound. The recent TREAT launch happening today may fuel optimism among traders, with expectations of renewed momentum for the cryptocurrency. If the bullish trend persists, SHIB could break past the $0.000025 level. A further surge might push the price toward $0.00003, particularly if the broader market maintains its recovery trajectory. The global crypto market has experienced a 1.11% uptick in the last 24 hours, with Bitcoin hovering around $94,000. This sideways trading pattern could provide stability and support for SHIB’s potential rally. However, the possibility of bearish pressure remains a concern. A reversal in market sentiment could drive the Shiba Inu price forecast below the $0.00002 mark, erasing recent gains. As market participants monitor developments, the next few weeks could prove pivotal for Shiba Inu’s price trajectory, influenced by market trends and the performance of the TREAT initiative.

While mobile phones took 21 years and the internet 15 years to reach 300 million users, cryptocurrencies achieved this milestone in just 12 years. This rapid growth is seen as a testament to the global interest in decentralised finance and blockchain technology, reflecting their potential to reshape financial systems and digital innovation worldwide. Time taken to 300 million users. source: BlackRock report . Bitcoin leads the pack As per the report, Bitcoin is the world’s leading and most widely adopted cryptoasset and boasts a market cap nearing USD $2 trillion. Its global and decentralized nature positions it as a potential alternative monetary system, particularly appealing during periods of global disorder and waning trust in institutions and fiat currencies. This has attracted significant attention from both institutional and individual investors seeking to diversify their financial assets with Bitcoin. The report added that historically, gaining exposure to Bitcoin has posed challenges, such as the need to open specialized accounts, high trading fees, and security concerns. However, the advent of investment vehicles like IBIT is changing the landscape. Similar to how ETFs have simplified access to hard-to-reach markets like gold and international stocks, IBIT provides a more convenient and efficient way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Drivers behind Bitcoin’s rapid adoption Since Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, its adoption has outpaced even other transformative technologies like the internet and mobile phones. The reports lists three key factors that have fueled this rapid growth: Demographic patterns: younger generations, often considered “digital natives,” exhibit a stronger affinity for digital innovation, including Bitcoin, compared to older demographics like Gen X and Baby Boomers. This generational shift has bolstered Bitcoin’s adoption. Global shifts: economic and political uncertainties, such as rising inflation, geopolitical tensions, and concerns about banking systems, have heightened Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized and non-sovereign asset. Future of finance: the ongoing digital transformation of the global economy has reshaped financial systems. The maturation of infrastructure supporting digital assets has reduced barriers to entry and introduced new use cases for Bitcoin, reinforcing its role in the evolving financial landscape. The future of Bitcoin investing Despite the surge in Bitcoin adoption, direct investment in the cryptocurrency often comes with hurdles. The reports add that this is reason why Bitcoin ETFs would be the next driver behind Bitcoin’s next leg of global adoption. Access: IBIT provides exposure to Bitcoin within a traditional brokerage account. As an ETF, it combines the appeal of Bitcoin with the familiarity of stock trading. Investors can buy and sell IBIT alongside stocks, bonds, and other ETFs across taxable and tax-advantaged accounts, such as a TFSA. Convenience: investing in Bitcoin directly can be complex, requiring accounts on crypto exchanges or specialized brokerages. Securing Bitcoin often involves setting up costly and intricate custody solutions outside these exchanges. IBIT eliminates these challenges by offering exposure to Bitcoin through an ETF — a trusted and widely traded investment vehicle.

However, with the looming ban in the US market, they are contemplating selling the platform’s US operations to Elon Musk. The United States is still discussing the potential TikTok ban. However, with the US Supreme Court judges hinting that they would uphold the law, a TikTok ban is more in sight. The Supreme Court hinted it may not intervene to stop TikTok’s ban TikTok has until January 19 to divest its US operations or face removal from app stores and servers nationwide. The video-sharing platform sought intervention from the US Supreme Court, hoping to avoid the ban, basing its arguments on rights to free speech and expression. The platform has consistently claimed that its removal from the US market would infringe on the rights of its 170 million American users to share content. However, the Supreme Court may be of little help to the platform. On January 10, after listening to multiple oral arguments, most of the court’s judges signaled that US national security concerns take precedence over the free speech interests of companies and creators. Beijing considers Elon Musk for TikTok’s acquisition With the ban becoming more imminent, the Chinese government is considering having Elon Musk take over US operations. Officials have even suggested having Musk’s X merge with TikTok. Nevertheless, there has been no confirmation of any agreement reached between Beijing and the American billionaire. The extent of ByteDance’s involvement in government discussions is still uncertain, as is whether Musk, TikTok, and ByteDance have engaged in talks about any potential deal. TikTok’s US operations are worth about $40 billion to $50 billion. How Musk can finance such a deal remains an open question since he’s still repaying sizable loans after his Twitter acquisition. Whether TikTok decides to sell its US service to Musk or any other individual or corporation, the Chinese government will have a say in the transaction. While TikTok maintains that the Chinese government’s control over ByteDance only extends to its sister application, Douyin, Beijing’s export laws still restrict the sale of software algorithms to foreign parties.

At this point, while many companies are purchasing BTC, the latest news came from Italy.

According to the report by Italian media outlet Criptovaluta, the country's largest banking group, Intesa Sanpaolo, purchased 11 BTC worth 1 million euros. While the acquisition is the first direct investment in cryptocurrency by an Italian financial institution, it remains unclear whether the move is a sign of the bank’s intention to expand into crypto services or is simply an exploratory investment into crypto. The bank also invested in Italy’s first blockchain-based digital bond, worth 25 million euros ($25.6 million), to be issued on the Polygon blockchain by development bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti in July 2024, the bank said. *This is not investment advice.

Mike McGlone expressed confusion over XRP’s rising value. Over the weekend, XRP saw a price recovery, breaking out from its recent low and overcoming the first bull flag that has been forming for the past couple of weeks. This move has been closely tracked, with expectations of a bull flag pattern developing, similar to the last point of support (LPS) phase in a market accumulation cycle. As the new week begins, XRP is experiencing some backtesting, which is expected to be short-lived as the market stabilizes. Analysts suggest that this price action is part of a larger bullish structure, with a possible second bull flag forming. Currently, XRP is holding key support levels, with $2.20 being a crucial point to watch. As long as XRP remains above this level, the bullish outlook stays intact. If the price dips below this mark, it could mean a trap, though it is still too early to draw any conclusions.

The U.S. SEC-approved options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (IBIT), which debuted on Nov. 19, are already almost half the size of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market. On Monday, there were 2.16 million open or active IBIT options contracts, representing a notional value of $11 billion, according to data source optioncharts.io. This notional value is derived by multiplying the open interest by the ETF's price and the lot size 100. The tally equates to 50% of the $23 billion locked in the open BTC options on Deribit at press time. One option contract on Deribit represents one BTC. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A call provides the right to buy, and a put offer offers the right to sell. Similar to traditional markets, traders leverage crypto options to speculate on or hedge against price movements, volatility, and the effects of time (referred to as theta). Deribit has held a leading position for years, with traders and investors using its bitcoin and ether options to set up complex directional and non-directional strategies. However, the exchange's offshore status kept U.S.-based investors looking for regulated avenues at the bay. IBIT options are stepping in to fill that gap. ""With BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF as its underlying asset, IBIT options appeal not only to institutional investors but also U.S. retail traders who favor regulated markets. This rapidly expanding segment is evident in the increasing demand for IBIT options,"" Volmex Finance, a crypto derivatives protocol, told CoinDesk in an email. Volmex added that the growing popularity of IBIT options is challenging Deribit's dominance in the crypto options market. However, Deribit's Chief Executive Officer Luuk Strijers said IBIT options have created positive ripple effects for the industry. ""IBIT options are predominantly traded by U.S. retail investors, a segment that historically has not had access to Deribit. As such, their activation has not negatively impacted our market activity. If anything, it has created positive effects by introducing new arbitrage opportunities and facilitating enhanced risk-offloading strategies for institutional participants as Deribit continues to act as the global repository for risk and volatility,"" Strijers told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) is likely to stay in consolidation as long as fiat-to-stablecoin conversions remain muted, according to Singapore-based digital asset firm Matrixport. In a Jan. 14 research note, Matrixport noted that the latest 7-day stablecoin minting indicator shows a “significant slowdown” in fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, particularly in the lead-up to the Christmas holidays. https://twitter.com/matrixport_en/status/1879061318650806474?s=46 Markus Thielen, an independent analyst, said the dip can be attributed to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish pivot in mid-December, which likely dampened investor sentiment. With fiat-to-stablecoin conversions still subdued, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are expected to continue consolidating, Thielen warned. You might also like: Matrixport outlines new risks that could challenge Bitcoin’s rally in 2025 Despite the end of the quieter holiday period, stablecoin inflows have yet to show a meaningful rebound. Even after the holiday period ended, stablecoin inflows have yet to rebound meaningfully. Thielen stressed that this metric is important, as a rise in stablecoin minting “typically signals rising demand for cryptocurrencies.” However, the current uptick in minting is slight, and its sustainability remains uncertain, he admitted. Thielen remains cautious, noting that while any increase in minting is a good sign, it’s still not enough to signal a clear path for BTC or other cryptocurrencies. For now, the market is likely to stay in a holding pattern until more significant movements in stablecoin inflows appear. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States recorded their third consecutive day of outflows this year, as Bitcoin fell below $90,000 amid a broader market risk-off sentiment. As crypto.news reported , the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs logged nearly $285 million in net outflows on Jan. 13, extending the outflow streak to three days, during which over $1 billion exited the funds.

According to an official release , Tether and its subsidiaries will be located in El Salvador after the company completes all formalities for the move. The stablecoin issuer will also establish its headquarters in the Central American country. Tether to Move to El Salvador Per Tether’s announcement, the latest decision is a step in its journey to foster global Bitcoin adoption. The move to El Salvador will strengthen its position in one of the world’s “most forward-thinking markets,” promoting innovation in the country. El Salvador was the first country to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender and has since established innovative projects showing its support for the cryptocurrency. The country has a favorable regulatory environment and a budding Bitcoin-savvy community, especially with government programs teaching residents about Bitcoin. While Tether supports El Salvador’s vision for financial freedom, one highlight of its latest decision is the ability to expand its focus on emerging markets. The company says it will be strategically positioned to help shape the future of financial systems, not just in El Salvador but in the global landscape. “This decision is a natural progression for Tether as it allows us to build a new home, foster collaboration, and strengthen our focus on emerging markets,” Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino said. Past Collaborations With El Salvador It is worth mentioning that Tether and its subsidiaries have already begun and gotten involved in several projects in El Salvador. In 2023, the government of El Salvador collaborated with Tether to launch a citizenship program that offered a residency visa and a route to citizenship for individuals willing to invest $1 million in bitcoin (BTC) or Tether (USDT) in the country. Last year, Tether became a part of a $1 billion Bitcoin mining initiative in El Salvador, a project powered by the country’s volcanoes and seeking to foster sustainable digital asset mining. “El Salvador represents a beacon of innovation in the digital assets space. By rooting ourselves here, we are not only aligning with a country that shares our vision in terms of financial freedom, innovation, and resilience but is also reinforcing our commitment to empowering people worldwide through decentralized technologies,” Ardoino added.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains the top player, but altcoins are emerging as powerful contenders for impressive gains. Ethereum (ETH) and the rising BigBossInu are primed to deliver extraordinary returns. These top picks are expected to surge before the broader market enters a full-fledged rally. BigBossInu Presale Lights Up the Crypto Scene: Get in Early BigBossInu is blazing a trail in the crypto space, with its electrifying presale attracting widespread attention from investors. Offering the chance for high returns, early involvement is seen as a strategic move. With growing excitement, BigBossInu is positioned as a top pick. Its forward-thinking roadmap and game-changing features signal a powerful rise ahead. >>>>>> Solana (SOL) is showing strong upward momentum, currently trading around $192. With a 5% increase in the last 24 hours, SOL is experiencing significant buying pressure as indicated by its RSI, pushing the price higher. If SOL crosses the $195 resistance level, analysts suggest it could rally toward $220 and possibly $250. Polygon (MATIC) has seen a 3.7% increase, with recent spikes in on-chain activity. Despite the overall bearish market, MATIC’s network activity is picking up, signaling a possible reversal. Analysts are keeping an eye on a potential price resurgence driven by rising user engagement and decentralized application (dApp) activity. Injective (INJ) has reached a significant milestone, breaking above its April 2021 high of $25.30 and now trading around $21.1. Although the token is in overbought territory, buyers continue to push the price up, suggesting more gains ahead unless a short-term correction occurs​. >>> Sei (SEI) continues to experience rapid growth, with the network’s recent upgrades driving increased transaction activity. SEI’s price rose by 7.95%, supported by new features and developments like Sei v2, which blends the strengths of Solana and Ethereum. Its expanding ecosystem is also drawing attention in the DeFi space​. Conclusion As the crypto market gears up for a bull run, altcoins like BigBossInu, Solana, and Polygon are top picks for investors aiming for substantial returns by 2025. BigBossInu’s presale, Solana’s momentum, and Polygon’s network activity highlight strong growth potential. With the market primed for movement, positioning for gains now is crucial, but thorough research and risk management are essential in this volatile space.

Related Reading: Bitcoin To $350,000? Top Crypto Influencer Makes Bold Prediction Based on recent figures from Glassnode, net inflows for the week ending January 6 amounted to 17,567 BTC, equivalent to around $1.7 billion. This increase surpasses the weekly average inflows of 15,900 BTC documented in the final quarter of 2024 and indicates a resurgence of investor enthusiasm. A Turbulent Journey Of Inflows Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have shown an erratic pattern. These inflows showed notable fluctuations in late 2024. In September, there was a significant decline as Bitcoin prices dropped below $64,000, leading to large withdrawals. Nevertheless, things began to change by October. Inflows increased dramatically; in few weeks, they topped 24,000 BTC. With the average weekly inflow settling at around 15,900 BTC, the increase continued into November and December, demonstrating the high demand for Bitcoin investments. After a slow start to the year, demand for US spot #Bitcoin ETFs has normalized. In the week of January 6, inflows reached 17,567 #BTC ($1.7B), which is slightly higher than the weekly average of 15.9K $BTC ($1.35B) from October to December 2024: https://t.co/0Cpfm8lpak pic.twitter.com/u4FksOSLuZ — glassnode (@glassnode) January 13, 2025 As the price of Bitcoin increased, so did ETF inflows. In December 2024, the most popular digital asset in the world reached a record-breaking high of $108,135. This association suggests that as more people switched to exchange-traded funds, investors’ confidence in Bitcoin’s worth grew, leading to a positive market sentiment. Bitcoin ETFs: Who Possesses The Most? The total holdings of US spot Bitcoin ETFs as of early January 2025 are approximately 1.13 million BTC. Grayscale has 204,300 BTC, Fidelity holds 205,488 BTC, and BlackRock has 559,673 BTC, making it the largest holding. In 2024, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) garnered attention by accumulating $37.25 billion in assets during its inaugural year, securing the third position on the Top 20 ETF Leaderboard for that year. This significant surge highlights the rising institutional demand for cryptocurrency-backed financial solutions. Will 2025 Be A Good Year For ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs look like they will do well in 2025. Experts in the field think that this year there may be a lot of new, innovative offerings on the market. There will be at least 50 new bitcoin ETFs this year, according to Nate Geraci of the ETF Store. These will cover a wide range of strategies, such as covered call ETFs and Bitcoin-denominated equity ETFs. Furthermore, there is conjecture that Bitcoin spot ETFs may soon exceed physical gold ETFs in asset size. This would represent a pivotal advancement in the development of digital assets as conventional investment instruments. Such a change would highlight a rising confidence in Bitcoin as a valid store of value and investment tool, therefore challenging the long-held view of gold as the best hedge.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court declined Binance's appeal in a class-action lawsuit alleging unregistered securities sales. This is in addition to the exchange’s growing list of global legal troubles. Additionally, the US indicted three Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, accusing them of laundering funds linked to cybercrimes. Robinhood Reaches $45 Million Settlement with the SEC Robinhood agreed to a $45 million settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after an investigation that uncovered violations of more than ten securities law provisions. The penalty affects Robinhood Securities LLC and Robinhood Financial LLC, both of which failed to meet a wide range of regulatory requirements. These included inaccuracies in reporting trading activity, non-compliance with short sale rules, delayed filing of suspicious activity reports, failure to maintain and preserve customer communications, and inadequate safeguarding of customer information. (Source: SEC ) The SEC's order was released on Jan. 13, and revealed that Robinhood entities admitted to certain findings, including the failure to preserve electronic communications from customers between 2020 and 2021. The company also submitted more than 11,849 Electronic Blue Sheets with errors or omissions, which caused it to misreport data for at least 392 million transactions. Additionally, Robinhood did not report suspicious activity quickly enough between January of 2020 and March of 2022 and failed to implement sufficient identity theft protection measures from April 2019 to July 2022. The regulator also pointed out Robinhood’s non-compliance with Regulation SHO, which addresses abusive short-selling practices, from December 2019 to May 2022. In 2021, a cybersecurity vulnerability also allowed unauthorized access to customer information involving millions of accounts. Both Robinhood Securities and Robinhood Financial admitted to specific findings in the SEC’s order and agreed to be censured. Robinhood Securities will pay $33.5 million, while Robinhood Financial will pay $11.5 million, with the total $45 million penalty due by Jan. 27. Robinhood’s stock (HOOD) was not impacted much by the settlement as shares only fell by about 1.22% to $39.59 on Jan. 13. Share prices also recovered slightly in after-hours trading. Robinhood Markets stock price (Source: Google Finance ) It is still unclear if Robinhood’s cryptocurrency business played a role in these violations. However, the company’s crypto division settled with California regulators last September for $3.9 million over allegations of restricting customer withdrawals between 2018 and 2022. In this case, Robinhood did not admit or deny wrongdoing. Despite its regulatory challenges, Robinhood’s crypto operations have seen a lot of growth. In the third quarter, its crypto trading volume increased by 112% year-on-year to $14.4 billion, while revenue from crypto trading surged by 165% to $61 million. Supreme Court Rejects Binance Appeal Other crypto companies are also currently budding heads with the law. The US Supreme Court recently declined to hear an appeal from Binance and its founder, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, in a class-action lawsuit that was filed by investors alleging the exchange sold unregistered tokens that subsequently lost value. On Jan. 13, the Supreme Court denied a petition to review a lower court ruling that determined US securities laws applied to Binance, even though the exchange lacks a physical headquarters in the United States. (Source: Supreme Court ) The lawsuit was initially filed in April of 2020 by Chase Williams on behalf of investors, and it claims Binance operated as an unregistered securities exchange or broker-dealer. A lower court ruled in March of 2023 that the case could proceed due to the fact that token purchases were finalized in the US and transactions occurred on US servers. Binance argued that the interconnected nature of global markets allowed Americans to trade on foreign exchanges without necessitating the application of US securities laws but failed to convince the courts. The decision by the Supreme Court allows the case to move forward, which only adds to Binance’s mounting legal troubles in the United States. Since mid-2023, the SEC accused Binance and Zhao of selling unregistered securities and illegally providing services to US citizens. Additionally, in November of 2023, Binance agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice over violations of money laundering and terrorism financing laws. Its legal challenges are not limited to the United States. Binance faces a class-action lawsuit in Canada for alleged securities law violations after its exit from the country in May 2023. In another case, the FTX bankruptcy estate is suing Binance and Zhao for $1.8 billion over claims of a fraudulent share deal in 2021. In August of 2024, Zhao and Binance were also sued over allegations of laundering stolen cryptocurrency. Zhao’s personal legal battles intensified in April 2024 when he pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering at Binance and failing to enforce proper Anti-Money Laundering controls. He was sentenced to four months in prison and was released in late September. US Indicts Russians Behind Crypto Mixers Blender and Sinbad The US Justice Department indicted three Russian nationals , Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko, Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, and Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov, for money laundering related to their operation of crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io. A federal grand jury in the Northern District of Georgia charged the trio, and alleged their mixing services facilitated laundering funds that were stolen through ransomware, cryptocurrency thefts, and other crimes, according to US Attorney Ryan Buchanan. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent Wible stated that the mixers made it possible for state-sponsored hackers and cybercriminals to profit from offenses that threatened public safety and national security. Blender.io was sanctioned by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in May of 2022 for its alleged role in laundering illicit proceeds from a crypto heist tied to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Elliptic, a crypto analytics firm, reported that Blender likely rebranded as Sinbad.io in February 2023, which led the OFAC to sanction Sinbad in November of 2023. Authorities dismantled Sinbad.io later that year, but the investigation continued by focusing on identifying and prosecuting those responsible. Ostapenko and Oleynik were arrested in December 2024, while Tarasov is still at large. If convicted, the three face charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Their sentences could exceed 25 years. The enforcement actions against crypto mixers are part of broader efforts to address illicit financial activity in the crypto space. In addition to targeting Blender and Sinbad, US and international authorities have started cases against Tornado Cash. However, sanctions against Tornado Cash in August 2022 drew a lot of criticism from the crypto industry. Advocacy groups like Coin Center and Coinbase-backed individuals even challenged the sanctions in court . Legal proceedings are still ongoing for Tornado Cash co-founders, including Roman Storm. His US money laundering trial is set for April.

L’asset ha sfondato la barriera dei 2 dollari, superando le performance di molti altri asset. Il picco è stato raggiunto il 2 dicembre, quando XRP ha toccato i 2,71 dollari, ma da allora ha perso parte dello slancio. XRP ha continuato a registrare una certa volatilità, con episodi come il rapido crollo sotto i 2 dollari il 20 dicembre. Nonostante il forte slancio iniziale di novembre, il token non è riuscito a mantenere la spinta rialzista. Al momento sta scambiando al livello di 2,53 dollari, con un rialzo del 3,80% in 24 ore. Nel grafico settimanale rimane in positivo con un guadagno del 3,94%, mentre in quello mensile del 5,28%. Gli sviluppi previsti per questo mese potrebbero influenzare in modo decisivo l’andamento di XRP. Domani, 15 gennaio, la SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) presenterà la sua memoria di apertura nell’appello contro Ripple, un passaggio fondamentale per l’esito della battaglia legale. Inoltre, il 20 gennaio Donald Trump assumerà ufficialmente la presidenza degli Stati Uniti, mentre Gary Gensler, il tanto criticato presidente della SEC, lascerà il suo incarico per fare spazio a Paul Atkins, noto per la sua posizione favorevole alle criptovalute. Tutti questi fattori potrebbero avere un impatto notevole sulla traiettoria di XRP. Per capire come potrebbe evolversi nei prossimi giorni, abbiamo consultato l’algoritmo avanzato di PricePredictions , una piattaforma che analizza i movimenti del mercato crypto, per scoprire a che livello potrebbe arrivare XRP entro la fine del mese. L’AI prevede un rialzo per XRP L’algoritmo, tenendo conto di tutti gli sviluppi, prevede un trend rialzista per il token di Ripple. Secondo l’AI, l’asset potrebbe arrivare a 2,70 dollari entro la fine di gennaio. Si tratterebbe di un aumento di circa il 7% rispetto al prezzo attuale. Le previsioni si basano su un’analisi tecnica approfondita, che prende in considerazione diversi indicatori per valutare la forza delle tendenze in corso e determinare se l’asset sia in una fase di ipercomprato o ipervenduto. Tra questi strumenti, troviamo la divergenza della media mobile di convergenza (MACD), l’indice di forza relativa (RSI) e le bande di Bollinger (BB). Nel lungo termine, le previsioni sono ancora più ottimistiche: secondo l’intelligenza artificiale, XRP potrebbe superare la soglia dei 3 dollari a metà febbraio. Prevede anche una correzione nel breve termine, che potrebbe influenzare temporaneamente lo slancio rialzista. Anche diversi analisti prevedono un rialzo di XRP nei prossimi giorni. Ad esempio, il 12 gennaio Alan Santana ha condiviso la sua analisi, presentando un grafico di consolidamento che lo ha portato a ipotizzare un rally fino a 2,70 dollari, a condizione che si sviluppi uno slancio rialzista nel breve periodo. Ma l’analista è più ottimista rispetto all’intelligenza artificiale. Secondo Alan Santana, l’asset potrebbe proseguire lo slancio e raggiungere il livello di 2,90 dollari nelle prossime settimane. Anche l’esperto di trading The Great Mattsby ha rilasciato una previsione rialzista per XRP, stimando che l’asset potrebbe toccare a breve nuovi massimi storici (ATH) sopra la soglia dei 2,70 dollari. La sua analisi si basa sui ritracciamenti di Fibonacci, una tecnica ampiamente utilizzata per individuare i punti di inversione e le possibili nuove tendenze del mercato. Anche se le analisi tecniche prevedono un possibile rialzo per XRP, è cruciale considerare fattori esterni che potrebbero influenzare la sua traiettoria. Il recente dump di 690 milioni di dollari di XRP da parte di Ripple rappresenta un evento significativo che potrebbe innescare una pressione al ribasso nel breve termine, offuscando le previsioni degli esperti più ottimisti. Alternative a XRP Nel frattempo, mentre XRP continua a guadagnare slancio, molti investitori stanno diversificando i loro portafogli per cogliere nuove opportunità nel settore crypto. Progetti come Wall Street Pepe , attualmente in prevendita, stanno attirando molta attenzione. Wall Street Pepe sta costruendo una community esclusiva, denominata $WEPE Army, che offre ai titolari del token l’opportunità di accedere a segnali di trading, strategie vincenti e consulenze specializzate.

The altcoins are also in recovery mode, with ETH reclaiming $3,200, while DOGE has jumped by over 7% daily. BTC Bounces Off The primary cryptocurrency was in a freefall state since last Tuesday, when it peaked above $102,000. Its inability to sustain that level resulted in immediate retracements that pushed it south hard. Within 48 hours alone, it had lost over ten grand, but that was just the start. After a minor recovery last Friday and during the weekend, bitcoin headed straight south on Monday. This time, the bears were even more persistent, pushing BTC down to under $91,000 for the first time since late November and later to below $90,000. In fact, that crash took bitcoin down to a multi-month low of $89,200 (on Bitstamp). At this point, the bulls finally reminded of their presence and didn’t allow another breakdown that could have driven BTC to under $85,000. The cryptocurrency started to recover some ground rather rapidly and jumped to $95,000 earlier today. The bulls kept the pressure on and drove the asset to just under $97,000 as of now. Its market cap has risen to over $1.910 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts stands just shy of 55%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Turn Green The altcoins suffered even more during the past several days, but green now dominates the charts. Ethereum was among the poorest performers, dumping to under $3,000 yesterday for the first time in over two months. Now, though, the second-largest cryptocurrency stands close to $3,250. Even more impressive daily gains come from XRP, SOL, DOGE, ADA, SUI, LINK, HBAR, APT, and AAVE. The case with AAVE is particularly impressive as it has risen by over 11%. The cumulative market capitalization of all crypto assets has recovered $200 billion in a day and is up to $3.5 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Solana has emerged as a fierce rival of Ethereum thanks to its low transaction fees and high scalability. Investors are lining up to buy Solana, which has resulted in a price increase of over 300% in the last two months alone. It’s currently priced at $186.52. And this momentum should be amplified by the launch of ETFs. For fellow crypto traders and investors, we’ve shortlisted four of the best altcoins that are all set to benefit from Solana’s potential ETF launch. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s First-Ever Layer-2 Solution Solaxy ($SOLX) is designed to enhance liquidity, speed, and multi-chain interoperability on Solana. It benefits from the high-performance infrastructure of Solana, supporting seamless liquidity pools and fast swaps. This altcoin has raised an impressive $10M during presale, which reflects the strong confidence of investors in its vision. Currently priced at $0.0016, it offers a significant upside potential. As Solana continues to expand into institutional finance through its upcoming ETF, $SOLX is likely to ride this growth trajectory. Solana can process thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. This makes it a preferred choice for DeFi and enterprise applications. With $SOLX being integrated into this ecosystem, it’s positioned as a key player for investors looking for exposure to Solana. 2. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Empowers Retail Traders with Unique Market Insights Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and influencers alike with its serious ambitions. This altcoin brings a fresh twist with its community-driven ecosystem that engages users with innovative features. The project powers several decentralized applications (dApps) and rewards users when they engage with its ecosystem. Furthermore, $WEPE investors will get unique market insights often reserved for whale investors. Simply put, it aims to even the playing field and empower the average Joe. $WEPE also boasts gamified staking options. As a holder, you can earn passive income while participating in its vibrant community activities. The presale has raised over $47M, which demonstrates the strong interest in its playful approach. As Solana ETFs move closer to approval, $WEPE is poised to gain further traction. It’s currently available at just $0.00036647, with prices set to increase in the next couple of days. 3. Bonk ($BONK) – Proven Performer to Get a Boost The first dog-themed coin on the Solana blockchain, $BONK, is revolutionizing the concept of community-driven cryptocurrencies. This altcoin was launched in December 2022 and carries the ethos ‘for the people, by the people.’ 50% of $BONK’s total supply has been airdropped to the Solana community. This strategic move significantly enhanced its visibility and led to a 34% rise in $SOL’s price in just 48 hours. $BONK was designed to bring back liquidity to the Solana-based DEXs. However, its broader mission is to create a full-fledged ecosystem where all participants have an equitable chance to contribute and benefit. The uniqueness of the project lies in its airdrop mechanism, which significantly rewarded collectors, developers, and artists across the Solana network. This initiative has increased trading activity, with Orca, Solana’s DEX, reporting a trading volume of $20M. $BONK had grown over 2,000% within a week by January 2023, which made it the top-performing crypto asset in terms of percentage return that year. Currently, the tokens have over 350 on-chain integrations from various verticals. As the launch date of Solana ETFs approaches, $BONK will ride the momentum, emerging as a key force in the Solana ecosystem. 4. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – One of the Most Popular Meme Coins Pudgy Penguins is a meme coin inspired by the popular NFT project that shares the same name. Since its launch in late 2024, it has been gaining traction. This altcoin combines the playful essence of its NFT with Solana’s efficient blockchain infrastructure. Pudgy Penguins has established itself as a favorite among community-driven projects. Currently, it has a market cap of $2.06B , which reflects $PENGU’s rapid surge in popularity . Analysts also consider its influencer partnerships and the growing trend of Solana-based meme coins to be key drivers of this demand. $PENGU’s future largely hinges on market sentiment and how it engages with the Solana ecosystem. The launch of the Solana ETF is likely to further drive the momentum of this promising meme coin. Verdict – Where There’s Reward, There’s Risk While these 4 of the best altcoins are undoubtedly poised for massive returns, it’s always advisable to do your own research before investing your money into them or any other asset class for that matter. After all, the crypto market has its fair share of ups and downs, and you must be prepared for it all. Also, remember that none of the above is financial advice, so you need to DYOR before investing in cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|BONK,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-14 09:53:13

But this much is already clear: the convergence of web3 and artificial intelligence is happening at scale and it’s going to change everything – both onchain and off. From DePIN supplying the backbone for startups to access GPU compute to protocols tokenizing AI assets, the scope and diversity of innovation is breathtaking to behold. It’s also becoming extremely hard to keep pace with. To simplify matters, the following blockchain projects meet the criteria that denotes they’re not just using the right buzzwords – they’re also walking the walk. From Singularity Finance to OpenLedger, the following five are tackling the AIFi economy from different angles, but with the same broad goal: ensuring onchain AI achieves its full potential through unlocking new monetization opportunities. Here’s how they’re going about it. Singularity Finance: Tokenizing the AI Value Chain There’s a lot of buzz building around Singularity Finance , the EVM Layer 2 optimized for tokenizing key components of the AI ecosystem. Singularity addresses challenges such as liquidity and compliance, transforming AI compute, applications, and services into yield-bearing tokenized assets seamlessly integrated with DeFi. Singularity Finance is intent on accelerating development of new asset classes, such as AI compute tokens, empowering individuals and businesses to invest in AI infrastructure. The result is a dynamic marketplace for AI resources that enhances accessibility and fosters innovation within the sector. Currently on testnet , where devs can put Singularity Finance’s tech to the test, expectations are high for its mainnet launch and what this means for mainstreaming access to AiFI. VIRTUALS Protocol: Co-Ownership of AI Agents VIRTUALS Protocol is pioneering the use of AI agents in gaming and entertainment. It provides a decentralized co-ownership layer for AI agents, treating these autonomous, revenue-generating entities as productive assets. The agents are multimodal, capable of operating across diverse platforms like Roblox, TikTok, and Telegram games, with memory and functionality that persist across applications. AI agents created using VIRTUAL can plan, interact with environments, and manage onchain wallets. The use of vaults, meanwhile, ensures contributors to AI development are compensated fairly, with their work’s provenance recorded onchain. VIRTUALS also facilitates tokenized co-ownership of AI agents, making them accessible to a broader audience. Its plug-and-play approach simplifies the integration of AI agents into consumer applications, enabling businesses to harness the full potential of AI with minimal technical overhead. OpenLedger: Attributable AI Data. There are many blockchains for AI, but OpenLedger is adroitly targeted at where the greatest value add can be found: data, supplying the lifeblood for AI models and agents to flourish. OpenLedger unlocks the true potential of AI by leveraging blockchain’s ability to efficiently divert revenue streams, ensuring that data and IP owners are fairly remunerated. This way, developers can still access the models they need to train AIs, but without the copyright issues that have plagued centralized AI to date. OpenLedger is also particularly focused on AI agents, offering payable AI models that can support an array of agents for all kinds of use cases, from trading to gaming. The ability to create a custom agent using a model of your choice opens the door to all kinds of possibilities, with full data provenance providing proof that everything has been correctly attributed. NEAR Protocol: User-Owned AI NEAR Protocol may not have launched as an AI-centric chain, but since embracing the technology it’s demonstrated that it’s not just cashing in on the latest craze. There’s some real substance to be found and original ideas that position NEAR as one of the leading “pre-AI” chains that’s best suited to hosting this fast-growing onchain vertical. NEAR enables developers to build scalable AI applications while ensuring users maintain control over their data and AI interactions. It’s funding advancements in data collection, compute access, and monetization for AI applications and has established NEAR.AI R&D Lab, a dedicated research arm focused on creating AI tools for developing web3 applications directly from user intent. From a technical perspective, NEAR is also well equipped for the task at hand, its scalable architecture supporting the massive computational demands of AI. For example, TurboChain, the first AI-generated memecoin blockchain, was deployed on the Aurora Network , which is a prominent layer 2 on the NEAR protocol. The TURBO ecosystem began as a memecoin that was created from the ChatGPT prompt: “Create the next great meme coin, starting with a budget of just $69.” Injective: AI-Driven Blockchain Interactions With iAgent Injective is another general-purpose blockchain ecosystem whose architecture and business model makes it a natural fit for hosting AI applications. It’s recently launched iAgent, an AI-powered SDK that simplifies onchain interactions. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, iAgent allows users to execute tasks such as trading, checking balances, and sending payments through natural language commands. With a particular focus on crypto use cases for AI, iAgent continuously monitors markets, providing insights for informed decision-making, while its SDK uses machine learning to anticipate trends and enable strategic actions. Everyday language inputs make advanced functionalities accessible to non-technical users, enabling them to automate tasks like placing trades or transferring funds with speed and precision. With iAgent, Injective is democratizing blockchain usage by combining the power of AI with intuitive, user-friendly tools, opening new possibilities for both casual users and advanced traders. The Race to Monetize Onchain AI Tokenizing AI components allows individuals to invest in and benefit from the growing AI economy. In other words, everyone can capture the upside to the most transformative tech since the internet itself. For some individuals, that will mean acquiring tokens representing AI compute or stocks in AI companies. For others, it’ll mean leveraging the technology itself through creating agents to do their bidding. While there are hundreds of protocols now operating at the intersection of web3 and AI, the five profiled here have successfully combined superior tech with a sound business model. They’re not just riding the wave in other words: they are the wave, pushing the capabilities of onchain AI further up the beach with every innovation they launch. From tokenizing AI infrastructure to enabling decentralized ownership of AI agents, these projects are redefining how artificial intelligence operates in the web3 era.

Bitcoin’s recent price action may have formed a “head and shoulders” formation, a classic indicator of a reversal from an uptrend to a downtrend, said Piotr Matys, senior forex analyst at Intouch Capital Markets. “A break below $91,600 is a strong technical bearish signal for Bitcoin,” Matys said. The bearish outlook was echoed by Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst, who predicted that Bitcoin’s next low could be around $88,000 if the negative sentiment continues.

While the court calls for the SEC’s lack of transparency in denying Coinbase’s request for crypto-specific regulations, the ruling fuels debate on Gary Gensler’s enforcement policies. XRP Lawyer John Deaton Slams SEC Chair Gary Gensler In his latest X post on January 14, pro-XRP lawyer John E.

He stated, “The rule is inconsistent with free market capitalism and oppressive in a society of self-determination.” Coinbase Secures Partial Win Against SEC The US Third Circuit Court ordered the SEC to reconsider providing clear guidelines on cryptocurrency regulation in Coinbase vs SEC lawsuit . In 2022, Coinbase filed a petition of rulemaking, asking the SEC to provide clarity on crypto regulation. While the exchange sought crypto-specific rules, including asset classification, the SEC rejected the petition. However, the recent court ruling ordered the regulator to explain its denial of the exchange’s motion. The judge opined: “Rather than force the agency to make a rule, we order it to explain its decision not to. Indeed, a rule may not prove necessary to solve the notice problems here; the agency could just state its position on crypto assets unequivocally.” Crypto Community Exalts Coinbase’s Win Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal revealed the exchange’s victory via his X post, stating “We just won our petition for a writ of mandamus at the Third Circuit.” According to his statement, the court deemed the SEC’s move “arbitrary and capricious.” At the same time, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty applauded Coinbase and Grewal for their win over the regulatory agency. Meanwhile, lawyers including ex-SEC James Farrell and pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli discuss how the lawsuit will pave the way for the SEC under incoming Chair Paul Atkins to work on crypto regulations and implications for other crypto lawsuits.

De koers is in een week tijd met 20% gedaald, maar is vandaag weer 3,4% omhoog geschoten naar $186,70. Kan Solana zijn belangrijke support rond $183 behouden of zal een rejection leiden tot een daling? In het geval dat Solana verder stijgt, kan hij uit een downtrend breken die sinds het eind van november speelt. Hiervoor zal SOL echter eerst opnieuw boven $200 moeten breken met een stijging van 7%. Solana herstelt van daling naar laagste niveau sinds 6 november Solana is gisteren zo laag gegaan als $170, het laagste niveau sinds 6 november.

En door de stijging van $170 naar $187 zit de kans erin dat de koopdruk toeneemt vanuit short-term holders. Wat gaat Solana doen? De Solana koers is sinds het einde van november gedaald en bevindt zich voor het grootste deel van afgelopen twee maanden in een trading range die nu tussen $180 en $210 ligt. Het niveau rond $210 dient dan mogelijk als extra resistance, maar een stijging hierboven maakt een breakout boven de downtrend mogelijk. SOL heeft gisteren meerdere support levels getest, zoals de 200-daagse moving average (blauw) op $173 en de onderkant van de trading range op $180. Ondanks de bearish druk, lijkt het nog steeds lastig om de koers onder $170 te duwen, tenzij de crypto markt instort. De Relative Strength Index (RSI) van 42 geeft aan dat Solana weinig momentum heeft, wat het lastiger kan maken om door resistance levels te breken. De eerstvolgende resistance ligt op het huidige niveau van $188, gevolgd door de 30-daagse moving average (geel) van $197. Mogelijk zien we vandaag welke kant Solana opgaat. Een lichtpuntje is het feit dat we nog 6 dagen verwijderd zijn van de inauguratie van Donald Trump. Dit kan zorgen voor veel hype rondom crypto, waardoor SOL een extra duwtje in de rug kan krijgen. Alternatieven voor Solana De crypto markt lijkt voor nu weer op te fleuren. Zo is Bitcoin al 4% gestegen in de afgelopen 24 uur, na een doorbraak boven $96k in de ochtend. Dit is positief voor de hele markt, die over het algemeen beter presteert als het goed gaat met de grootste cryptomunt. Kleine cryptomunten die veel aandacht weten te trekken van investeerders, profiteren het meeste, want een kleinere influx van kapitaal kan zorgen voor grote stijgingen. Hieronder kijken we naar 3 opkomende crypto projecten met een lage market cap en potentie om veel te stijgen in de komende tijd. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Meme coins kunnen binnenkort ook een comeback maken. Een stijging van 7% voor Dogecoin hint erop dat investeerders nog niet hun vertrouwen hebben verloren. De nieuwe Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) heeft ook veel aandacht gekregen van investeerders en met zijn presale al meer dan $47,7 miljoen opgehaald. Een mogelijke reden dat $WEPE een van de grootste presales is van de afgelopen periode is dat $WEPE een meme coin is die veel utility biedt. Token holders kunnen winst maken als $WEPE stijgt, maar krijgen ook toegang tot een exclusieve community met elite trading inzichten. The strength of Wepe is in every hand that holds it. 🐸 ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/Z8M3bsxTwf — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) January 13, 2025 Wall Street Pepe is nog voor een vaste lage prijs te koop van $0,00036647 per token, maar deze prijs stijgt in zo’n 24 uur. Vroege investeerders krijgen de mogelijkheid om hun tokens direct te staken, voor een APY van nog 27%. Nu naar Wall Street Pepe Solaxy ($SOLX) Solaxy ($SOLX) is wellicht het beste alternatief Solana, omdat het de allereerste Solana Layer-2 blockchain is. Niet alleen heeft dit concept veel hype opgewekt, ook heeft Solaxy een veel lagere market cap dan Solana. Dat terwijl het wel kan meeliften op het succes van de grote altcoin. Als Layer-2 profiteer je met Solaxy nog steeds van de lage transactiekosten en hoge snelheden, maar dan zonder de kans op storingen of mislukte transacties. Daarnaast is het mogelijk om met $SOLX te investeren in projecten die op de nieuwe blockchain gelanceerd worden. Als toegangssleutel tot de nieuwe blockchain, kan $SOLX erg waardevol worden. Daarom is de huidige presale prijs van $0,0016 mogelijk erg laag en is het niet gek dat de presale al $10 miljoen heeft opgehaald. Koop en stake $SOLX vandaag nog voor een APY van 343%. Nu naar Solaxy Best Wallet Token ($BEST) De Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale is een unieke kans om de utility token van Best Wallet voor een vaste lage prijs te kopen. Deze token biedt in combinatie met deze crypto wallet unieke voordelen vergeleken met andere bekende wallets zoals Metamask en Phantom. Als token holder profiteer je van korting op handelingen binnen de app en vroegtijdige toegang tot nieuwe presales en launches. Verder krijg je exclusieve voordelen bij partners en hogere staking beloningen. Hierdoor kan de prijs van $BEST na de presale mogelijk veel hoger worden. Keep it up, king 👑 pic.twitter.com/kSqYs40qDI — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) January 13, 2025 Na het ophalen van $7 miljoen in de presale, is de prijs van $BEST gestegen naar $0,0236.

According to a report by The Washington Post on Jan. 13, Trump is expected to prioritize executive orders addressing crypto de-banking and revising a controversial bank accounting policy. The anticipated orders include a repeal of a policy introduced under the Biden administration, requiring banks holding cryptocurrency to list the digital assets as liabilities. This policy stems from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s March 2022 Staff Accounting Bulletin, SAB 121, which has faced resistance from the crypto industry. Trump Team to Reverse SAB 121 The Trump team has reportedly emphasized the urgency of reversing these measures, with sources close to the discussions confirming their high priority. The crypto industry has long criticized the Biden administration for what it perceives as a targeted crackdown, often referred to as “Operation ChokePoint 2.0,” aimed at severing the sector’s access to financial services. Industry leaders have urged Trump to take decisive steps, including issuing crypto-related executive orders, within his first 100 days in office. Some insiders predict that at least one such order could be signed on his inauguration day. In addition to crypto-focused policies, Trump’s administration is expected to revisit other tech-related regulations. David Sack, Trump’s designated crypto and artificial intelligence advisor, recently signaled intentions to revoke Biden’s 2023 AI executive order. This order had been criticized by conservatives for its emphasis on advancing equity through AI technologies. *TRUMP TO ISSUE EXECUTIVE ORDERS RELATED TO CRYPTO ON DAY ONE @DavidSacks ready to roll. pic.twitter.com/ez1CDMeRd0 — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) January 13, 2025 Meanwhile, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has reportedly been instrumental in shaping Trump’s incoming administration. Known for his investments in tech and crypto, Andreessen has been actively recruiting candidates for key positions, including roles in technology, defense, and intelligence. During his campaign, Trump pledged to bolster the U.S. crypto sector, promising a Bitcoin strategic reserve and reduced regulatory hurdles. New Hampshire and North Dakota Latest U.S. States to Propose Bitcoin Reserves New Hampshire and North Dakota have introduced legislation to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves, marking a growing trend among U.S. states to diversify their treasuries with cryptocurrency. Previously, Ohio proposed adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves, following the introduction of a new bill by House Republican leader Derek Merrin. Likewise, on 12 December 2024, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which proposes that the state comptroller hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset for at least five years. Pennsylvania took a similar step in November, with Representative Mike Cabell proposing a bill to allow its treasury to allocate up to 10% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin, citing the asset’s potential to hedge against economic uncertainty. Furthermore, corporate Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have expanded their Bitcoin holdings.

Per a Jan. 14 X post from Gao, the white paper was written by Shaw, the founder of ElizaOS, alongside contributors from other related organizations. According to the technical whitepaper , Eliza is described as a platform for deploying AI-powered agents that integrate directly with web3 technologies, including blockchain data interaction, smart contract operations, and decentralized applications. These agents are able to “By doing so, it could pave the way for a more equitable world where the benefits of technological progress are more broadly and fairly distributed among humanity,” the paper adds. To achieve this, Eliza has been developed using TypeScript, a widely used language in web3 and web development. As such, developers can integrate blockchain functionality into existing web applications and build dapps using familiar tools and frameworks. Eliza’s modular architecture further enhances its adaptability by decoupling its structure into a core Runtime and four key components: Adapter (for data integration), Character (defining agent personalities), Client (managing message interactions), and Plugin (providing universal functionalities). This design allows developers to freely add and customize AI agents without modifying the core Runtime.

Its flexibility extends to platform integrations like Twitter, Discord, and Telegram, making it a powerful tool for deploying advanced web3 applications and AI functionalities. The framework also supports plugins for image, video, and NFT generation, as well as blockchain analytics tools for portfolio management and decision-making. However, the whitepaper notes that Eliza is still in its developmental phase and has identified workflow automation, runtime efficiency, and multi-language support as areas it still needs to improve upon. As its end goal, Eliza aims to evolve into a fully autonomous AI system capable of planning and executing tasks without human intervention. As previously reported by crypto.news, Shaw revealed that Eliza v2 would integrate Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs), a system designed to break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components structured in a tree-like hierarchy. This will allow AI agents developed on Eliza to efficiently plan, adapt, and execute intricate, multi-step processes, even in uncertain or dynamic scenarios. According to Elizas.world , a community-run dashboard, Eliza currently powers over 30 AI agents. The launch of the technical whitepaper comes as AI agents continue to gain traction across various industries. Market research firm RootsAnalysis estimates the AI agent industry, valued at $5.29 billion in 2024, will grow at a projected compounded annual growth rate of 40% through 2035. However, the crypto AI agent sector has faced some hiccups amid a broader market correction in the crypto space, with its value dropping 16% to $11.3 billion yesterday before recovering to $13.65 billion at press time.

Although the narrative paints BTC as resilient, macroeconomic pressures could drag the digital asset to levels not seen in months. A Bitfinex Alpha report has cited tightening financial conditions, the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling fewer rate cuts, and news of the Justice Department’s authorization to liquidate $6.5 billion worth of BTC as factors driving the dump. However, rising U.S. Treasury yields are another important factor. Macroeconomic Pressures The 10-year U.S. Treasury yields have recently climbed to 4.79%, a level not seen in 14 months. The last time yields surged above this 4.6% was in April 2024, when BTC traded close to $73,000. Interestingly, BTC did not touch $73,000 again for seven months. Analysts at Bitfinex noted that the rise in Treasury yields has significant implications for both traditional markets and risk assets. Higher yields lead to an uptick in returns from low-risk government bonds, making them more attractive to institutional and conservative investors. “As yields increase, the opportunity cost of holding Bitcoin rises, prompting some institutional investors to rebalance their portfolios away from cryptocurrencies and into safer, yield-generating assets,” analysts stated. Additionally, higher yields signal tightening financial conditions, which affects overall liquidity in financial markets. Borrowing becomes more expensive, and capital flowing into speculative assets like cryptocurrencies declines significantly. Diversified institutional investors also rotate their capital out of crypto into bonds to take advantage of safer returns. A More Volatile Environment for BTC Although Treasury yield moves often impact risk assets with a delayed effect, BTC tends to react more quickly compared to equities due to its higher volatility and greater sensitivity to liquidity changes. The S&P 500 reacts within one to three months, while it takes BTC one to two weeks or less in highly speculative market conditions. Bitcoin’s reaction to the recent rise in Treasury yields can be seen in net outflows across U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These funds have recorded negative flows in seven out of the last 12 trading days. While the market’s condition suggests a more volatile environment in the coming weeks, Bitfinex thinks the incoming U.S. administration could limit deeper losses and keep BTC in a strong long-term position.

This time, two breakout stars made their list of profitable tokens for the altcoin season: Solana and the new GambleFi altcoin, Rollblock. Despite bleeding 18% MoM, analysts believe Solana is set to climb to new highs and reclaim ATH of $264. But the new Rollblock token has defied all odds: over $8.7M raised, a 350% surge, and analysts still predict 50x gains. With bullish momentum surging, both tokens could redefine the year’s crypto narrative. Here’s the timeline and what to expect. Gamblefi Ingenuity Rollblock Wins Hearts; Analysts Predict 50x Surge Rollblock has quickly become a viral presale sensation with its GambleFi solution. This iGaming wonder introduced a truly decentralized cutting-edge AI casino last year, and since then, it’s continued from strength to strength. Last year ended on a blissful note, with Rollblock’s GambleFi ingenuity raking in close to $9M. The numbers have grown tremendously: Over $8.7M raised so far, 350% token growth and a 600% rise in user deposits. All these monumental milestones wouldn’t have been possible without Rollblock’s laser focus on innovation. Its ecosystem fosters user growth by blending blockchain technology with the best of traditional casinos. The 100% transparency and robust ecosystem of bespoke games, including sports betting, has obviously attracted investors. Realistic regulatory compliance and a Solidproof audit only complement this dedication to transparency further. At the core of this innovation is the RBLK native token. The GambleFi altcoin is packed with solid utility, including governance rights, rakebacks and a passive income stream from the revenue share program and staking opportunities. This dual strategy positions RBLK for exponential growth , and that’s why analysts forecast it could go 50x soon. The token is still selling hot for just $0.045 in presale stage 9. Analysts Predict A New ATH For Solana: Can This Altcoin Deliver? Solana is back in the spotlight, and this time, its analysts’ forecast of a fresh ATH had investors buzzing. The altcoin had an excellent 2024 that saw it hit an ATH of $264 in November before suffering a sharp decline from profit-taking selloffs. However, the dips have deterred Solana from building on its innovative legacy. In recent news, Solana unveiled plans to implement quantum resistance for unbeatable security. Proposed scalability upgrades like “Accounts Lattice Hash” aim to improve blockchain efficiency, and all these have bucked up experts’ outlook for a potential Solana ETF. Market analysts believe Solana is in the final leg of a five-wave upward movement that could see prices soar. Near-term targets range between $270 and $300, with an extended rally potentially reaching $418-$421. With strong technicals and robust development activity, Solana seems poised to deliver on its promise as a top-tier altcoin. Conclusion The viral new altcoin Rollblock and Solana have set the stage for an exciting altcoin season this year. Rollblock’s revolutionary GambleFi ecosystem and robust utility token, RBLK, have captured investors’ attention with unparalleled transparency, innovation, and a projected 50x surge. It’s the same for Solana—its focus on continuous innovation and upgrades has fueled projections of a new ATH that could reaffirm its dominance among altcoins.

That’s a problem for everyone,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/us-saudi-breakup-no-longer-feels-farfetched/,"The United States and Saudi Arabia have been tied at the hip for decades. But now, it’s looking like the Kingdom is ready to break away, and this isn’t just a diplomatic spat. This is the kind of geopolitical breakup that could disrupt energy markets, upend alliances, and crash global stocks markets as well as, of course, crypto. The bedrock of their relationship—the petrodollar—is crumbling, and that’s not something we can brush off. In June 2024, Riyadh ended its exclusive petrodollar deal, an arrangement that had tied its oil trade to the U.S. dollar for nearly 50 years. This wasn’t just a financial arrangement, it was a marriage of convenience that kept both sides in power. Now, Saudi Arabia is selling its oil in Chinese yuan, euros, and other currencies. Around 30% of their oil sales are now outside the dollar system, and that number is climbing. Plus, they are considering officially joining the BRICS bunch, whose whole deal is dethroning America. With Saudi on their side, they’d be able to do it in a heartbeat. Petrodollar divorce and a changing economic playbook The U.S.-Saudi partnership began in 1974 when both countries struck a deal that would define global finance for decades. The Kingdom sold its oil exclusively in dollars, and in return, the U.S. offered military protection and a global platform for Saudi influence. The decision to dump the petrodollar exclusivity wasn’t a snap judgment. It’s part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 plan, which aims to diversify the Kingdom’s economy. Oil might still be king, but Riyadh knows it can’t keep its future tied to a single resource—or a single currency. This also fits neatly into Saudi Arabia’s budding relationship with China, its largest trading partner. China is becoming Saudi Arabia’s gateway to global influence. The Kingdom has joined China’s mBridge digital currency initiative, a multi-central bank project aimed at revolutionizing cross-border payments. The goal is clear: ditch the dollar, and they’re not being subtle about it. This isn’t just about money, either. Saudi Arabia is courting Beijing for investment in its non-oil sectors—tourism, tech, and entertainment. Sorry to president Trump, but these guys could care less. Diplomatic chaos and a shaky U.S. The cracks in the U.S.-Saudi relationship aren’t just economic—they’re political. In March 2023, Saudi Arabia shocked the world by signing a China-brokered deal to restore diplomatic ties with Iran. Yes, Iran, the same country Washington has spent decades trying to isolate. This was a sign that Riyadh is no longer taking marching orders from the U.S. Then, in June 2024, the Kingdom made another bold decision. It declined to renew its security agreement with the U.S., a cornerstone of Middle Eastern stability since the Gulf War. That deal was a guarantee of U.S. military support in exchange for Saudi loyalty. Without it, the power dynamics in the Gulf are changing fast. Of course Saudi’s new alliances are making Washington nervous. If Riyadh starts buying military hardware from Beijing or Moscow, the U.S. loses its foothold in the region. Iran, emboldened by its new friendship with Saudi Arabia, might start flexing its muscles. The Gulf Cooperation Council, already a fragile alliance, could fracture further. Global markets on edge Saudi Arabia is shaking up global markets. By stepping away from the dollar, the Kingdom is challenging a system that has defined international trade for nearly a century. Global trade, which relies heavily on dollar transactions, could face serious instability. And let’s not forget the ripple effects on inflation, interest rates, and global economic growth. China, of course, is loving this. As Saudi Arabia’s top trading partner, Beijing benefits directly from Riyadh’s pivot. By conducting more trade in yuan, China strengthens its currency’s position on the world stage. For the U.S., this is a nightmare. If the dollar loses its grip on the oil market, Washington loses leverage over global trade. Saudi Arabia’s pivot isn’t without risks, especially for Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). Vision 2030 is ambitious, but it depends on foreign investment. By alienating the U.S., Saudi Arabia risks scaring off Western investors. There’s also the issue of domestic stability. The Kingdom is undergoing rapid change, and not everyone is on board. Unemployment is still a problem, and the oil revenues that have kept the country afloat are less reliable than they once were. If Vision 2030 stumbles, the Crown Prince could face backlash at home. The security implications of this decoupling are massive. Without U.S. military support, Saudi Arabia is more exposed to threats from Iran, the Houthis in Yemen, and other regional players.",OP-ED|BRICS|CNY|EUR|SAR|USD,EN,0,0,ASIA|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-14 11:37:37

One such advanced service is currently being deployed with the emerging coin, 1Fuel . 1Fuel’s presale is hitting the high notes, with over $1.2 million in sales already acquired at the token price of $0.015. Let’s explore why experts are betting on this unexpected contender as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in now for potential returns up to 1000%. Bitcoin vs Ethereum: The dominant crypto duo Both assets are still keeping things strong in the cryptocurrency market, bringing distinct opportunities to the table. Often referred to as digital gold, Bitcoin is popular for its store-of-value features and effective security—all of which endear it to whales. Conversely, Ethereum dominates with its adaptability, efficient decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, which underscore much of the DeFi ecosystem. As of December 10, 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum together accounted for more than 50% of the cryptocurrency market. This signifies a widespread adoption among whales. However, their dominant run still leaves some things to be desired. Both platforms appear not to cater to small-scale and regular investors, particularly in the aspects of ease of use and cost efficiency. 1Feul steps in: a wildcard with practical appeal 1Fuel will tackle some persistent issues that have ravaged major platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum. A notable 1Fuel feature is its flexible approach to the cryptocurrency exchange. Unlike existing networks, which need several wallets and phases of usage fees, 1Fuel streamlines the flow, ensuring cross-network swaps proceed without hassle. 1Fuel’s focus on flexible utility has been attracting interest from new and seasoned investors alike. Its ongoing third presale keeps generating impressive numbers—over 135,000,000 tokens have been sold, each at the affordable price of $0.015. Its tokenomics are a strong talking point, built solely for scalability, sustainability and affordability. Investors who actively consult the 1Fuel trading system will be rewarded with a percentage of the total token supply. 40,000,000 tokens have been allocated for this special operation to ensure asset liquidity and utility. For investors exploring the best cryptocurrencies to invest in now, the joint package of utility, affordability, and growth potential proposed by 1Fuel gives it an appealing edge. Why analysts are taking note of 1Fuel Market observers are monitoring emerging DeFi platforms gathering momentum in the past months. In the case of 1Fuel, there is considerable agreement that the network fits smoothly into the evolving trends of the blockchain. As adoption mounts, the demand for tokens that can organize cost-effective and seamless transactions across multiple networks is intensifying. Some analysts submit that this shift could open a gap in the market where 1Fuel is perfectly positioned to thrive. The network’s potential to operate as a link between platforms without compromising on speed or security further strengthens its appeal as users daily seek more adaptable solutions to the cryptocurrency exchange. Conclusion The rise of 1Fuel as an accessible, streamlined option could make it a wildcard in the 2025 market scene, even in the presence of major players such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. There’s plenty of room for 1Fuel to prove itself. And it looks like it will, as analysts anticipate a 100x return for early investors. Best not to be left out. There is still time for investors who haven’t bought from the 1Fuel presale yet to do that now.

38950506,https://finbold.com/?p=228396,1736854763,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/finbold.png,"XRP eyes $100 this cycle if historical pattern plays out, according to technical analyst",https://finbold.com/xrp-eyes-100-this-cycle-if-historical-pattern-plays-out-according-to-technical-analyst/,"XRP breakout in the current cycle could be preparing the token to rally to $100 if a repeating historical pattern plays out. According to technical analyst Gert van Lagen, the projection is based on the fact that the Ripple -affiliated token has confirmed a double-bottom breakout, a bullish structure that previously led to XRP’s rise in 2017. In an X post on January 14, Van Lagen noted that the double-bottom formation emerged in the 2017-2018 cycle, during which XRP surged to its all-time high near $3.50 after breaking through its neckline resistance and successfully retesting it. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView/Gert Van Lagen Now, amid the current market cycle, the analyst observed that XRP has repeated this structure, bouncing from the neckline after a retest. Van Lagen’s projection suggests that XRP could follow a similar trajectory, making the next target possibly around $100. It is worth noting that although such a rally might be driven by underlying fundamentals around Ripple partnerships and regulatory developments, it remains highly ambitious. Achieving this target will also require significant support from the overall sustainability of the cryptocurrency market rally. Indeed, a $100 target would elevate XRP’s market cap to $5.74 trillion, making it the most valuable cryptocurrency, provided assets like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) post minimal growth over the same period. However, Van Lagen did not offer a specific timeline for when XRP might reach this ambitious $100 target. While the $100 mark may not seem achievable in the short term, XRP investors could interpret the asset’s recent breakout as a potential indicator of its trajectory toward this goal. What next for XRP’s price XRP has experienced one of the longest consolidation periods below the $1 mark, but recently broke out amid the post-election rally , driven by anticipation of Donald Trump’s pro-cryptocurrency stance. Elsewhere, an analysis by Cryptoinsightuk in an X post on January 14 suggested that XRP’s technical setup points to a massive rally that “will leave people in shock.” According to the expert, the XRP/BTC pair has broken out of a multi-year downtrend. XRP price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Between 2013 and 2017, XRP consolidated against Bitcoin for 1,277 days before skyrocketing by an astounding 5,492%. Fast-forward to 2024, and XRP has just completed a significantly longer consolidation period of 2,741 days—more than twice the length of the prior cycle. With this breakout, the potential for a similarly exponential rally is anticipated. This short-term bullish breakout is also supported by analysis from World of Charts , which predicted that XRP could target $4 in the “next couple of days.” Meanwhile, Alan Santana pointed out that XRP’s recent short-term rally against the general market momentum indicates that the token’s bullish breakout has been confirmed. XRP price analysis At press time, XRP was trading at $2.59, having rallied by over 7% in the last 24 hours. On the weekly chart, the asset has gained 5.3%. XRP seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold At its current price, XRP is showing strong bullish momentum as it remains above its 50-day simple moving average ( SMA ) and 200-day SMA. With a 14-day RSI of 60.20, XRP is nearing bullish territory without being overbought, leaving room for further gains.

Remittix (RTX) Set To Outshine Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) in 2025,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/remittix-rtx-set-to-outshine-dogecoin-doge-and-ethereum-eth-in-2025/,"The post The Next Big Crypto? Remittix (RTX) Set To Outshine Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) in 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The crypto market is currently seeing signs of turbulence with many tokens bleeding on the price charts. Even some of the best cryptos, like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH), are trading in the red, however market analysts Javon Marks and Poseidon have made bold price predictions for these altcoins. Nevertheless all the crypto talk is about Remittix (RTX) , a rapidly growing ICO with bold plans to create the world’s first crypto-to-fiat exchange! Remittix’s ICO has already raised over $2.7M in just two weeks as thousands pile into crypto’s newest revolution. Some even think this altcoin, with its higher upside potential, could outshine DOGE and ETH in 2025. Remittix (RTX) Price Soars 32% With More Spikes Ahead Remittix (RTX) is a crypto coin that has made headlines with its exceptionally impressive ICO. It has seen seven price increases in just three weeks while successfully raising over $2.7 million. Early buyers of this altcoin have already taken 32% return and this is only set to increase. With a CoinMarketCap listing and dedicated information page, Remittix is ticking all of the right boxes for seasoned investors who believe it possesses all the necessary traits to become a 50x token in 2025! Along with this Remittix’s team has also submitted a CoinGecko listing application and with these developments, millions of new investors could soon drip into the PayFi innovators ecosystem. Remittix aims to redefine the cross-border payments market, which Mordor Intelligence predicts could be worth $295B by 2029. Remittix will introduce a crypto-to-fiat platform where users can swap 40 crypto coins to fiat currencies and then send them to any global bank account. This will be done very quickly and at a flat fee, as Remittix will not implement any hidden costs for FX or wires. The RTX utility token will be a big part of its ecosystem and to incentivize investors the Remittix team announced that holders of this altcoin will get governance voting rights as well as amazing staking rewards. Currently, one RTX costs just $0.0199 and now is an excellent time to acquire Remittix. The team over at Remittix has stated that the minimum launch price for RTX will be $0.135 marking a 578% increase from its current price ! but the next block of tokens will cost $0.020. Additionally, everyone is waiting for a Tier-1 crypto exchange like Uniswap to list it, as it may trigger a massive rally. Javon Marks: The Price of Dogecoin (DOGE) May Hit $20 Dogecoin (DOGE) is one of the best meme coins but has recently seen some red price charts. CoinMarketCap shows its value has fallen nearly 20% on the one-month chart. The Dogecoin price moved from around $0.40 to nearly $0.30 during that time. However, crypto analyst Javon Marks remains bullish for Dogecoin (DOGE). In a recent X post , he said that this meme coin looks to be in a bull cycle. As a Dogecoin price prediction, Javon forecasts a potential surge to $20. The technicals for the Dogecoin crypto are also showing some good signs. TradingView shows that this meme coin is valued above its 100-day EMA ($0.30) and its 200-day EMA ($0.24). Thus, Dogecoin is still one of the altcoins to watch. Ethereum (ETH) Sees a Price Dip, Analyst Remains Bullish One of the top 5 cryptocurrencies, Ethereum (ETH), has also experienced some volatility. In the past week alone, the price of Ethereum has dropped from around $3,700 to nearly $3,000. In other words, nearly a 20% fall in just a few short days as per CoinMarketCap . Nevertheless, some market analysts like Poseidon remain bullish. For instance, Poseidon’s recent X post says that this altcoin could see a massive price surge soon as it is in its consolidation phase. Poseidon suggests a rise to $10K as an Ethereum price prediction soon. Even though many investors are bullish on Ethereum, some are still cautious. Since the Ethereum market cap now sits at $364B, it needs a lot of new money for its price to surge. Therefore, investors are looking at crypto coins like RTX instead. Remittix (RTX) vs. Dogecoin (DOGE) vs. Ethereum (ETH) – Which Crypto Coin May See Faster Gains? Remittix (RTX), Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ethereum (ETH) could all see big price gains soon. However, one of them stands out – Remittix. It will introduce trailblazing technology that could disrupt an entire market while having a smaller market cap, which means faster price growth with less money. With growing community members, strong fundamentals, and real utility, this crypto coin is positioned to outshine even DOGE and ETH in 2025.

The redeemed SOL was distributed to 20 addresses. Solscan data showed that the FTX/Alameda staking address still held a balance of 6.47M SOL worth over $1.19B. The data also revealed that the staking address had redeemed and transferred a total of 4.445M SOL worth over $516.88M through the same method at an average price of $116. The move signaled FTX/Alameda’s active management of their accounts and showed their continued significant stake in Solana, potentially indicating confidence in SOL’s long-term value. According to crypto enthusiast Evelina Radziwiu, the staking redemption could be seen as FTX/Alameda’s broader strategy to rebalance their portfolio due to the potential staking risks. She pointed out that the proposed slashing mechanisms on Solana were likely to affect staked assets. FTX/Alameda has a significant stake on Solana 🚨TODAY: FTX/Alameda Research redeems around $32 million worth of $SOL from staking. Solscan data shows that the wallet still has over $1.1 billion worth of $SOL locked up. pic.twitter.com/LsjVUzZc4X — Crypto HMVP (@Naqati7) January 14, 2025 Solscan’s ‘transfers’ data showed that the FTX/Alameda staking address first withdrew 182,397 SOL, followed by another withdrawal of 24 SOL three hours later, bringing the total to 182,421 SOL . The SOL was then distributed to 20 addresses in separate transactions carried out about seven hours ago. LocaleDao claimed that FTX/Alameda’s significant movement of SOL could impact SOL market dynamics, while the remaining $1.1 billion locked position warranted close monitoring for future redemptions. The allocation of the redeemed SOL to 20 different addresses also suggested a strategic distribution aimed at liquidity management or fulfilling specific institutional demands. Today’s unstaking continued a trend in recent months where FTX/Alameda had redeemed almost the same amount of SOL between the 12th and the 15th of each month. In December 2024, Solscan’s data showed that FTX/Alameda completed its routine redemption, unstaking 181,232 SOL worth ~$41.46 million, which was also distributed to 20 addresses. The FTX/Alameda staking address also redeemed 179,800 SOL worth $39.21 million in November through the same procedure, with most of the SOL reportedly flowing into Binance and Coinbase. The same address redeemed 177,693 SOLs valued at over $23.7 million in September 2024 and 178,631 SOLs worth $128 million in October. As of the time of publication, Solana was exchanging hands at $186.63, with a 24-hour increase of 2%. SOL’s trading volume increased by almost 158% to $6.12 billion in the past 24 hours. FTX/Alameda redirects $1.2B to debt repayment According to FTX creditor activist Sunil Kavuri, FTX had until the 20th of this month to fulfill predistribution requirements of $1.2 billion in repayments to small creditors ( represent 98% of FTX’s customers and will receive a larger percentage of the payout. According to ODaily’s JK, FTX is paying part of its ~$16 billion debt (creditor repayments) by next month. The plan came as FTX/Alameda continued to liquidate assets, including SOL, to initiate the notable debt cancellation. The compensations will, however, be settled based on crypto prices at the time FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022. The price of Bitcoin was at around $16K. Arkham’s on-chain data revealed that FTX’s net holdings had dropped by over $200 million in the last week, from $1.70 billion on January 7th to $1.49 billion on January 14th. Solana-based assets OXY (9.77B), MAPS (7.96B), MEDIA (7.65M), FIDA (256.09M), and RAY (3.11M) accounted for about $713 million of FTX’s net holdings’ value.

Also, PEPETO Becomes Token of the Season",https://coinpedia.org/press-release/pepeto-becomes-token-of-the-season/,"The post Dogwifhat Approaching $1.30, Correcting impending? Also, PEPETO Becomes Token of the Season appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News In the lively crypto space two tokens recently grabbed attention for different reasons. Dogwifhat rose quickly in the market but now shows signs of a possible price drop ‒ PEPETO draws eyes with its successful presale and exciting features. Looking at Dogwifhat’s Latest Price Changes Dogwifhat (WIF), with a market cap of $1.58 billion and 998.84 million tokens circulating, had impressive trading numbers ‒ now faces a big downturn. After reaching its peak its price steadily falls nearing an important support level around $1.30. This recent change hints that a correction could happen soon as traders think about how sustainable its fast early growth is. The token’s high volatility acts like a double edged sword ‒ it attracts quick profit seekers but also brings risk that might scare away long term investors. Analysts watch Dogwifhat closely as it nears these lower prices wondering if it will settle or keep falling. ‍PEPETO: Bright Newcomer in Meme Coin World PEPETO moves forward in the crypto community ‒ not only as a meme coin but also as a token with real usefulness. Starting at a presale price of $0.000000104 per token, PEPETO has already gathered over $3.4 million ‒ showing growing investor interest and belief in its future potential. Unlike many meme coins that depend solely on social media buzz, PEPETO builds a strong base with practical features. https://twitter.com/Pepetocoin/status/1874260504891240897 Main Features of PEPETO: Zero-Fee Exchange ‒ A big attraction for traders tired of high transaction costs ‒ encouraging more frequent and larger trades. Cross-Chain Bridge ‒ Allows easy token swaps across different blockchains ‒ increasing its usefulness in a multi-chain setup. Staking Rewards ‒ Gives extra reasons for holders to invest and keep their tokens ‒ supporting the token’s price stability and long-term success. These features aim not just to follow trends but to create lasting value in the crypto market ‒ making PEPETO stand out from regular meme coins. Market Outlook: Dogwifhat and PEPETO Dogwifhat’s short-term future looks shaky with its price close to $1.30. In the coming weeks ‒ very important ones ‒ the token might either find new support or keep losing value. Investors and traders should watch market mood and trading volumes closely as signs of where Dogwifhat could go next. On the other hand PEPETO aims to take advantage of its successful presale by entering the market with strong energy. Its mix of meme charm and useful features gives a solid base for growth, maybe making it a regular in many crypto portfolios.

Its new way of handling transaction costs and working across different chains could probably set fresh trends in the meme coin space. Dogwifhat owners should think about the risks linked to its current ups and downs. A careful plan seems wise maybe using short term signals until the token becomes more stable.

The price surged significantly after news of Gary Gensler’s resignation. With a new SEC chair in place and Brad’s recent dinner with Trump, it appears that things are finally starting to clear up for the coin. In a recent podcast with Scott Melker, Bloomberg’s Mike McGlone expressed his confusion about the value of XRP, especially when comparing it to stablecoins like Tether. He noted that both XRP and Tether have market caps of around $100 billion to $140 billion, with crypto volumes growing daily. Despite this, he struggles to understand XRP’s value, given that stablecoins offer instant transactions with low costs and are generally considered secure. He questioned why XRP stands out in this context. CEO and co-founder of CoinRoutes said that, “They (Ripple) believe their ledger will be used by the banking system to launch their own stablecoins or to use their stablecoin to do it. And if you believe that the XRP Ledger will be the technology that will underlie the replacement to Swift, you could come to a valuation somewhere between, you know, $7 and $10, which is not ridiculous.” He continued, “I don’t talk about size ever, but I did because I looked at it and said, okay, they have the right connections, they have the regulatory headwinds that will be gone, and I think people are going to discount the fact that they’re going to have a real shot at being part of the backbone of the new financial system. I could have a $7 price target on my position, and that’s a really nice return. I mean, I don’t care. I’m not looking for 100x.”",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP|ZRX,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-14 11:53:51

While the comment may appear overly optimistic to macro bears, it is not without justification. Even as the DXY, Treasury yields, and Fed rate expectations look to destabilize risk assets, corporate and institutional demand for BTC continues to strengthen. Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy’s largest bank by market capitalization, has reportedly purchased BTC, snapping up 11 BTC for $1 million. That could accelerate crypto adoption in the European Union's third-largest economy, which already has 1.4 million citizens holding cryptocurrencies. If that's not enough, corporate Treasury purchases of BTC have already reached 5,774 BTC in the first two weeks of January, outpacing the supply of new BTC. To Dragosch's credit, BTC has bounced to over $96K, hinting at an end of the price weakness that began a month ago at record highs above $108K. As usual, that has brought cheer to all corners of the crypto market, with AI, gaming and meme sub-sectors leading the charge. The recovery, supported by ongoing institutional adoption and rumors of President-elect Donald Trump planning to issue an executive order addressing crypto-accounting SEC rules on day one, suggests that bears may find it difficult to assert their influence. Prices may move into six figures if Tuesday's U.S. producer price index points to softer inflation in the pipeline, weakening the hawkish Fed narrative. Note that the dollar index's rally has already stalled amid reports that Trump's tariffs will be gradual and smaller than initially feared.

The marketplace has integration with multiple social channels including X, allowing for agents to be deployed on these channels after launch. Despite enduring a steep correction, AI tokens have outperformed every other basket class within the cryptocurrency space so far this year, owing their returns to a significant surge seen in the first week of the year. CCData’s basket performance shows that year-to-date, AI tokens are up 2.5%, while the second-best performing class, exchange tokens, is up less than 0.5%. On the other end of the spectrum, real world asset (RWA) tokens are down more than 14% , significantly underperforming memecoins, which dropped roughly 10% in this month’s correction. Usual Protocol, the popular decentralized finance protocol that came under fire last week over an unexpected change in its redemption mechanism, has activated its Revenue Switch for USUALx holders. Solana-based token launchpad Pump.fun has moved 122,620 SOL worth over $21 million to Kraken, bringing their total deposited funds to 1.785 million SOL worth $362 million, Onchain Lens revealed . The FTX estate has executed its monthly SOL redemption transfer, unstaking 182,421 SOL and moving the funds to 20 different addresses. Since November, FTX has redeemed over $500 million in SOL, and it still holds $1.18 billion in its staking address. Derivatives Positioning Large cap tokens, excluding XLM, XRP and HYPE, have seen a decline in perpetual futures open interest in the past 24 hours. Front-end BTC and ETH options risk reversals show neutral sentiment despite the price recovery. Near-dated and long-term options show a bias for calls. Block flows featured large purchase of calls at $95K and $98K expiring in the next two weeks and an ETH bull call spread, involving March 28 expiry calls at $5.5K and $6.5K.

Tuesday sees the altcoin combined market cap at $965 billion, and the trend is definitely still up. $XRP and $KAS lead the pack. Total3 confirms uptrend Source: TradingView Total3 is the combined market capitalisation of all the cryptocurrencies, excluding $BTC and $ETH. It can be seen that the price came all the way down to confirm the bottom of the triangle before rising and settling above the strong horizontal support once more. It could be that the price ducks back under the support again as it continues to track sideways, experiencing strong volatility as it does so. However, a break to the upside of the triangle is more likely than not. All that is needed is for Bitcoin to do its part. $XRP breaks out - set to go higher Source: TradingView Among the altcoins that are doing their bit to force the altcoin market cap upward is $XRP. As can be seen in the daily chart above, the price has broken through the descending trendline and looks set to go higher. Just settling above the 0.618 Fibonacci, the 0.786 is overhead at $2.68. The next targets are then $2.90 where the trendline started, and then aspirationally $3.52 at the 1.618 Fibonacci. $XRP, with its strong community behind it, could go higher than this. This will very much depend on how this bull market develops. $KAS faces strong resistance Source: TradingView The altcoin that is arguably doing the best on Tuesday is $KAS. A 13% rise bears testament to this. That said, unlike $XRP, which has plenty of open space above it, $KAS bulls will have to battle through plenty of resistance in order to threaten the all-time high. The price is currently facing rejection from the horizontal resistance at $0.13, together with the ascending trendline. On the other hand, if a breakout can occur, the climb to $0.18 would definitely be on. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

XRP Set For A Breakout: Will the Bull Run Take It Higher? XRP is currently trading in a narrow band between $2.27 and $2.67. This price behavior comes ahead of key resistance at $2.83 and support at $2.03. The 10-day and 100-day moving averages are almost identical, hinting at stability. The RSI is neutral, but the recent 326% rise over six months shows strong upward momentum. A breakout past $2.83 could pave the way toward the next resistance level at $3.24, reflecting potential gains of nearly 21%. The sentiment around altcoin season could further bolster XRP’s upward trajectory. Traders are optimistic, watching for movements past these resistance levels that may signal the start of another rally. TRX Poised for Potential Rebound Amidst Market Fluctuations TRON’s current price sits between $0.22 and $0.26. Despite recent drops, there’s hope. The Relative Strength Index is around 31, hinting it’s oversold. The MACD and Stochastic indicators also signal a potential upward shift. If TRX overcomes the $0.29 resistance, it could aim for $0.33. This move marks a possible gain of over 20%. Yet, strong support at $0.21 might stabilize prices if they fall. A 6-month rise of over 60% shows its resilience. Momentum may favor bulls soon, especially if broader market sentiment improves. Keep an eye out for a shift in trend. Conclusion XRP and TRX may offer limited short-term potential. Catzilla presents itself as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to everyone. With a 700% ROI potential during its presale, starting at $0.0002 and increasing to $0.0016 over 14 stages, it offers triple utility: governance, incentives, and staking options. The project invites people to acquire $CATZILLA tokens and join the battle against crypto villains.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As XRP targets $20 and Cardano rides bullish trends, Yeti Ouro is disrupting the Play-to-Earn market. Table of Contents XRP could take on $20 in 2025 ADA changes trends Yeti Ouro dominates P2E pace Market trends XRP aiming for $20 in 2025 along with Cardano’s (ADA) bullish trends has sparked a lot of interest in the market. Further, Yeti Ouro (YETIO) continues to reshape the landscape of Play-to-Earn (P2E) games. XRP could take on $20 in 2025 Last week XRP had an increase in its trading volumes which exceeded 80%, stirring up prices from $2.24 to peaks of $2.60. The price settled at around $2.50. With the SEC appeal deadline set for January 15, analysts suggest a potential conclusion of the legal battle and subsequent stepping down of SEC chair Gary Gensler could lead XRP to as high as $20 in 2025. ADA changes trends Cardano is attracting interest thanks to its technical and ecosystem developments. Developers have released several updates including new nodes as well as improvements to wallets and performance. Moreover, Cardano’s Hydra’s Doom tournament demonstrated its scalability mechanisms. The network value of ADA is also enriched by the growth of Total Value Locked in DeFi , which now exceeds $480 million. Off the chain, the recent landmark partnership of Cardano with FC Barcelona is indicative of their marketing strategies. Despite going below $1, bullish sentiments have returned, and the community and governance activities are looking optimistic for 2025. Yeti Ouro dominates P2E pace Yeti Ouro has been controversial as a new utility meme coin trying to establish itself in the market as a big player in the P2E space. In the middle of all of the market leaders, it is trying to grab investors attention. Its flagship game is Yeti Go, a racing game that runs on Unreal Engine. Players will be rewarded with YETIO tokens as a gift, making the gaming experience surreal. A big selling point for Yeti Ouro is that unlike most meme coins, it has a deflationary mechanism, making YETIO more exclusive. Yeti Ouro has also raised $1.599 million and it differentiates itself by giving out 10% tokens to players that refer new users that join their game. Yeti Ouro shifts focus towards player-driven growth. With its total issuance of 1 billion tokens of which 60% is to be issued for presale, this aims to stand out against the inflationary meme coins. Market trends Throughout 2025, shifts in the market will be guided by regulatory changes, sentiment within the investor community, and essential metrics driving token valuations. Yeti Ouro’s P2E model could capture new investors with high potential breakouts like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin while also trying to offer real-life use cases.

With mainstream appeal steadily rising on account of increased accessibility through Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) and a favorable political climate, the wider market went into a bull run in the last quarter of the year. However, in the midst of an uptrend, it’s easy to forget the utility side of things. Crypto payments have likewise experienced a noted surge. Per CoinGate ‘s crypto payments report 2024 published on January 14, stablecoins have seen the lion’s share of the gains — surpassing even Bitcoin as a method of payment, with Tether ( USDT ) leading the charge. In addition, the report showcased that BTC was dethroned as the most popular blockchain by the Tron ( TRX ) network and that 2024 saw a marked increase in the popularity of layer 2 solutions like the Lightning Network. Meanwhile, ETH seems to be losing influence, while Solana ( SOL ) is on the rise. The findings, based on the 1,677,288 transactions processed through the Lithuanian headquartered firm, reveal several interesting takeaways. Let’s take a closer look at the data. USDT dominates payments — but other assets are growing faster On the whole, transaction volume has increased by 29.6% over the course of the year. The most significant shift seen in 2024 is the fact that Tether has overtaken BTC to become the most popular cryptocurrency used for payments. Notably, USDT accounted for 34.6% of payments, while BTC was the preferred method for 22.8% of transactions. Popularity of cryptocurrency assets by volume. Source: CoinGate And that’s just Tether — once other stablecoins are factored in, the figure increases to 35.5% of all transactions. Taking a look solely at stablecoins, USDT dominates — accounting for 97.2% of transactions, with USD Coin ( USDC ) at a distant second at 2.5% and Dai ( DAI ) coming in at third place with just 0.3% of payments. However, USDC experienced the greatest growth — since the start of the year, usage has surged by 86.9%, driven primarily by its integration into the Solana network in May. As impressive as that is, it’s only fair to note that the trajectory of stablecoins, in general, has been positive — with payment usage more than doubling from 2022 when assets like these accounted for only 16% of total transactions. Chart depicting the growth of stablecoin transactions over the years. Source: CoinGate BTC and ETH lose ground while TRON and LN become more popular In contrast to the growth trajectory of stablecoins, mainline assets have become less popular as methods of payment. In 2023, Bitcoin accounted for 35.6% of payments — in 2024, its share experienced a sharp drop to 22.8%. Blockchain preferences seem to be changing as well. Last year, Ethereum’s share of total payments decreased by 1.7% — meanwhile, Solana, which saw a 56.4% increase in order volume between October and November, was propelled to become the 6th most preferred blockchain. However, the largest beneficiary seems to have been TRON, which has now surpassed Bitcoin and accounts for 31.5% of transactions. In the same timeframe, Litecoin ( LTC ) grew its share of payments from 9.5% to 13.1% Changes in blockchain popularity from 2022 to 2024. Source: CoinGate Finally, layer 2 solutions experienced significant growth in 2024. The Lightning Network (LN) saw a 39.1% increase in usage and now accounts for 15.4% of all payments made in Bitcoin. Even more impressively, Polygon marked a 135% uptick in transactions — while Arbitrum ( ARB ) saw adoption surge by 565% owing to the increased popularity of ETH and USDT payments. Stablecoins have cemented their place as a crucial part of the wider cryptocurrency ecosystem — while the shifts in blockchain preference point to a vibrant, dynamic space that is still focused on advancing scalability, efficiency, speed, and cost-effectiveness.

Among them, XRP, ADA, SHIB, and Yeti Ouro (YETIO) are considered promising assets that can show high results this year. All these tokens have various characteristics that include innovation in technology and a strong community, which enhances investor confidence. Cardano Price Prediction: A Platform For Scalability And Sustainability Cardano (ADA) remains one of the most promising and reliable altcoins in the market, which is constantly gaining popularity. It has always provided network enhancements while ensuring that it remains a scalable and efficient energy blockchain. Cardano also witnessed some whale movement recently, where large investors started to accumulate more than 40 million tokens in January 2025 alone. Furthermore, the collaboration with FC Barcelona and the development of the dApp ecosystem are proof of the foundation’s utilization. Analysts are positive about the ADA price rebound and highlight that the asset might gain some ground with ADA price at $0.93 . However, if the trend persists, Cardano may be on its way to potentially breaking towards the $3 range by the end of 2025. Source X XRP Price Prediction: A Comeback In Progress XRP is still one of the biggest cryptocurrencies, and the recent events have boosted the morale of the investors. With some of the legal hurdles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sorted out, XRP gained traction and breached important resistance levels. Analysts are also looking at higher prices in the daily chart as more bullish formations develop on XRP, with targets in the $3.50-$4 range. Whenever there is new collaboration, such as the one that has just been announced between Ripple and Chainlink for CCIP integration, investors are more confident. As of mid-January, XRP price is still hovering around $2.50 ; the next possible target could be the $3 mark. Experts predict a growth in demand for the token as the speculative interest rises, fueled by expectations of further rules and guidelines. Source X Shiba Inu Coin Price Prediction: The Meme Coin That Aims Higher Shiba Inu (SHIB), a popular memecoin, has not stopped growing and is now venturing into the expansion of its ecosystem. Recently, the Shiba Inu team revealed that it is launching a new token called TREAT, which is believed to add value to the ecosystem. The SHIB 2025 price predictions are $0.00004458 by June and $0.00009319 by July due to the Shibarium platform expansion. Although still a highly volatile asset, the SHIB community and token burning have played an important role in decreasing supply and increasing demand. Experts expect SHIB to remain relevant and even shed another zero this year as the market interest resumes. Source X Yeti Ouro (YETIO): A Rising Contender In The Crypto Space The Yeti Ouro presale is gaining traction as investors seek life-changing profits from the relatively new project. At the present moment, in the second stage of the presale, tokens cost $0.017, with exclusive deals and perks offered to early adopters. As of now, more than 126 million tokens have been sold in presale. As Yeti Ouro gears up for its exchange listing, early investors will be able to buy tokens at a relatively low price. To its credit, Yeti Ouro has an active ecosystem, which includes Yeti Go, a future P2E game that will be developed using Unreal Engine 5. Built on the Ethereum blockchain, YETIO has well-defined tokenomics that help in the sustainability of the project as the funds are set aside for staking rewards, marketing, and game development. The meme coin shares similarities with Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, but Yeti Ouro differs in that it has practical applications. This makes it worth investing in for 2025. With its increasing adoption and its highly enthusiastic and impressive presales, it is a formidable candidate for generating huge profits in the coming months.

Speaking during his keynote speech at the ICR Conference in Orlando, Saylor called on companies to buy Bitcoin and described the bonds as 'toxic.' Michael Saylor, the largest institutional Bitcoin holder, described the bonds as “toxic” and said that Bitcoin is a suitable investment vehicle for companies and that they should buy Bitcoin. Comparing the performance of Bitcoin and bonds since 2020, Saylor said that since MicroStrategy adopted the Bitcoin buying strategy, the value of Bitcoin has increased while the value of bonds has decreased. Saylor, who recommended that companies buy BTC in the face of this difference, outlined the options for companies: continue with traditional practices such as purchasing U.S. Treasury bonds and conducting buybacks and dividends, or innovate by adding Bitcoin to their investment portfolios. Saylor's statements come after MicroStrategy bought Bitcoin for 10 consecutive weeks, while Saylor also criticized companies like Microsoft and Nvidia for not following MicroStrategy's Bitcoin strategy. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As the crypto market surges, Catzilla, Pepe, and Solana offer unique investment opportunities for bold investors. Table of Contents Catzilla: Transforming meme coins with purpose Pepe poised for a price breakout Solana’s surging back potential despite recent dips Conclusion Cryptocurrency markets are experiencing a thrilling wave of unpredictability. As the bull run gains momentum, a trio of digital currencies is capturing widespread attention. Their rapid price swings have caught the eye of investors and enthusiasts. This momentum hints at a new chapter in the crypto saga, offering potential opportunities and challenges for those daring enough to engage. Catzilla: Transforming meme coins with purpose Catzilla is not just another meme coin, it’s a DeFi superhero on a mission to disrupt shady practices and unlock financial opportunities for everyone. Built on a foundation of innovation and a passionate community, Catzilla unites crypto enthusiasts, meme lovers, and investors in a shared pursuit of growth and fairness.

You might also like: BTC nears $100k, while Catzilla gains attention with explosive 1000x growth potential Pepe poised for a price breakout Pepe is trading between $0.00001579 and $0.00002055, and it’s gaining attention. The strong support level at $0.00001382 means there could be upward movement soon. If it breaks the nearest resistance at $0.00002335, a rise to around $0.00002812 is possible. This jump would mark an impressive increase. Pepe is above the 10-day moving average but still below the 100-day average, showing mixed signals. However, sentiment is turning bullish with the wider market. If momentum builds, we could see Pepe make a substantial move up. Keep a close watch on these resistance levels; breaching them could signal a strong rally for this coin. Solana’s surging back potential despite recent dips Solana’s price currently ranges between $172.62 and $213.70, after a recent dip. It showcases potential growth, driven by its tech advancements and community backing. The nearest resistance level is set at $238, suggesting a rise is possible. Despite a short-term dip of more than 16% over a week, Solana has gained roughly 17% through the past 6 months. Its Relative Strength Index stands at 52.01, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. The Stochastic at 92.74 hints at potential future growth. The next target is breaking the $238 resistance, aiming potentially for the second resistance at $280 if bullish momentum continues. Conclusion Despite PEPE and SOL’s volatility, they may offer less short-term potential. Catzilla, the meme coin hero, aims to bring financial freedom to all. Offering huge ROI during its presale from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages, it provides governance features, loyalty rewards, and staking options. Catzilla unites crypto enthusiasts, meme fans, and anime lovers to dismantle toxic systems and reach new heights.

However, the digital asset is also yet to recover from its seven-day decline, which currently sits at around 13% at the time of this publication. SHIBA INU is also up 2.42% in the last 24 hours, reducing its seven-day decline to 12.08%. PEPE, the first frog-inspired memecoin, is up 2% on the day but is struggling to recover from a 17% dip registered over the last week. BONK and FLOKI are up 3.77% and 2.94%, while WIF and BRETT register 2.38% and 3.56% gains. The sudden surge in activity among the top memecoins comes amid growing concerns over the current uncertainty in the broader global markets and the selloff in digital assets. The crypto market sank into the red over the weekend as Bitcoin and Ethereum slid below $95K and $32K, respectively. Bitcoin is trading at $95,483 but has dipped by more than 6% in the last seven days, while Ethereum sits at a double-digit seven-day decline of 13.27% and is exchanging hands for $3,183 at the time of this writing. Data from CoinGecko shows that the crypto market capitalization has largely remained unchanged and currently sits at $3.442 trillion. The industry’s 24-hour trading volume also settled at $205 billion. Cryptocurrency market stumbles amid ongoing uncertainty in Fed rate decisions According to a recent Bloomberg report, the crypto market seems to be struggling due to headwinds from macroeconomic factors. The report highlighted that the crypto meltdown arose due to uncertainty around the Federal Reserve ‘s next policy changes. The Fed cut interest rates in December by 25 basis points. However, Fed chair Jerome Powell has continuously given hints that the central bank will take its foot off the gas pedal for further interest rate cuts. According to his last press briefing, Powell indicated that the U.S. central bank will adopt a more hawkish stance this year due to the increased risks of a possible rise in inflation. According to data from Sosovalue, a U.S. spot ETF tracking website, approved Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded $284.19 million in negative flows on January 13. The outflows marked a three-day streak of negative flows from the ETFs that began on January 8. In the meantime, crypto critics have continued to pile on the crypto industry. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says Bitcoin is “a Ponzi scheme” that “has no intrinsic value.” Despite the ongoing crypto turmoil, investors are still bullish on digital assets in the long run. Michael Saylor announced on January 13 that his company, Microstrategy added 2,530 Bitcoins to its books for $243 million at an average price of $95K per Bitcoin. The company still retains its title as the largest Bitcoin corporate holder worldwide, with 450,000 BTC in its books according to Bitcoin Treasuries.

On Monday, bitcoin fell below $90,000, while it is above $96,500 on Tuesday, up over 8% . Bitcoin bull Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat, told CNBC on Monday that he sees this current correction in bitcoin as normal. ""Bitcoin is down 15% from its highs for a volatile asset, which is a normal correction,"" he said. Glassnode data shows that bitcoin in this current cycle has seen relatively mild drawdowns of around 15%-20%, much smaller than previous bull market drawdowns, which saw as much as 30%-50% drawdowns, showing the asset is becoming more mature. According to Lee, $70,000 is a line in the sand, which is a strong support level. They refer to a methodology called Fibonacci levels, or retracement periods, essentially where bitcoin pulls back from where it started its rally. Lee also believes the $50,000 level can be tested if the prior $70,000 levels do not hold. Common Fibonacci levels from the all-time high that analysts look for are 23.6%, 38.2%, 50% and 61.8% Despite a short-term correction, Lee still thinks bitcoin will be one of the standout assets for 2025 and remains bullish on end-of-year targets of $200,000 to $250,000.",Markets|Fundstrat|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-14 12:07:05

The cryptocurrency, once caught in a major slump, has climbed 8% in the last few days. That’s promising, right? But the road ahead isn’t exactly smooth. Resistance levels and weak market inflows are still holding it back. Let’s dive into what’s happening and why it matters. A Glimpse of HYPE For the first time in a while, HYPE’s technical indicators are hinting at a potential reversal. The MACD has turned bullish. In simpler terms, HyperLiquid shows growing momentum that could push prices higher—if enough buyers join in. But here’s the thing: investor confidence is still shaky. Source : Tradingview The Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which tracks capital moving in and out, is below zero. That’s a red flag. Without stronger inflows, any recovery could fizzle out before it gains real traction. Source : Tradingview Even with its recent recovery, HYPE remains at a crossroads. Prices are hovering above the $19.47 support level, but they need to break past $23.20 to convince investors of a sustained rally. Resistance Levels Could Make or Break the Rally Here’s the catch. If HYPE can’t breach the $23.20 resistance level soon, it risks falling back to its $19.47 support. And that’s dangerous. Losing this level might wipe out what little confidence investors have left, making further declines more likely. On the flip side, flipping $23.20 into a solid support could trigger a run toward $29.85. But without new inflows or more active participation from investors, that dream might remain out of reach. What to Expect HYPE’s recovery isn’t just about charts or percentages. It’s about trust. Investors need to see real momentum backed by capital inflows before they dive back in. Until then, progress will be slow. The technical signs are there, but they’re not enough on their own. Stronger market support is essential. If HyperLiquid can’t attract it, the current gains could quickly disappear.",Price Analysis|Altcoins,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-14 12:20:11

Here’s why,https://timestabloid.com/john-deaton-says-no-chart-in-crypto-is-more-bullish-looking-than-xrp/,"A recent post by prominent attorney and pro-crypto advocate John Deaton on X highlights growing optimism within the XRP community. Deaton responded to a prediction by Cointelegraph that XRP could experience a 60% surge, potentially reaching $4, a new all-time high. This prediction follows Ripple’s legal victory, allowing the sealing of sensitive documents in its prolonged case with the SEC. Deaton noted that he is not a huge believer in technical analysis, but analysts say no chart is more bullish than XRP. This highlights XRP’s unique position. The digital asset has been building momentum for years, and many experts believe a massive surge could occur in its immediate future. Deaton’s post also included a hypothetical scenario that captured the excitement of XRP’s supporters. He described Ripple CTO David Schwartz, also known as JoelKatz, performing a playful rendition of LL Cool J’s “Mama Said Knock You Out.” The attorney highlighted the line, “Don’t call it a comeback, I’ve been here for years…” While many have claimed XRP will not succeed, people like Deaton have always seen its potential, and this line suggests that when XRP breaks out, it won’t be a comeback, the asset will just be taking its rightful place at the top as the community always knew it could. I’m not a TA but I keep hearing no chart in crypto is more bullish looking than XRP. A 60% would be a $4 XRP – an ATH. If that happens, I see a vision: @JoelKatz on stage rapping @llcoolj ’s Mama Said Knock You Out: “Don’t call it a comeback, I’ve been here for years….” https://t.co/p7cn6zCXLh — John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) January 13, 2025 XRP Getting Ready to Break Records XRP has been on a historic run, and the huge potential it has shown has converted skeptics like Peter Brandt. Brandt initially criticized and shamed XRP supporters, but has now become a prominent supporter of the digital asset, recently calling its chart the most powerful in the crypto world. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The prediction of a 60% surge in XRP’s value reflects the optimism of analysts and community members. Deaton’s remarks also align with broader positive sentiment regarding Ripple’s position in the cryptocurrency market. Ripple’s legal momentum, combined with its ongoing efforts to expand XRP utility through cross-border payment solutions, positions the asset for potential growth. Reaching a new all-time high at $4 would signal a significant milestone, reaffirming XRP’s status as a leading digital asset. XRP has already demonstrated its potential by recovering from significant setbacks during the lawsuit and solidifying its place among the leading cryptocurrencies. In December, it climbed to its highest level since 2018, and many in the community are confident that 2025 will be the year the digital asset creates a new all-time high .

The Switzerland-based digital asset bank hit a valuation north of $1 billion after pulling in $58 million in an equity funding round. Fulgur Ventures, a Bitcoin-focused venture capital firm, led the charge, with further support from new and existing investors. Even Sygnum’s own team members threw their hats in the ring. This milestone follows a $41 million funding round in 2024, which set the bank’s valuation at $850 million. The crypto boom—fueled by Bitcoin ETFs and prospective crypto-friendly policies under Donald Trump—helped Sygnum capitalize on a thriving market. By the third quarter, trading revenues for crypto, FX, and securities had already blown past both 2022 and 2023 figures combined. Sygnum’s record-breaking growth in 2024 Sygnum’s growth numbers are hard to ignore. Annual trades surged by more than 1,000% year-over-year, thanks to partnerships with Swiss banking giants like PostFinance and over 20 other institutions on its B2B platform. The bank also manages more than $5 billion in client assets. “Last year was a watershed moment,” said Mathias Imbach, Sygnum’s Co-Founder and Group CEO. “The approval of Bitcoin ETFs marked a critical convergence of traditional finance and decentralized infrastructure.” But it wasn’t just about trades. Sygnum’s crypto derivatives trading surged by 500%, while loan volumes jumped 360%. The funding boost is set to power the bank’s expansion plans for Europe and Hong Kong in 2025. The bank started 2024 strong, announcing a $40 million raise in January that pushed its valuation to $900 million. By midyear, the bank hit another milestone—profitability. H1 2024 saw client assets grow to $4.5 billion, driven by explosive trading activity and strategic partnerships. In July, the bank launched Sygnum Connect, a 24/7 multi-asset settlement network. This platform lets institutional players settle trades anytime, without waiting for traditional banking hours. Big names like AsiaNext and Hidden Road are already on board. By December, the bank closed out the year with a bang. It inked a partnership with Bergos, a Swiss private bank, to enhance service offerings. This collaboration will reportedly bring even more institutional clients into the crypto fold.

Now stabilized above $2.40 and now launched its $RLUSD stablecoin, investors anticipate further growth for the XRP price. In the midst of a positive Ripple (XRP) market, savvy investors are exploring low-cap gems with equal or more growth potential than Ripple coin. As a result, many are stumbling upon Lunex Network , as it positions itself as a solid DeFi contender with robust features including a multichain DEX, designed to allow wide interoperability over 40 blockchain networks. Ripple Coin Shows Bullish Strength By Surges By Over 10% In The Past Week Having progressed by over $2 from a lower range around $0.5 in October 2024, it’s safe to say Ripple (XRP) has held itself strongly and also rode the bullish wave excellently this market cycle. Although its price has fallen by over 3% what where it was in the past month, XRP token has risen by over 11% in the past week, climbing over the $2.40 range. Several crypto analysts are already bullish on Ripple due to the latest launch of its stablecoin, $RLUSD, which is poised to increase liquidity on the Ripple network. SirRobArtll1, anonymous crypto analyst, highlighted the possibility of Ripple coin hitting $4 very soon. Another analyst, Mr Xoom discussed the growth potential of Ripple on X (formerly Twitter), where he highlighted that Ripple price will potentially hit a target of $6 or $7 by the end of January. Investors are generally confident that Ripple coin can break higher levels this year as Bitcoin continues to rise this year, presenting it as a top crypto to buy this year. Lunex Network Poised To Surpass Some Of The Top DeFi Platforms This Year The Lunex Network (LNEX) has shown that it has the strength needed to transverse through the DeFi market successfully. Given its non-custodial and multi-chain DEX, which comes with extra features that will allow it challenge the likes of Binance (BNB). With additional cheaper transactional rate, surplus liquidity, B2B payment gateway and a Portfolio Tracker, this new DeFi platform is slated to dominate a considerable size of the DeFi market. Its unique B2B payment gateway tackles the issues that merchants face with cross-border payments, so Lunex Network enables merchants to accept crypto as payment worldwide. Moreover, its DEX protocol allows users to trade over 50,000 cryptocurrencies pairs across up to 40 or more blockchain networks while also allowing users to store their assets in a safe, secure and transaction wallet. With regular market insights that come from its Portfolio Tracker, the platform also allows users to manage their assets strategically. As the DeFi market grows, Lunex Network is poised to skyrocket its growth especially as it continues to gain traction. To top it all, its native token is built with a deflationary nature which automatically generates more value through its reduction in supply. The LNEX is currently sold for $0.0054 after rising over 350% from $0.0012 to accumulate over $6.2 million in presale revenue. Its projected massive rise after its presale has also added to its value as a top crypto to buy. Is Ripple A Tough Challenge For Lunex Network to Surpass? Ripple has already established its dominance in the DeFi market and with its $RLUSD stablecoin launch, it serves as a befitting challenge for Lunex Network. However, Lunex’s innovative DeFi features and rapid presale success could help it carve out a surpass Ripple easily if its momentum spikes.

Now, a new project, Remittix (RTX), is gaining traction, with experts drawing comparisons to Solana’s early days due to its massive potential in the lucrative cross-border payments sector. Solana Sets New Benchmark For Scalability Solana’s (SOL) price trajectory looks unclear going into 2025, as the asset experienced a 19.9% dip in the last month, though Solana’s ecosystem continues to experience significant growth with several new updates. Solana’s efforts in this domain were focused on the release of the Firedancer validator client in 2024, which saw Solana ramp up its network throughput and trading efficiency. From this update, Solana added priority fees along with QUIC to tackle congestion issues that had long frustrated Solana (SOL) users. These changes have seen Solana (SOL) set a new benchmark for scalability in the crypto space. Currently, Solana is trading at $177.25 following a 17% weekly decrease. Despite this decline SOL investors remain bullish and Solana’s daily trading volume has remained steady above $2 billion. Remittix Presale Nears Significant Milestone Of $3 Million Raised As Solana continues to pursue scalability, Remittix (RTX) targets inefficiencies plaguing the $250 trillion global cross-border payments industry. Combining blockchain with fiat systems, Remittix provides a secure and easy way for individuals and businesses to transfer money worldwide. The platform can change more than 40 cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies with ease, and allows users to send money directly to bank accounts worldwide. Instead of complicated, hidden fees and long delays, Remittix (TRX) charges a flat fee and makes instant payments, creating a pleasant user experience. For businesses, the Remittix Pay API facilitates crypto payment acceptance and fiat settlement, empowering merchants to operate in the digital economy without technical complexities. Additionally, companies can manage crypto-to-fiat conversions in over 30 fiat currencies and over 50 cryptocurrency pairs, providing flexibility and control over transactions. Central to the Remittix ecosystem is the intelligently designed RTX token, which powers governance, staking, and rewards within the Remittix ecosystem. With a limited supply of 1.5 billion tokens, demand is quickly rising as investors begin to recognize this project’s disruptive potential in the global payments sector. Remittix Is Poised To Dominate The PayFi Market Remittix is racking up major attention in presale, with tokens available to early adopters at an enticing price of just $0.0199, especially seeing as the RTX launch price has been confirmed at a minimum of $0.135. The presale has already raised $2.7 million and shows no signs of losing momentum. With its innovative approach to cross-border payments and strong market momentum, analysts are projecting an explosive 5000% rally once the token hits major exchanges later in 2025.

Speaking at an event on January 13, Shinawatra emphasized the untapped potential of crypto-backed tokens and gambling revenue, urging Thai regulators to take swift action. Highlighting the stability of asset-backed tokens, Shinawatra stated there’s “no risk” in allowing the trade of stablecoins. He proposed piloting crypto payments in Phuket, citing its potential to enhance financial inclusivity and streamline transactions. Meanwhile, his call to regulate and tax online gambling underscored a missed opportunity to generate nearly $4 billion in annual tax revenue. Shinawatra argued that a controlled ecosystem with a passport-like monitoring system could formalize the industry and curb illegal gambling activities, which currently involve millions of users and massive financial flows. Thailand Takes Steps Toward Legalization Shinawatra’s recommendations come amid a significant regulatory shift in Thailand . The Thai cabinet recently approved the Entertainment Complex Business Act, a draft law aimed at legalizing casinos and taxing the underground gambling industry. Inspired by Singapore’s success in integrating legalized gambling into its economy, current Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra—Thaksin’s daughter—sees the move as a way to enhance tourism and economic output. The House of Representatives must still sign the bill into law, with no definitive timeline announced. If passed, the legislation would position Thailand as a regional hub for regulated entertainment and gaming industries. Stablecoins and CBDCs: A Path Forward? Thaksin Shinawatra’s support for stablecoins aligns with Thailand’s growing interest in digital payments. He urged the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to facilitate stablecoin trading, describing it as an essential step toward modernizing the economy. Thailand has already taken strides in digital finance. In July 2024, the government distributed $13.8 billion in digital money to 45 million citizens as part of a social benefits program. Earlier that year, the Bank of Thailand completed a pilot project for a retail CBDC , though it has no immediate plans for official issuance.

This decision follows years of tension between the regulator and the crypto sector over the lack of clear guidelines. Judicial Rebuke In its ruling , delivered on January 13, the court criticized the SEC’s approach, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and demanding the agency clarify its stance on regulations for digital assets. “Because we believe the SEC’s order was conclusory and insufficiently reasoned, and thus arbitrary and capricious, we grant Coinbase’s petition in part and remand to the SEC for a more complete explanation,” the order read. However, the three-judge bench stopped short of asking the financial watchdog to create new rules for the sector, instead emphasizing the importance of transparency. Judge Thomas Ambro, who wrote the opinion, stated that government agencies such as the SEC could be forced to create rules only when the delay “endangered human lives.” In his opinion, the need for crypto-related regulations had not met that threshold. Judge Stephanos Bibas, the only Republican on the panel, added that the financial watchdog needed to explain why it had not made rules for the crypto industry. He said that while rules may not be necessary to solve the issues affecting virtual currencies, the SEC must clearly state its position on the assets. Further, he urged the commission not to give “another poor explanation” when tackling the Coinbase question, pointing out that it already had a long history of providing ambiguous answers. Coinbase Responds Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, hailed the decision, noting the court’s recognition of the SEC’s insufficient reasoning. He also applauded Judge Bibas’ highlighting of “looming constitutional concerns” that could come with the retroactive enforcement of regulations without clear guidance. The exchange’s CEO, Brian Armstrong, also had a say, expressing gratitude for the judiciary’s role in upholding constitutional values. In a social media post , he remarked on the enduring damage caused by regulatory uncertainty, stressing the importance of maintaining freedoms that prevent government overreach. The ruling comes less than a week before SEC Chair Gary Gensler is due to step down . While his regulation by enforcement strategy made him deeply unpopular in crypto cycles, Gensler insisted severally that he would not change his approach towards policing the industry. His departure coincides with the Donald Trump administration coming into office. The president-elect has signaled a shift towards more lenient crypto laws under Paul Atkins, his pick for the SEC top spot.

Alan Santana stated that SOL’s technical setup “is screaming bullish,” noting that the asset has been trading within a consolidation range for 300 days, which he considers a strong foundation for the next major rally, according to his TradingView post on January 13. Solana price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Santana observed that Solana exhibited a bullish bias during this consolidation, with price action clustering near resistance levels. Additionally, SOL has maintained its price above the 200-day moving average ( MA ), which aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level, reinforcing its role as a critical support zone. Key SOL price targets to watch Santana summed up by stating that investors should not be surprised if the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) asset rallies further, as a decisive breakout above the upper boundary of the long-standing sideways channel has already occurred, signalling an upward trajectory. The analyst projects Solana could hit $300 in the near term and potentially $400 by May. “No need to scream, no need to cry no need to be surprised. There is no need to be surprised if Solana starts trading above $300 in a matter of months. No surprises is Solana goes above $400 before or near to May. No surprises here, all growth is welcomed,” the expert said. This optimistic outlook comes as Solana’s bulls and bears tussle for control. To this end, an analysis by RLinda on January 14 observed that Solana was testing a critical downtrend boundary near $185 amid a corrective phase. Solana price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Bulls are aggressively defending the $178 to $180 support zone to prevent further declines, with $203 and $218 identified as key resistance levels. A breakout above $203 could ignite bullish momentum, while a drop below $178 might lead to further losses toward $170. The possibility of a downward trajectory was also echoed by prominent cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez who emphasized the importance of the $180 support zone. In his January 9 analysis, Martinez cautioned that a breakdown below $180 could result in a downward push toward $150 or even $130. Solana price analysis As of press time, Solana was trading at $187, gaining 6% in the last 24 hours. However, on the weekly chart, SOL remains weighed down by overall market sentiment, having plunged over 12% in the period. Solana seven-day price chart. Source: Finbold Solana’s trajectory remains uncertain and will likely be dictated by broader cryptocurrency market trends. With moderate volatility of 6.32%, price fluctuations are expected, though nothing extreme. Solana’s 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at $211.95 is above its current price, indicating a short-term downward trend. However, its 200-day SMA at $172.22 remains below, indicating a longer-term upward trajectory. The 14-day Relative Strength Index ( RSI ) sits at 41.71, placing SOL in a neutral position. This suggests potential movement in either direction as the market struggles to sustain recent gains. Overall, as the cryptocurrency market remains on the edge, SOL’s ability to rally now shifts to the possible impact of Donald Trump inauguration on January 20, whose election win is considered bullish for digital assets.

The subsequent rally has brought the asset near the upper boundary at $2.5, a significant dynamic resistance level. If it breaks above this boundary, bullish momentum is expected to increase, potentially driving the price toward the $3 resistance zone, a crucial psychological and technical level. The coming days will be pivotal, as the price action near $2.5 will dictate Ripple’s short-term trajectory. A successful breakout could set the stage for a sustained bullish trend. The 4-Hour Chart XRP’s bullish market structure is evident in the lower timeframe, with the price forming higher highs and higher lows. Strong buying activity near the 0.5-0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels has fueled this upward movement. Despite the steady rally, Ripple remains trapped within the $2-$3 range, with a breakout required for a fresh trend. The price is expected to climb toward the $3 threshold, a level critical for validating the bullish continuation. However, consolidation within this range is likely to persist without a breakout.

However, the 200-day MA, acting as the buyers’ last defense, still holds, offering hope for a potential rebound. Technical Analysis By Shayan The Daily Chart ETH recently broke below the significant 100-day MA at $3.1K, signaling the sellers’ growing dominance. This breakdown points to a potential test of the $3K support region, a critical juncture aligned with the 200-day MA. Currently, Ethereum is finding temporary support at this level, with a modest bullish reversal hinting at demand from buyers. The 200-day MA serves as the primary defensive line for bulls, and its ability to hold will determine the short-term trajectory. A breakdown below this level could trigger a mid-term bearish trend, targeting the $2.5K support zone. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, ETH saw consolidation near the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level ($3.2K) before sellers overwhelmed the market, breaking below this critical support. This triggered a wave of long liquidations, driving the price toward the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level at $3K. This region is pivotal, as it represents the last major support zone for buyers. A sustained breach below this level could lead to a cascade of liquidations, driving the price toward the $2.5K target. However, Ethereum appears to be consolidating around this juncture, with a potential battle between buyers and sellers unfolding. Onchain Analysis By Shayan Ethereum is testing the critical $3K support region, with sellers exerting pressure to reclaim control. Insights from the Taker Buy Sell Ratio provide a glimpse into market sentiment and potential direction. Upon reaching the $3K support region, the Taker Buy Sell Ratio initially surged, reflecting increased buying power and a defensive stance by buyers. However, this trend was short-lived as a subsequent sell-off coincided with a bearish reversal in the metric. Since then, the ratio has steadily declined, signaling a growing dominance of sellers in the market. If this trend persists, the likelihood of a breakdown below the $3K threshold increases. Such a scenario would likely lead to heightened selling activity, pushing ETH toward the $2.5K support level. Conversely, a reversal in the ratio could indicate renewed buyer interest, stabilizing the price at this critical juncture.

The rally was fueled by heightened trading activity, with its daily volume jumping 33% over the past day to $646 million. The altcoin was also trending on CoinGecko. This surge coincided with the overall crypto market recovering from a recent downturn , adding further momentum to AI16Z’s price movement. AI16Z rallied after the project’s founder, Shaw, shared details about the version 2 update to Eliza, the operating system powering the Agentic AI platform Eliza. The update will reportedly deliver a suite of advanced features, including full autonomy for seamless operation, unified wallet abstraction for streamlined asset management, and a sophisticated plugin registry to support diverse integrations. The rally further gained strength after the official technical whitepaper for Eliza was released on Jan. 14. Meanwhile, demand for the AI-powered meme coin has increased among derivative traders. According to data from CoinGlass, the open interest in the AI16Z futures market rose by 10% over the past day to $193.9 million at the time of writing. Whale investors, capitalizing on the recent AI Agentic hype, have also shifted their focus to AI16Z. According to an X post by Lookonchain, a whale recently withdrew 5.64 million AI16Z tokens, valued at $6.37 million, from the centralized exchange Gate.io. This whale now holds a total of 15.95 million AI16Z tokens, worth approximately $17.86 million. Meanwhile, smart money investors have reportedly started accumulating the token as well. See below.

ADA could maybe reach $10, PEPETO might jump 50 times in value and XRP’s price may rise quickly. Next year could be very important for people who invest. PEPETO: A Fresh Path in Meme Coins PEPETO steps into the busy meme coin scene with a fun style and solid features. Right now during its presale, each token costs only $0.000000104 ‒ already raising over $3.4 million. PEPETO stands ready for a big 50x jump by offering new things like no-fee trading and easy swaps between different blockchains ‒ making it more useful and setting it up for steady growth.

Every milestone has been achieved, and the… pic.twitter.com/zCmy1bTRQY — Pepeto (@Pepetocoin) January 1, 2025 Cardano (ADA): Ready for Big Growth Cardano stays strong in the crypto market ‒ it uses scientific methods and has a solid plan for growing. ADA wants to reach $10 ‒ this big jump is backed by its ongoing progress like making things work faster and adding real-world uses with smart contracts. Cardano dreams of safer and bigger blockchains ‒ this vision attracts big investors who might push its price higher as these plans become real. Ripple (XRP): Preparing for an Upward Surge XRP moves through tricky rules and market changes. With a loyal group of supporters and new updates in Ripple’s payment system, XRP looks set to rise. More banks and financial groups around the globe are using Ripple’s payment tools ‒ which might greatly lift XRP’s use and worth ‒ leading to upward trends by 2025. Studying Market Patterns These guesses for ADA, PEPETO and XRP are not just guesses ‒ they rely on now market patterns, tech progress and more big companies using them. ADA’s price goal of $10 shows trust in its big platform growth and more use in decentralized finance (DeFi). PEPETO’s possible 50x jump shows the rising pattern of investors rushing to tokens that give both a fun story and real use ‒ making it one to watch for those seeking very high gains on new coins. XRP’s expected bull run depends on good results from ongoing rule talks and its growing fit into global pay systems ‒ promising very big returns for early buyers. Conclusion Looking ahead to 2025 ‒ ADA, PEPETO and XRP shine brightly in their own areas. Each one gives special opportunities to both experienced and new investors. ADA’s climb to $10 would firmly place it as a top platform for smart contracts and dApps. PEPETO ‒ with its huge growth potential ‒ invites investors to join its path in changing the meme coin market. XRP ‒ hoping for a big rise ‒ wants to change cross-border transactions even more. To stay ahead in these thrilling changes ‒ and maybe gain big benefits ‒ think about joining the PEPETO wave early and visit PEPETO’s official website.

Among the trending ones, one crypto really stands out – Rollblock. This fresh project is already pulling in investors from big names like Shiba Inu and Solana, and they’re jumping in for a reason. Why? It’s all about those long-term gains and stability that Rollblock promises. Could Rollblock be the game-changer for long-term investors? Is this the project that finally blends real utility with lasting value? Let’s find out. Rollblock is Trending Crypto with Promising Tech While Shiba Inu and Solana are facing tough times, Rollblock is telling a completely different story. This new crypto is on a serious growth streak, with new registrations surging by over 600% in December. What’s fueling this buzz? Rollblock aims to shake up the massive $540B gambling industry by solving long-standing issues like fraud and trust. By using Ethereum’s solid blockchain infrastructure, the platform ensures transparency and security, two things gamblers and investors care about a lot. With over 7000 games to play, Rollblock offers a world of options. Whether you love spinning the roulette wheel, hitting the slots, or trying out virtual reality betting, you’ll find something exciting here. The sportsbook is also making waves, already pulling in $1.75M in wagers last month. Clearly, Rollblock isn’t here to play around – it’s here to lead. And we can’t ignore the platform’s native token, RBLK, which uses a smart deflationary model. A huge 60% of revenue goes into buying back tokens, which are instantly burned to reduce supply and boost demand. With its current price at $0.045 and over $8.5M raised in presale, Rollblock has already given early investors massive returns of 500%. Shiba Inu Investors are Jumping Ship as the Coin Goes Down Shiba Inu has been struggling lately, dropping 26% in the last 30 days and continuing its decline with an 18% weekly loss. With this downtrend, many investors are starting to look for new opportunities. While some hold on to the belief that SHIB will bounce back at some point, the reality is that, for long-term momentum, it’s not exactly a solid pick right now. That’s where Rollblock comes into play. Solana’s Recovery is Slow, but There are Signals for Growth Solana (SOL) has been taking a hit, dropping 20% іn the last month and 17% іn the past week. It’s tough out there for a lot оf cryptos and SOL’s nо exception. But here’s the thing: Even though Solana’s struggling, there are some signs оf life showing up. It’s still early, but if these signs continue, we might see a recovery. So, for investors, this could be the moment to take another look at SOL. Let’s see if it picks up momentum! Conclusion In a market where SHIB and SOL are struggling, Rollblock is stepping up with a game-changing approach. While meme coins like SHIB face tough times, and Solana shows slow recovery, Rollblock’s growth is unreal – its innovative tech and skyrocketing interest are hard to ignore. Investors from SHIB and Solana are jumping ship for a reason: Rollblock, a trending crypto, is creating a path to long-term gains. Don’t wait too long – Rollblock’s presale is happening just this once. Discover the exciting opportunities of the Rollblock (RBLK) presale today!

Semler joins a growing list of companies hoarding Bitcoin in recent years. Semler Expands Bitcoin Bag To 2,321 BTC Semler purchased 237 Bitcoin at an average price of $98,267 from December 16, 2024, to January 10, 2025, as per a disclosure on Monday. After the latest purchase, the Santa Clara, California-based firm now boasts holdings of 2,321 Bitcoin, valued at more than $221 million at market current prices. Its BTC treasury stash places it 13th among publicly traded companies, according to BitcoinTreasuries.com. Semler’s total holdings of 2,321 BTC were purchased for $191.9 million, or an average price of $82,687 per Bitcoin. Semler issues shares of common stock to buy Bitcoin, and has now adopted “Bitcoin Yield” as a key performance indicator. Specifically, the BTC yield measures the ratio of BTC holdings to outstanding shares and describes how well a firm does in buying Bitcoin in an accretive manner to shareholders. The BTC purchases brought the stock’s Bitcoin yield to 99.3% up from 72.6%, the company said. Publicly Traded Companies And Bitcoin Semler Scientific first adopted its Bitcoin treasury strategy back in May 2024 when the company said it was convinced that Bitcoin had “the potential to generate outsized returns as it gains increasing acceptance as digital gold.” On Nov. 4, Semler CEO Doug Murphy-Chutorian said the medical technology company is “laser-focused on acquiring and holding Bitcoin.” Murphy-Chutorian also revealed that the firm was considering financing opportunities that could allow it to purchase more BTC. Semler’s move follows several firms pursuing similar strategies. MicroStrategy currently owns the biggest corporate BTC treasury with a whopping 450,000 coins under its belt (valued at over $43.4 billion). Japan’s answer to MicroStrategy, Metaplanet , has also been actively buying up Bitcoin.

In 2026, it will range between $0.5404 and $0.6531, with an average price of $0.5558. In 2030, it will range between $2.21 and $2.73, with an average price of $2.29. Algorand’s capabilities make it an interesting prospect for investors and developers interested in smart contracts and blockchain interoperability. A 2019 video featured Gary Gensler, Securities and Exchange Commission chair, referring to Algorand as a great technology and using it as an example when discussing the decentralization of cryptocurrencies. Will ALGO go up? Can it reach $10? Where will ALGO be in 5 years? We explore these and more in our Cryptopolitan price prediction.

Algorand’s total value locked (TVL), the amount of funds locked up by an ecosystem’s decentralized applications has been bearish as users withdrew their assets from the protocol.

Per our technical indicators, ALGO’s price trend is bearish and the fear and greed index shows greed among investors. Data analysis shows that activity on decentralized finance applications is dropping. Why is ALGO down? ALGO is correcting from previous highs set in the last quarter of 2024, the drop could be attributed to the crypto market’s general bearish sentiment which saw its market cap drop below $3.2 trillion. Will ALGO reach $1? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, ALGO will break above $1 in the period ending 2028. Will ALGO reach $10? Per our Cryptopolitan price prediction, it remains highly unlikely for ALGO to break above $10 in the period ending 2030. Will ALGO reach $100? At $100, Algorand market capitalization has to rise above $700 billion from the current $1.2 billion. In comparison, Ethereum’s market capitalization is at $400 billion. Per our price prediction, Algorancd is highly unlikely to reach $100. Does ALGO have a good long-term future? Like most mega-altcoins, Algorand is trading at its lowest level this year. A break below 30 RSI will be crucial to sending it to previous highs. Looking ahead, ALGO will register new all-time highs in the coming years. Is ALGO a good investment? Analysis by Intotheblock shows that 97% of holders are at a loss at the current price. The figure will likely drop lower in the short term. However, as our Cryptopolitan price prediction shows, this will change over the long term. Recent news The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) now offers blockchain education training to 24,000 personnel worldwide, including UNDP, UN Volunteers, and the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF). The training for the academy is in partnership with the Algorand Foundation , an organization focused on enabling an inclusive, decentralized, and borderless global economy.

Algorand historic price sentiment Algorand price history: Coinstats Algorand held its token sale in June 2019 at $2.4 each. Union Square Ventures, Lemniscap, and NGC Ventures, among others, held earlier funding rounds. The public sale raised $60.40 million while funding rounds raised $66 million. Token sale participants who held their tokens since launch are down 90%. Binance listed ALGO on 21 June 2019. According to Coinmarketcap data, it pumped after the listing to reach its all-time high (ATH) at $3.28. ALGO later crashed; four months later, it was down 90% from ATH. In July 2021, Coinbase listed ALGO. As a result, it gradually recovered and peaked at $0.637 in August. In retrospect, 2021 was the golden year for the crypto market. The emergence of NFTs, DeFi growth, and institutional interest drove growth. So, in 2021, it rose from a low of $0.32 in January to $2.3 in October, a 200% gain. Nothing prepared crypto enthusiasts for the 2023 crypto winter, which worsened with the FTX crash. The year closed with ALGO trading at $0.23. The decline continued through 2023, registering an all-time low at $0.0876 in September. The market’s recovery began in October. By the end of the year, it had risen above $0.2. It now trades at $0.13. It began recovering in November from a low of $0.12, rising as high as $0.61 in December. It then corrected into 2025 dropping to the $0.4 mark.",Crypto Price Predictions,EN,0,0,ALGO|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-14 13:48:43

This marks the regulator’s first strategic market status (SMS) designation inquiry under the newly enacted Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCC). According to a UK government post , the CMA’s investigation will assess whether Google’s search and advertising services harm competition and innovation. It will also look at whether consumers and businesses are receiving fair outcomes from the company’s services. Google’s search business, which reportedly accounts for over 90% of general search queries in the UK, is at the helm of economic connectivity, facilitating business interactions and generating data for AI-driven innovations. UK legislation to focus on strategic market status The DMCC , which took effect on January 1, 2025, aims to prevent anti-competitive practices in digital markets. Under this regime, companies with SMS can be subjected to regulatory changes to promote competition. The CMA estimates that enhanced competition in search advertising could save UK households up to £500 annually through lower prices across the economy. According to the UK antitrust watchdog, designating Google’s search business as having SMS would allow the regulator to impose conduct requirements or propose pro-competition measures. The recently announced probe will examine whether Google’s dominance hinders competition and innovation in search. While Google’s market share highlights weak competition, advances by companies like OpenAI make the argument that there is sufficient innovation in alternative search solutions. Additionally, the investigation will also evaluate whether the tech giant unfairly prioritizes its own services in advertising and AI, potentially harming competitors and reducing consumer choice. Authorities will scrutinize Google’s use of consumer data without informed consent, particularly regarding intellectual property and content from publishers. They have given commenters up to February 3 to make or break the company’s case. Google’s history with antitrust cases Google has faced multiple antitrust queries globally, including in the United States and Europe. In its home market, US prosecutors argue that Google should divest its Chrome browser, share data and search results with rivals, and implement measures to reduce its monopoly in online search. The CMA noted that it is maintaining regular contact with other authorities worldwide to coordinate efforts. “ Millions of people and businesses rely on Google’s search and advertising services, ” said CMA Chief Executive Sarah Cardell. “ It’s our job to ensure people benefit from choice and innovation in search services and get a fair deal. ” Google’s search advertising platform supports over 200,000 UK businesses and facilitates connections between businesses, investors, and customers. It also generates valuable data for AI-driven products. For this reason, regulators believe it is imperative to monitor the search engine’s prowess in the market. The regulator’s inquiry also aligns with broader efforts to curb anti-competitive practices in digital markets. Under the DMCC, firms with SMS in specific digital activities can be subject to tailored regulatory interventions to ensure positive outcomes for consumers and businesses. Parallel investigations in the tech sector In other news, the UK regulator recently accepted remedies proposed by Synopsys and Ansys provisionally to address competition concerns linked to their $35 billion acquisition deal. The companies, known for their expertise in electronic design automation and engineering simulation, respectively, offered to divest overlapping business units to alleviate market dominance concerns. Per the CMA, Synopsys and Ansys’ proposed divestitures aim to maintain competition in key areas, including power consumption analysis tools and optics software. The regulator has until March 2025 to finalize its decision on fully accepting the proposals, with an option to extend the deadline up to early May for further deliberation.

Despite this, the Rollblock (RBLK) presale has been seeing incredible inflows from Ripple investors, drawn to its incredible 50x potential to disrupt the GambleFi space in 2025. Find out what has made them so bullish… Rollblock (RBLK) Sees Massive Uptick In New Gamers In Q4 Rollblock (RBLK) represents one of the greatest opportunities in all of crypto at the current time, as it is on track to deliver astonishing disruption to the enormous $500 billion online gambling industry. All Rollblock transactions are secured on the immutable Ethereum blockchain, meaning that gamers now have the upper hand and can verify that everything is fully above board. This removes the ever-present risk of casinos manipulating bets and working against their users. In December, Rollblock saw a huge groundswell of new users, as a 600% surge in registrations was recorded in just one month. RBLK is the native token of the platform and grants its holders access to exclusive VIP areas and free spins, along with staking potential which can earn up to 30% in hassle-free passive income. It has a fixed cap of a billion tokens, meaning it cannot be diluted away, and in fact, its supply will trend down over time thanks to a unique revenue share feature. Each week up to 30% of the platform’s operating profits will be used to fund RBLK purchases, 60% of which are burned to bring down the number of tokens in circulation. The rest are allocated to stakers who represent the most loyal of holders. In short, RBLK’s scarcity could send its price many multiples higher than its current level of $0.045. Stars Aligning For Ripple (XRP) In 2025 Incredibly, the Ripple price has escaped the worst of the current crypto dip and is up 3.2% on the monthly timeframe to reach $2.47. This is in stark contrast to many other coins in the top ten, which have suffered losses of up to 20%. Much of this strength can be put down to the stepping down of SEC chair Gary Gensler, which will likely signal an end to Ripple Labs’ years-long legal battle. Ripple also recently rolled out a highly successful stablecoin launch with $RLUSD. This has caused institutional adoption of the Ripple chain to surge and has made the approval of a spot Ripple ETF all the more likely for 2025. With a more crypto-friendly administration soon to be entering the White House, Ripple could easily reach $10 this year. Rollblock Gains Ground Over TradFi Casino Platforms As Ripple continues pushing toward new all-time highs, Rollblock (RBLK) will likely outpace its gains as it rides the wave of huge momentum into 2025. Many experts have predicted an RBLK price of up to $1 this cycle as Rollblock takes its place among the giants of the GambleFi sector.

The Chia token was released on 17 March 2021 by Chia Network Inc., owned by Bram Cohen, a computer programmer and founder of BitTorrent. The Chia crypto is represented as XCH and runs on the Chia Network, a public and open-source blockchain with a personalized programming language known as Charlisp. Based in Delaware, Chia Network Inc. launched the beta version of its blockchain in 2019. After two years of successful testing, the mainnet became public in March 2021. A few months later, transaction features were enabled, and the Chia Network became fully functional. The Chia blockchain is currently hosted on about 400,000 computers, with the Chia coin (XCH) listed for trading on several exchanges, including Gate.io , Uniswap(V2), KuCoin, OKEx, and Huobi.

The price movement shows consistent selling pressure, with minimal upward retracements, indicating weak buyer interest.

On the 1-day chart, XCH has faced consistent selling pressure, leading to a downward trend with support levels tested near $20. Indicators such as the RSI and MACD on both the daily and 4-hour charts highlight weakened buying momentum, with the RSI hovering in the bearish zone and the MACD showing bearish crossovers. While minor recoveries are evident on shorter timeframes, such as the 4-hour chart, they lack the volume and strength needed to reverse the overall trend. The market sentiment remains cautious, and further downside is possible unless a strong bullish catalyst emerges to drive the price upward. Is Chia Coin a good investment? Based on the current bearish trend, heightened volatility, and strong selling pressure indicated by technical indicators like the RSI and moving averages, Chia Coin (XCH) may not be considered a favorable investment at this time. Investors should exercise caution due to the uncertain market direction and potential for further price declines in the near term. Why is Chia down? Chia (XCH) is currently down due to a combination of technical and market-related factors. Technically, the daily and 4-hour charts show consistent bearish pressure, with indicators like the RSI and MACD reflecting weakened buying momentum. The RSI is in the lower zone, indicating overselling, while the MACD shows bearish crossovers, signaling negative momentum. Additionally, the market has failed to sustain critical support levels, leading to further downward movement. Will XCH recover? The recovery of Chia XCH depends on reversing the current bearish sentiment and stabilizing market conditions. Watch for signs of decreased selling pressure, potential positive catalysts, and a shift in technical indicators indicating oversold conditions, which could signal a potential recovery in future price movements. Will XCH reach $25? XCH could reach up to $25 soon. Analysts suggest this could happen as early as 2025. Will XCH reach $50? The forecast for 2027 anticipates a peak price of $71.42, indicating that XCH could potentially surpass the $100 mark during that year, assuming the bullish momentum and positive market conditions persist. Will XCH reach $200? By 2031, the prediction suggests a maximum price of $293.70 for XCH, indicating a potential for the cryptocurrency to exceed the $200 mark. However, this would depend on sustained growth, market dynamics, and broader adoption factors. Does XCH have a good long-term future? The long-term price predictions from 2025 to 2031 indicate a generally positive outlook for Chia Coin, with projected growth in average and maximum prices over the years. This suggests the potential for XCH to establish itself as a valuable asset in the cryptocurrency market, subject to market developments and adoption trends.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As XRP once captured the crypto world’s attention in 2017, Lightchain AI is emerging as the next potential breakout star, combining AI and blockchain to drive massive growth in 2025. Table of Contents XRP’s 2017 success: Lessons from the past Lightchain AI’s game-changing features Lightchain AI as the next big altcoin In 2017, Ripple’s XRP was the breakout star of the cryptocurrency market, delivering exponential gains and cementing its place as one of the most successful altcoins of all time. Now, as the market evolves, Lightchain AI is emerging as the next contender poised for a similar meteoric rise. With its integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, Lightchain AI is capturing investor attention and positioning itself as a top altcoin for 2025. Currently, Lightchain AI is in its presale phase, priced at $0.00525 per token, with over $10.6 million already raised. This momentum suggests it could be the next big thing, much like XRP’s legendary 2017 run. XRP’s 2017 success: Lessons from the past In 2017, XRP price went up from about $0.006 to more than $3.80, showing a rise over 35000%. This great growth was pushed by a few things, like Ripple’s smart links with more than 100 money groups, like American Express and Santander which raised market trust. Also, XRP’s fast transaction skills, managing up to 1,500 transactions a second with low fees made it nice for cross-border pay. The wider digital money market rise during that time also helped XRP’s climb. This period shows the importance of smart partnerships, tech speed, and how people felt about the market. Lightchain AI’s game-changing features Lightchain AI integrates utility and innovation to deliver a sophisticated platform that transcends traditional financial systems. At its foundation lies the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM), a specialized layer engineered for AI tasks such as model training and inference, seamlessly embedded within the blockchain infrastructure. The platform also introduces Proof of Intelligence (PoI), a consensus mechanism that not only ensures network security but also incentivizes nodes for performing valuable AI computations. To optimize performance, Lightchain AI incorporates advanced scalability features, including sharding and Layer 2 solutions, enabling high-speed and high-throughput AI operations. By combining cutting-edge technology with practical functionality, Lightchain AI is setting a new standard for an intelligent, scalable blockchain ecosystem. Lightchain AI as the next big altcoin Ripple’s XRP paved the way for altcoins by showcasing the power of utility and institutional adoption. Now, Lightchain AI is poised to take that legacy further by combining blockchain with artificial intelligence, creating a platform that caters to both developers and enterprises. For investors seeking the next big opportunity, Lightchain AI offers the perfect mix of innovation, scalability, and early-stage accessibility. With its presale raising over $10.4 million and a vision to transform decentralized systems, Lightchain AI could be the breakout star of the next crypto bull run, much like XRP was in 2017.

Both developments are evidence of the growing push for clarity and innovation in the crypto industry, as companies navigate complex legal and economic landscapes while seeking jurisdictions that align with their vision for financial freedom and technological advancement. US Appeals Court Rebukes SEC in Coinbase Case, Demands Better Clarity on Crypto Regulations The US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has delivered a critical opinion in the legal battle between cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), calling the regulator's decision to deny rulemaking ”arbitrary and capricious.” The ruling, issued on Jan. 13, has significant implications for the regulatory landscape of the cryptocurrency industry. In the case stemming from Coinbase’s 2022 petition requesting the SEC to establish clear rules for regulating digital assets, the appellate court partially granted Coinbase’s appeal. While the court refrained from mandating the SEC to initiate rulemaking proceedings, it criticized the agency's denial of Coinbase’s petition, labeling the SEC’s reasoning as “insufficiently reasoned.” Judge Thomas Ambro, writing for the panel, noted that the SEC’s denial lacked substantive justification, undermining its credibility. Judge Stephanos Bibas, in a concurring opinion, further lambasted the agency’s sporadic enforcement actions against the crypto industry, which he argued went beyond combating fraud and risked stifling innovation. “We properly remand to the SEC to explain itself; it should not give yet another poor explanation in an already-long line of them,” Judge Bibas wrote. He added, “New inventions create new fraud risks, and the agency needs to guard against them. But sporadically enforcing ill-fitting rules against crypto companies that are trying to follow the law goes way beyond fighting fraud.” Coinbase’s petition to the SEC, filed in 2022, sought to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets. The exchange argued that such rules would clarify which digital assets qualify as securities, providing much-needed guidance for the burgeoning industry. However, the SEC denied the request in 2023, prompting Coinbase to take legal action in the Third Circuit. The court's decision highlights a broader issue: the lack of clear and consistent regulations governing the cryptocurrency market. Coinbase and other crypto firms have long argued that the SEC’s approach—relying on enforcement rather than rulemaking—creates uncertainty and stifles growth. The appellate court’s opinion stopped short of compelling the SEC to engage in rulemaking but sent a strong message about the need for greater transparency and reasoning in its decisions. The ruling emphasized that the SEC’s current practices could amount to targeting an entire industry, a move that risks hindering innovation and economic development. Legal experts believe the decision could set a precedent for other cases involving the SEC and crypto firms. The ruling also sheds light on the judiciary’s growing impatience with the agency’s approach to regulating the sector. The Third Circuit decision comes amid a broader crackdown by the SEC on cryptocurrency firms. In addition to Coinbase, the agency has ongoing enforcement actions against Ripple Labs and Binance, among others. In a separate case filed in June 2023, the SEC accused Coinbase of operating as an unregistered securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. That case is currently under appeal in the Second Circuit. A Leadership Shake-Up at the SEC The ruling also coincides with significant changes at the SEC. Chair Gary Gensler and Commissioner Jaime Lizárraga are set to resign before the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump. Gensler’s tenure has been marked by a contentious relationship with the crypto industry, and his resignation could signal a shift in the agency’s approach to digital assets. While the Third Circuit ruling remands the case to the SEC for further explanation, it does not compel the agency to create new rules for crypto. The court made it clear that it would only intervene in cases of “extreme delay that endangers human lives,” not for primarily economic reasons. This leaves the future of crypto regulation in the US uncertain. For Coinbase and other crypto firms, the ruling is a partial victory. It reinforces their argument that the SEC’s current practices are inadequate and highlights the need for a more thoughtful and transparent regulatory approach. The Third Circuit’s rebuke of the SEC marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing battle between regulators and the cryptocurrency industry. As the SEC grapples with the court’s demand for better reasoning, the crypto sector continues to call for clear and consistent rules to foster innovation while ensuring investor protection. With leadership changes on the horizon at the SEC, the regulatory future of digital assets in the United States remains in flux. Tether Relocates to El Salvador, Strengthening Nation’s Role as a Crypto Hub In other news, Tether, the issuer of the world’s largest stablecoin, has announced plans to relocate its headquarters and subsidiaries to El Salvador after securing an operating license in the Bitcoin-friendly nation. In a Jan. 13 notice , Tether confirmed it had obtained a license to operate as a digital asset service provider and stablecoin issuer under El Salvador’s progressive regulatory framework. The company cited the nation’s “forward-thinking policies, favorable regulatory environment, and growing Bitcoin-savvy community” as key factors in its decision to establish a new base. “This decision is a natural progression for Tether as it allows us to build a new home, foster collaboration, and strengthen our focus on emerging markets,” said Paolo Ardoino, Tether’s CEO. “By rooting ourselves [in El Salvador], we are not only aligning with a country that shares our vision in terms of financial freedom, innovation, and resilience but also reinforcing our commitment to empowering people worldwide through decentralized technologies.” The relocation marks a significant step for Tether , which has been navigating increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. By establishing itself in El Salvador, Tether positions itself in a jurisdiction that has embraced Bitcoin and blockchain technology with open arms. The relocation follows reports that Tether executives, including CEO Paolo Ardoino and COO Claudia Lagorio, became naturalized citizens of El Salvador in 2024. Tether has also deepened its ties with the Salvadoran government and local businesses over recent years, including its participation in renewable energy projects such as geothermal facilities for Bitcoin mining. Ardoino has maintained a close relationship with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who has championed Bitcoin adoption in the country. Ardoino’s social media posts frequently echo Bukele’s calls for innovation and entrepreneurship in El Salvador, and the two have reportedly engaged in discussions about expanding the nation’s crypto ecosystem. Since President Bukele announced in 2021 that El Salvador would adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, the small Central American nation has been a focal point for the global crypto community. Despite initial skepticism, Bukele has continued to advocate for Bitcoin’s integration into the country’s economy, positioning it as a tool for financial inclusion and innovation. In 2023, Tether pledged to support El Salvador’s renewable energy initiatives, signaling its long-term commitment to the country’s economic development. However, the results of Bitcoin adoption have been mixed. While Bukele has described it as a “net positive” for El Salvador, the anticipated economic windfall has been slower to materialize. As of December 2024, the government reported holding over 6,000 BTC, valued at more than $550 million. Controversies and Challenges Bukele’s administration has drawn praise for its success in reducing El Salvador’s once-notorious crime rate, a feat that has bolstered his popularity. However, critics have accused Bukele of undermining democratic institutions, detaining political opponents, and committing human rights abuses. Despite these allegations, Bukele was reelected in 2024, continuing his push for crypto adoption as a cornerstone of his economic policy. While over 90% of Salvadorans reportedly do not use Bitcoin for transactions, the government remains committed to its vision of making El Salvador a hub for cryptocurrency innovation. Tether’s decision to move its headquarters to El Salvador is a vote of confidence in the country’s regulatory environment and its ambitious vision for the future of finance. As the stablecoin issuer integrates itself further into El Salvador’s crypto ecosystem, it could pave the way for other major players in the industry to follow suit. For El Salvador, the relocation represents another milestone in its efforts to position itself as a global leader in cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. By attracting companies like Tether, the nation aims to build an ecosystem that fosters innovation, attracts investment, and empowers its citizens through decentralized technologies.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|USDT,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-14 14:00:00

He made the call labeling bonds as “toxic” during his speech while asking businesses to look into Bitcoin’s potential. Related Reading: Litecoin Price Falters Amid Doubts Over LTC ETF Approval Comparing Investment Returns Saylor bases his argument on a comparison of investment returns. Since MicroStrategy adopted its Bitcoin-buying strategy in 2020, Bitcoin has shown remarkable resilience and growth, while bonds have faltered. He presented data indicating that while many companies cling to outdated financial practices—such as purchasing Treasury bonds—those who embrace Bitcoin stand to benefit significantly. “Every company has a choice to make: cling to the past or embrace the future,” he stated, emphasizing the transformative potential of digital assets. Companies should buy Bitcoin because bonds are “toxic,” according to MicroStrategy Chairman Michael Saylor https://t.co/SOZdLagLCC — Bloomberg (@business) January 13, 2025 The Case For Bitcoin During his speech, Saylor mentioned that MicroStrategy’s own investments have been rewarding. The company recently closed an acquisition of Bitcoin worth $243 million. It is their 10th consecutive week in purchasing the cryptocurrency. Saylor was critical of the tech giants like Microsoft and Nvidia for not following suit. He said that they are missing a revolutionary opportunity. He used an image to drive the point home with a slide indicating that only 70 companies have Bitcoin today, so those who are slow might be left out. The landscape of finance is changing, and Saylor says that companies should evolve to remain in the loop. He even provocatively added, “What’s the downside? Well, you just get rich,” underlining his conviction that Bitcoin is a better investment vehicle. Future Implications Saylor’s statement is indicative of a broader change in how companies perceive digital assets, and it extends beyond corporate finance. He advised leaders to think about their obligations to their families and investors in addition to the future of their company as he wrapped off his remarks. “Adopt Bitcoin,” he exhorted, presenting it as a moral requirement for influential people. Related Reading: Bitcoin To $350,000? Top Crypto Influencer Makes Bold Prediction Saylor’s influence has now appeared to extend into the political sphere as well. Saylor received an invitation to Mar-a-Lago to talk more about Bitcoin following Donald Trump’s reelection. Trump has met with executives of the cryptocurrency industry in the past to discuss regulations that impact the sector. These exchanges show that the potential economic impact of cryptocurrencies is becoming more widely acknowledged. Michael Saylor’s passionate call for Bitcoin, rather than a traditional bond, isn’t just a matter of an investment strategy. It represents an ideological shift within finance. If companies adopt the digital currency that he advocates for, then everything about business could change in terms of operations and investment.

Ripple ( XRP ) climbed to $2.60, extending a recovery that began on Dec. 30 when it bottomed at the psychologically important level of $2. One catalyst for XRP’s rise is the gradual growth of Ripple’s USD stablecoin ( RLUSD ), which has now attracted over $72 million in assets. According to CoinGecko , there are signs that RLUSD usage is increasing, with its 24-hour trading volume reaching $162 million. This volume makes RLUSD the sixth-most used stablecoin in the crypto market. RLUSD has surpassed other popular stablecoins, including Justin Sun’s USDD, Frax, and PayPal’s PYUSD. Notably, PYUSD, which has a market cap of $534 million, recorded a 24-hour volume of just $22 million. However, RLUSD faces stiff competition from major stablecoins such as Tether ( USDT ) and USD Coin, which had 24-hour volumes of $74 billion and $6.7 billion, respectively.

Among the top performers this week were newly launched tokens such as Pongo, XRP Army, PHNIX, and Britto. The growth of RLUSD and the performance of Ripple meme coins have helped boost the utility of the Ripple network, which has been criticized in the past as a “ ghost chain .” XRP price could continue rising in the coming days as Donald Trump’s inauguration nears. Crypto investors see Ripple as being one of the top beneficiaries of this inauguration as it will lead to significant changes at the Securities Exchange Commission. For example, Polymarket users have given a 58% chance that the agency will approve a spot XRP ETF in 2025. XRP price analysis XRP chart | Source: crypto.news The weekly chart shows that XRP has risen for three consecutive days, even as other cryptocurrencies have declined. The recovery began when the coin dropped to the psychological level of $2, which forms the lower boundary of a symmetrical triangle. This pattern is part of a bullish pennant formation. XRP has also formed a break-and-retest pattern, dipping to a key support level of $1.9660, its previous all-time high. This pattern is widely seen as a bullish continuation signal. XRP remains above all major moving averages, suggesting further bullish momentum. The next crucial resistance level to watch is $2.9150, which could serve as the next target in the ongoing rally.

While this situation caused investors to expect losses in ETH, an interesting claim came from CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju for ETH. Sharing about Ethereum from his X account, Ju said that ETH is fundamentally similar to stablecoins due to its price stability. CryptoQuant CEO wrote that Ethereum (ETH) acts like a stablecoin due to its price movements. Noting that ETH has consistently traded at $3,160 in some months in 2021, 2022, 2024 and 2025, Ki Young Ju said: “MAY 2021 Ethereum $3,160 AUGUST 2021 Ethereum $3,160 JANUARY 2022 Ethereum $3,160 MARCH 2022 Ethereum $3,160 ​APRIL 2022 Ethereum $3,160 MARCH 2024 Ethereum $3,160 MAY 2024 Ethereum $3,160 JULY 2024 Ethereum $3,160 NOVEMBER 2024 Ethereum $3,160 JANUARY 2025 Ethereum $3,160” ETH is a stablecoin.” While CryptoQuant CEO likened Ethereum to a stablecoin, Deribit Asia Business Development Head Lin Chen stated that the crypto options market at X predicts a 10.62% probability that the Ethereum price will exceed $4,000 by the end of the month. Ethereum, which has gained 3% in the last 24 hours, continues to be traded at $3,246 at the time of writing. https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1878996132506005584 *Not investment advice Continue Reading: Interesting Analogy for Ethereum (ETH) from CryptoQuant CEO!

German Trader Predict Parabolic Rally for 4 Crypto Tokens,https://coingape.com/trending/last-chance-to-buy-german-trader-predict-parabolic-rally-for-4-crypto-tokens/,"Amid increased volatility and unpredictability, a German trader predicts a parabolic rally for four famous crypto tokens, buzzing investors. Although the market has begun a recovery trail today after the collapse, altcoin dominance is still months away, per most analysts. However, the aforementioned prediction hints at the formation of the peak moment for some of these tokens. Let’s discuss these and why the trader call it the last chance to buy. German Trader Predicts ADA and Other Crypto Tokens Price Rally With the Bitcoin price rally , altcoins also splurged investors with gains in November-December 2024. However, after this, things slowed down, and the market faced downtrends and losses. However, according to this German trader, things will change really fast now. During an interview, Oliver Michel, founder and CEO of Tokentus and popular crypto celebrity, discussed the upcoming bullish moments for HBAR, DOGE, XLM, and ADA. More importantly, he urged investors to pay attention to these four crypto tokens before concluding that these would rally pretty soon. Michel’s analysis identified similar trends in these cryptos, with each achieving similar rallies in 2024 end, reaching 3x, 4x, 6x, and 7x with the Trump-driven crypto market rally. His analysis also focused on these four cryptos entering a consolidation ever since then, showing a sideways moment, making it the perfect buying opportunity for investors. ADA Price To Hit $12 in 2025? At present, Cardano’s price is at $0.9635 after a 7% surge in the last 24 hours. Despite that, it is still losing in the broader market. Analyzing its historical performance, ADA hit its prime in early 2021, creating an ATH of $3. However, since then, the asset has sharply declined before stabilizing in 2023 and 2024, increasing investors’ expectations for 2025. With Oliver Michel’s ADA price prediction , investors await the bullish rally to $12. However, considering this crypto token’s overall performance, this target seems less likely. To reach this target, ADA needs a 12x increase, which is 4 times the rally it had in November, and that is only possible with an altcoin season, which is not due until a few months. Even with that, the crypto trends, investor demand, and technical factors need to be combined to make this target achievable. Considering the prediction’s challenges, some call this target a FUD. However, some analysts believe in the long-term potential of the token, especially as the Cardano Foundation is focusing on the DeFi expansion and real-world adoption. $ADA is forming an ascending channel. Looking at other coins, if the previous high was the upper part of the channel, the next high is likely to be formed at the middle line of the upper zone. The target price will vary depending on the time of reach, but it expected that to be… pic.twitter.com/chqQKmZSU6 — CW (@CW8900) January 9, 2025 Key Takeaway From This Post The recent ADA price recovery sparked enthusiasm around this altcoin’s rally, especially as a German trader presented a bullish outlook for the same. During an interview session, Oliver Michel predicted a massive rally for four crypto tokens, i.e., ADA, HBAR, XLM, and DOGE. More importantly, he called it a must-buy opportunity before these cryptos explore new heights. With this prediction, fellow investors presented concerns over ADA’s growth and long-term target of $12 as to whether this can finally become a reality in 2025 or not. The post Last Chance to Buy?

The analyst pseudonymously known as Credible Crypto tells his 453,500 followers on the social media platform X that the third-largest digital asset by market cap just shattered its immediate resistance. According to the trader, the move puts XRP in a position to surge to a fresh record high. “We may have a breakout on our hands here. Swing and spot positions looking great here and we continue to simply let those ride till a new ATH (all-time high). Will actively look for scalp long entries once more now that we’ve cleared local resistance. “ Source: Credible Crypto/X XRP is trading at $2.53 at time of writing, around 25% below the record high of $3.40 reached seven years ago. The pseudonymous analyst also says that XRP could outperform other crypto assets as it has done in the past. “XRP has a habit of running on its own and leaving everything else in the dust once it gets going. Those who have been here since 2017 have witnessed these moments.” While Credible Crypto is bullish on the third-largest digital asset by market cap, the trader sees the native token of the stablecoins-focused decentralized exchange Curve DAO ( CRV ) potentially outperforming XRP over the short to medium term. “So we’ve pushed deeper into the green zone – which means it’s still possible that we see a bullish shift here on CRV/XRP in the short/mid-term. If not, we make new lows – which implies XRP is absolutely ripping to the upside. The good thing about holding both CRV and XRP is you win either way and if XRP does in fact lead here it just means you have to be a little patient on CRV which should follow based on the setup we identified on the US dollar pairing.” Source: Credible Crypto/X CRV is trading at $0.811 at time of writing.

This key price floor has proven its strength, giving bulls the confidence to reenter the market. Oversold conditions signal a potential reversal, and DOT is now gradually climbing, sparking renewed optimism among traders who hope for stronger bullish momentum in the days ahead. With technical indicators aligning to support a recovery narrative, DOT’s ability to hold and build on the current bounce will be crucial in determining its next price phase. Will this gradual comeback pave the way for Polkadot to break free from its recent slump, or will bearish pressure reassert itself? Polkadot Recovery In Focus: Can Bulls Sustain Momentum? Following the rebound at the $6.2 support level, DOT’s price is now exhibiting early signs of recovery. DOT is slowly but steadily attempting to push higher, with its sights set on reaching the 4-hour Simple Moving Average (SMA). This moving average acts as a key technical indicator for short-term trends, and a move toward it suggests that Polkadot is gaining strength in its recovery effort. Related Reading: Polkadot Price Soars 15% In One Day — Here’s Why $7.5 Might Be The Next Target Furthermore, DOT’s gradual price increase reflects a shift in market sentiment, moving from bearish to more neutral as buyers cautiously re-enter the market. The $6.2 support level has provided a solid foundation, which allows the price to stabilize and begin its ascent. As the token approaches the 4-hour SMA, it will encounter a critical point where the bulls must demonstrate their strength by surpassing this level. Successfully breaking above the SMA could catalyze more gains, confirming that the bullish momentum is taking hold. Technical indicators are starting to reveal early positive signs for Polkadot, with the Composite Trend Oscillator showing promising movement. Currently, the indicator, which synthesizes multiple technical indicators, indicates that DOT is in oversold territory, suggesting the cryptocurrency could be poised for a reversal as buying interest begins to emerge. However, the journey to the SMA is still in its early stages, and the recovery remains fragile. Any failure to hold above the $6.2 support or to break through the SMA may result in a setback for Polkadot, potentially allowing bearish pressure to resume. Key Resistance Levels To Watch For Ahead As Polkadot attempts to sustain its momentum, key resistance levels will play a critical role in determining whether the recovery can continue. The first major resistance to watch is around the $7.7 mark, which might act as a barrier to further upward movement. A break above this level would indicate increasing bullish strength, paving the way for a move toward higher price targets.

While XRP spent most of the year trading quite flatly, the wider market rally that began in November propelled the token to a 233% gain for the year. Since the start of 2025, prices have increased by 21.47% — at press time, XRP was changing hands at $2.57. XRP price year-to-date (YTD) chart. Source: Finbold Beyond its appeal as a speculative investment, XRP ’s utility as a cross-border payment solution has also contributed to making it the third-largest cryptocurrency in the world in terms of market capitalization, which currently stands at approximately $147 billion. While utility does play a role in determining the price of a cryptocurrency, measuring the exact effect is a tall order. Thankfully, the laws of supply and demand still apply to cryptocurrencies — and the interplay of these two factors, often referred to as ‘ tokenomics ’, provides a much better level of insight into how price action could unfold going forward. XRP’s highest market capitalization, roughly $154.84 billion, was reached on December 3, 2024 — marking the first time that the digital asset surpassed its January 6, 2018 peak market cap of $131.65 billion. At the time of the prior peak, only 38.72 billion XRP was circulating — resulting in an all-time high (ATH) price of $3.40. XRP market cap 1-year chart. Source: CoinMarketCap Currently, XRP’s circulating supply amounts to 57.49 billion tokens — here is how Ripple Labs’s ongoing escrow schedule could impact the price of XRP in the future. Ripple Labs’ escrow system and XRP inflation At present, some 42.51 billion XRP have yet to be unlocked. Ripple Labs unlocks 1 billion XRP each month — however, it can decide to re-lock any amount for the purpose of a future escrow. In fact, Ripple Labs has done exactly that with the majority of the unlocked supply on many occasions — most recently in January, when it decided to re-lock 700 million units and dump the remaining 300 million . In the worst-case scenario, assuming that Ripple decides not to relock any amount of XRP going forward, per the escrow schedule, it would take approximately three and a half years for the rest of the token’s supply to be unlocked. This would result in a 20.87% annual inflation in the first year, followed by a 17.27%, 14,73%, and 6.96% annual inflation in the following years. Once that is finished, the entire supply would be unlocked, resulting in a fully diluted market cap of $257 billion, considering current prices. This increase in supply would lead XRP prices to drop to $1.55 — equating to a 39.75% loss compared to the current price of asset.

In 2024, institutional OTC (over-the-counter) crypto trading volumes more than doubled, recording a 106% surge. This momentum was primarily driven by the victory of Donald Trump. Moreover, the launch of the highly anticipated Bitcoin ETFs added to the growth trajectory. The fourth quarter of the previous year proved pivotal, with Bitcoin and Ethereum leading the charge. Trading volumes of these two coins soared by 80% and 187%, respectively. While altcoins were once a niche segment for institutional traders, they, too, gained traction. Currently, altcoins account for 29% of the market share. Plus, since 2023, they’ve recorded more than double growth. As institutional interest grows and retail investors follow suit, presales of emerging cryptocurrencies are garnering significant attention. After all, presales offer the best entry points and, therefore, the highest returns. In this post, we’ve shortlisted 4 hottest presales to buy in January 2025 for maximum gains. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Overall Best Crypto Presale in 2025 Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) stands out as one of the hottest presales in January thanks to its promise of making profitable crypto investing accessible for everyone, including retail crypto traders. $WEPE token holders will get access to unique trading insights that are usually reserved for only the big guns on Wall Street. What’s more, $WEPE appeals to investors with its playful, community-oriented nature and innovation. Plus, it has been inspired by iconic tokens like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin. $WEPE is currently in presale, having already raised over $47M, which demonstrates its potential. Currently valued at $0.00036647 per token, experts are predicting $WEPE to be the next 100x token. 2. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana Layer-2 Solution Offering Fast & Reliable Transactions Solaxy ($SOLX) is the outstanding utility token behind a project that benefits from Solana’s fast blockchain and has been designed to optimize liquidity and enhance multi-chain interoperability. Moreover, $SOLX has emerged as a preferred choice for DeFi applications, seeing as it supports seamless swaps and scalable solutions. The Solana network will benefit from Solaxy, thanks to its ability to ensure smooth transaction flows and seamlessly handle a greater number of transactions. During its ongoing presale, $SOLX has already raised over $10.2M, which shows the teeming confidence of investors. Priced at $0.0016, it offers possibly one of the best crypto investment opportunities right now as Solana continues to expand its ecosystem. Token holders will also be able to stake $SOLX and earn rewards while contributing to the network’s development. 3. 5thScape ($5SCAPE) – Unique Combination of Crypto & Virtual Reality 5thScape ($5SCAPE) seamlessly merges VR and blockchain to create an innovative entertainment ecosystem. It has been built on Ethereum and serves as the first VR content hub of its kind. 5thScape offers users an immersive and decentralized ecosystem. The flagship game of this platform, Cage of Conquest, has already gained significant attention. Some of the upcoming games include Epic Cricket Arena, Archery Master, Immersive Kickoff, and Thrust Hunter. Currently priced at just $0.00498, the market sentiments around $5SCAPE are very positive, in part due to its strong performance during the presale period. According to some analysts, the token could reach $1, not to mention that its expected listing price is around $0.01, which is already an approximate 100% return should you invest now. Hurry! 5SCAPE presale ends in 14 days! 4. DexBoss ($DEBO) – Advanced Trading Terminal with AI-Powered Charts and More DexBoss ($DEBO) is a decentralized exchange platform designed to maximize profitability for crypto traders with its advanced trading tools. Investors can access these features exclusively through its native token, $DEBO. Its features include order execution in almost real time, deflationary tools, and strong liquidity framing options. $DEBO is currently in its second presale phase and priced at $0.011 per token. The target listing price of this coin is $0.0505, which promises almost 41x returns to investors in 2025. Out of the presale goal of $750K, DexBoss has already raised $360K.

Il suo imminente ingresso alla Casa Bianca, accompagnato da un’amministrazione composta da sostenitori e difensori del settore crypto, sta alimentando forti aspettative. Nonostante la recente correzione del mercato, in seguito alla pubblicazione dei dati economici positivi provenienti dagli Stati Uniti, molti esperti sono convinti che stiamo per entrare in una nuova era. Un’era che potrebbe segnare l’inizio di una delle fasi più promettenti per il settore crypto. Con l’arrivo della nuova amministrazione, diversi asset digitali potrebbero beneficiare di un contesto normativo più favorevole. Solaxy: Il ponte tra Solana ed Ethereum per una DeFi più accessibile Un progetto attualmente in fase di prevendita da tenere d’occhio è Solaxy . Si tratta della prima soluzione di layer 2 costruita sulla blockchain di Solana, pensata per affrontare il sovraccarico del suo network. Solana è una delle blockchain più popolari, ma continua a fare i conti con una sfida crescente: la scalabilità. Nei momenti di picco, infatti, le transazioni rallentano, le fees aumentano e molte operazioni rischiano di non andare a buon fine. Il layer 2 di Solaxy promette di gestire una parte del carico di lavoro su una chain separata, rendendo tutto più economico, veloce e fluido. La piattaforma svilupperà un’architettura appositamente progettata per ridurre al minimo i fallimenti delle transazioni, indirizzando parte del carico della mainnet verso questa piattaforma offchain. Solaxy non solo ottimizza l’efficienza di Solana, ma la prepara anche a un futuro ancora più promettente, aprendo la strada a nuove adozioni e casi d’uso. Nel 2024, Solana è stata la blockchain di riferimento per il lancio di nuove meme coin e l’adozione dell’intelligenza artificiale; quest’anno, i prossimi progetti di punta potrebbero debuttare direttamente sul layer 2 Solaxy. Grazie alla sua natura multi-chain, Solaxy sfrutta al meglio le potenzialità di Solana ed Ethereum, creando un ponte tra le due blockchain. Un approccio che offre agli utenti una maggiore liquidità e un accesso più semplice alle piattaforme DeFi. Inoltre rende Solaxy una scelta ideale per chi opera nel settore crypto. Il progetto sta suscitando un grande interesse e, come già accennato, si trova ancora in fase di prevendita. Finora ha raccolto oltre 10 milioni di dollari. Wall Street Pepe raccoglie oltre 47 milioni di dollari nella prevendita Un altro progetto in prevendita che sta suscitando grande interesse è Wall Street Pepe . In sole sei settimane, la prevendita ha raccolto ben 47,8 milioni di dollari e, se continuerà con questo ritmo, potrebbe superare i 50 milioni di dollari nei prossimi giorni. Il progetto riprende il tema della rana da Pepe Coin, ma non si tratta di una semplice meme coin. Wall Street Pepe sta costruendo una vasta community esclusiva e dinamica per i titolari di WEPE, chiamata $WEPE Army. I membri della community avranno accesso a strategie di trading avanzate e segnali alfa, nonché a strumenti esclusivi per navigare nel mercato crypto. Non solo, gli utenti potranno anche condividere preziosi consigli per superare le manovre delle balene e avere un vantaggio nel mercato. Inoltre, ogni settimana ci saranno gare entusiasmanti, offrendo agli investitori opportunità uniche per testare le proprie abilità. Grazie a strumenti di trading all’avanguardia e a eventi settimanali, i membri avranno l’opportunità di crescere come trader e ottenere un vantaggio competitivo nel mercato crypto. Meme Index (MEMEX) raccoglie 2,5 milioni di dollari L’ultimo progetto in prevendita della lista è Meme Index (MEMEX) . Basato sulla blockchain di Ethereum, si propone come una piattaforma unica che offre agli investitori la possibilità di diversificare i propri investimenti nel segmento in rapida crescita delle meme coin. Meme Index si distingue per il suo sistema di indici diversificati, che permette agli utenti di scegliere tra diverse opzioni di rischio, garantendo un’esposizione mirata alle meme coin con la possibilità di adattare il livello di rischio alle proprie preferenze. La piattaforma offre quattro indici distinti, ognuno dei quali raggruppa meme coin con caratteristiche e volatilità differenti: Titan Index, Moonshot Index, Midcap Index e Frenzy Index. Titan Index include anche le meme coin più popolari come Dogecoin, Shiba Inu e Pepe Coin . Un altro aspetto che distingue Meme Index da altre piattaforme è la possibilità per i titolati del token $MEMEX di partecipare attivamente alla governance del progetto. Invece di essere semplici investitori, i suoi titolari hanno il potere di proporre nuove meme coin da inserire negli indici e votare su quali token dovrebbero essere rimossi, oltre che contribuire al miglioramento della piattaforma. Inoltre, Meme Index offre opportunità di staking per i titolati del token nativo. Durante la fase di prevendita e successivamente, gli utenti possono mettere in staking i propri token $MEMEX per ottenere un ritorno percentuale annuo (APY).",Italia|Donald Trump|meme coin|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|MARKET|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-14 15:37:58

Bitwise chief investment officer Matt Hougan predicts a surge in the number of corporations adding Bitcoin ( BTC ) to their treasuries, driven by MicroStrategy’s influence and shifting regulatory headwinds in the U.S. under President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. In a research note , Hougan said the success of spot BTC exchange-traded funds and increasing crypto adoption in the U.S. has helped dispel Bitcoin’s prior reputational risks. Recent changes to accounting rules have provided additional incentives for firms considering adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets. In December, the Financial Accounting Standards Board introduced new reporting requirements under ASU 2023-08. You might also like: Bo Hines is a future exec of the U.S. crypto council. What are his views on crypto? The updated rules allow institutions to mark down Bitcoin price slumps while also adjusting their disclosures when the price appreciates. This represents a notable shift from the previous rules, which required companies to treat Bitcoin as an intangible asset — meaning firms could only record price declines, with no provision for noting price increases. If 70 companies were willing to add bitcoin to their balance sheets when, from an accounting perspective, it literally could only go down, imagine how many will add it to their balance sheet now. “Two hundred? Five hundred? A thousand? Matt Hougan, Bitwise CIO Hougan’s note was shared days before Trump’s swearing-in, scheduled for Jan. 20, and hours after MicroStrategy bolstered its BTC horde. Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy’s executive chairman, said the company holds around 450,000 BTC, which is valued north of $43 billion and plans to buy more. In 2024, MicroStrategy spent $22 billion acquiring 258,320 BTC — more than the total 218,829 BTC produced by miners throughout the entire year. Saylor has indicated that his firm intends to acquire an additional $42 billion in Bitcoin, a sum that would account for nearly three years’ worth of newly mined BTC supply.

Solana surged 75% in 2024, hitting $260, but investors now seek 2025’s promising altcoins like Dawgz AI for high growth potential. Table of Contents Dawgz AI: A promising AI crypto of 2025 Hedera: One of the promising low-cost altcoins to buy Algorand: Next crypto to hit $1? Stellar: Analysts predict big growth Conclusion Solana has been a huge success in 2024. Over the past year, it has increased in value by 75% and its value has even exceeded $260. It has attracted the attention of the entire market with a trading volume of more than one trillion dollars on decentralized exchanges. Its ecosystem has seen a huge increase in new developers and continues to expand, with an average of 62 million transactions per day. Solana organizes many events to increase its engagement, and it’s a critical center for meme coins. Investors who did not invest in Solana at the time are looking for different coins with the same development potential in 2025. Today, we are going to look at the best cheap altcoins that can bring big profits to their investors. These include projects such as Dawgz AI, which combines unique artificial intelligence technology with meme culture. Dawgz AI: A promising AI crypto of 2025 Traders can sometimes get tired of constantly following market trends. They need to follow the trends and adapt their trading accordingly. However, with Dawgz AI (DAGZ) , this problem is eliminated because DAGZ holders will be able to execute trades automatically thanks to the AI trading bot within the Dawgz AI platform. Behind this AI integration are Wall Street veterans with years of experience. With this trading bot, trades are executed to keep users’ income at an optimal level. In order to keep the platform active, Dawgz AI organizes many events powered by meme culture. Among these events are competitions in which users can receive rewards. The project is currently in the presale phase and the price is $0.00211. The $960,000 quota for the presale is almost full. After that, it’s possible to see a price increase. Investors who want to invest in a coin with huge growth potential in 2025 should definitely take a look at the Dawgz AI crypto presale! Hedera: One of the promising low-cost altcoins to buy Hedera is a blockchain that enables its users to develop and operate decentralized applications that are fast, secure, and low-cost. Last year, the Valour Hedera ETP was launched on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, and a partnership with Chainlink was established to strengthen the DeFi infrastructure. In addition, a cooperation with SEALSQ was organized to increase the security of the blockchain. Hedera’s council approved a $408 million allocation to help the ecosystem grow and thrive. Developments such as these show investors that this network is highly developable and can bring them income. Algorand: Next crypto to hit $1? Algorand is an ultra-fast blockchain, and one of its competitors is Solana. Like Solana, it has the potential for massive growth. ALGO is currently under a dollar, making it a very affordable price to invest in. In addition, it’s possible to think that the coin can gain value thanks to DeFi projects such as Algofi, Tinyman, or Impact. Not only that, Algorand works with various governments and is used in CBDC projects. If such projects continue, we can think that the coin may gain value in the future. Stellar: Analysts predict big growth With updates such as “Protocol 20,” which introduces the Soroban smart contract platform, the network is becoming more attractive. Therefore, analysts predict that growth potential is on the way. Grayscale’s investments in the Stellar Lumens Trust may be among the reasons for this increase. Conclusion Projects such as Dawzg AI, Algorand, Stellar, and Hedera, which are similar to Solana in their developments, have growth potential for 2025, which attracts the attention of many investors.

If you are in need of such an opportunity, this article reveals 9 Cryptocurrencies That will take you from your 9-to-5 grind to a millionaire in 2025. 1. Rexas Finance: Your Millionaire Ticket in 2025 Rexas Finance focuses on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, which allows people to own fractional shares of high-value assets like real estate and intellectual property. These assets are expensive and illiquid. However, Rexas Finance turns them into tokens, allowing anyone to own fractions of them anywhere in the world. This vision redefines asset management, changing how assets are held and traded. This vision has resonated with investors, leading to the massive interest Rexas Finance has witnessed in the past months. Its presale has been one of the standouts, quickly moving to the current stage eleven. So far, the price has skyrocketed by an impressive 483%—from $0.03 to $0.175. Over 412 million tokens have been sold, raising $39 million. This kind of growth has caught the attention of both everyday investors and crypto whales, leading to FOMO. What really sets Rexas apart is its user-friendly ecosystem. Tools like the Rexas Token Builder make asset tokenization easy. The QuickMint Bot makes tokenization accessible to everyone, whether on their phone or computer. Its advanced AI Shield offers top-notch security for smart contracts, giving investors peace of mind. Its listing on CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko, as well as its Certik Audit, have increased its appeal. The token will launch on major exchanges in Q1. This listing will give it visibility and attract a broader audience, positioning it for further growth. It could spark another round of rallies that could see RXS surge to $18 in the coming months. The current giveaway of $50,000 worth of RXS to twenty lucky winners not only rewards its community but has also attracted more investors, increasing its chances for growth. Rexas Finance presents a strong, bullish case with its unique proposition, growing community, and presale success. Investing in the token today could help you secure a promising future this year. 2. Sui: Redefining Blockchain Innovation Sui is transforming the blockchain landscape with its cutting-edge ecosystem and strategic growth. Its first Hydropower Accelerator program successfully graduated twelve projects targeting diverse sectors, from DeFi to decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN). Sui’s Total Value Locked (TVL) soared to $1.8 billion in Q4 2024, driven by partnerships and integrations. In 2024, Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, says the token has entered a super bullish phase and could outdo even Solana and Ethereum this year. SUI currently trades at $4.83, a 320% increase in the past year. 3. Solana: Aiming for a Comeback in 2025 Despite recent market volatility, SOL is holding steady below $190, signaling potential for a significant rebound. Trading volumes have dipped due to sell fatigue, suggesting that bearish momentum may be fading. Experts are optimistic about upcoming catalysts, including the potential approval of Solana ETFs, which could drive substantial growth. Solana's ecosystem is robust, and institutional interest is rising. Thus, its current consolidation phase could be the perfect entry point for those looking to become millionaires. 4. Bitget Token: Surging Toward New Heights Bitget Token (BGB) recently soared 12%, breaking past $6.72 with a massive 101% surge in trading volume, signaling strong bullish momentum. It has now risen to $7.08, closer to its all-time high of $8.45. Key drivers include its integration with Morph Chain for enhanced utility and a supply-reducing token burn. Bitget’s approval to operate in El Salvador as a Bitcoin Service Provider also boosts its global reach. With technical indicators pointing to continued growth and a potential push toward $8.50, BGB is a promising asset for transforming small investments into substantial wealth. 5. Dogecoin: The Memecoin That Could Make Millionaires Though DOGE recently experienced a 10% decline, it has been displaying indications of a possible breakout. Its high-risk, high-reward nature attracts investors, making it a favorite in volatile markets. Whale accumulation surged 400% earlier this year, driving DOGE to $0.40 before market pressures pulled it back. Trading indicators currently hint at bullish momentum, and historical patterns point to a rebound. DOGE is currently trading at $0.34. A decisive move past $0.40 could take it to the $1 milestone. Dogecoin could offer explosive gains, making it a top choice for turning small investments into fortunes in 2025. 6. Ripple: Positioned for a Millionaire-Making Rally Ripple’s XRP sets the stage for explosive gains. Market watchers like Peter Brandt predict a potential threefold rally if it breaks out of its current bullish flag pattern. The token currently trades at $2.50 after increasing 5% in the past week. On-chain data also shows strong buying pressure, positioning XRP for a breakout to $4.78 or higher. If it reaches a $500 billion market cap, its price could climb to $8.68. This narrative is not far-fetched, considering the hope for a legal resolution and the expected approval of a Ripple Spot ETF. Thus, XRP offers a great wealth-making opportunity in 2025. 7. Cookie DAO: The Largest Index and Data Layer for AI Agents Cookie DAO is the largest index and data layer for AI agents, and it has gained popularity with AI agents flooding the crypto space. Binance listed COOKIE, sparking a recent surge in its price. It has risen about 2315% from its lowest price and 739% in the past month. Cookie DAO’s position as the first project to aggregate and index live data of all agents has attracted investors' interest. The token is expected to grow further in 2025 as AI Agents remain trending topics. 8. Cardano: A Potential $3 Rally Cardano (ADA) might soon see a break past the $1 threshold it has tested repeatedly. Trading at $0.99 right now, ADA shows indications of breaking from a bullish continuation pattern. This might drive it to a target of $3, analysts project. If Cardano breaks through this key resistance, it could lead to substantial gains, making it an attractive option for investors looking to grow their wealth. ADA's strong technical and continued development position will take you from your 9-to-5 grind to financial success this year. 9. Pepe Coin: A Potential 8X Surge Pepe Coin (PEPE) could be one of the top cryptocurrencies to help you leave your 9-to-5 grind. Despite recent market corrections, key on-chain indicators suggest it’s primed for a major rebound. PEPE has been witnessing falling exchange supply, and its bullish MVRV indicator shows it may be undervalued. Analysts project an 8x surge, especially if it breaks through key resistance levels. With whales holding strong and Bitcoin potentially rising past $100,000, Pepe Coin could ride the wave of renewed investor confidence. If it hits its all-time high again, a 65% increase is possible in the short term. Conclusion These nine cryptocurrencies can take you from a 9-5 daily grind to becoming a millionaire. Among the impressive lineup of cryptocurrencies on this list, Rexas Finance (RXS) stands out as the ultimate choice for those looking to leave the 9-to-5 grind behind.Rexas Finance's groundbreaking approach to real-world asset tokenization and stellar presale performance make It a project unlike any other.

This popularity led to heavy returns for holders, but after today’s 75% price rally, traders could anticipate three higher price targets. Let’s discuss Fartcoin’s price potential and the reasons behind that. Open Interests and Trading Volume Leads the Fartcoin Price Rally With the recent crypto market crash, the Fartcoin meme coin also declined to a weekly low of $0.68. Although the token hit a new ATH just days before, the increased volatility and seller dominance crashed it on the charts. Still, it became one of the earliest and biggest recoveries of the market, rallying 75% on the charts since the crash. This happened as investor interest peaked for the crypto token, fueling a 185% surge in the trading volume, currently at $206.85M. Additionally, Coinglass’s derivative market data reveals a 60% increase in the Open interest in the token, pushing it to $156.06M. This represents the investor’s heavy interest and confidence in the token, fueling the Fartcoin price rally. If the trend continues, the token could reach higher heights as the momentum builds up with strong buyer demand. Some analysts even call it the next Dogecoin and PEPE, with high returns, further price rallies, and potential targets. Fartcoin To Hit These 3 Targets Next Since its launch in October 2024, the Fartcoin price has surged 218380%. Many crypto investors benefited from this growth. One crypto trader made $18M , showcasing Fartcoin’s constant rallies. With many similar stories and continuous development, investors are eyeing this crypto token, which explains the high trading volume and open interest. However, despite the price rally, it is now range-bound between the recent low and high. As a result, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.936 is the new critical point. A bounce from this crucial point favors a further price rally, which the investor’s positive sentiments, interest, and strong bullish momentum will support. If the Fartcoin token maintains the bull’s dominance, it will likely hit three prime targets at $1.749, $2,476, and $3.202 based on the Fibonacci extension level. More precisely, if it reaches the 161.8% Fibonacci extension level, it may hit the first target at $1.749, which is an upside target, offering an early profit-taking opportunity. A breakout above this will push the token to 261.8% Fibonacci extension level, reaching the price target of $2.476. Lastly, the most optimistic rally could propel the meme coin to a 361.8% Fibonacci extension level and the Fartcoin price to hit $3.202. Bottom Line The Fartcoin token is among the most trending meme coins due to its constant upward movement. More importantly, it is among the market’s top performers at present after its 75% rally past the market crash. With its high demand, bullish momentum, and favorable market trend, it could move higher on the charts. Although there is significant risk and trend reversal with investor sentiments and macroeconomic events, a surge above the critical $0.936 point could confirm a further upward movement, pushing the Fartcoin price as high as $3.302.

Sui: Revolutionizing Blockchain Development Sui is reshaping the blockchain ecosystem with its innovative framework and strategic expansion. Its initial Hydropower Accelerator program successfully nurtured twelve projects across various sectors, including DeFi and decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN). Sui’s Total Value Locked (TVL) reached $1.8 billion in Q4 2024, fueled by partnerships and integrations. In 2024, Raoul Pal, CEO of Real Vision, highlighted that the token has entered a highly bullish phase, with the potential to surpass even Solana and Ethereum this year. Currently, SUI trades at $4.83, reflecting a 320% rise over the past year. 3. Solana: Poised for a Comeback in 2025 Despite recent fluctuations in the market, SOL remains steady below $190, indicating the possibility of a substantial rebound. A decline in trading volumes due to sell fatigue suggests that bearish momentum might be dwindling. Analysts are optimistic about forthcoming catalysts, such as the potential approval of Solana ETFs, which could lead to significant growth. The ecosystem surrounding Solana is strong, and institutional interest is climbing. Therefore, this consolidation phase could serve as an ideal entry point for those aiming to achieve millionaire status. 4. Bitget Token: Soaring Towards New Heights Bitget Token (BGB) recently experienced a 12% increase, surpassing $6.72, with trading volumes soaring by 101%, indicating strong bullish momentum. The token has climbed to $7.08, inching closer to its all-time high of $8.45. Key factors driving this growth include its integration with Morph Chain for improved utility and a supply-reducing token burn. Additionally, Bitget’s authorization to operate in El Salvador as a Bitcoin Service Provider enhances its global presence. With technical indicators suggesting ongoing growth and a potential push towards $8.50, BGB represents a promising asset for converting small investments into significant wealth. 5. Dogecoin: The Memecoin with Millionaire Potential Although DOGE recently saw a 10% decrease, it is showing signs of a potential breakout. Its high-risk, high-reward profile attracts investors, making it particularly popular in volatile markets. Earlier this year, whale accumulation surged by 400%, pushing DOGE to $0.40 before market pressures caused a retreat. Current trading indicators suggest bullish momentum, and historical trends indicate a potential rebound. Currently priced at $0.34, a decisive move beyond $0.40 could lead to the $1 milestone. Dogecoin has the potential for explosive gains, making it a top pick for transforming modest investments into fortunes in 2025. 6. Ripple: Set for a Millionaire-Making Surge Ripple’s XRP is gearing up for significant gains. Market analysts like Peter Brandt predict a possible threefold increase if it breaks out of its current bullish flag pattern. The token is currently priced at $2.50 after a 5% rise in the past week. On-chain metrics also reveal strong buying interest, positioning XRP for a breakout towards $4.78 or higher. Should it achieve a $500 billion market cap, the price could rise to $8.68. This scenario isn't far-fetched, given the anticipation for a legal resolution and the expected approval of a Ripple Spot ETF. As a result, XRP presents a remarkable wealth-building opportunity in 2025. 7. Cookie DAO: The Leading Index for AI Agents Cookie DAO stands as the largest index and data layer for AI agents, gaining traction as these agents proliferate in the crypto space. Its recent listing on Binance has sparked a significant price surge. The token has increased approximately 2315% from its lowest point and 739% in the last month. Cookie DAO’s unique position as the first project to aggregate and index live data from all agents has garnered investor interest. The token is expected to further grow in 2025 as AI agents continue to be a hot topic. 8. Cardano: Eyeing a $3 Rally Cardano (ADA) could soon break the $1 barrier it has tested multiple times. Currently trading at $0.99, ADA exhibits signals of escaping a bullish continuation pattern. Analysts forecast a target of $3 if Cardano can overcome this crucial resistance. A successful breakout could lead to substantial gains, making it an appealing option for investors looking to increase their wealth. With its strong technical foundation and ongoing development, ADA could be your ticket from the daily grind to financial success this year. 9. Pepe Coin: A Potential for an 8X Surge Pepe Coin (PEPE) has the potential to be among the leading cryptocurrencies that can help you break free from your 9-to-5 job. Despite recent market corrections, key on-chain metrics indicate it’s ready for a significant rebound. PEPE has seen a decline in exchange supply, and its bullish MVRV indicator suggests it may be undervalued. Analysts predict an 8x surge, particularly if it can breach essential resistance levels. With whales holding firm and Bitcoin possibly rising above $100,000, Pepe Coin could benefit from renewed investor confidence. If it reaches its previous all-time high, a 65% increase is feasible in the short term. Final Thoughts These nine cryptocurrencies could transform your 9-5 struggle into millionaire status. Among the standout options listed, Rexas Finance (RXS) emerges as the premier choice for those eager to escape the daily grind. Its innovative approach to real-world asset tokenization and impressive presale performance make it truly unique. Currently in its presale phase, it offers investors the opportunity to get in early and benefit from its growth. With the token priced at $0.175, now is an ideal time to invest.

These attacks target blockchain tech, crypto exchanges, and digital asset custodians globally. The three nations suggest that the DPRK’s cyber program poses a huge threat to the integrity and stability of the international financial system. The advanced persistent threat groups. like the infamous Lazarus Group, are responsible for numerous exploits to steal crypto assets. The massive hack of over $230 million of an Indian crypto exchange, WazirX, was carried out by the same entity. North Korea’s cyber heists As per the release , the three countries are working together to prevent thefts initiated by North Korea and to recover stolen funds. They hold an ultimate goal of cutting out the DPRK’s illicit revenue for its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs. Just in 2024 alone, the DPRK has been linked to the DMM Bitcoin theft of $308 million, the Upbit hack of $50 million, and the Rain Management exploit for $16.13 million. It also mentioned the massive hacks of WazirX for $235 million and Radiant Capital for $50 million. It added that the United States government has observed aggressive targeting of the crypto industry by the DPRK. The hackers came in well-disguised, deploying malware such as TraderTraitor, AppleJeus, and others. However, Japan and the Republic of Korea also observed similar trends and tactics. The top agencies from the three countries have published several notifications regarding the DPRK information technology workers, as this also presented an insider threat to private sector partners. They propose a deeper collaboration among the public and private sectors of the three countries. This is essential to disrupt malicious actors’ cybercrime operations and secure the international financial system. Lazarus stole $659M in 2024 The North Korean hackers reportedly stole at least $659 million through crypto loots in 2024. The United Nations has estimated that these exploiters have stolen around $3 billion worth of crypto between 2017 and 2023 to fund its sanctioned nuclear weapons programs. Chainalysis reported the funds stolen jumped by around 21% YoY to $2.2 billion in 2024. It highlighted that the number of individual hacking incidents increased from 282 in 2023 to 303 last year. Meanwhile, the intensity of crypto hacking shifted about halfway through the year. It added that the cumulative value stolen between January 2024 and July 2024 already reached $1.58 billion. It was around 84.4% higher than the value stolen over the same period in 2023.

At this point, with an XRP and Solana ETF expected to gain approval in 2025 under the pro-crypto Trump administration, JPMorgan has estimated that the XRP and SOL ETFs could attract net inflows of over $15 billion. Banking giant JPMorgan has estimated that a spot XRP ETF could attract impressive inflows of between $3 billion and $8 billion. Stating that Solana could experience the same rate of inflow as XRP, JP Morgan analysts predicted that XRP and SOL ETFs could attract a total net inflow of more than $15 billion. Analysts noted that their predictions were based on the performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs launched last year. Apart from JPMorgan, VanEck head of digital assets research Matthew Sigel also estimated that SOL and XRP ETFs have the potential to attract inflows of $3-6 billion and $4-8 billion, respectively, based on the performance of BTC and ETH ETFs. While many companies have already applied to launch an XRP ETF in the US, there are important names such as Bitwise and WisdomTree.

With the political shift, TON blockchain is positioning itself to capitalize on the evolving opportunities in the U.S. market. TON Blockchain Eyes US Growth Backed by Trump’s Pro-Crypto Policies In a recent post on X , TON blockchain has expressed optimism about expanding into the United States under the Trump presidency. Donald Trump’s administration has pledged to position the U.S. as a global leader in the digital asset space. Trump’s plans include creating a Bitcoin strategic reserve and establishing a more welcoming environment for blockchain innovation. The TON blockchain aims to leverage these favorable conditions. Its network, which serves 950 million Telegram users, offers in-app payments and gaming capabilities, powered by its native token, Toncoin. This integration positions TON blockchain as a key player in the blockchain ecosystem, with an eye on capturing the expanding U.S. market. Notably, the entire crypto community has shown much optimism with the incoming Trump presidency. In a recent report, stablecoin issuer Circle announced a $1M USDC donation to Trump’s inaugural fund. Leadership Transition: Manuel Stotz to Steer TON Blockchain’s US Focus As part of its U.S. expansion strategy, the TON Foundation has appointed Manuel Stotz as its new president. Stotz, the founder of Kingsway Capital, brings extensive investment experience in emerging markets and blockchain technology. His appointment signals the foundation’s intent to establish a robust presence in the United States. Stotz succeeds Steve Yun, who has been instrumental in shaping the foundation’s vision. Yun will continue to serve on the board, providing strategic guidance during this transition. The leadership change reflects the foundation’s commitment to aligning its operations with global opportunities, particularly in the U.S. market. The new president Manny Stotz emphasized, “TON is uniquely positioned to lead the blockchain revolution. I look forward to working with our partners and stakeholders to accelerate this mission—especially in the dynamic and innovative US market.” More so, the crypto community is optimistic about Q1 2025, as industry leaders push for a federally-backed U.S. Bitcoin reserve under Trump’s administration. The Bitcoin Policy Institute has proposed allocating $21 billion to build the reserve, urging executive orders to secure banking access for crypto firms and establish a dedicated crypto council. Toncoin Price Action Toncoin is an important part of the TON blockchain, and it is the network’s native cryptocurrency. It provides a smooth payment method within the application and encompasses gaming features for millions of Telegram users. The foundation’s expansion into the United States will drive Toncoin utility in a favorable US regulatory environment. Consequently, Toncoin price has experienced fluctuations in response to these developments. As of this writing, Toncoin (TON) is $5.35 per token, an increase of 3% within the last 24 hours. The market capitalization is $13.57B, and the trading volume in the last 24 hours is $188.13M.

While top ten coins like Dogecoin and Solana are unlikely to deliver the outsized gains most investors are seeking with cryptocurrency, they remain solid safety nets for returns around 5x, providing stability and a hedge for diversified portfolios. For those aiming for parabolic returns in the 50x-100x range this bull run, Remittix stands out as a strong contender. With the cross-border payment sector at its core, Remittix is in its early presale phase and boasts potential growth of over 5000% in a bullish case scenario. Here’s the rundown on Remittix’s bullish potential. Short-Term FUD Likely To Be A Blip In Solana’s Long-Term Trajectory Recent whale activity has raised caution among Solana investors, with a notable transfer of 149,999 SOL, valued at $27.9 million, from an unknown wallet to Binance. This transaction has sparked concerns about potential selling pressure or strategic repositioning, contributing to short-term market uncertainty for Solana alongside wider bearish market conditions. Currently trading at $186, Solana faces fluctuations and hesitant buyer sentiment as the market evaluates its troubling trajectory. Despite this, Solana continues to solidify its position as a leading layer-1 blockchain, having processed 66.9 million daily transactions even in bearish conditions last month. Institutional interest is growing, with Grayscale and 21Shares filing for Solana-based ETFs and developers working on a ""lattice-based homomorphic hashing function"" to enhance scalability and efficiency. These advancements position Solana for significant growth, with potential 2-5x returns expected in this cycle, keeping it competitive in the evolving blockchain landscape and continuing its 2024 hot streak where Solana was the trendiest layer-1 overall. Elon Musk And Donald Trump’s Inauguration Could Propel Dogecoin To Further Heights Dogecoin has shown resilience despite a 17% decline this week, buoyed by increased whale activity and ongoing speculation about Elon Musk's potential integration of Dogecoin into his envisioned ""X Money"" payments platform. Musk’s long-standing fascination with Dogecoin, paired with support from the pro-crypto Trump administration and the “Department Of Government Efficiency” (DOGE), also act as potential bullish catalysts for a strong Dogecoin recovery in 2025. Currently trading near $0.33, Dogecoin’s history of rebounding from market slumps suggests it could recover alongside other meme coins as market conditions improve. While a repeat of its monumental 2021 performance is unlikely due to market cap limitations, sustained whale accumulation and Dogecoin’s enduring cultural appeal position Dogecoin for steady growth, reinforcing its role as the #1 leading meme coin.

Currently priced at $186, Solana is experiencing volatility and cautious buyer sentiment as the market assesses its troubling path. Nonetheless, Solana continues to reinforce its status as a premier layer-1 blockchain, processing 66.9 million transactions daily, even during last month's bearish conditions.

Is TRX a good investment? TRX is a coin with utility that continues to trade higher, indicating growing adoption among crypto investors. Despite this, the coin remains a victim of uncertainties and volatility. Our Cryptopolitan price prediction explores the expected movements from 2025 to 2031. Why is Tron up? Tron is bullish during the day. However, the coin has increased to $0.2245 amidst rising buying activity, which resulted in a noticeable recovery. TRX lost considerable value amidst a growing selling trend in the past week. Will Tron reach $0.5? Yes, Tron should rise above $0.5 in 2026. During that period, its price will range between $0.577 and $0.734. Will Tron reach $1? Yes, Tron should rise above $1 in 2028. During that period, its price will range between $1.10 and $1.26. Will Tron reach $10? Per expert analysis, Tron may not reach $10 before 2031. Does Tron have a good long-term future? According to the Tron price predictions, Tron is set to trade higher in the coming years. However, factors like market crashes or difficult regulations could invalidate this bullish theory.

Tron historic price sentiment TRON price history Tron, founded by Justin Sun in 2017, raised $70 million through an ICO the same year; it launched its mainnet in May 2018 and migrated TRX from Ethereum to Tron in June, which temporarily boosted TRX’s price to $0.09. TRX reached an all-time high of $0.3004 in January 2018 before dropping below $0.05 a month later; it consistently traded under $0.05 until late 2020, when it began to rise again. In 2021, it reached a high of $0.16. Tron was also reorganized as a DAO as Justin stepped down as CEO of Tron Foundation. TRX was in a bear trend for the best part of 2022. In 2023, TRX maintained a consistent bull run, rising from a low of $0.05. In March 2023, the SEC sued Justin for allegedly selling unregistered securities and promoting Tron and Bittorent tokens. In February 2024, Circle’s announcement to cease USDC on Tron led TRX to correct from $0.1429. TRX held above $0.1234 until mid-May, then dropped to $0.1113. The price rebounded to $0.1398 in July but fell again to $0.1213 in early August. By late September, TRX recovered to $0.166, reaching $0.1691 in October and touching $0.2130 in late November. TRX ended 2024 with a price tag of $0.255. At the start of 2025, Tron is trending near $0.264.",Crypto Price Predictions|TRON,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|ICO|LINK|MARKET|TRADING|TRX|USDT|BNB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-01-14 15:58:00

33767162,[object Object],1736870400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Cardano Price At Risk Of 15% Crash, Analyst Warns It Might Get ‘Bloody’",https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-price-risk-15-crash/,"The Cardano price currently finds itself in a risky position, and technical analysis highlights the possibility of a significant price correction. The analysis, conducted on the 4-hour candlestick chart and shared on TradingView, points to a potential 15% decline for the Cardano price in light of a recent break below the Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). Cardano Price Breaks Below EMAs To Open Up Bearish Scenario As noted by a crypto analyst (SwallowAcademy) on the TradingView platform , Cardano started the week with four consecutive bearish candles on the 4-hour timeframe, leading to a drop below the drop below Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs). This drop below the EMAs on the 4-hour timeframe has triggered some sort of bearish outlook, which in turn opens up the risk of the Cardano price falling further in a short-term timeframe. With the possibility of more price decline in mind, technical analysis shows there isn’t any liquidity zone close to the current price action to act as a quick support level for Cardano. The closest support level is about 7% away from the current Cardano price, and the analyst suggests that the cryptocurrency could revisit this level aat round $0.83. Should this support fail, the analyst warns of an additional 8% drop, pushing the Cardano price further down quickly to $0.76. All in all, this would represent a quick 15% drop from the current Cardano price by the end of the week, a movement that the analyst noted could be bloody. “Eyes wide open here; it might get bloody,” the analyst said. Bearish Scenario Can Be Invalidated Although the bearish scenario is still in place, the analyst also provided a potential scenario that could invalidate this outlook. A strong upward bounce from here could send Cardano’s price above the $0.98 mark and a quick shift in the short-term price outlook. Such a rebound would bring Cardano back above the EMAs and indicate renewed bullish momentum to reduce the risk of further declines. In such a case, the analyst noted that Cardano would be able to push above $1.02 and eventually reach $1.2 to $1.3 in the next few days. At the time of writing, Cardano is trading at $0.9544 and is up by 1.57% in the past 24 hours. Hopefully, the cryptocurrency can continue this upward movement to invalidate the bearish scenario. Ultimately, the next few days will determine which scenario will play out for the Cardano price. If the bearish case unfolds as anticipated, the 15% correction could create new challenges for ADA holders. On the other hand, a bounce above $0.98 would reignite optimism for Cardano to retest $1.2, which is its highest price level in over two years, and ultimately break above it.",Altcoin News|Cardano|ADA|ADA news|ADA Price|adausd|ADAUSDT|Analyst|Cardano news|Cardano Price|crypto|Crypto Analyst|crypto news,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|AXS|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|NEAR|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|FET|SEI|JUP|BSV|AGX|ZK|WLD|APE|HNT|FTT|BTG|MOG|PYUSD|MEME|RAY|ARKM|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-01-14 16:00:00

To read full editions, subscribe . Given the volatility we saw yesterday, I thought it might be a good time to do a mini temp check. We saw bitcoin briefly drop below $90,000 on Monday, and this morning we’re back up over $96,000. The volatility seems like it’s here to stay, perhaps until Inauguration Day. ETH, shadowing bitcoin’s movements, also took a tumble before regaining momentum. And then there’s top AI agent coin AI16z, which is up 21% in the past 24 hours, having bounced after undergoing its own selloff . Ah, the diversity of crypto. There’s truly nothing like it. Bitcoin’s sudden drop didn’t exactly worry Unity Wallet’s James Toledano. “The current price action may appear concerning but for those of us who have been in the space for a long time, it is simply business as usual. It doesn’t necessarily signal the end of the bull run either,” he explained. “The inauguration of President-elect Trump is just seven days away and could be a pivotal moment, with markets anticipating announcements of pro-crypto policies that might spark renewed buying interest. Institutional accumulation, as reflected in falling exchange reserves also supports the view that demand remains strong despite low trading volumes.” Pairing that with what we’ve been told by Ledn’s John Glover, we very well may close out this month with a run. Glover thinks we could see bitcoin move 20-30% higher in the next few weeks, especially given that the $91,000 level seems to be a decent support level. I am once again asking for you to be patient, especially given that we’re only a week out from the new administration. Start your day with top crypto insights from David Canellis and Katherine Ross.

The broader crypto market followed suit, with the CoinDesk 20 index rising 3.9%. Traders scrambled to reposition after new inflation data pointed to a cooling economy, triggering a risk-on rally across both cryptos and equities. Major crypto-adjacent stocks also rallied. Coinbase gained over 3%, while MicroStrategy added more than 5%. Mining companies like Mara Holdings and Core Scientific posted similar jumps, climbing roughly 5% as investors capitalized on the upward momentum. Inflation numbers change sentiment The Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed a 0.2% increase in the producer price index (PPI) for December, falling short of the 0.4% projection by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. Core CPI inflation also came in lower than expected at 3.5%, below the predicted 3.8%. These lighter-than-anticipated inflation numbers ignited optimism among investors, driving demand for growth-oriented assets like Bitcoin. However, the bond market told a different story. The yield on the 10-year Treasury surged to 4.82%, its highest level in 14 months. This rise defied expectations since softer inflation data typically signals fewer rate hikes or even potential rate cuts. Analysts were quick to dig deeper, pointing to several factors driving the bond market’s unusual reaction. The U.S. government’s massive deficit spending is one major culprit. Total public debt hit a staggering $36.2 trillion in December, with $1 trillion added in just 105 days. Projections suggest the national debt could reach $40 trillion by February 2026. Flooding the bond market with new debt has increased supply, dragging down bond prices and pushing yields higher. Uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump’s upcoming presidency has also added fuel to the fire. Tariff concerns have strengthened the U.S. dollar, putting pressure on Bitcoin. Meanwhile, term premiums—essentially the extra compensation long-term investors demand for taking on risk—are at their highest levels since the pandemic, reflecting growing unease about the economic outlook. Bitcoin traders ride the volatility Last week, Bitcoin dropped sharply after stronger-than-expected payroll data sent bond yields soaring. Investors, spooked by rising yields and Trump’s proposed tariffs, fled risk assets in droves. Despite the rollercoaster, Bitcoin is still up 3% year-to-date and remains a favorite among risk-hungry investors. Tom Lee of Fundstrat isn’t phased. Speaking on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” he said, “Bitcoin could dip to $70,000 in the short term, but the long-term trajectory remains bullish. We could see it end the year somewhere between $200,000 and $250,000.” Bitcoin price chart | Source: TradingView (JaiHamid) Crypto traders are bracing for more chaos. January was expected to be rocky, but the market’s volatility could stretch through the first quarter as inflation data and fiscal policy continue to send mixed signals. A closer look at bond yields provides more context for Bitcoin’s swings. Real yields on 30-year Treasuries—yields adjusted for inflation—have jumped more than 50 basis points since rate cuts began in Q3 2024. Source: TKL Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) yields have climbed 40 basis points during the same period. While both have risen, the moves pale in comparison to the 117 basis-point surge in the 10-year Treasury yield since the Federal Reserve started easing rates. Analysts are pointing to term premiums as the missing puzzle piece. The category, which captures risks unrelated to inflation or economic growth, has ballooned to decade-high levels.

Tron ( TRX ) fell to a low of $0.2200, down more than 50% from its December high. This decline has pushed TRX’s market cap from over $26 billion to $19 billion. In an X post on Monday, Sun recommended buying the dip, maintaining his long-held view that Tron remains highly undervalued. Sun’s bullish stance is backed by Tron’s strong fundamentals. The network ranks as the third-largest player in decentralized finance after Ethereum and Solana with a total value locked of $6.69 billion . Tron is also the market leader in Tether transactions because of its more affordable transaction costs than Ethereum. On Monday, Tron’s USDT transactions surged by 91% to $137 billion, making it one of the largest payment processors globally. The Tron blockchain currently has over 59.2 million USDT holders. Buy the dip and focus on building! 2025 will be a great year!🤞 — H.E. Justin Sun 🍌 (@justinsuntron) January 13, 2025 Tron also ranks high in the decentralized exchange industry. Since its inception, its DEX protocols have handled almost $100 billion in volume. In the last seven days, they processed tokens worth over $782 million, making it the 10th chain.

Tron active addresses and transactions | Source: CryptoQuant Tron offers competitive staking yields, making it an attractive option for holders. The network’s staking yield is currently 4.52%, supported by rising network fees and a declining circulating supply. According to TokenTerminal , Tron collected $2.21 billion in fees in the last 12 months. It even flipped Ethereum this year, making $116 million versus Ethereum’s $60 million. Tron’s circulating supply has continued falling, moving from 88.1 billion in January last year to 86.17 billion today. Tron price analysis TRX price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that Tron has dropped from $0.4487 on Dec. 4 to $0.2245 amid the broader crypto sell-off. TRX has moved below its 50-day and 100-day weighted moving averages, while key oscillators such as the MACD and Relative Strength Index (RSI) have signaled bearish momentum. However, on a positive note, Tron has formed a bullish double-bottom pattern at $0.2245, with the neckline at $0.2760. A double-bottom pattern often precedes a bullish breakout. If TRX remains above the $0.2245 support level, it suggests that the double-bottom is holding, which could lead to a recovery. However, a break below this level could push TRX down to $0.20, aligning with the ascending trendline connecting the lowest swings since June last year.

While the reason isn’t entirely clear, cynics have cited Solana’s lack of modern features as it is surpassed by newer players. Among these emerging projects are Polygon (MATIC) and Remittix (RTX). While Polygon (MATIC) excels in its support for custom blockchains, Remittix (RTX) is setting a new benchmark in the cross-border payments, and is currently showing huge promise in its presale. So will Solana bounce back in 2025, and how are Polygon and Remittix likely to perform? Polygon Sees 7% Dip In 24 Hours Despite Polygon’s (MATIC) recent price losses, the project’s unique blockchain infrastructure have led analysts to speculate on its potential. Polygon made significant technical progress throughout 2024. Notably, the AggLayer protocol was introduced, which aggregates zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) from multiple blockchains, enabling developers to connect layer 1 and layer 2 blockchains into a unified network. The aim is to provide a smoother user experience, eliminating the need for frequent bridging between different chains. From the end-user perspective, this integration now feels like using a single chain. Polygon’s (MATIC) price has fluctuated recently, dropping by a steep 25.6% in the last month, with a further 10.5% loss in the last 24 hours. Despite this, analysts remain bullish on Polygon's future given its unique infrastructure and budding strategic partnerships. Solana Continues On Downward Trend Solana (SOL) had an underwhelming 2024 and the start of this year has been no better as SOL posted a 14.9% monthly dip and a 10.7% loss in the last week. The Average Directional Index (ADX) points to growing bearish momentum, suggesting SOL may see further downside pressure soon. Solana (SOL) has tried to combat these price movements with technological improvements, having just introduced the Winternitz Vault, an optional security feature designed to enhance protection against potential future quantum computing threats. This vault generates unique cryptographic keys for individual transactions, utilizing Winternitz One-Time Signatures (WOTS) to protect users’ digital assets from modern technological risks. Despite such advancements, some analysts have criticized Solana (SOL) for lacking modern features such as improved interoperability and user-friendly developer tools that are becoming standard on other blockchain platforms. Remittix Soars Past $2.6 Million Raised In Presale Remittix (RTX) is quickly drawing an audience with its practical approach to problems in the cross-border payments space. With Remittix, users can change more than 40 cryptocurrencies to fiat currencies and transfer them to any global bank account.This functionality addresses common challenges associated with international payments, such as high fees and lengthy processing times. Of interest to businesses, Remittix offers the Remittix Pay API. This streamlines crypto acceptance as viable payment from customers, while processing payments in fiat and sending them to a nominated bank account. This feature appeals to freelancers and e-commerce platforms who want to tap into the crypto market without wrapping their heads around the complexities of digital assets. Remittix has raised $2.6 million in its presale so far, which continues to gain momentum. Its focus on privacy, efficiency and user autonomy makes the platform a potential disruptor in the $190 trillion cross-border payments industry. Some analysts project massive gains for Remittix (RTX), forecasting an 800% price upshot during the presale with a possible 5,000% rally post launch, as Remittix gears up to dominate the PayFi space.

Polygon Experiences a 7% Decrease in 24 Hours In spite of Polygon’s (MATIC) recent price declines, the project’s distinctive blockchain infrastructure has led analysts to ponder its future prospects.

Nevertheless, analysts remain optimistic about Polygon's future, given its unique infrastructure and the development of promising strategic partnerships. Solana Remains on a Downward Path Solana (SOL) had a disappointing 2024, and the beginning of 2025 has proven to be similarly bleak, with SOL experiencing a 14.9% decline over the past month and a 10.7% drop in the last week. The Average Directional Index (ADX) indicates increasing bearish momentum, hinting that SOL may face additional downward pressure soon. To counteract these price trends, Solana (SOL) has implemented technological upgrades, recently launching the Winternitz Vault. This optional security feature aims to bolster protection against potential future quantum computing threats. The vault generates unique cryptographic keys for separate transactions, employing Winternitz One-Time Signatures (WOTS) to safeguard users’ digital assets against modern technological threats. Despite these innovations, some analysts have criticized Solana (SOL) for not incorporating modern features like enhanced interoperability and user-friendly developer tools, which are becoming commonplace on other blockchain platforms.

According to a report shared with CryptoPotato , CryptoQuant carried out the survey between November and December 2024. There were 1,478 respondents, all residing in Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, the Middle East, and Oceania. Key Trends for Crypto Users in 2024 The majority of the respondents reside in Asia (40%), Europe (29%), and North America (10%). The survey asked 35 questions about user demographics, investing behavior, and crypto exchange preferences. Around 60% of the survey respondents were aged between 25 and 44, and 89% were male, indicating that the crypto industry mainly comprises young men. Roughly 50% hold a Bachelor’s degree, so the surveyees are considered a generally educated audience. Also, 62% of the respondents have been in the crypto space for over three years, reflecting an experienced user base. While a third of the surveyees revealed that they trade cryptocurrencies full-time, around half of them said they invest less than $10,000 per year. This indicates that retail investors dominated the survey. More Spot Than Derivatives Trading Binance emerged as the most preferred crypto exchange across most regions, while Coinbase dominated only in North America. Around 53% of respondents highlighted Binance as their most frequently used exchange, 48% said they hold most of their assets on the platform, while 50% acknowledged the entity as the venue they have obtained most of their profits from. The next most preferred exchanges were Bybit and Coinbase. Furthermore, the survey found that Bybit, OKX, Bitget, and Binance had a higher percentage of full-time traders, while Crypto.com, Coinbase, and Kraken housed more part-time traders. “Exchanges with more full-time traders will likely prioritize innovation in trading tools and efficiency to retain their more professional user base, focusing on advanced trading features and lower fees for high volumes,” CryptoQuant stated. Regarding favored cryptocurrencies, bitcoin ( BTC ), ether ( ETH ), and layer-2 assets emerged as the most invested in. The respondents also indicated a rising interest in integrating artificial intelligence into blockchain technology. Notably, users mainly engage in spot trading and holding on exchanges. Only 19% trade derivatives, and 3% stake their assets or participate in yield farming. Meanwhile, the respondents said they rely on independent research to make investment decisions, but also on social media and Key Opinion Leaders.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Ethereum’s slide worries investors, as whales shift to Remittix, predicted to rival XRP with its PayFi solution. Table of Contents Ethereum shakeout gets steeper, decline could continue Remittix to take cross-border payments to the next level Ripple shows resilience, could jump to $3 Why ETH whales are after Remittix as a promising crypto to buy The downward trend of Ethereum (ETH) is getting worse with each passing day, and investors are beginning to get worried. With the ETH price now testing critical support at $3,000, whales have been accumulating a new token called Remittix that has defied the bearish trend. Earning comparisons with Ripple (XRP), Remittix has been soaring in the market, pumping from $0.015 to $0.0199. With financial experts predicting that Remittix can rival and surpass XRP because of its new unique PayFi solution, top ETH whales believe that RTX could trade above $1 in 2025. Ethereum shakeout gets steeper, decline could continue On the 30d chart, the Ethereum price has plunged by 22% as the dip continues to go lower. The ongoing correction has led to ETH dropping to the $3,000 support level, per data from CoinMarketCap. This is the first time since November 2024 that the ETH price would trade as low as $3,000. However, there is optimistic Ethereum news as 74.7% of ETH addresses now belong to long-term holders. While it shows the commitment from investors, they are keen for a turnaround. While the Ethereum price prediction shared by Planfomo is very bullish, we could see the leading altcoin take more plunge. According to the charts shared by Planfomo, Ethereum charts across multiple timeframes are like a “bullish Russian doll.” However, the charts suggest that ETH could decline to $2,800 or as low as $2,569 before the uptrend begins. However, when the uptrend begins Planfomo believes the Ethereum (ETH) coin could rally above $5,475, making it one of the top crypto coins to keep an eye on. Remittix to take cross-border payments to the next level Cross-border transactions have been a challenging process for most people and companies in the past. Although Ripple made a stir in this $190 trillion market, it did not address the fundamental issues of expensive, lack of transparency, and slow processes. Remittix (RTX) is launching a new PayFi platform to solve these inefficiencies creating a seamless, efficient, cheap, and most importantly, transparent platform for fund transfers. Remittix is the best of both worlds, offering 50+ cryptocurrencies for payments that users can swap for over 30 fiat currencies. By linking fiat wallets with cryptocurrencies, Remittix cuts out middlemen and fees and provides users with faster transfer times. Remittix is also handy for international payments within the DeFi space as the funds can directly be transferred to bank accounts worldwide. Industry experts believe Remittix can become the standard for payments, especially for international businesses. As Remittix rises to this level, they believe the RTX coin can skyrocket toward $1 in 2025. Remittix has already raised $2.7 million and pumped from $0.015 to $0.0199, showing the potential of one of the best cryptos. Ripple shows resilience, could jump to $3 Among the top 10 altcoins, Ripple has shown the greatest strength, defending most of its key support levels. According to CoinMarketCap, the XRP coin has held the $2.4 support level, managing to gain 1% over the last 30 days, while other coins plunged. Although the Ripple coin appears to be in consolidation, FrankTrades has advised investors to use bigger timeframes so they can see “the bigger picture.” The Ripple price chart shared by FrankTrades shows that XRP is breaking out of a descending trendline. According to the analyst, XRP could break out and trade as high as $3 soon. The 1D price chart of La Derecha Cripto has set a higher target. According to the trader the Ripple crypto could trade as high as $3.5 by February. Why ETH whales are after Remittix as a promising crypto to buy The current trend of Ethereum has been less than desirable, while Ripple doesn’t offer much explosive growth anymore. This is why whales have been turning to Remittix. The newer crypto is strategically positioned in a $190 trillion market, giving it more growth potential than the rest of the market.

Among the listed groups was the notorious Lazarus Group-a bunch of hackers connected with some of the biggest cyber thefts in history aimed at funding ballistic missile and weapons programs of North Korea via Web3 platforms . This is the warning that echoes concerted efforts in trying to confront such threats. The three governments pledged to disrupt the illicit activities, recovering such stolen funds with the eventual aim of blocking access by the DPRK to revenues for its illegal activities. Staggering 2024 Crypto Losses In 2024, North Korean hackers stole more than $1.34 billion in cryptocurrency, up 102% from $660 million in 2023, due to 47 incidents of theft, including several high-profile attacks: the $305 million DMM Bitcoin hack, the $230 million WazirX hack, and the $50 million Upbit breach, among many other things. According to Chainalysis, North Korea-affiliated cybercrime accounted for more than 61% of all cryptocurrency stolen worldwide in 2024. This exponential surge in the volume of stolen assets speaks volumes about an increasingly large-scale and sophisticated operation. Financial System Implications This sets the scene for rampant increases in cryptocurrency theft, including major risks to the global financial system. The US, Japan, and South Korea called out in a statement that this was a threat requiring an urgent response through cooperation with the public and private sectors. The assets have also been linked to funding North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs, underlining further geopolitical stakes. Shifting Methods of North Korean Hackers The methods used by North Korean hackers are becoming increasingly advanced. Chainalysis noted a surge in hacks yielding over $50 million in 2024, with several exceeding $100 million. This trend suggests that hackers are targeting larger and more lucrative exploits, refining their strategies to maximize returns. These developments show that international cooperation is in high demand to take proactive measures for safeguarding the integrity of the industry and, more generally, of the whole financial ecosystem. Governments and industry leaders must work together to stay ahead of these evolving threats.",Blockchain|Regulation|Web3,EN,0,0,ASIA|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-01-14 16:14:24
