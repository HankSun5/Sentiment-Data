Over seven million email addresses from that incident are now in the public domain. The ecosystem became aware of the update via 23pds, SlowMist’s Chief Information Security Officer’s post on X. The OpenSea Response to the Initial Breach 23pds notes that this leakage of users’ email addresses increases the risks for the affected users. Primarily, malicious actors could target them in a phishing email scam to attempt to dispossess them of their funds. Although the leak initially occurred two years ago, in 2022, the data did not get widely circulated back then. However, the current development means all the information is accessible to everyone. This accessibility makes them most vulnerable to fraud attacks. Notable figures, companies, crypto influencers, and others in the crypto industry are among those whose email addresses have been compromised. Analysts suggest that the rate of phishing scams might spike as malicious actors have been known to target high-profile individuals and accounts . This allows them to rake in high financial reward if their attack is successful. Will Phishing Mail Scams Spike? For perspective, OpenSea realized in June that one of its employees for its email automation provider, Customer.io, had exploited their access to download users’ email addresses. This employee shared the downloaded addresses with an unauthorized third party. At the time, OpenSea proactively alerted its users to assume their information had been compromised. However, the full dataset remained under limited circulation until now, when it is publicly accessible to everyone, including malicious actors. 23pds post serves as a cautionary note for users to remain vigilant, especially those who might be affected by the leak. It taxed them to be on the lookout for suspicious emails and take appropriate security measures to protect themselves. Experts Call for Vigilance and Preventive Measures Notably, phishing scams lure users into parting with sensitive information. These include such details as login credentials and personal data by pretending to emanate from official channels. Tech experts have also urged users to beware of airdrops, buzz offerings , and other reward programs. They advised users to double-check any offer of free tokens with links in emails to claim such rewards as they could be phishing scams from fraudsters.

Leading the charge, Render has seen a notable 30% rise in price, aiming for an all-time high. In parallel, Token Spritz has formed a significant alliance with Atleta Network to push forward Web3 advancement. Yet, Web3Bay , often referred to as 3BAY, is transforming e-commerce. Its innovative approach connects traditional Web2 and futuristic Web3, allowing users to purchase digital assets and tangible goods with digital currency. Already, it has secured over $630,000 in its initial sales phase, proving increasing trust in its potential to overtake established e-commerce leaders like Amazon and Alibaba. Is Render Set to Reach New Peaks? Starting 2025 with momentum, Render has experienced a 30% increase in price, solidifying its position in the AI-driven digital asset market. Market experts suggest that Render’s price could climb to $11.50 and may even reach up to $14.32, marking new peaks. This progress comes after a tough 2024 for AI-driven digital assets like Render, which saw lackluster performances. Yet, Render’s journey to consistent growth faces challenges. Previous resistance at the $11.50 level has led to declines, and current patterns suggest possible downward adjustments from peak prices. Dropping below $6.50 might indicate a downturn, urging caution among digital asset holders. Token Spritz & Atleta Network Unite for Web3 Progress The partnership between Token Spritz and Atleta Network is a significant move for Web3 progress. Atleta’s layered blockchain architecture emphasizes a transparent, secure, and resilient digital environment. Together, they aim to create user-friendly decentralized applications (dApps) that meet a wide range of needs. Announced under the slogan “Together, Stronger,” this collaboration highlights their combined commitment to advancing Web3 through leading-edge technologies. Despite its potential, the success of this partnership hinges on overcoming scalability issues and ensuring steady user engagement. Although efficient, Atleta’s system may encounter competition from other blockchain platforms, which could affect its widespread adoption. Traditional E-Commerce Giants Face Challenge from Web3Bay’s Innovative Model Web3Bay is revolutionizing online commerce with its blockchain-based platform, which starkly contrasts with conventional methods by emphasizing transparency, security, and user empowerment. This model addresses critical concerns such as data privacy and centralized control which plague traditional platforms. By integrating cryptocurrency payments with standard methods like PayPal, Web3Bay provides a fluid shopping experience for a broad audience, enabling them to buy digital assets effortlessly. Its decentralized nature distinguishes it from industry giants like Amazon and Alibaba, who often receive criticism for data privacy breaches and high transaction fees. Blockchain technology ensures data security and ownership, fostering unmatched trust and access. With over 180 million 3BAY tokens sold in presales and $630,000 amassed, Web3Bay’s growing momentum underlines the market’s confidence in its novel approach to e-commerce. Currently, tokens are priced at $0.0039675, offering an early entry into the Web3Bay community, which could yield significant returns as it gains market presence. As the token price rises with each presale stage, early participants could see a substantial return on investment upon launch. As demand for decentralized platforms increases, acquiring 3BAY tokens now not only secures unique benefits but also ensures participation in a platform poised to redefine e-commerce’s future. With a limited number of 3BAY tokens available, the opportunity to join this groundbreaking shift is closing fast, urging potential buyers to act quickly. Capture the Moment! The expanding crypto market presents distinct opportunities, with Render and Token Spritz at the forefront. Render’s potential all-time high underscores its strong presence in the AI digital asset sphere. Meanwhile, Token Spritz’s collaboration with Atleta Network lays the groundwork for Web3 advancement. Among emerging projects, Web3Bay stands out as a transformative force in e-commerce. Its decentralized model merges Web2 and Web3 functionalities, enabling users to acquire digital assets and physical goods with enhanced security and transparency. As platforms that blend blockchain advantages with practical applications become increasingly sought after, the chance to secure 3BAY tokens at the current price is fleeting.

38917089,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=674650,1736809222,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Solana Consolidates In A Bullish Pattern – A Breakout ‘Could Spark A 40% Move’,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-consolidates-in-a-bullish-pattern-a-breakout-could-spark-a-40-move/,"Solana (SOL) finds itself at a critical juncture as the broader crypto market weathers a bearish consolidation phase. Since January 6, Solana has shed over 20% of its value, with losses extending to more than 33% since late November, reflecting the challenging conditions across the sector. Related Reading: XRP Scores A Lower High Break On Daily – ATH Next? This downturn has placed Solana under the spotlight as both investors and analysts closely monitor its next move. Top analyst Ali Martinez recently shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Solana is currently consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern—a formation often seen during periods of indecision in the market. This pattern suggests that Solana could either break out and recover or break down and continue its descent, depending on upcoming market catalysts. A decisive move for Solana could set the tone for the weeks ahead. While the bearish sentiment weighs heavily on the market, Solana’s position as a leading altcoin keeps it in focus for investors seeking potential opportunities. All eyes are now on the symmetrical triangle as traders prepare for the volatility that a breakout or breakdown could bring. Will Solana regain its momentum, or is further downside in store? Solana Faces Critical Consolidation As Market Awaits Next Move Solana, often hailed as a market leader since 2023, has faced significant headwinds in recent weeks. The altcoin has struggled to maintain crucial support levels, with consistent losses placing it in a precarious position. Once a beacon of strength, Solana now finds itself grappling with bearish sentiment, testing investor patience and market resilience. Top analyst Ali Martinez shared a technical analysis on X, revealing that Solana is consolidating within a symmetrical triangle—a formation known for signaling potential volatility. According to Martinez, a breakout above $214 or a breakdown below $183 could trigger a 40% move in either direction, making this a critical moment for SOL. With the price currently hovering below the bearish target, a close below today’s levels could confirm a further correction and send Solana spiraling toward lower support zones. Despite these challenges, not all hope is lost. Solana’s robust fundamentals and its historical ability to recover could pave the way for a quick bounce or a period of sideways consolidation. A reversal in market sentiment, driven by macro or ecosystem-specific catalysts, could propel Solana back into bullish territory. However, the path forward depends heavily on how SOL navigates the current triangle formation. Related Reading: Whales Buy 470 Million Dogecoin In 48 Hours As Price Tests Crucial Demand Level – Details As investors brace for potential volatility, the coming days will likely determine whether Solana can reclaim its leadership status or succumb to further selling pressure. A decisive move is imminent, and market participants are keeping a close eye on these critical price levels. Will Solana defy the bears and stage a recovery, or is a deeper correction on the horizon? The next steps will define Solana’s trajectory in this uncertain market climate. SOL Tests Key Demand Level Solana is currently trading at $177, testing the critical support provided by the daily 200 exponential moving average (EMA). This level has historically served as a stronghold for bullish reversals, making it a pivotal area for SOL to defend in the face of broader market declines. The ongoing market downturn has placed significant pressure on Solana, highlighting the importance of maintaining the $175 level. If the price can stabilize and hold above this mark, it may signal a potential rebound or at least a pause in the bearish momentum. However, failing to secure support here could result in further downside, with the next significant support zone around $155. Market participants are closely monitoring these levels as Solana navigates this critical phase. The daily close will be crucial in determining whether SOL can maintain its structure and build a foundation for recovery or if it risks deeper corrections. A breakdown below the $175 mark would likely intensify selling pressure, potentially triggering additional losses as the market searches for equilibrium.

Among these, 1Fuel has emerged as a leading contender. This development reflects a broader market trend in which meme coin investors—like Shiba Inu and PEPE owners—are increasingly leaning toward tokens that provide both functionality and long-term value. With an ongoing presale selling over $135,000,000 coins at $0.015 per token, 1Fuel is swiftly emerging as the best cryptocurrency to buy right now. Read on to find out why. Shiba Inu and PEPE: Recent market performances At the time of writing, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile, especially among meme coins like PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB). Though the SHIB ecosystem has grown, particularly with the Shibarium Layer-2 network, which has completed over 600 million transactions—the Shiba Inu coin has seen recent reductions in market value. According to CoinGecko, SHIB's price has dropped -8.4% over the past seven days, underperforming both the global cryptocurrency market and GMCI 30 Index coins. Meanwhile, PEPE was introduced in 2024 to renowned exchange platforms such as Coinbase and Binance.US. has also experienced some devaluation in the past days. The price of Pepe has dropped 12.9% over the past seven days, underperforming both the global cryptocurrency market and Ethereum Ecosystem coins. Although the recent underperformance by SHIB and PEPE does not diminish their overall market value, a prevailing sense of caution lurks among meme coin investors due to the inherently speculative nature of these tokens. 1Fuel’s DeFi value proposition 1Fuel's prominence stems from its capacity to bridge the gap between speculative buzz and actual use. Unlike Shiba Inu and PEPE, which gained momentum through virality and community driven movements, 1Fuel is founded on utility driven applications that meet the evolving demands of the DeFi industry. The network offers a wide range of offers for investors on the lookout for the best cryptocurrency investment. 1Fuel allows users the liberty to choose the coin they intend to trade. The wallet then simplifies all related intricacies, ensuring that cross chain transactions are straightforward. Cross chain transactions can be pricey, especially if they include several phases, such as linking fees and token swaps. But 1Fuel lessens these expenses by identifying and implementing the most effective transaction procedures. 1Fuel’s edge over meme coins Shiba Inu and PEPE owners are no strangers to risky moves and speculative operations.

Namun, para analis memprediksi bahwa tahun ini akan menjadi puncak bull market. Jika prediksi tersebut benar, ini mungkin menjadi waktu yang sempurna untuk menambah kripto baru ke dalam portofolio Anda. Berikut adalah 5 kripto terbaik untuk dibeli demi potensi keuntungan hingga 100x tahun ini: Wall Street Pepe Wall Street Pepe adalah proyek baru yang menghadirkan angin segar bagi sektor meme coin. Proyek ini menghidupkan kembali semangat pergerakan Wall Street Bets tahun 2021, membangun komunitas pedagang sehari-hari yang bersatu untuk mengalahkan whale di permainan mereka sendiri. Dengan memanfaatkan karakter utama siklus ini, yaitu Pepe, proyek ini menawarkan serangkaian alat perdagangan dan hadiah komunitas untuk membantu anggotanya meraih kemenangan di pasar. Fitur-fiturnya meliputi sinyal perdagangan, pilihan meme coin, grup insider trading, staking, dan hadiah perdagangan. Pendekatan ini menciptakan efek flywheel; semakin efektif upaya perdagangan komunitas, semakin besar dana yang mereka miliki, yang dapat kembali diarahkan ke token $WEPE . Kombinasi utilitas dan elemen meme ini menarik minat banyak investor. Dalam sebulan, presale Wall Street Pepe berhasil mengumpulkan lebih dari $47,5 juta. Harga saat ini adalah $0.00036647, tetapi akan terus meningkat selama ICO, dengan kenaikan harga berikutnya dijadwalkan hari ini. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi Wall Street Pepe di sini . Solaxy Solaxy hadir untuk mengatasi masalah kemacetan yang dihadapi oleh blockchain Solana dengan membangun layer 2 pertama untuk blockchain tersebut. Layer 2 Solaxy menggabungkan transaksi dan memprosesnya di luar jaringan utama, sehingga membebaskan ruang blok Solana sekaligus menawarkan throughput transaksi yang lebih cepat dan lebih murah. Solusi ini juga menangani masalah kegagalan transaksi Solana. Berdasarkan data dari Dune Analytics, 41,78% transaksi di jaringan Solana gagal kemarin. Solaxy menyediakan lingkungan yang lebih stabil, di mana transaksi non-vote dapat diproses tanpa hambatan. Selain itu, token $SOLX dapat dibeli di jaringan Ethereum. Tim Solaxy berupaya menjembatani dua ekosistem kripto terbesar, menggabungkan volume tinggi Solana dengan infrastruktur DeFi Ethereum yang kokoh. Saat ini, $SOLX tersedia untuk dibeli melalui presale token, yang telah mengumpulkan $10 juta sejauh ini. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi presale Solaxy di sini . Flockerz Flockerz adalah meme coin yang sedang bersiap untuk terdaftar di bursa setelah mencapai kesuksesan besar dalam presale. Proyek ini dibangun berdasarkan ide desentralisasi, memberikan otonomi penuh kepada komunitasnya untuk menentukan arah masa depan proyek. Flockerz membangun organisasi otonom terdesentralisasi (DAO) di mana pengguna dapat memberikan suara pada semua keputusan penting, seperti pengelolaan anggaran, strategi pemasaran, dan bahkan proyek mana yang akan diajak bermitra. Selain itu, Flockerz memperkenalkan konsep inovatif bernama Vote-to-Earn, di mana pengguna dibayar untuk berpartisipasi dalam voting di DAO. Pendekatan ini meningkatkan keterlibatan komunitas sekaligus mendorong pengambilan keputusan yang lebih efektif. Flockerz akan terdaftar di bursa dalam 8 hari ke depan. Namun, saat ini masih menjalani presale token yang telah mengumpulkan $9,8 juta. Dengan permintaan yang tinggi dan peluncuran di bursa yang semakin dekat, ini mungkin menjadi kesempatan terakhir untuk membeli $FLOCK dengan harga rendah saat ini. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi presale Flockerz di sini . Best Wallet Token Best Wallet adalah dompet kripto baru yang saat ini mengalami pertumbuhan yang sangat pesat. Basis pengguna dompet ini meningkat dengan tingkat pertumbuhan bulanan sebesar 50%, membuktikan bahwa fitur-fitur inovatifnya berhasil menarik perhatian komunitas kripto. Fitur-fitur yang ditawarkan meliputi kartu debit kripto, agregator presale, bursa desentralisasi untuk spot dan derivatif, agregator staking, serta dukungan untuk lebih dari 60 blockchain.

Sementara itu, Best Wallet telah mengumpulkan $7 juta dari presale, menunjukkan potensi keuntungan yang signifikan bagi para investor. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi presale Best Wallet Token di sini . Meme Index Meme Index adalah platform investasi meme coin terdesentralisasi pertama di dunia. Platform ini memungkinkan pengguna untuk membeli keranjang “baskets” meme coin yang terdiversifikasi dalam satu transaksi. Dengan platform ini, investor dapat dengan mudah mendapatkan eksposur yang terdiversifikasi di sektor meme coin dengan cara yang belum pernah dilakukan sebelumnya. Beberapa bursa terpusat seperti Bitpanda dan Swissborg memang menawarkan keranjang meme coin, tetapi hanya satu jenis. Sebaliknya, Meme Index menyediakan empat jenis keranjang yang berbeda. Keranjang ini bervariasi mulai dari volatilitas rendah hingga sangat tinggi, sehingga dapat memenuhi kebutuhan investor dengan berbagai tingkat toleransi risiko dan kondisi pasar. Investor yang lebih berhati-hati mungkin memilih keranjang dengan volatilitas rendah. Di sisi lain, pedagang dapat memanfaatkan keranjang ini selama masa ketidakpastian pasar. Dalam periode bullish, investor biasanya beralih ke keranjang volatilitas tinggi untuk memaksimalkan potensi keuntungan. Token $MEMEX memegang peran sentral dalam operasional platform ini. Token ini memberikan akses ke platform, hak governance, serta hak untuk staking. Saat ini, presale untuk $MEMEX sedang berlangsung dan telah mengumpulkan $2,3 juta.

Dengan hasil presale yang luar biasa dari proyek-proyek ini, minat investor semakin meningkat, menunjukkan potensi besar untuk pertumbuhan nilai token di masa mendatang. Jika Anda mencari peluang untuk memaksimalkan keuntungan di tengah pasar yang bergejolak, token-token ini layak dipertimbangkan. Tidak ada waktu yang lebih baik untuk bertindak selain sekarang. Dengan presale yang sedang berlangsung dan momentum yang terus berkembang, ini adalah kesempatan emas untuk menjadi bagian dari proyek-proyek yang menjanjikan ini.

38918238,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=642872,1736811031,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38918238.jpeg,Top Nvidia clients delay orders of Blackwell racks due to technical glitches,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/top-nvidia-clients-delay-blackwell-orders/,"Overheating issues associated with ‘Blackwell’ racks have reportedly led Nvidia’s top customers to delay orders of the AI chip maker’s latest offering. A rack is a structure used in data centers to house chips, cables, and other essential equipment. The news comes at a time when the Biden administration announced new AI rules that raised concerns among investors, leading to a sharp sell-off in AI-related stocks, including Nvidia whose shares went down 4% in early trading Monday. Clients reportedly cut on Blackwell orders It was reported that the first shipments of racks with Blackwell chips overheated and exhibited glitches in the way chips connected to one another. According to reports, Nvidia’s major customers, that is Microsoft, Amazon’s cloud division, Alphabet’s Google, and Meta Platforms are said to have cut some orders of the chipmakers’ Blackwell GB200 racks. Reports also show that so-called hyperscalers had each placed Blackwell rack orders worth $10 billion or more. Due to this development, some customers are said to be waiting for an improved version of the racks or acquire the existing older AI chips from the manufacturer. GB200 racks with at least 50,000 Blackwell chips were being planned to be installed in Microsoft’s Pheonix facilities, the report added. However, key partner OpenAI asked Microsoft to provide it with an older generation of Nvidia’s ‘Hopper’ chips as delays popped up. Since there are other purchasers of the overheating GB200 server racks, it is now unclear how the order cuts would impact the chipmaker’s sales. The company, together with other AI-related firms is already affected by the introduction of new AI rules under the Biden administration, which include export restrictions. The Information initially reported about Blackwell’s overheating late last year adding this was going to affect other tech firms like Meta and Google that rely on the technology for their data centers. The Information further reported that the overheating arose from chips placed in server racks that were meant to support up to 72 units. As part of efforts to limit the challenge, Nvidia reportedly requested vendors to repeatedly rebuild racks. Nvidia might miss its targets The Blackwell AI chips were first unveiled in March and were supposed to hit the market in the second quarter but faced delays in deliveries subsequently affecting client deployment schedules. A Tom’s Hardware report indicated that the Blackwell AI chips release was already delayed by several months because Nvidia was working on a design flaw that affected production yields. The chips combine two silicon components into one unit meant to run times quicker than past versions in jobs like chatbot answer creation. In November Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang said the company was on track to exceed an earlier target of recording several billions in revenue from Blackwell chips in its fourth fiscal quarter. It waits to be seen how the chipmaker will achieve this with myriad of challenges arising. It comes as AI chip and technology exports are being further restricted by the US government, potentially hurting Nvidia’s sales. The Biden administration is proposing new restrictions that will limit the export of advanced computer chips used to develop AI, part of an effort to preserve America’s six-to-18 month advantage on AI over rivals such as China. The proposed framework is raising concerns of chip industry executives who say the rules would limit access to existing chips used for video games and restrict 120 countries to the chips used for data centers and AI products. Nvidia said on Monday that the proposal was not well thought after. “The proposal is misguided and said that it threatens to derail innovation and economic growth worldwide.” Nvidia. Government officials said they felt they needed to act quickly to preserve US companies’ advantage over China and other nations, an edge that could be easily eroded if competitors could stockpile chips and make further gains. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said, that “it’s critical to preserve America’s leadership in AI and the development of AI-related computer chips.” “The fast-evolving AI technology enables computers to produce novels, make scientific research breakthroughs, automate driving, and foster a range of other transformations that could reshape economies and warfare.” A tech industry group, the Information Technology Industry Council, warned Raimondo in a letter last week that a hastily implemented new rule from the Democratic administration could fragment global supply chains and put US companies at a disadvantage.

But one rising token in 2025 is drawing attention away from their LINK and XRP holders as investors seek out new blockchain projects that promise bigger & better returns. Let’s look at the key factors that led to this change in priorities and what it means for the investors in these new OFT tokens. Chainlink (LINK): A Pioneer in Decentralized Oracles Chainlink’s most famous attribute, yet most frequently miscomprehended, is its architecture that serves as the foundation of decentralized oracles through its structured approach in which smart contracts securely and reliably access professional external information. Chainlink has played a key role in the evolution of decentralized finance (DeFi), allowing for communication between on-chain and off-chain systems. It remains one of its most valuable features. Chainlink, now priced at roughly $20.10 , has demonstrated steady growth, with this year's performance at 39.63%. The gain is indeed impressive, but it feels low when compared with the appreciation of newer projects. With the advent of new blockchain opportunities like 1Fuel, many LINK holders are reassessing their strategies to add future-yielding cryptos investments to their arsenal. Chainlink’s tech is absolutely crucial, but as the market matures, it will probably also have slightly less appeal to higher-risk, higher-reward investors. This is where 1Fuel’s approach is vital, as it comes with features that solve scalability, efficiency, and interoperability problems. XRP: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments In pioneering faster and cheaper cross-border payments, XRP has enabled this revolution. XRP is a token developed by Ripple Labs that combines traditional finance with blockchain systems through its use in the remittance market. Partnerships with leading financial firms made it an accepted token for international transactions. XRP as at the time of writing, trades at $2.54 and this is a long way since its turbulent history. Still, questions about its sustainable growth remain, given regulatory restrictions and the volatility of the market. Stressing these revolutionary aspects, it has also pushed some investors to see the light in future-oriented crypto investments such as 1Fuel that translate innovation, and untapped potential. 1Fuel makes a strong case for XRP holders. With more of the market focusing on security and function, the project’s emphasis on user privacy, transaction efficiency, and cross-chain compatibility is timely. It also allows investors to be a part of its presale stages and benefit from its growth from the ground up. 1Fuel: The Emerging Contender 1Fuel (OFT) stands out as one of the most mentioned projects of 2025 in the blockchain ecosystem. It solves some of the most salient challenges to date, like interoperability, scalability, and sustainability, making it one of the most exciting emerging blockchain opportunities in the entire ecosystem today. 1Fuel has also achieved tremendous investor confidence, which has allowed it to surpass over $1 million raised in its presale stages. Stage 3 of the presale is now selling tokens at $0.015 each , with a 20% purchase bonus, making it a very appealing option for early investors. Market analysts expect re-entering onto 1Fuel to produce 1000% returns post-launch, and this has received notable insight from Chainlink and XRP investors. Moreover, the project's roadmap for 2025 and even beyond, includes connections to DeFi platforms and unique staking mechanisms. This forward-thinking approach has made them a powerhouse to be reckoned with ahead of competition within the token market and if you are looking for better gains than Chainlink and XRP, then look no further. Conclusion Investment strategies must be constantly re-evaluated due to the state of the cryptocurrency market. XRP and Chainlink holders will find a powerful opportunity awaiting the emergence of 1Fuel to enhance their portfolios. 1Fuel's innovative concept and consistent presale results are a promising combination for a project that's definitely one to watch.

In a Jan. 13 statement, Tether revealed that it had secured authorization to operate as a digital asset service provider and stablecoin issuer in El Salvador. The company cited the nation’s “forward-thinking policies, favorable regulatory environment, and growing Bitcoin-savvy community” as key reasons for the move. “This decision is a natural progression for Tether as it allows us to build a new home, foster collaboration, and strengthen our focus on emerging markets,” said Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino. He added, “By rooting ourselves [in El Salvador], we are not only aligning with a country that shares our vision in terms of financial freedom, innovation, and resilience but is also reinforcing our commitment to empowering people worldwide through decentralized technologies.” The relocation follows reports that Ardoino and Tether’s Chief Operating Officer, Claudia Lagorio, purchased property and became naturalized citizens of El Salvador in 2024. Cointelegraph reached out to Tether for further comment but received no response at the time of publication. El Salvador and Bitcoin Adoption Since President Nayib Bukele announced plans to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, El Salvador has become a hub for cryptocurrency initiatives. In 2023, Tether pledged support for one of the country’s renewable energy projects, including geothermal energy facilities. Ardoino has reportedly met with Bukele on several occasions, expressing support for the president’s efforts to attract businesses and new residents. While Bukele has claimed Bitcoin adoption has been a “net positive” for the nation, some expected benefits have yet to materialize. As of December, the Salvadoran government reported holding over 6,000 BTC, valued at more than $550 million.

Now, as holders attempt new tokens in 2025, established project leaders such as Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) will pave the way, like in 2024. Currently, there is one token making huge rounds in the market, a project that analysts are claiming could yield huge returns this year, and that token is none other than 1Fuel . With that in mind, what does the migration to 1Fuel mean for the performance and prospects for Cardano and Solana? Cardano (ADA): A Blockchain With a Strong Foundation Since its launch, Cardano , one of the main players in the crypto space, has increasingly become known for security, scalability and sustainability. Today, Cardano (ADA) serves as an open-source proof-of-stake blockchain platform founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson along with philosophy on formal verification as well as peer reviewed research. There’s a large community behind in it, and an enviable list of investors who apparently like its approach to blockchain development. As of early 2025, Cardano's current price of $1.01 has remained fairly stable for a while and has seen low volatility. Its ecosystem goes on expanding with an increasing number of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts being deployed on the platform, its growth nevertheless appears to have hit a divergence from that of other altcoins. 1Fuel has rapidly become an attractive opportunity to maximize returns for Cardano holders seeking to invest their assets elsewhere. Given its unique offerings and impressive presale results, Cardano investors are considering how high the price may go in the coming months. Solana (SOL): High-Speed Performance Meets Scalability Solana has emerged as one of the fastest-growing blockchain networks owing to its super-fast transaction speeds and low fees. With over 65,000 transactions per second , it has become a leading platform for different decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, NFT projects, and dApps. Solana’s blockchain is also extremely scalable, which is a major differentiator in a space where a lot of blockchains face congestion during peak utilization periods. As of now in January 2025, the price of Solana is a pretty solid one, we see it at $189 but it does not mean that its journey on the market was smooth. Even with the performance, Solana's price has been turbulent, weighed down by network collapses and other blockchain projects' competition. For these types of investors who have benefitted from the earlier years of Solana, 1Fuel provides the opportunity to migrate into yet another potentially more stable, high-growth token. With the 1Fuel presale gaining momentum, many Solana holders are questioning if now is the right moment to diversify into this exciting new asset. The Growing Interest in 1Fuel: What Sets It Apart? A major driving force behind the growing popularity of 1Fuel is its capacity to fulfill existing demand in the blockchain ecosystem. While others like Cardano and Solana are working well but on specific niches, 1Fuel has its sights set on new things that pull in a much larger crowd. With development focused on making DeFi more useful for investors, the platform cross-chain functionality will likely be a key part of enabling better cross-platform interaction. 1Fuel presale success, even before the official launch, is indicative of this token's appeal with analysts indicating that 1Fuel is likely to outperform the current market leaders Cardano and Solana in the coming years. Conclusion Although Cardano and Solana are still two popular options among cryptocurrency investors, 1Fuel has been attracting more interest from those seeking fresh opportunities. With the project continuing to build its momentum, Cardano and Solana holders are starting to pay very close attention to this emerging token, asking themselves if it's now time to diversify and take advantage of 1Fuel's growth potential into 2025 and beyond.

The incoming order will reverse a regulatory guideline that has shaped how financial institutions account for and custody digital assets, reports the Washington Post. “…Trump is expected to issue executive orders on the first day of his presidency that may address issues including “de-banking” and the repeal of a controversial crypto accounting policy requiring banks holding digital assets to count them as liabilities on the bank’s own balance sheet, according to a person involved with the conversations.” The expected executive order is designed to reverse SAB 121, an SEC guideline that requires certain financial entities to list even the crypto assets they hold on behalf of customers as liabilities. Crypto proponents say the guideline blocks financial institutions’ ability to enter the digital asset arena. A bill aiming to eliminate SAB 121 recently passed both the House and the Senate, but President Biden vetoed the bill.

Her concerns, outlined in a detailed 31-page letter, focus on Bessent’s stance on crypto regulation, financial deregulation, tax policies, and the challenges faced by small banks. Senator Elizabeth Warren Presses Treasury Nominee Bessent on Crypto and Tax Policies In a 31-page letter to Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent, Senator Elizabeth Warren emphasized the need for clear crypto oversight. She questioned whether the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) should have authority over stablecoins to address risks like money laundering and sanctions evasion. Warren urged Bessent to provide a plan for regulating crypto companies that pose threats to financial stability. Moreover, on tax policy, Warren challenged Bessent’s support for the 2017 tax cuts enacted during the Trump administration, which added $4.5 trillion to the federal deficit. She criticized his “3-3-3” strategy, which proposes reducing taxes, lowering the deficit, and boosting economic growth. The anti-crypto Senator demanded specifics on how Bessent would enforce the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) and address the carried interest loophole. Concerns Over Deregulation and Financial Stability Additionally, Warren scrutinized Bessent’s endorsement of deregulation, linking it to the 2008 financial crisis and the 2023 collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). She cited the Federal Reserve’s report blaming weakened regulations for SVB’s failure. More so, the anti-crypto Senator asked whether Bessent agreed with the assessment. Senator Warren asked, “Do you agree with this assessment? What’s your plan to ensure deregulation doesn’t cause another banking crisis?” Nevertheless, Warren highlighted the importance of upholding the Dodd-Frank Act, which was designed to prevent financial crises. She sought assurance that Bessent would enforce these crypto regulations and avoid policies that could lead to another economic downturn. Decline of Small Banks and Community Banking The senator also pointed out the decline of small banks, which dropped from 84% of all U.S. banks in 1994 to 52% by 2022. She raised concerns about the survival of community banks and their role in supporting small businesses. Warren questioned Bessent’s strategy to ensure smaller banks can thrive amid industry consolidation and financial instability. She also asked for Bessent’s views on proposals to limit the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) ability to sell failing banks to large institutions. Warren emphasized the need for bipartisan measures to raise deposit insurance limits for small businesses. Similarly, Elizabeth Warren criticized Republican-led efforts to cut $20 billion from the IRS budget. She warned of the impact of enforcing tax compliance for large corporations. More so, the anti-crypto Senator questioned how Bessent would maintain audit quality and recover revenue without adequate funding. Despite questioning by Senator Warren on crypto policies, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse hailed Scott Bessent as a pro-innovation choice for Treasury Secretary. Garlinghouse expressed optimism for XRP and crypto progress under Bessent, signaling potential clarity on the Ripple-SEC case.

While Dogecoin’s momentum has since slowed, this experienced investor has set their sights on a new opportunity: PropiChain . PropiChain is being hailed as the next millionaire-making crypto, combining blockchain, AI, and real estate innovation. Here’s why this trader, and many others, believe PropiChain could be the game-changer you’ve been waiting for. From Dogecoin Fame to Spotting Hidden Gems Dogecoin’s rise was nothing short of amazing, with prices soaring from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of $0.70. For early adopters, it was a life-changing event. However, Dogecoin’s current performance has slowed down, leaving investors searching for the next big thing. That’s where PropiChain steps in. PropiChain is designed to revolutionize the $300 trillion real estate market. The Dogecoin millionaire sees PropiChain as a transformative project, offering practical applications and massive growth potential that make it a standout in the crowded crypto market. What Makes PropiChain Different? PropiChain allows fractional ownership of high-value properties, breaking down barriers to real estate investment. For example, instead of needing $1 million to invest in a luxury property, you can buy fractional shares for as little as $100. This opens up real estate opportunities to everyday investors who were previously excluded from the market. This also means you can earn a portion of the rental income proportionate to your investment. It’s a tangible, ongoing revenue stream in addition to potential token appreciation. PropiChain also integrates cutting-edge AI to provide predictive market insights. Investors receive tools for anticipating trends, assessing market dynamics, and making informed decisions. For example, the platform can identify high-demand property types or forecast rental yields, helping you optimize your portfolio. Another feature is the metaverse integration. Investors can explore properties virtually, allowing them to assess layouts, locations, and features without ever leaving their homes. This immersive experience bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds, making international property investment more accessible than ever. Moreover, blockchain ensures secure and transparent transactions, eliminating the risk of fraud. Every property token and transaction is recorded immutably, providing investors with peace of mind. Additionally, smart contracts automate processes like rental payments, reducing delays and costs. PropiChain Presale: A Millionaire-Making Opportunity? PropiChain’s presale is generating significant attention, with over $2 million raised so far. Now in Stage 2, tokens are priced at $0.011, with prices expected to rise to $0.023 in Stage 3. The Dogecoin trader who turned $1,000 into $3 million believes PropiChain’s real-world utility and market potential could lead to a 30,000% surge. That means a $1,000 investment today could potentially grow to $300,000 in the future. This opportunity isn’t just for crypto veterans. PropiChain’s presale provides an affordable entry point for anyone looking to diversify their portfolio with a promising AI-driven altcoin. Why PropiChain Could Surpass Dogecoin While Dogecoin relies largely on community-driven hype, PropiChain offers real-world value. Its focus on solving inefficiencies in the real estate market gives it an edge, especially as investors increasingly prioritize utility over speculation. The Dogecoin millionaire’s endorsement underscores PropiChain’s potential to deliver exponential returns. It’s a chance to be part of a project that’s not just about token value but also about reshaping a trillion-dollar industry. Conclusion With endorsements from experienced investors and a clear roadmap for growth, PropiChain is well positioned to become the next millionaire-making crypto. Don’t wait until prices climb higher in Stage 3. Secure your spot in the presale now and join the ranks of early adopters who stand to benefit from PropiChain’s game-changing potential.

The current Polkadot price analysis suggests continuing volatility, provoking queries about its prospective performance. Simultaneously, the Bitget Token (BGB) expansion is progressing with significant cross-chain integrations and targeted strategies aimed at augmenting its utility and market value. Concurrently, Web3Bay (3BAY) is capturing significant interest in the Web3 e-commerce sector with a remarkable $630K presale, having sold over 180 million coins. At a modest price of $0.0039675, Web3Bay provides an opportunity for investors to support a platform dedicated to user autonomy, scalability, and community-oriented governance. Armed with a definitive roadmap and innovative functionalities like Layer-2 scaling and DAO governance, Web3Bay is setting itself up as a frontrunner in the decentralized e-commerce landscape. Current Trends in Polkadot Price Analysis Suggest Market Uncertainty The ongoing Polkadot price analysis indicates heightened volatility as DOT faces challenges in maintaining stability. Currently trading around $6.71, Polkadot has witnessed an 11.62% decrease, stirring unease among investors. The technical indicators suggest a downward trend, with the token positioned below the 20-day moving average and a Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 41.88, indicating subdued buyer interest. Polkadot price analysis also underscores a critical support level at $6.50, beneath which further declines could escalate selling pressures. On-chain metrics reveal $1.23 million in long liquidations, exacerbating the downward trend. Nevertheless, certain analysts hold a cautiously optimistic view, suggesting a potential rally towards the $20 threshold if Polkadot can surpass key resistance levels. Investors remain vigilant for any indicators of a market turnaround amid these challenging conditions. BGB Expansion Enhances Ecosystem Capabilities The Bitget Token (BGB) expansion is forging ahead, driven by its recent integration with Morph Chain that facilitates effortless cross-chain transfers, thus amplifying BGB’s presence in decentralized finance. Newly established liquidity pools, like the one on Bulbaswap, have amassed over $1.1 million, providing staking incentives to participants. Furthermore, BGB Token expansion strategy includes a strategic buyback and burn initiative, designed to decrease supply and augment its long-term value. Future plans to incorporate BGB with payment systems such as PayFi highlight Bitget’s dedication to broadening BGB’s utility across both decentralized and traditional markets. Web3Bay: Fusing E-Commerce with Web3 Crypto Innovations Web3Bay is reshaping online commerce through its blockchain-integrated platform, merging traditional e-commerce functionalities with cutting-edge Web3 crypto innovations. Priced at only $0.0039675, Web3Bay has successfully raised over $630K, distributing more than 180 million coins. The platform’s vision to empower users with comprehensive control over their data and assets while shopping on the Web3Bay platform is rapidly gaining traction. With aims to facilitate worldwide, unrestricted transactions and incentivize user engagement through its native 3BAY token, Web3Bay is pioneering a new era in online commerce. At its essence, Web3Bay is committed to extensive scalability and democratic governance. It is transitioning towards a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which will allow token holders to influence the platform’s strategic direction. This commitment to fostering user participation positions Web3Bay not just as another crypto endeavor but as a leader in the decentralized e-commerce revolution. To support anticipated growth, Web3Bay is integrating Layer-2 solutions like rollups to manage high transaction volumes efficiently while maintaining both speed and cost-effectiveness. Its plans to introduce NFT marketplaces, staking opportunities, and cross-chain functionality further underline its strategic expansion initiatives. For those observing from the sidelines, this presale offers a unique opportunity to invest early in a project with a transparent roadmap and a firm commitment to community and scalability. Web3Bay isn’t merely constructing a platform—it’s crafting the future of online commerce, where not participating now could mean missing out on a significant opportunity for substantial growth. In Conclusion As we observe significant movements across various blockchain projects, Polkadot price analysis continues to indicate market challenges as it attempts to stabilize, prompting caution among traders regarding future directions. In parallel, the Bitget Token (BGB) expansion is reinforcing its ecosystem with cross-chain integrations, liquidity enhancements, and strategic supply reduction tactics, bolstering its long-term potential. Meanwhile, Web3Bay is emerging as a formidable force in the Web3 crypto landscape, having raised over $630K and sold 180 million tokens. This project is revolutionizing e-commerce through user empowerment, scalability, and decentralized governance, presenting an attractive proposition for those eager to invest in the future of online commerce.

However, this volatility has led some whales to lose confidence and dump their holdings, impacting the market today. Crypto Whale Dump $22 Million of SOL On January 13, 2024, Whale Alert, a blockchain-based transaction tracker, posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a crypto whale had dumped 122,620 SOL tokens worth $21.75 million onto the Kraken cryptocurrency exchange. However, the wallet address remains unknown. 122,620 #SOL (21,748,048 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Kraken https://t.co/HIUF9pQDDf — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) January 13, 2025 This notable dump was witnessed in the market when SOL fell below its crucial support level of $175 and approached the $168 level. This initially shifted market sentiment and indicated that SOL had broken down from its crucial support level, signaling bearish price action. However, as sentiment cooled down, SOL rebounded above the support level and appears to be recovering. Solana (SOL) Price Action and Key Level According to expert technical analysis, the key level for SOL in the upcoming days is $175. SOL remains bullish as long as it holds this support level. If it sustains this level, there is a strong possibility that it could soar by 22% to reach $220 in the future. Source: Trading View Currently, the altcoin has returned to its consolidation zone, where it has remained for the last four trading days. For intraday traders, if SOL closes an hourly candle above the $193 mark, there is a strong possibility that it could witness a price surge of over 7% to reach the $207 mark. However, Solana’s bullish thesis will only hold if SOL maintains itself above the $175 level, otherwise, it may fail. Bullish Signal From Technical Analysis On the positive side, despite this price decline, SOL has held itself above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating an uptrend. Additionally, SOL’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is near the oversold area, signaling a potential price recovery that traders and investors are anticipating. Current Price Momentum Currently, SOL is trading near $183.3 and has experienced a price decline of over 2.50% in the past 24 hours. However, during the same period, its trading volume surged by 240%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors, potentially driven by SOL’s current discounted price.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-14 00:02:11

Through its X platform , Coinbase posted that the transfers for PNUT will be available on Coinbase and Coinbase Exchange in regions where Trading is supported; it further clarified: Trading will begin on or after 9 AM PT on January 14 2025 if liquidity conditions are met. Once this asset is sufficiently supplied, trading on our PNUT-USD trading pair will launch in phases. Support for PNUT may be restricted in some supported jurisdictions. ~Coinbase PNUT is gaining popularity as most exchanges continue to list it PNUT has been growing popular and gaining attention from different crypto exchanges. KuCoin was the first to announce the listing of the meme coin in early November before it began trading on November 11, 2024. Coinbase’s announcement was timely for the crypto, as it caused the coin to jump almost 30% to trade at $1.29. This is a significant shift, considering that the coin is very new in the market. Currently, the meme coin’s market capitalization stands at $1.28 billion. The New York Department of Conservation blessed the crypto society with its euthanization of squirrel mascot PNUT began with the New York Department of Conservation euthanizing a squirrel mascot named Peanut. The incident was controversial, making it viral and trending on social media. Soon, the meme transformed into a digital asset with a massive following on Crypto Twitter, reaching a significant market value. The meme coin trades above its peers, including POPCAT and MOG COIN. Its presence in serious crypto exchange platforms like Binance and Coinbase may grow the token tenfold.

Meme coins are taking over, and 2025 is shaping up to be the year of hilarious innovation paired with serious gains. Whether you’re a seasoned degen or a fresh-faced investor, the ever-evolving meme coin ecosystem offers something for everyone. These quirky tokens bring more than laughs—they deliver financial potential. Leading the charge is BTFD Coin, the breakout sensation smashing presale records with over $5.1 million raised, 64 billion coins sold, and a community of 8,200+ Bulls cheering it on. And it’s not just the numbers turning heads— BTFD Coin’s 90% APY on staking is redefining passive income opportunities in the crypto world. Hot on its heels is Notcoin (NOT), which thrives on dip-buying opportunities, and the audacious Book of Meme (BOME), bringing decentralization to meme culture. Together, they make up the trio of top new meme coins to buy this year, and each is here to shake up the space. BTFD Coin: 90% Staking APY That’ll Have You Saying “Bull-yah!” Let’s talk about BTFD Coin, the project that’s practically screaming, “Buy the dip!” It’s not just a meme; it’s a lifestyle. The presale numbers alone are jaw-dropping: over $5.1M raised, and that’s just the appetizer. But the main course? A game-changing staking feature with an insane 90% APY. Translation: your crypto can make more crypto, faster than you can say “Lambo.” Why Staking Matters for You Imagine this: You invest $3,000 into BTFD Coin at its current presale price of $0.000142 per token. That nets you approximately 21,126,760 BTFD Coins. Now, let’s say the price skyrockets to $0.0006 (a conservative projection, given the hype). Your tokens would then be worth a whopping $12,675, not including staking rewards. Factor in the 90% APY, and your wallet’s doing happy flips. More Than Just Staking BTFD Coin isn’t a one-trick pony. Its ecosystem is packed with features, from a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game that rewards players with convertible in-game tokens to a vibrant community led by the “Bulls Squad” —a cast of characters as dynamic as the coin itself. Add Ethereum’s scalability and Layer 2 solutions into the mix, and you’ve got a project built to last. With momentum like this, there’s no reason to sit on the sidelines. Join the movement, stake your claim (literally), and watch your portfolio grow. Notcoin (NOT): A Tap-to-Earn Pioneer with Dip-Buying Power Remember when games were just for fun? Notcoin says, “Let’s make it profitable, too.” This community-driven token got its start in a viral Telegram game that brought thousands into the web3 space with a simple tap-to-earn mechanic. Today, NOT is more than a game; it’s a thriving ecosystem where users can explore web3 products, contribute to projects, and earn tokens. Why NOT’s Dip is a Win At $0.006063, NOT’s price has dipped 7% in the last 24 hours, creating a prime opportunity for dip buyers. Its market cap of $621M and growing adoption across Telegram and beyond suggest that the token is far from a fleeting trend. With a max supply nearing its cap, scarcity could drive future price increases, making now the perfect time to hop aboard. A Platform for Builders Notcoin isn’t just for gamers. Developers can showcase their web3 products to an active, engaged community, creating a collaborative environment that benefits everyone involved. Whether you’re a builder, investor, or casual user, NOT offers avenues for participation—and profit. Book of Meme (BOME): Decentralized Storage Meets Meme Culture If you thought memes were just for laughs, think again. Book of Meme (BOME) is here to immortalize internet culture on the blockchain. This experimental project leverages decentralized storage solutions like Solana, Arweave, and IPFS to create a digital compendium of memes that will outlast even the most persistent TikTok trends. The Numbers Behind the Laughs Currently priced at $0.005417, BOME has seen a slight dip of 5%, but its $373M market cap shows there’s strong interest in its vision. With over 68 billion tokens in circulation, this project is all about creating a lasting impact on the decentralized social media space. Why BOME Stands Out The concept of preserving meme culture as an immutable, blockchain-based artifact is as innovative as it is hilarious. Combine this with trading opportunities, and you’ve got a recipe for long-term engagement. Plus, its storage expansions to Bitcoin inscriptions signal big plans for the future. Conclusion: Don’t Miss the Meme-ment Meme coins have evolved into more than just jokes—they’re now platforms for community, creativity, and profit. If you’re looking for the top new meme coins to buy this year, BTFD Coin, Notcoin, and Book of Meme deserve a place on your radar. BTFD Coin’s presale and staking APY are setting new standards, offering investors a chance to grow their portfolios exponentially. With Notcoin’s web3 integration and BOME’s innovative take on meme preservation, this trio is as diverse as it is exciting. Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. Get in on BTFD Coin’s presale now and be part of the movement that’s redefining meme coins. Sign up today and stake your claim in the future of crypto!

What are his views on crypto?,https://crypto.news/bo-hines-is-a-future-exec-of-the-u-s-crypto-council-what-are-his-views-on-crypto/,"Hardly a well-known name in the crypto industry, former college football player and the young politician, Bo Hines, 29, got a high-profile appointment as an executive director of the Presidential Council of Advisers for Digital Assets, (or the “Crypto Council”) position on Dec. 23, 2024. What are his views on crypto? Not surprisingly, Bo Hines is a pro-crypto politician – if he wasn’t, Trump wouldn’t have appointed him, given the bold support for crypto from the U.S. President-elect. Read more: Bo Hines named executive director of Donald Trump’s crypto council For years, Hines has been a consistent Joe Biden critic and a passionate Donald Trump supporter. This loyalty didn’t go unnoticed, and Trump endorsed Hines when the latter was fighting for the U.S. House seat in North Carolina in 2022. Trump called Hines an “America First patriot,” a “winner both on and off the field,” and “fighter for Conservative values.” Thankfully, Hines’ views on crypto are far from being conservative. Throughout the years, Hines made only a few statements concerning cryptocurrencies. Although Hines was never an avid crypto evangelist, his statements clearly show that he sees cryptocurrency and decentralized finance as a remedy to various problems on the national and individual levels. The statement from the Bo Hines For Congress website: Hines disapproves of overregulation and CBDCs One of these statements is a part of the program that can be found on the website dedicated to Hines’ run for Congress. The mention of DeFi is found in the Economy section of the website. As an ultra-patriot, Hines begins with the importance of the protection of American jobs and business at home and leans on the America First policies that will discourage businesses from fleeing the USA. Then, Hines speaks about the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector as a way to boost individual financial independence and inclusion, which is rather a commonplace opinion. Hines starts to show his vision when he states that he sees overregulation as a threat to innovation and future development of the DeFi sector. As a part of the Crypto Council, Hines will have to overcome many challenges in facilitating a balanced and delicate crypto regulation. Seemingly, during the Congress campaign, Hines saw the DeFi as the self-regulating ecosystem based on principles of free market, empowering individuals and institutions to grow in terms of finance. The emphasis on individuals was crucial for Hines, as he stated that crypto gives individuals control over their funds and opportunities. Another important statement that can be found on the Congress campaign website is Hines’ strong disapproval of the adoption of central banks’ digital currencies. Hines sees CBDCs as a threat to financial sovereignty and a violation of the decentralization principles. Bo Hines on X: free speech and individual empowerment in finance The only time Hines mentioned crypto on X before their appointment to the Crypto Council was on Jan. 17, 2024, when he called crypto “an epitome of individual empowerment in finance” and stressed that the government shouldn’t step in the organic growth of the sector. Ironically, now Hines is the one who’s stepping. We’ll see if he’s able to let the sector grow. “Decentralized finance is the way of the future if regulators don’t crush it,” he concluded. Cryptocurrency is the epitome of individual empowerment in finance. We don’t need the government stepping in and slapping burdensome regulations on financial innovation. This new sector needs the freedom to grow organically. Decentralized finance is the way of the future if… — Bo Hines (@BoHines) January 16, 2024 On many occasions, Hines took to X to support freedom of speech. The Bo Hines For Congress website mentions that free speech is “under assault from the Authoritarian Left in our country” and names free speech as one of the conditions for flourishing Democracy. https://twitter.com/BoHines/status/1365362692668739585 While Hines was speaking about the importance of freedom of expression on many occasions, in his remarks, he never made a connection between censorship resistance and blockchain. Considering the fact that blockchain is great for facilitating immutable, transparent, inclusive, and censorship-resistant networks, Hines, as a free speech maxi and crypto proponent, will probably appreciate the potential of blockchain in this regard. Despite all the dedication to free speech, Hines has been silent about his plans as an executive director of the Crypto Council. Following the appointment, Bo Hines expressed gratitude to his patron, Donald Trump and said he’s thrilled to work alongside David Sacks, a “Crypto Czar,” appointed by Trump earlier. Hopefully, soo,n we’ll learn what the Crypto Council is going to bring to the table.

Recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributors sheds light on Tron’s expanding ecosystem and revenue surge, presenting a compelling case for its role in blockchain technology’s ongoing evolution. One major highlight is the substantial increase in Tron’s daily on-chain revenue. According to the data shared by the analyst, Crazzyblockk, this rise has been driven by the network’s enhanced gas fee revenue and higher transaction volumes. Additionally, Tron’s price movement appears to be now becoming interesting as it approaches critical support and resistance levels, which could dictate its near-term trajectory. Related Reading: TRON Reclaims Its Crown With 43% Dominance In Altcoin Transactions Daily Revenue Growth Reflects Network Utility Tron’s daily on-chain revenue has grown by 119% since January 1, 2024, a metric closely tied to rising gas usage and increased transaction activity on its blockchain, according to CryptoQuant analyst Crazzyblockk. This surge as disclosed by the analyst highlights Tron’s scalability in “processing high transaction volumes” while maintaining “cost efficiency.” The revenue growth also highlights the network’s expanding adoption within the decentralized finance (DeFi) and smart contract ecosystems. The network’s ability to generate substantial gas fee revenue serves as a benchmark for blockchain performance, with Tron’s figures signaling growing user engagement and utility. The analyst wrote: The year-to-date revenue expansion signals increasing user demand and network utility, further solidifying Tron’s position as a leading blockchain for high-speed, low-cost operations. Crazzyblockk also suggests that this trend reflects the network’s economic viability and its strengthening position among blockchains optimized for high-speed and low-cost operations. Additionally, this development is especially significant as blockchain networks compete to attract developers and investors with notable decentralized applications. The analyst concluded by noting: With this explosive momentum in daily revenue, Tron is setting a new standard for blockchain economic models. Investors, developers, and users alike should keep a close watch as this trend continues to reshape decentralized finance and smart contract adoption. Tron Approaches Key Level Meanwhile, from a technical perspective, Tron has reached a critical level near its 1-Year Moving Average (MA) plus two standard deviations, at approximately $0.25. Darkfost another CryptoQuant analyst warned that failing to hold this level could result in a decline to its 1-Year MA support of around $0.15. However, the analyst highlighted Tron’s ecosystem growth offers optimism for long-term investors. Related Reading: TRON Founder Justin Sun Expected to Meet Trump as Potential Web3 Advisor The network has seen notable activity, including a sharp increase in the USDT volume on its blockchain, which rose from $8 billion in early 2023 to $27 billion by late 2024. This growth points to strong adoption and an influx of capital into the Tron network. Additionally, metrics like the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicate that TRX was recently oversold, a condition that in the past has often preceded bullish momentum.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS.

The hype stems from 1Fuel selling over 135 million units of tokens worth $1.24 million with the potential for a market surge. Analysts’ expectations for a potential 5,000% gain from its current presales price of $0.015 have drawn in a lot of savvy investors looking to multiply their portfolio balance significantly, a move SOL and WIF offers no more. SOL is on the losing end SOL’s performance has been largely bearish, with investors recording losses across all timeframes. In the past month, it saw a drawdown of 18.58% and a past week loss of 14.90% according to CoinMarketCap . In the past 24 hours, it has continued its losing streak with a 1.47% decline. Analysts say should its market volume keep rising from its current level of $2.02 billion, then SOL’s fall will inevitably occur. Some analysts who are less optimistic say that SOL could get flipped by DOGE, a major memecoin in the market, based on the rate at which SOL’s market capitalization has been declining, dropping from over $100 billion down to $88.77 billion at press time. While one memecoin, DOGE, could pull an impressive move, the situation appears different with WIF another memecoin, as investors are moving away from it. WIF goes against investors’ predictions The sentiment for WIF is bearish, meaning the current downfall in the market could likely intensify moving forward. In the past month and week, WIF investors have lost 51.05% and 30.65% respectively, and the route downward is becoming more apparent with its 6.20% loss in the past 24 hours as indicated on CoinMarketCap . On the TradingView chart , WIF is in a more troubled state with the asset crossing below a critical support line at 1.4783, which is known to house buying pressure. Should the daily candle close below this support line, then WIF will begin another phase of continued decline, till it locates the next support level. With WIF and SOL failing to meet investors’ criteria, they have now turned to the best cryptocurrency, 1Fuel as the better alternative. 1Fuel: Best alternative to SOL and WIF With doubts setting in among top cryptocurrencies in the market, analysts have begun shifting to assets analysts consider will secure their investment and, more importantly, provide long-term gain. This is where 1Fuel comes in, as analysts predict the asset will return the most market gain in 2025 when it launches alongside its peer-to-peer exchange and cryptocurrency wallet. 1Fuel’s wallet will include some of the most innovative crypto wallet features in the market, that’s rarely functional in the market. Its multichain feature, being the most discussed, will support transactions across multiple chains without being hindered by high gas fees, utilizing multiple bridges, or wallets. This one-click settles everything in just a single action and uses 1Fuel as the native token to facilitate this in the market. Other aspects of the wallet analysts and investors are also excited about are the security functions, DeFi utility, and its on/off ramp supports. Conclusion Finding the best cryptocurrency to invest in isn’t a hassle anymore, as analysts say 1Fuel is the solution and the pathway to recording 5,000% in the coming trading sessions. Unlike SOL and WIF, 1Fuel remains in a state where it isn’t struggling and doesn’t appear to struggle in any way, based on analysts’ projections.

The Revenue Switch, a mechanism designed to distribute 100% of Usual’s ( USUAL ) protocol revenue to USUALx stakers, has been launched by the USUAL token and USD0 stablecoin ecosystem creators. While the initiative marks a significant step forward for decentralized finance, its debut is accompanied by ongoing community concerns about recent changes to the protocol’s redeem function. Activated on Jan. 13, 2025, the Revenue Switch enables USUALx stakers to receive protocol-generated revenue, estimated at $5 million per month, directly in USD0. This mechanism links token value to actual earnings, aiming to incentivize long-term staking and support sustainable protocol growth. Starting today UTC+0, the Revenue Switch was activated for USUALx holders. Those holding their USUALx positions throughout this week will be eligible for the distribution of last week’s collateral revenues. ​ More details here & on the dApp: https://t.co/syOdYwHXW5 ​ The 1:1… — Usual (@usualmoney) January 13, 2025 As of Jan. 14, 2025, the USUAL token is trading at $0.5319, with a market capitalization of $275.68 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $194.6 million. Approximately 36.53% of the token supply is staked, offering an annual yield of 275%, 42% in USD0 rewards, and 233% in USUAL. USUAL 1D chart | Source: CoinmarketCap Despite the excitement surrounding the Revenue Switch, the protocol has faced criticism over its decision to update the redeem function for USD0 stablecoins. The new feature allows for temporary suspension of redemptions under specific conditions, such as during periods of market volatility or liquidity constraints. While USUAL has clarified that this change is intended to maintain stability in extreme scenarios, it has raised concerns about the concentration of control and potential implications for decentralization.

The Revenue Switch aims to enhance the utility of USUAL tokens, stabilize returns for stakers, and provide a transparent mechanism for revenue distribution. USUAL has also indicated plans to refine its model in the coming months, incorporating advanced staking and governance frameworks inspired by the “veModel” used in other DeFi projects. As USUAL navigates these developments, the success of the Revenue Switch may serve as a proof of concept for revenue-based tokenomics , potentially influencing future practices in the sector.

Beberapa sinyal teknikal, seperti Golden Cross dan pantulan dari zona $91.000-$92.000, mengindikasikan bahwa bull run crypto masih jauh dari kata selesai. Dengan potensi besar Bitcoin untuk melakukan comeback, ini adalah kesempatan emas untuk berinvestasi pada altcoin. Waktu terbaik untuk membeli token ini adalah saat presale berlangsung. Artikel ini menghadirkan 4 presale altcoin terbaik yang mendominasi pasar saat ini. 1. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Presale Crypto Terbaik Secara Keseluruhan di 2025 Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) memberikan sinyal trading dan wawasan pasar crypto kepada investor ritel yang sebelumnya hanya dapat diakses oleh investor Wall Street. Tujuan utamanya adalah membangun komunitas aktif yang dapat mengurangi kekuasaan para crypto whale dan memberikan kesempatan yang lebih adil bagi investor kecil. Token ini memulai presale di akhir 2024 dan hingga saat ini telah berhasil mengumpulkan lebih dari $47,5 juta. Saat ini, setiap token dihargai $0.00036647 , tetapi fase berikutnya dari presale akan dimulai dalam beberapa jam, sehingga sekarang adalah waktu terbaik untuk membeli dengan harga termurah. Menurut beberapa ahli, $WEPE bisa menjadi token dengan performa terbaik di tahun 2025. Alasan utamanya adalah, meskipun beberapa meme coin hanya bersifat tren yang bisa memudar kapan saja, $WEPE menawarkan solusi nyata terhadap masalah manipulasi pasar oleh crypto whales , sehingga menciptakan lapangan bermain yang adil untuk semua. Beberapa analis bahkan menyebut bahwa $WEPE berpotensi melampaui $PEPU, yang harganya melonjak 500% setelah peluncuran. Anda bisa mengunjungi web resmi presale Wall Street Pepe di sini . 2.

Flockerz ($FLOCK) – Proyek Vote-to-Earn yang Hampir Mengumpulkan $10 Juta pada Presale Flockerz ($FLOCK) adalah platform vote-to-earn unik yang memberi penghargaan kepada investor berupa token gratis atas partisipasi mereka dalam pengambilan keputusan penting di platform.

Meanwhile, a newer altcoin dubbed RCO Finance (RCOF) is gaining significant attention, with its presale setting the stage for a potential surge in value, offering a stark contrast to Dogecoin’s current trajectory. Dogecoin Price Momentum Slows Down Dogecoin (DOGE) , once the darling of social media-driven crypto spikes, seems to have hit a plateau. Currently trading at around $0.33, the memecoin has seen a significant decline from around $0.4 at the start of the year. Dogecoin has consistently struggled to break past key resistance levels, with its momentum notably cooling off. Technical indicators like the 50-day EMA suggest potential bearish trends, with the token falling below its short-term moving averages. The market sentiment around the future of Dogecoin price is mixed, with some analysts predicting a possible climb to $0.45 if it manages to overcome current resistance, yet the overall momentum appears to be waning. RCO Finance Bullish Outlook Post-Presale As Dogecoin price momentum slows, RCO Finance’s presale is capturing the spotlight with its promise of substantial returns. Currently in its fourth and second-last presale stage, the RCOF token is priced at $0.07770, having already surged 509% from its initial presale price of $0.01275. The excitement around RCOF is palpable as the final presale stage is set to push the token’s price to $0.21420, which is a 175% increase from the current stage. Once the presale concludes, and RCOF is expected to get listed on exchanges with at a price range of $0.4 to $0.6, with analysts forecasting an explosive growth thereafter. The anticipation is that within weeks of its official listing and platform launch, RCOF could see its value increase by up to 50,000%, driven by the innovative features of the RCO Finance platform and the growing interest in AI-integrated financial solutions. The RCO Finance Platform Innovative Features RCO Finance is not just another cryptocurrency project; it’s a comprehensive financial ecosystem in its final development stages, set for launch post-presale. Central to its appeal is an AI-powered Robo Advisor that crafts personalized investment strategies for users, leveraging real-time data from global financial sources like Bloomberg and Reuters. The RCO Finance Robo Advisor promises to democratize sophisticated investment techniques, making them accessible to users regardless of their financial acumen. Additionally, RCO Finance will offer access to over 120,000 tradable assets across 12,500 asset classes, including both traditional and blockchain-based assets, thereby providing vast diversification options. Another groundbreaking aspect is its KYC-free ecosystem, which prioritizes user privacy, allowing for seamless and anonymous engagement in DeFi markets. Security is also paramount, with the platform’s smart contract undergoing rigorous auditing by SolidProof , enhancing investor confidence. Furthermore, the RCOF token follows a deflationary tokenomics model, where unsold tokens are burned, potentially increasing the token’s value over time. These features, combined with the current enthusiasm for crypto AI solutions, are expected to propel RCO Finance to new heights, positioning RCOF not just as a competitor to Dogecoin but as a potential leader in the next wave of financial technology. For those looking for a cryptocurrency with immense potential, they could consider RCO Finance (RCOF) , especially now that the token is yet to be listed on crypto exchanges seeing that it is projected to explode after listing and the launch of its native platform.

In a new thread, pseudonymous crypto trader Credible Crypto tells his 453,200 followers on the social media platform X that the smart contract platform looks set to skyrocket – but not before it dips and presents a solid entry for long-term holders. ‘[Ethereum] is setting up for a face-melting rally later this year. Just be patient and take advantage of the dips for now. $2,500-$2,800 is the dream buy zone if we manage to get it down the road.” Credible Crypto goes on to note that Ethereum is close to hitting his downside target. “Now about 80% to my downside target – seeing some LTF (lower time frame) absorption here so maybe we are due for some relief before taking the lows. Let’s see.” Source: Credible Crypto/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to predict that ETH will drop to support at $3,000. Ethereum is trading for $3,255 at time of writing, a marginal decrease during the last 24 hours. Moving on to the dog-themed memecoin dogwifhat ( WIF ), the trader says he ultimately sees the meme asset plunging below a psychological price point. “My last post [about WIF] was when I closed a long on it at $2.85 because it looked weak. I was hoping for a move to the equal highs for a short down to $1 but we melted. Currently trading at mid-range where I think we could see some relief but I’m not interested in longing it anymore. Surprised we’ve left behind those equal highs so maybe we go back for them but ultimately I think sooner or later we will see sub $1.” Source: Credible Crypto/X WIF is trading for $1.50 at time of writing.

This makes it one of the most promising blockchain projects in Q1 2025. PropiChain: Revolutionizing Real Estate with AI PropiChain deploys AI to transform traditional real estate transactions, introducing features that enhance user experience and operational efficiency. The AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants provide real-time support, guiding investors through the complex real estate marketplace. AI powers the platform’s predictive market analysis. This tool gives real estate investors insights into future market trends and how to capitalize on potential opportunities. The AI tool also helps analyze user preferences to suggest properties that match specific needs, thereby enhancing the likelihood of successful investments. The innovative AI application has positioned PCHAIN as a game-changer in the crypto space, relegating established assets like XRP and Cardano to the background. According to top market analysts, AI is the future of the blockchain and crypto market, and traditional crypto projects like XRP and Cardano need to innovate fast. Comparative Analysis: PCHAIN vs. XRP and Cardano (ADA) While XRP and Cardano have made significant strides in the blockchain arena, PCHAIN’s AI-driven approach offers distinct advantages. Unlike XRP and Cardano, PCHAIN is a real-world asset (RWA) AI altcoin backed by the $600 trillion global real estate market. The token enjoys the stability of real estate in a volatile crypto space. The volatility of the crypto market has greatly impacted both XRP and Cardano, with the Ripple token losing over 31% of its value since its all-time high. Similarly, ADA has lost over 69% since its all-time high. The impact of the crypto market volatility on both XRP and Cardano underscores the importance of a stable real-world asset backing a project. Looking at XRP, Cardano, and the AI-powered PCHAIN’s prospects, leading market analysts project a staggering 40,000% growth potential for PCHAIN within Q1 2025. The ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the United States SEC has cast a shadow of uncertainty on the future of XRP. Additionally, the developmental challenges facing the Cardano blockchain are also a major concern for investors considering the ADA token’s long-term viability. PropiChain: Redefining the Future of Global Real Estate Transactions Aside from its revolutionary artificial intelligence feature, Propichain also deploys the Metaverse, smart contracts, and RWA tokenization technology to power the future of real estate. Metaverse-Powered Virtual Real Estate Exploration The platform is revolutionizing real estate by integrating Metaverse technology, offering users an immersive way to explore properties. Instead of relying on physical site visits, buyers can embark on interactive 3D virtual tours, scouting properties from anywhere in the world. This cutting-edge feature eliminates geographical limitations, allowing buyers and sellers to connect seamlessly, negotiate deals remotely, and expedite transactions. Minimizing the need for in-person visits reduces costs, saves time, and enhances accessibility, making real estate transactions more efficient and globally inclusive. Automated Transactions with Smart Contracts PropiChain uses blockchain-based smart contracts to streamline real estate transactions, bringing unparalleled transparency and efficiency. Whether handling lease agreements, rental renewals, or property sales, smart contracts automate the entire process, eliminating the need for intermediaries like brokers and agents. Real Estate Tokenization: Expanding Investment Opportunities Through real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, PropiChain democratizes access to high-value real estate investments. The platform enables fractional ownership by converting premium properties into digital tokens, allowing a broader range of investors to participate in lucrative real estate markets. This innovative approach removes traditional financial barriers, providing investors with new opportunities to diversify their portfolios without requiring full ownership. Conclusion PCHAIN’s integration of artificial intelligence capabilities positions it as a formidable contender in the crypto market, with the potential to outperform established players like XRP and ADA in Q1 2025. With Its projected 40,000% growth, your $1000 investment in the ongoing presale will potentially yield over $382,520 in profit in Q1 2025. The ongoing second presale round has already raised over $800,000 after the project raised more than $1.3 million in the first presale round. After this presale round, the token will increase by over 109% for the final presale round. Join the PCHAIN presale now to buy the token on the cheap and make unprecedented gains. The token is listed on CoinMarketCap , a remarkable feat that shows the project’s readiness for bigger things in the market. BlockAudit , a top blockchain security firm, audited the smart contract and found zero vulnerabilities.

Addressing a full ballroom of executives and investors, Saylor said : “It works for any company. Every company has a choice to make: “Cling to the past” by purchasing Treasury bonds, executing buybacks and dividends, or “embrace the future” by using Bitcoin as digital capital.” Michael Saylor Saylor defends Bitcoin strategy as MicroStrategy continues aggressive purchase Saylor’s comments followed MicroStrategy’s latest announcement about its Bitcoin purchases, including a $243 million acquisition, marking the 10th consecutive week of purchasing the cryptoasset. He took a jab at companies like Microsoft and Nvidia for not following his company’s example, saying, “We’re the people building with steel, and they’re building with wood.” A slide in his presentation showed that 70 companies currently hold Bitcoin. “What’s the downside? Well, you just get rich,” he added. MicroStrategy shares have risen approximately 9.71% this year, reaching $317.75 per share as of 1:43 p.m. on Monday in New York, while Bitcoin has fallen 1.8% during the same period. The Virginia-based company now owns over 2% of all the Bitcoin that will ever exist, totalling roughly $41 billion. In closing, Saylor urged executives to make the right decision for their families, countries, and investors: “Adopt Bitcoin.” Donald Trump continues to engage crypto leaders Following Trump’s re-election, several high-profile crypto executives visited Mar-a-Lago. Trump recently invited Michael Saylor to his estate in Mar-a-Lago to discuss Bitcoin further. This isn’t the first time he’s done something like this. In 2024, for example, Trump invited American Bitcoin mining giants to learn more about the industry and what he needs to do to best support them. Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, has also met with Trump to discuss policies related to the sector. A few weeks ago, Saylor said he would be open to advising Donald Trump on Bitcoin. Now, with him at Mar-a-Lago, that may come to pass. As the President-elect prepares for his inauguration, major tech and crypto firms, including Circle, Microsoft, Google, and Apple, have opened their wallets, hoping to get a seat in the inaugural committee. These contributions come as Trump’s administration prepares to take a stance on digital assets, with many industry leaders positioning themselves to influence the upcoming policy changes.

Is it groundbreaking tech, real-world impact, or riding the momentum of presales? As of January 13, 2025, Ondo Finance is shaking things up with its upcoming token unlock, and Litecoin is keeping its place as a steady market contender. But the real buzz is around Qubetics (TICS) . With its presale setting new records and solving real-world issues, it’s no wonder analysts are predicting massive gains. If you’re hunting for the Best Altcoins to Join for Long Term, these three projects should be on your radar. While Ondo and Litecoin bring innovation and reliability to the table, Qubetics ($TICS) is addressing practical issues like secure online access with its decentralized VPN. Let’s explore why these altcoins are making waves and why Qubetics is leading the charge. Qubetics (TICS): Redefining Online Security with Decentralized VPN Qubetics (TICS) is rapidly gaining momentum in the crypto space with its innovative blockchain solutions. Offering unmatched scalability and real-world impact, Qubetics is positioning itself as a leader in the next wave of blockchain technology. With a growing community and significant ROI potential, it’s a token to watch for long-term growth. Currently in its 17th presale stage, Qubetics has raised over $9.5 million, sold 417 million $TICS tokens, and attracted over 14,300 holders . At $0.0501 per token, the presale is massive. Analysts predict $TICS will hit $0.25 by the presale’s end, delivering a 398.73% ROI, with projections reaching $15 after the mainnet launch—a jaw-dropping 29,824% gain. One of the standout applications of Qubetics is its decentralized VPN (dVPN). Imagine a world where your online activity is private, secure, and immune to centralized control.

It’s clear that $TICS is redefining what’s possible in blockchain, making it one of the Best Altcoins to Join for Long Term. Ondo Finance (ONDO): Innovating Tokenomics Ondo Finance is making waves with its upcoming token unlock event, slated to release $2.38 billion worth of tokens. While the market has seen ONDO dip to $1.2250—a 43% decline from its December peak—this falling wedge pattern suggests a potential rebound. Ondo’s strategic approach to tokenomics is designed to encourage long-term growth, even amidst broader market corrections. Ondo is more than just token unlocks. Its ecosystem is built around providing liquidity solutions for decentralized finance (DeFi). Imagine you’re a DeFi platform struggling to maintain liquidity.

Trading at $98.70, it’s seen a slight dip of 4.94% but remains one of the most reliable cryptocurrencies out there. Despite the SEC’s lowered likelihood of approving a spot Litecoin ETF—down to 42% from 60%—Litecoin’s real strength lies in its consistency. Litecoin is often called the “digital silver” to Bitcoin’s “gold,” and for good reason. Its fast transaction speeds and low fees make it a favorite for everyday transactions. Picture yourself grabbing a coffee at your local shop and paying with crypto. Litecoin makes this process as smooth as using a debit card. From businesses integrating crypto payments to individuals exploring blockchain for the first time, Litecoin offers a user-friendly experience.

The crypto market is buzzing with opportunities, and projects like Helium (HNT) and Fantom (FTM) are making headlines. Helium’s decentralized wireless network is gaining momentum, and Fantom is facing critical market shifts. But one project is stealing the spotlight—Qubetics ($TICS). With its innovative multi-chain wallet and recent 10% price increase, Qubetics is offering investors a front-row seat to massive gains. Qubetics is more than just a cryptocurrency; it’s a game-changing platform designed to solve real-world blockchain problems. Its non-custodial multi-chain wallet makes crypto management seamless, blending traditional finance with cutting-edge blockchain technology. With its presale heating up, Qubetics is positioning itself as one of the best coins to join this week for both seasoned investors and newcomers looking for explosive ROI. Qubetics Is Transforming Crypto Management with Its Multi-Chain Wallet Qubetics is taking crypto accessibility to new heights with its non-custodial, multi-chain wallet .

If you’re curious about how Qubetics is changing the crypto landscape, watch this video to learn more. Qubetics Presale Is Delivering Explosive Growth The Qubetics presale is on fire. Currently in its 17th stage, $TICS is priced at $0.0501, with over $9.5 million raised and more than 14,300 holders. Over 417 million tokens have been sold, and the price increases by 10% every Sunday at midnight. This built-in price surge creates urgency for investors looking to get in early on the action. Analysts are predicting huge returns for $TICS . By the end of the presale, $TICS could hit $0.25, offering a 398.73% ROI. If it reaches $1 post-presale, that’s a staggering 1,894.93% ROI. And the upside doesn’t stop there. If $TICS climbs to $5 or $6, the ROI could skyrocket to 9,874.66% or even 11,869.60%. The most optimistic predictions have it reaching $10 or $15, translating to gains of 19,849.33% to 29,824.00%. For example, a $1,000 investment now would give you approximately 19,950 $TICS tokens. If $TICS hits $1, that $1,000 turns into nearly $19,950. If it jumps to $10, your investment skyrockets to $199,500. This kind of return easily makes Qubetics one of the best coins to join this week. Helium Expands Its Decentralized Wireless Network Helium (HNT) continues to make waves with its decentralized wireless network designed for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The project boasts a market cap of $871.45 million and a 24-hour trading volume of $14.81 million. Helium’s network growth is fueled by its innovative Proof-of-Coverage (PoC) consensus mechanism, which allows users to set up Hotspots that provide wireless coverage and earn HNT tokens. The recent expansion of its network has attracted more participants, leading to improved connectivity and increased token utility. Helium’s ability to scale its network and integrate with IoT solutions positions it as a serious contender for long-term growth. As the demand for decentralized wireless infrastructure rises, Helium is proving to be one of the best coins to join this week for investors seeking solid, tech-driven projects. With its focus on solving real-world connectivity issues, Helium is showing strong potential for growth in the booming IoT sector. Its commitment to decentralization and network expansion makes it a solid choice for both new and experienced crypto investors. Fantom Faces Market Uncertainty After Coinbase Suspension Fantom (FTM) is under pressure following Coinbase’s decision to suspend its trading. This unexpected move has led to speculation about Fantom’s future price movements. Analysts suggest that this suspension could cause further price drops, affecting investor confidence. However, Fantom’s underlying technology and commitment to scalability still hold long-term promise. Despite the immediate challenges, Fantom’s high-speed, low-cost blockchain infrastructure remains a valuable asset. If the project can navigate this period of uncertainty, it could recover and continue to attract developers and users. For now, however, investors are watching closely to see how the market reacts. Although Fantom is facing short-term volatility, its innovative technology still makes it a project worth monitoring. For risk-tolerant investors, Fantom could be a strategic addition among the best coins to join this week, provided it regains market stability. Why These Altcoins Deserve a Spot in Your Portfolio Helium, Fantom, and Qubetics each bring something unique to the crypto market. Helium is building a decentralized wireless network that’s growing rapidly, while Fantom’s high-speed blockchain could rebound after navigating its current challenges. But Qubetics steals the show with its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, seamless payment integration, and explosive $TICS presale growth .

38923594,https://www.newsbtc.com/?p=674500,1736820018,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png,Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Now Capitulating: Bottom Here?,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-short-term-holders-capitulating-bottom/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin short-term holders have started selling at a loss. Here’s what this could mean for the cryptocurrency’s price. Bitcoin Short-Term Holder SOPR Has Just Dipped Under 1 As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a new post on X, the Bitcoin Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) of the short-term holders has declined into the red zone recently. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Plummets To Neutral: Reversal Signal? The “SOPR” here refers to an on-chain indicator that tells us whether the BTC investors are selling their coins at a profit or loss. The metric works by going through the transaction history of each coin being sold/transferred on the network to see what price it was transacted at prior to this. If the last transfer price of the coin was less than the current spot value it’s being sold at now, then its sale could be assumed to be leading to profit realization. Similarly, transactions of the tokens of the opposite type correspond to loss-taking. The SOPR adds up the profits and losses being realized across the network in this manner and calculates what their ratio stands at. In the context of the current topic, the SOPR of only a particular segment of the sector is of interest: the short-term holders (STHs). This cohort is made up of the investors who bought their coins within the past 155 days. When the indicator has a value greater than 1, it means the STHs as a whole are selling their coins at a profit. On the other hand, it is under the threshold implies loss realization is dominant among these holders. Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day simple moving average (SMA) of the Bitcoin STH SOPR over the past decade: As is visible in the above graph, the 7-day SMA of the Bitcoin STH SOPR shot up to high levels above the 1 mark during the last couple of months of 2024, implying the group was participating in significant profit-taking during the asset’s run to new all-time highs. This wasn’t anything unusual, as STHs have historically proven themselves to represent the fickle-minded side of the market, who sell at first sight of any major change in the market, like a rally or crash. Predictably, with the market downturn that has followed in the last few weeks, the STHs have shown another shift, as their profit-taking has calmed down and loss-taking has started taking over. The 7-day SMA of the indicator has declined to 0.99, which suggests the loss realization is now just ahead of the profit realization. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Explains What Could Trigger Ethereum Rally To $6,000 From the chart, it’s apparent that past capitulation events have generally coincided with tops for Bitcoin. So far, though, the level of loss-taking isn’t anything too notable, which may suggest the indicator could have to decline a bit more before BTC finds a bullish reversal. BTC Price Bitcoin has erased the recent recovery as its price has seen another 3% plunge during the past day, which has taken it to $91,600.

FIL Shows Uncertainty and Web3 Grows Fast,https://thecoinrise.com/web3bay-hits-630k-in-days-as-its-community-vision-gains-traction-fil-shows-uncertainty-and-web3-grows-fast/,"The blockchain sector is growing as various projects adapt and widen their scope. Recent Filecoin price analysis suggests uncertainty, with difficulties in sustaining a rise despite positive signs and technical backing. Concurrently, the Web3 ecosystem is progressively expanding through strategic alliances that link decentralized and conventional finance, paving the way for broader use. In e-commerce, Web3Bay (3BAY) is rapidly advancing, gathering over $630K in a few days and distributing 180 million tokens. With a token price of only $0.0039675, Web3Bay offers a smarter way to buy digital assets, enhanced by community-led governance and special purchasing discounts. Mixed Signals in Filecoin’s Market Trends Filecoin price analysis reveals inconsistent performance as FIL tries to regain its footing. Currently trading around $5.14, Filecoin is showing recovery signs after finding support near $4.85. Technical indicators like a Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 56 hint at a cautiously optimistic sentiment. However, resistance near $8.42, at the 61.8% Fibonacci level, could be crucial for future gains. While there is enthusiasm for the potential of Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) to boost decentralized storage, obstacles from large cloud storage firms and regulatory ambiguities persist. Thus, Filecoin price analysis calls for careful optimism, with stakeholders keeping a close watch on market dynamics. Growing Impact of the Web3 Ecosystem The Web3 ecosystem is on an upward trajectory as it forges connections between decentralized and traditional financial systems. For example, Pyth Network’s collaboration with Revolut underscores how decentralized protocols can enhance the financial industry by offering real-time data to blockchain applications, making the Web3 ecosystem more approachable for the average user. This trend is encouraging more conventional financial entities to consider decentralized ventures, showing potential for wider adoption. As the Web3 ecosystem matures, innovations in data sharing, security, and decentralized finance (DeFi) are making practical applications more feasible for daily use. The ongoing integration of decentralized and centralized financial practices is solidifying the foundation of the Web3 ecosystem and guiding its future expansion. Web3Bay: The Smarter, More Secure Way to Buy Digital Assets! Web3Bay is revolutionizing e-commerce by integrating blockchain technology with a user-centric approach. Having raised over $630K and sold 180 million of its 3BAY tokens at just $0.0039675 each, Web3Bay stands out for its strong focus on community, integrity, and user empowerment. The platform ensures user control over their data and assets without intermediaries or hidden costs. Community governance is central, enabling users to directly influence the evolution of the marketplace. As Web3Bay moves towards becoming a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), 3BAY token holders will gain voting rights on future developments, ensuring a transparent and inclusive decision-making process. Moreover, purchasing digital assets on Web3Bay with 3BAY tokens grants a 5% discount, enhancing transaction value. Web3Bay also prioritizes scalability, incorporating Layer-2 solutions like rollups to efficiently manage high transaction volumes. Plans to launch NFT marketplaces, staking options, and cross-chain functionalities are underway, aiming to further improve the platform’s capabilities. For those keen on the future of decentralized e-commerce, Web3Bay presents a unique opportunity. More than just a marketplace, it’s a movement dedicated to empowering its users and delivering value through a community-focused approach. Web3Bay is actively constructing the future landscape of online commerce! Decentralized Projects: Forging the Path to Tomorrow! Decentralized technologies are increasingly influencing the future of digital markets. Filecoin price analysis reflects the ongoing struggle to maintain growth in a fiercely competitive storage sector, while the expanding Web3 ecosystem continues to merge decentralized and traditional finance through key partnerships. Together, these developments demonstrate the growing acceptance of blockchain solutions across various industries. Leading this evolution is Web3Bay, significantly enhancing how users buy digital assets. Since launching its presale, Web3Bay has quickly raised over $630K and sold more than 180 million tokens, now priced at merely $0.0039675. These tokens not only offer exclusive purchasing discounts but also grant governance rights to their holders. By focusing on community, transparency, and scalability, Web3Bay is setting the stage for the future of decentralized e-commerce.

This $0.07 AI altcoin shows great potential to outperform DOGE’s explosive growth. With its AI-driven tools, real-world asset integration, deflationary model and early-stage advantage, RCOF offers a more innovative and sustainable investment opportunity than DOGE. This AI altcoin is setting a new standard for altcoins, offering greater utility and growth potential. Why Dogecoin Millionaires See AI Altcoins as Smarter Bets Dogecoin millionaires are transitioning from speculative assets like Dogecoin to AI altcoins offering more tangible value. Here’s why. As the 7th largest crypto by market cap, DOGE is the king of memecoins, growing to this position thanks to speculative interest and meme appeal. However, over the last few years, Dogecoin has experienced significant price swings, the most recent being a 21% drop in December 2024. Its mature market position and lackluster performance have investors questioning the sustainability of its returns, which have been diminishing since its meteoric rise in 2021. To hedge against further losses, some Dogecoin investors are moving to high-growth AI altcoins. There’s a growing preference for altcoins that offer more tangible value. Compared to AI altcoins with real-world applications and innovative solutions, Dogecoin lacks the underlying utility many investors now seek. Due to their innovative features, many of these AI altcoins have high ROI potential, attracting Dogecoin investors who are eager to capitalize. RCO Finance: The $0.07 AI Altcoin Set to Outrun DOGE’s 2021 Rally While DOGE delivered impressive returns during its 2021 rally, RCOF’s innovative features and practical utility greatly boost its potential and could see RCOF deliver greater gains than Dogecoin did during its rally. Prices at just $0.07, this altcoin offers the chance to turn a modest investment into life-changing gains. At the core of RCOF is the robo-advisor, an AI-powered tool that offers personalized support and investment guidance based on your preferences.

This personalization is a game changer and helps you easily create a profitable portfolio you are comfortable with, even if you have no experience. For beginners, it curates its recommendations in easy-to-understand formats so you are not overwhelmed and can confidently make sound decisions. It also offers educational resources enabling novices to boost their knowledge and skills in crypto trading and how to navigate financial markets.

It can automatically execute trades on your behalf and rebalance your portfolio as needed. This saves you time and effort since you don’t have to check and adjust your portfolio manually. With real-world asset integration, this AI altcoin offers more investment and diversification opportunities. This inclusion gives more users exposure to traditional assets and helps increase liquidity for otherwise illiquid assets. This tokenization allows you to buy them using cryptocurrency eliminating the need to convert it to fiat currency. This unique feature expands its utility and appeals to a broader investor base. Built on blockchain technology, RCOF ensures transparency, security, and low fees. Its non-KYC approach makes it accessible to investors worldwide, breaking down geographical barriers​. Its smart contracts have also been thoroughly audited by SolidProof. Ride the RCOF Wave and Outrun DOGE’s 2021 Gains The Dogecoin millionaire’s confidence in RCOF highlights its potential to outperform DOGE’s legendary 2021 rally.

While the XRP price faces regulatory challenges and market volatility, PropiChain , an emerging AI altcoin, is gaining momentum with its innovative real-world applications in real estate. PCHAIN is projected to reach $2 as it transforms the crypto landscape. With XRP’s growth potential uncertain, investors are increasingly turning to PropiChain for its strong fundamentals and high upside. XRP Price Analysis: Why Ripple Faces Challenges in Reaching $10 Ripple’s XRP price has remained trapped in a narrow range, with significant resistance at $3 and strong support at $2. Despite occasional short-term bullish reversals, the XRP price has struggled to maintain upward momentum. The market sentiment surrounding XRP is largely cautious, with traders reluctant to commit to substantial positions without a clear breakout signal. Also, regulatory challenges continue to weigh on the XRP price performance. Without a favorable resolution, XRP may find it difficult to attract the level of institutional and retail investor interest required to push its price toward the $10 milestone. For now, the XRP price remains in a consolidation phase. A decisive breakout above $3 could spark renewed bullish momentum, paving the way for a potential rally. However, a breakdown below $2 would likely trigger additional selling pressure, pushing the XRP price lower. In contrast, emerging altcoins like PropiChain are gaining attention for their innovative approaches and untapped growth potential, making them a compelling alternative to XRP. PropiChain: The AI Altcoin Set to Outpace XRP PropiChain has quickly gained traction as a standout in the crypto market, combining blockchain technology and AI to revolutionize real estate investment. Unlike XRP, which faces headwinds from regulatory scrutiny, PropiChain offers a forward-thinking solution to real-world challenges in the property sector. One of PropiChain’s most attractive features is real estate tokenization, which enables the division of high-value properties into smaller, affordable units. This approach makes real estate investment accessible to a broader audience. For instance, an investor with just $500 can own a fraction of a luxury property valued at $1 million. This is a level of inclusivity traditional real estate markets rarely offer. Also, the AI-powered analytics enhance the investment process by providing data-driven insights into property trends and market conditions. These tools help investors make informed decisions, reducing risk and increasing the potential for high returns. Additionally, PropiChain’s metaverse integration allows users to explore virtual property environments, adding a futuristic and engaging dimension to real estate. Overall, PropiChain uses blockchain to address industry-specific issues like real estate scams and inefficient transaction processes. Smart contract automation ensures seamless and secure transactions, while blockchain transparency provides an immutable record of ownership. With investors increasingly seeking utility-driven projects, PropiChain’s practical approach could see its value soar, potentially surpassing XRP in growth potential. PropiChain Presale: A $2 Target Within Reach The PropiChain presale has captured significant investor interest, already raising close to $3 million. Currently priced at $0.011 in stage 2, this is an exceptional opportunity for forward-thinking investors to join the project before its price climbs to $0.023 in a few weeks. For those who invest now, the potential returns are staggering. For example, an early $1,000 investment could yield nearly $181,000 if PropiChain reaches its projected $2 target. Comparatively, the XRP price has struggled to sustain momentum, with regulatory hurdles casting doubt on its ability to reach $10. Even if it does, an investment of $1,000 at its current price of $2.31 will only yield about $4,000. The contrast highlights why investors are shifting their focus to utility-driven projects like PropiChain. Conclusion XRP’s ongoing challenges, from regulatory hurdles to market stagnation, have made its $10 price target seem distant. While Ripple continues to navigate uncertain waters, PropiChain is forging ahead with a clear and innovative vision. Its presale success and projected growth underscore its potential to deliver impressive returns, making it a standout in the crypto market. As the presale progresses, the current stage represents the most advantageous entry point for investors. Waiting until later stages or after its market debut could mean paying significantly higher prices.

On Tuesday, the company announced that it is officially launching ""Soneium,"" a general-purpose blockchain platform. The team behind Sony Block Solutions Labs (SBSL), a joint project between Sony Group and Singapore-based Startale Labs, describes Soneium — technically a layer-2 network atop Ethereum — as ""a versatile general-purpose blockchain platform"" built to support a diverse ecosystem of gaming, finance and entertainment apps. According to SBSL, the launch comes after a four month-long test period that involved participation from 14 million wallets. Sony's network is yet more evidence that traditional technology companies might again be keen on blockchain's ability to connect and commercialize the future of media. The chain is aimed towards ""bridging the gap between web2 and web3 audiences, especially for the creators, fans and community,” SBSL said in a statement shared with CoinDesk. “The platform prioritizes user-centric design, simplifying blockchain interactions and evolving web3 from a niche hobby into an everyday experience.” The team tapped Optimism’s OP Stack to build out their network — a customizable framework that lets developers use optimistic rollup technology to transact on Ethereum quickly and at a low cost. Other companies using the OP Stack include the U.S. crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken, which use the tech to power their popular Base and Ink networks. Uniswap, the leading decentralized exchange, and Worldcoin, the Sam Altman-founded digital passport, also use OP Stack to power their layer-2 blockchain networks. In many cases, the Optimism Foundation, which stewards the development of the OP Stack, has awarded grants to companies that agreed to use its tech. SBSL declined to comment on how many OP tokens they would receive as part of this deal, though previous reporting indicates that Optimism's grants can be substantial. In August 2023, Coinbase received up to 118 million OP tokens — worth $182 million at the time, or $192 million at today's prices — to use OP Stack for Base chain. CoinDesk also reported that Kraken received up to 25 million OP tokens, worth roughly $100 million, when it agreed to use the OP Stack in January 2024 (now worth $42 million). Similar grants are doled out by Optimism competitors like Polygon and Arbitrum, each of whom is dueling to build its own interconnected web of blockchains.

With a new bull market on the horizon, several digital assets are showing the potential to rise exponentially. Five cryptos BigBossInu, Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), and Polkadot (DOT) are well-positioned to follow in the footsteps of previous market leaders. Let’s dive into why these altcoins are primed for significant growth. BigBossInu’s Presale Shakes Up the Crypto Market BigBossInu is creating excitement in the crypto industry with a highly successful presale that’s drawing eager investors. Seen as a high-reward opportunity for those who join early, BigBossInu is quickly gaining momentum. With its presale interest peaking, this promising asset has become one of November’s top cryptos to watch. BigBossInu’s innovative approach and strategic growth plan suggest it’s set for considerable success in the months to come. >>>>>> Solana (SOL) has recovered well, currently trading around $197. Buyers have managed to push it above key resistance levels, but SOL is facing resistance at $200. If it can break above this, it could rise towards $250. However, if sellers regain control, SOL could dip back to $160. Polygon (MATIC) has established itself as a leading Layer-2 solution that enhances Ethereum’s scalability, offering faster transactions at lower costs. As demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) and blockchain technology grow NEAR Protocol (NEAR) As the next bull market gains momentum, NEAR’s potential to grow and attract more innovation positions it as a crypto to watch, with analysts expecting it to follow the growth trajectory of platforms like Ethereum and Solana. Polkadot (DOT) has made a notable upward move, breaching its resistance at $7.50 and climbing 6.1% within the last week. This development is being seen as a strong indicator of recovery, suggesting that DOT may soon experience a breakout. As it inches closer to concluding its accumulation phase, there’s increasing optimism among market experts. >>> Conclusion As the market gears up for its next major bull run, these five cryptos BigBossInu, Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC), NEAR Protocol (NEAR), and Polkadot (DOT) are showing the potential to deliver exponential gains. With innovative technology, strong communities, and strategic market positioning, they have what it takes to follow in the footsteps of Ethereum and Solana, rewarding early investors with impressive returns. For those looking to capitalize on the next wave of crypto growth, investing in BigBossInu could be a game-changing move.

In 2028, AR will range range between $63.77 and $77.30, with an average price of $66.05. In 2031, Arweave (AR) could reach a maximum price of $215.04. Arweave (AR) is a unique cryptocurrency that underpins a decentralized, permanent data storage solution, setting it apart in the blockchain space. As Arweave’s ecosystem continues to grow, interest in its price trajectory has increased among investors and analysts alike. This price prediction explores potential future movements of AR, considering factors like market trends, technological advancements, and overall crypto market sentiment. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for those looking to invest or engage with Arweave’s long-term vision of decentralized, permanent data storage. Overview Cryptocurrency Arweave Ticker AR Current price $15.30 Market cap $1,004,725,882.55 Trading volume $67,299,502 Circulating supply 65,652,466 AR All-time high $90.94 Nov 05, 2021 All-time low $0.4854 May 27, 2020 24-hour high $15.49 24-hour low $14.02 Arweave price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Price Prediction $21.00 Volatility (30-day variation) 10.87% 50-day SMA $ 20.11 200-day SMA $ 22.58 14-Day RSI 40.97 Sentiment Bearish Fear and greed index 61 (Greed) Green days 14/30 (47%) Arweave price analysis: AR faces bearish momentum with slight recovery signs TL;DR Breakdown Arweave resistance is present at $16.87. The coin’s support is present at $14.03. AR shows slight recovery from oversold levels in the short term. The Arweave price analysis for January 14 shows a downtrend. AR is down 1.18% over the last 24 hours, lost 19.23% in 7 days, and -30.54% in 30 days. AR/USD 1-day chart: Indicators suggest weak capital inflow The Arweave (AR) daily chart shows bearish momentum, with the price currently trading below the middle Bollinger Band at $16.87. The CMF at -0.04 suggests weak capital inflows, indicating limited buying pressure. Indicators suggest weak capital inflow The MACD is in a bearish crossover, with the histogram in the negative zone, reflecting continued selling pressure. If AR fails to reclaim the $16.87 level, it may test the $14.03 support. A breakout above $16.87 could signal a recovery toward $19.71, but the overall sentiment remains bearish for now. Arweave 4-hour price analysis: AR shows slight signs of recovery The 4-hour Arweave (AR) chart shows a modest recovery, with the price trading near $15.27 but still below the 20-period SMA at $15.47, indicating bearish resistance. The RSI at 39.65 suggests the coin is recovering from oversold levels but remains below neutral territory, reflecting weak buying momentum. AR shows slight signs of recovery The BBP (Bull Bear Power) at 0.106 indicates a slight improvement in sentiment but remains within a low range. For AR to continue its recovery, it needs to break above the 20-day SMA. Failing to do so may result in further consolidation or downward pressure.

Momentum is weak, so it’ll need stronger market support to see real growth. Is Arweave a good investment? Arweave looks promising for long-term investors in decentralized data storage, with strong partnerships like Solana and Polygon and backing from Coinbase Ventures. However, crypto volatility means investing in Arweave requires careful risk assessment and management. Will AR reach $50? AR could reach $50, especially since it hit an all-time high of around $90 in November 2021. With strong market momentum and growing adoption, it’s possible, but it depends on broader market trends and ecosystem growth. Will AR reach $100? AR reaching $100 is possible, but it would require strong market momentum, widespread adoption of its decentralized storage solutions, and continued ecosystem growth. Does Arweave have a good long-term future? Arweave shows strong long-term potential. Recent partnerships, like integrations with Transak and 4EVERLAND, as well as collaborations with Ethereum through WeaveVM and acquisitions like Odysee and Solarplex, highlight its expanding ecosystem and growing user base. Its focus on decentralized storage and strategic growth makes it a promising project for the future.

Pepe Unchained vs. BlockDAG Meme Culture Meets Blockchain Innovation Pepe Unchained and BlockDAG are two well-known projects that mix funny images with blockchain progress. Pepe Unchained, made on Ethereum’s extra layer, has got more than $73 million in its early sale, giving quicker deals and cheaper costs for meme coin trade. Its next part, Pepe’s Pump Pad, wants to make it easier to create meme coins which helps fans. BlockDAG uses a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) method to make things bigger and quicker as a Layer-1 blockchain. With more than $158 million collected and a 2240% jump in coin worth during its presale, BlockDAG attracts wider group of people, such as builders and companies; it gives easy-code tools for different apps that are not centered around one place. Pepe Unchained looks at the small meme coin market, but BlockDAG’s all-around way make͏s it a big part of blockchain setup. Investors should think about their goals and risk levels when looking at these projects. Why Lightchain AI Could Reach $1 First by 2025 While Pepe Unchained Coin and BlockDAG each present unique strengths, Lightchain AI appears to have the greatest potential to reach the $1 milestone ahead of the others. Several factors support this projection. Currently priced at $0.0048 during its presale phase, Lightchain AI (LCAI) is anticipated by analysts to achieve $1 by 2025. This growth is expected to be driven by its groundbreaking integration of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Key elements fueling this potential include its innovative Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus mechanism, which rewards nodes for completing AI computations, significantly improving network scalability and efficiency. Additionally, the Artificial Intelligence Virtual Machine (AIVM) facilitates seamless deployment of AI-powered applications, making it highly attractive to developers and enterprises seeking advanced solutions. The project’s deflationary tokenomics further enhance its appeal; by burning a portion of transaction fees, scarcity is increased, potentially driving up the token’s value as demand grows.

As SHIB seeks stability amidst market fluctuations, another cryptocurrency, RCO Finance (RCOF), is setting the stage for potential exponential growth through its ongoing presale , hinting at a market upside that could reach 30,000%. Shiba Inu Price Prediction Shiba Inu has experienced a mix of volatility and consolidation in recent weeks. The price of SHIB, as shown on CoinGecko , has been hovering around $0.000021, down from above $0.000043 in December 2024. SHIB seems to be facing resistance, possibly due to its limited utility and an increasingly saturated meme coin market. Analysts suggest that while there’s potential for SHIB to continue its upward trajectory if market conditions remain favorable, the lack of significant developments in its ecosystem might hinder long-term growth. The current sentiment around Shiba Inu is cautiously optimistic, with some predicting a modest rise to $0.00003 by the end of the first quarter if bullish trends persist, but the road ahead remains uncertain without new catalysts. RCO Finance Presale Setting the Stage for a Bull Run RCO Finance’s presale has been making waves, currently in its fourth stage with the RCOF token priced at $0.0777, showcasing a 509% surge from its initial offering. The next and final presale stage, the Bonus Round, is set to see the token’s price increase by 175% to $0.2142, offering additional incentives for early investors. Once the presale concludes, RCOF is expected to be listed on exchanges with a price range of $0.4 to $0.6, which could lead to a dramatic 30,000% surge in value within weeks post-listing and platform launch. This optimistic scenario is fueled by the strong momentum and investor interest during the presale stages, coupled with the innovative features of the upcoming RCO Finance platform. RCO Finance Platform: A Glimpse into the Future of Decentralized Finance As RCO Finance nears the end of its token presale, the platform itself is in the final stages of development, poised to redefine decentralized finance. At the heart of RCO Finance is an AI-powered Robo Advisor that democratizes sophisticated investment strategies, making them accessible to all users regardless of their financial acumen. This tool uses machine learning to analyze vast amounts of market data, offering personalized investment recommendations that adapt in real time to market changes. Beyond the AI advisor, RCO Finance boasts an extensive array of over 120,000 tradable assets across 12,500 asset classes, including tokenized real-world assets like real estate and commodities, providing investors with unprecedented diversification options. Privacy is also a key selling point with its KYC-free ecosystem set to appeal to those who prioritize anonymity in financial dealings. Security and trust are further enhanced by a smart contract audited by SolidProof , ensuring the platform’s integrity and investor confidence. There is also a deflationary mechanism in place, where unsold RCOF tokens are burned, possibly increasing scarcity post-presale leading to an increase in value over time. Given these features, RCO Finance is not just another DeFi platform but a potential market disruptor, with the RCOF token expected to capitalize on these innovations, contributing to its anticipated meteoric rise, especially with the current hype around AI in cryptocurrency. While the Shiba Inu price prediction remains tied to market sentiment and lacks new utility, RCO Finance’s strategic presale and forthcoming platform launch offer a compelling narrative of growth and innovation, potentially leading to significant returns for investors in the burgeoning world of crypto AI.

A transfer of 30 million XRP (approximately $76.1 million) from Upbit to an unknown wallet has captured market attention, indicating heightened activity among large holders. This comes as analysts and the crypto community closely monitor ongoing developments in Ripple’s legal battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), along with the imminent January 15 deadline for the agency’s appeal-related filing. XRP Price Eyes New ATH As Whales Move $76.1M In a recent report from Whale Alert, 30 million XRP worth $76.1 million was moved from Upbit, a South Korea exchange, to an unknown wallet. Such large transactions are often viewed as potential precursors to price volatility. Some of the analysts have noted that whales are known to make large movements that can be interpreted as either accumulation or preparation for large transactions. In the past, such transactions have been linked with the changes in the XRP price trend some analysts have forecasted that the currency may rise by double digits. EGRAG Crypto, a renowned market analyst, in a recent move pointed out that XRP is displaying a rare “Megaphone Bottom” formation that may indicate an upward trend. At the moment, this technical formation has a win rate of above 70%, and the analyst is predicting an ATH of $8 if it happens. XRP Breaks Out of Symmetrical Triangle The XRP price recently emerged from a symmetrical triangle pattern, which is a bullish signal, meaning that the price may rise to $4. The symmetrical triangles are formed when price action converges and forms a triangle where the tops and bottoms converge to form the triangle. A breakout above the upper trendline is generally taken as a positive sign by the traders aligning a recent XRP price predition . According to market analyst World of Charts, XRP price could increase by 60% in the coming days if it breaks out. Using the maximum height of the triangle on the breakout point sets the first target at $4. This surge is inline with the legal fight of Ripple which has still been on the rise, thus positively influencing the market. Some of the latest developments such as a ruling that certain documents submitted in connection with Ripple’s summary judgment motion should be sealed have also boosted investors’ confidence. SEC Deadline Approaches Amid Legal Uncertainty The SEC has until January 15 to submit its brief on the merits of the appeal regarding Judge Analisa Torres’s decision in the Ripple case. This comes after the agency filed its Notice of Appeal in October 2023 regarding the ruling that the normal sales of XRP are not securities under the Howey Test. Lawyers have noted that this is not unusual for filings to be submitted on the last day. According to Marc Fagel, a retired securities lawyer, “In thirty years of litigation, I would estimate that I have seen a lawyer file a brief before it was due once or twice.” However, it is still unclear if the SEC will continue the appeal to the next administration. SEC Chair Gary Gensler and Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw are to resign on January 20, and former Commissioner Paul Atkins, who is known to be pro-crypto, could join the commission which may change the agency’s stance on the Ripple case. Market Analysts Remain Optimistic Analysts remain optimistic about XRP price potential, citing legal developments and bullish chart patterns. Crypto trader “Dark Defender” pointed out that XRP price is now in the final stages of its “throwback” after breaking a triangle pattern. He predicted that there is high possibility through which the cryptocurrency may hit a new ATH of $4.4 within the next few days. Concurrently, the XRP community is also focused on Ripple’s leadership, including the recent meetings between Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Although specific information has not been provided, many in the community see these contacts as a positive sign which which may set ground for an XRP price breakout.

King Pepe on Solana (PEPESOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, King Pepe on Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and King Pepe on Solana could become the next viral memecoin. King Pepe on Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy King Pepe on Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for King Pepe on Solana by entering its contract address – xArnFwydB12BkKVXKy436TwCrSSfFcC7kXx7p2fGEWh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESOL.

Despite some positive price action, the market has not yet confirmed a breakout. Historically, breakouts from triangle patterns tend to show strong upward movement. However, the rally observed earlier this week did not maintain this momentum. XRP briefly rose from around $2.20 to $2.60, but the necessary breakout has not materialized. Micro Support Levels A key support level at $2.39 was identified as critical for maintaining the uptrend. Although the price briefly dipped below this level, it remains relevant. There is a possibility that the price will revisit this support zone, especially if the market moves upward in a corrective structure before retesting it. Triangle Pattern Still in Play The current price action suggests that the triangle pattern (A-B-C-D-E) is still intact. While the price broke above the D-wave high for a short period, it did not hold. For confirmation of the pattern’s completion, a break above $2.72 is required. If the price does not break above this level, the pattern may extend or evolve into a more complex structure. Market Sentiment and Bitcoin’s Influence The broader cryptocurrency market is under downward pressure, largely due to Bitcoin’s recent price movement. XRP has been impacted, but the effect has been mostly on a micro level. No significant support levels have been breached, and the overall market structure remains intact. The key invalidation point for the current triangle pattern is at $1.96—if this level is broken, a major shift in market structure is likely. Possible Downside Scenarios While the triangle pattern suggests a potential upward breakout, a more complex structure like a WXY correction could also unfold. In this case, the price may move downward before resuming upward momentum.

This decline has sparked debates about its future trajectory, with analysts closely examining major market metrics to understand where BTC’s price action could likely be headed next. Among these, CryptoQuant contributor Percival’s detailed insights shed light on Bitcoin’s current state, offering an in-depth look at key market trends. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Plummets To Neutral: Reversal Signal? Bitcoin Market Dynamics And Key Indicators Percival’s analysis highlights Bitcoin’s seasonal behavior, which has consistently influenced its price patterns in recent years. Historically, the final months of the year see increased sell-side pressure, often extending into January. This year is no different, with institutional profit-taking and broader macroeconomic factors playing a significant role. Despite these challenges, Bitcoin has shown resilience, maintaining a $90,000 support level despite heavy selling pressure. According to Percival, Bitcoin has experienced a 13% decline in Open Interest, much of it attributed to institutional activity on platforms like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have also seen a reduction in monthly inflows, dropping from $14 billion to $6.6 billion. These declines reflect broader market sentiment but also highlight Bitcoin’s ability to sustain critical support levels. On the sell side, Percival noted that December saw substantial pressure, with outflows reaching $200 million per day. However, this trend eased in January, with sell-side risk indicators showing a balanced market. This can be attributed to the Short-Term Holder Market Value to Realized Value (STH MVRV) remaining in a favorable zone, signaling that short-term investors are not facing unbearable losses. This stability suggests that short-term holders are unlikely to contribute to further downward pressure, creating an environment that supports Bitcoin’s $90,000 floor. Demand Trends and Future Scenarios While sell-side pressure has diminished, demand dynamics remain a critical factor in Bitcoin’s outlook. Percival highlighted a slight slowdown in on-chain volume, though it continues to hover around a healthy $12 billion across exchange inflows and outflows. Related Reading: 8 Bitcoin Price Predictions For 2025: What Banks, Hedge Funds And Experts Say This level of activity indicates that Bitcoin still retains strong market interest despite recent price declines. Percival also pointed to a potential risk in the gap between the STH MVRV average of 1 and the short-term holder cost base of $88,000. This gap could act as a “breathing space” for external market events to influence Bitcoin’s price, potentially challenging its ability to maintain the $90,000 support. However, for now, the balance between demand and sell-side risks suggests a period of consolidation rather than a significant further decline. Percival wrote: The odds favor the $90K floor, but beware! There is a gap in the STH MVRV between 1.08 and the average at 1 (STH cost base $88), and this difference can become the “breathing space” for an eventual external scenario, zeroing the possibility of going deeper!

This marks another loss for the SEC, following a string of defeats in recent crypto-related cases. Court Rebukes SEC’s Actions Coinbase has won its petition for a writ of mandamus at the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, which rebuked the SEC for denying its request for clearer rules regarding the regulation of digital assets. The court found the SEC’s order insufficiently reasoned and arbitrary, stating that it was “conclusory” and “capricious.” This ruling forces the SEC to reconsider its stance and provide a more thorough explanation for its refusal to create specific rules governing crypto regulations. Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase, took to Twitter to celebrate the victory, stating: “We just won our petition for a writ of mandamus at the Third Circuit rebuking the SEC for its order denying our rulemaking petition.” He said that the court’s decision highlighted the SEC’s failure to provide adequate reasoning for its actions. We just won our petition for a writ of mandamus at the Third Circuit.

A Pattern of Losses for the SEC This ruling adds to a growing list of defeats for the SEC under Gensler’s leadership. The agency has been called out for its arbitrary decision-making in multiple cases, including the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF rejection, where the SEC was similarly criticized for its lack of justification.

Shiba Inu’s burn rate has jumped by 4100% due to increased whale transactions, while Ethereum’s price analysis indicates a critical point. Yet, Web3Bay (3BAY) captures headlines with its notable presale achievements. With $630K raised and 175 million coins already sold in its presale, Web3Bay is proving its potential in leveraging Web3 for e-commerce. Now in its third presale stage, Web3Bay continues to draw interest from crypto enthusiasts and early adopters. Ethereum Price Analysis: Struggles at $3,721 Resistance Level Ethereum is currently facing challenges as it struggles to break the $3,721 resistance mark. After peaking at $4,107 in December 2024, the market is looking for stability. Recent trends show an increase in Ethereum holdings, with 1.52 million ETH accumulated by a certain group over the last week, suggesting optimism for a price recovery. Despite some resilience, market sentiment is mixed. Indicators like Liveliness suggest ongoing liquidations, with some investors remaining cautious. A reduction in selling pressure could help Ethereum gain momentum, but the market’s outlook is presently guarded. Whale Driven Shiba Inu Burn Rate Skyrockets by 4100% A massive transaction resulting in the burning of 21 million SHIB tokens has led to a 4100% surge in the Shiba Inu burn rate. This increase, accompanied by $751 million in whale transactions in one day, indicates a growing interest from large-scale investors. However, despite the burn rate increase, SHIB’s price has fallen by 11% amidst a broader market downturn. This shows the complex interaction between supply adjustments and market sentiment, where a high burn rate does not immediately translate to price stability. Web3Bay: The Future of Online Shopping! Web3Bay is a decentralized platform that utilizes the full potential of Web3 to create a secure and transparent online marketplace for buying and selling digital assets. Setting itself apart from traditional e-commerce sites, Web3Bay offers unmatched security, inclusivity, and transparency. This platform melds blockchain’s best features—immutability, transparency, and security—with a straightforward interface, making decentralized shopping accessible and user-friendly. Web3Bay ushers in a new era for e-commerce, granting users complete control over their transactions and cultivating a community-led marketplace. Web3Bay has been in the spotlight recently due to its thriving presale, which has successfully raised over $630,000 and sold more than 175 million tokens across 28 stages. Each stage of the presale escalates the token price, offering substantial benefits to early supporters. Currently, Web3Bay tokens are priced attractively at $0.0039675, making them some of the most accessible on the market. Early investors are projecting an extraordinary return on investment (ROI) of 6,430% at launch. This strategic pricing model rewards early participants and lays a solid foundation for the platform’s official launch, thereby enhancing the long-term value for all token holders. The ongoing presale underscores the escalating interest in Web3Bay and emphasizes the importance of getting involved now. As the presale progresses, the price of 3BAY tokens is set to increase, presenting a prime opportunity for new investors to acquire tokens at a minimal initial investment. Act swiftly to capitalize on the upcoming price surge. Wrapping Up! From the significant rise in Shiba Inu’s burn rate due to whale activity to Ethereum’s price struggle at $3,721, the digital asset market is bustling with opportunities and challenges. However, Web3Bay stands out as a promising project that revolutionizes how digital assets are traded in Web3 for e-commerce. The presale’s success with over $630,000 raised and 175 million 3BAY tokens sold underscores strong market confidence. The current low token price and projected ROI position Web3Bay as an appealing choice for those ready to invest in its potential.

The price is still showing positive signs and could clear the $2.550 resistance. XRP price gained over 4% and rallied above the $2.450 zone. The price is now trading above $2.4650 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The Federal Reserve ’s Jan. 29 meeting looms large as markets eagerly await clarity on interest rate policy. With a 97.3% probability that rates will remain steady at 4.25%-4.5%, according to market forecasts, and just a slim 2.7% chance of a 25 bps cut, the Fed’s decision is increasingly tied to incoming data. Chair Jerome Powell clarified in the December meeting that future rate cuts would hinge on economic indicators—a point reinforced by the central bank’s gradual shift, with three recent rate cuts of 50 bps in September, 25 bps in November, and 25 bps in December. For the crypto market and Bitcoin ( BTC ), which is currently trading at $94,840 and down nearly 7% this past week, the Fed’s decision could spark either renewed interest or further pressure. BTC 6-month price chart | Source: crypto.news Let’s explore the key economic data and their potential crypto impact. Economic indicators: A mixed bag for the Fed Inflation remains the Fed’s nemesis, but recent numbers suggest the battle is far from over. December’s Consumer Price Index is forecast to rise 2.8% from 2.7% in November, marking its third consecutive monthly increase and the highest since July 2024. Core CPI—a favored measure by the Fed that excludes volatile food and energy prices—is projected to have risen 0.2%, keeping the annual rate at 3.3%. Economists from Wells Fargo warn that inflationary pressures may linger due to fading disinflationary tailwinds, such as improved supply chains and falling commodity prices. Meanwhile, the job market continues to defy expectations. December’s payroll data showed an impressive 256,000 new jobs, surpassing consensus forecasts. A resilient labor market raises doubts about the Fed’s need for further easing, as employment strength could sustain consumer spending and economic activity. Yet, it also complicates the Fed’s task of balancing inflation control without triggering a sharp slowdown. Adding to the puzzle, long-term Treasury yields climbed to 4.8%, their highest level since late 2023. Historically, yields nearing 5% have coincided with stock market corrections, as noted by Fidelity’s Jurrien Timmer. The dollar index also surged to levels unseen since November 2022, pushing the euro at parity with the dollar—a sign of tighter financial conditions that may already be doing some of the Fed’s work. What this means for Bitcoin and the crypto market Bitcoin’s recent price dip—down 12.5% from its all-time high of $108,268 on December 17, 2024—hints at a broader risk-off sentiment in financial markets. If the January CPI report confirms sticky inflation or resilient growth, the Fed may hold steady or even signal a longer pause before additional easing. Additionally, a rise in Treasury yields and strong dollar often weighs on global assets, including crypto, as it increases the relative cost of holding non-dollar-denominated investments. All these outcomes could dampen Bitcoin’s recovery prospects, as the crypto market thrives on expectations of easy monetary policy. The crypto market’s recent behavior shows a high correlation with risk sentiment on Wall Street, where the Nasdaq dropped 0.4% during the Jan. 13 session, mirroring the cautiousness reflected in Bitcoin’s price sentiment.",News|economy|Federal Reserve|Inflation,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-01-14 04:12:53

Some crypto are catching their eye for its potential to generate 500x gains. Alongside XRP, seasoned investors are turning their attention to BigBossInu, Ethereum (ETH), Injective (INJ), and SEI. Here’s why these digital assets are becoming popular picks for high-growth potential in the coming years. BigBossInu: Revolutionizing Crypto with Its Explosive Presale BigBossInu is rapidly shaking up the crypto market, with its presale igniting strong demand from investors. This opportunity promises massive rewards for early backers. As anticipation builds, BigBossInu is one of the hottest cryptos to track. Armed with cutting-edge features and an ambitious roadmap, BigBossInu is set to deliver game-changing growth in the months to come, making it a prime candidate for 500x gains. >>>>>> Ethereum is showing stability at $3,470 after a slight dip along with Bitcoin over the past 24 hours. The crypto market remains mixed in its sentiment, with Ethereum ETF approval generating little change in price. Traders are on the lookout for the next significant move. Ripple (XRP) skyrocketed nearly 98% following Ripple’s partial win against the SEC, briefly climbing to become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. However, the price has since cooled, settling around $2.037 as market enthusiasm fades. The win has also prompted major exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken to relist XRP. Injective (INJ) is making waves in the DeFi space with its focus on decentralized derivatives and cross-chain trading. Its cutting-edge protocol enables users to trade a wide variety of financial markets in a decentralized manner. INJ’s innovative approach has attracted attention, especially from XRP holders, who see Injective as a promising investment alongside BigBossInu for massive returns. Sei recently achieved an all-time high of $0.589 and continues to trade around $0.60, reflecting a bullish trend. The increase comes after its listings on Binance and Coinbase, as well as a notable rise in transaction activity. With its efficient Layer-1 blockchain, Sei is emerging as a formidable player in high-speed trading. >>> Conclusion XRP investors looking to diversify and find the next big opportunity, BigBossInu, Ethereum (ETH), Injective (INJ), and SEI offer high-potential rewards. BigBossInu, in particular, is gaining traction for its potential to deliver 500x gains, making it one of the most exciting cryptos to watch in the coming years. As always, thorough research and strategic planning are essential when investing in cryptocurrencies. With the right approach, these digital assets could help investors achieve substantial financial success.

The ETF, named iShares Bitcoin ETF, aims to provide Canadian investors with access to BlackRock’s flagship U.S. spot Bitcoin fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Cboe Canada stated that the fund will allocate “all or substantially all of its assets” to IBIT. The Canadian ETF will trade under the ticker IBIT, identical to its U.S. counterpart. Additionally, shares denominated in U.S. dollars will be available under the ticker IBIT.U. Helen Hayes, BlackRock’s head of iShares Canada, commented, “The iShares Fund provides Canadian investors with a way to gain exposure to bitcoin and helps remove the operational and custody complexities of holding bitcoin directly.” This ETF joins a growing list of over a dozen Bitcoin ETFs already trading on Canadian exchanges, according to Nasdaq. The IBIT.U shares will be listed in Canada but priced in U.S. dollars, as confirmed by Cboe Canada. Growing Demand for Bitcoin ETFs BlackRock’s U.S. IBIT ETF has rapidly become the most sought-after Bitcoin fund globally. Since its January 2024 launch, the fund has recorded over $37 billion in net inflows, as reported by Farside Investors. U.S. Bitcoin ETFs collectively experienced more than $35 billion in net inflows throughout the year, equating to roughly $144 million daily. This figure also accounts for $20 billion in outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a fund launched in 2013 with higher management fees compared to newer options. In November, U.S. Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $100 billion in net assets for the first time, Bloomberg Intelligence reported. JPMorgan noted in December that Bitcoin is becoming a key portfolio component for investors seeking to hedge against inflation and geopolitical risks. Sygnum Bank suggested that surging institutional inflows in 2025 could create demand shocks, driving Bitcoin prices higher.",Bitcoin|Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-14 04:20:00

Here’s how",https://timestabloid.com/with-xrp-expert-says-ripple-will-have-the-largest-ipo-in-history-of-the-world-heres-how/,"Ripple, a leading blockchain company, is at the center of speculation about achieving the largest Initial Public Offering (IPO) in history. Saudi Aramco, the oil giant that currently holds the record, raised $25.6 billion during its IPO in 2019 and has a valuation of $1.93 trillion as of 2023. Crypto expert Zach Rector drew a compelling comparison between Ripple and Saudi Aramco, likening Ripple’s extensive XRP holdings to Aramco’s oil reserves. XRP, the digital asset closely associated with Ripple, is increasingly seen as a vital resource, similar to oil in the firm’s strategic importance and potential for global utility. This analogy highlights the transformative potential of Ripple’s technology and the critical role of XRP in its business model. Rector’s statement has amplified discussions around Ripple’s IPO, drawing attention to the company’s unique position in the evolving digital economy. Ripple will have the largest IPO in the history of the world. In fact, it’s very fitting that the largest IPO so far was from an oil company. Ripple = Saudi Aramco XRP = Oil Very similar setup with Ripple having significant “proven reserves” (XRP) to use an oil term. pic.twitter.com/CEHCQ4FEqm — Zach Rector (@ZachRector7) January 12, 2025 Brad Garlinghouse Reveals Ripple’s Massive XRP Holdings In a recent interview with Citizens JMP Bank, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse spoke about the company’s valuation and growing dominance in the cryptocurrency sector. While Ripple was previously valued at $11 billion, Garlinghouse revealed that the amount of XRP held by Ripple has now surpassed $100 billion. This staggering figure underscores Ripple’s significant growth and ability to leverage XRP for liquidity solutions and cross-border payment innovations. These developments have led to increased speculation about Ripple’s IPO potential, with many in the crypto community believing it could eclipse Saudi Aramco’s record. Twitter user LeeLong24 pointed out that Ripple’s substantial XRP holdings suggest its valuation could far exceed previous estimates, further fueling a potential IPO’s anticipation.

By partnering with financial institutions , banks, and payment providers, Ripple has demonstrated its ability to reduce costs and enhance the efficiency of cross-border payments. With the global adoption of its technology accelerating, Ripple’s strategic positioning is stronger than ever. X user, VoxLibertas emphasized the historic nature of Ripple’s rise, calling it the emergence of a company that could become the most significant in history. Such sentiments reflect the broader optimism in the blockchain industry about Ripple’s potential to redefine financial systems. The comparison between Ripple and Saudi Aramco reflects the shifting tides in global industries. Where oil once defined economic power, digital assets like XRP may become the cornerstone of the future financial ecosystem. Ripple’s IPO, if it materializes, has the potential to mark a defining moment in the history of blockchain technology and the global economy.

It says this pause is part of efforts to upgrade its compliance suite, which aims to maintain its security standards and prevent misuse by bad actors. Backlash and Clarification In a January 12 announcement , the exchange stated, “To enhance the security of our platform and safeguard against bad actors, we have made the decision to temporarily pause crypto withdrawals till January 28th, 2025.” Mudrex also reassured users that INR withdrawals remain unaffected, crypto deposits are fully functional, and all funds are completely safe and secure. Despite these promises, the announcement has received backlash within the crypto community. Crypto trader Vivan Live brought the matter to the attention of users on X, advising them to remove their funds immediately by converting their assets into INR to avoid potential issues. Another community member, Aakash Athawasya, voiced skepticism about Mudrex’s intentions, alleging that the exchange never truly allowed such functionalities and only offered price exposure without ownership. He also warned users to avoid the platform and instead use on-chain solutions, citing personal losses on Indian exchanges. However, founder Alankar Saxena responded to the criticism, defending Mudrex’s long-standing support for crypto deposits and withdrawals. He noted that the company had always allowed users to access their funds freely, even when other similar entities limited such functionalities due to regulatory and operational challenges. The temporary suspension comes amid rapid growth for the company, with its user base reportedly rising 200% and its December 2024 trading volumes increasing 20-fold to $200 million. Regulatory Pressures Mudrex’s decision to halt crypto withdrawals also coincides with another exchange, Bybit, temporarily restricting services to its Indian customers effective January 12, 2025. The company blamed recent regulatory developments and the continuation of previous restrictions for its decision. As a result, customers can no longer open new trades or access products on the platform. However, fund withdrawals remain available. While India was ranked highly in the 2024 Crypto Adoption Index, it still maintains high levies on digital assets, including a 1% tax deducted at source (TDS) and a 30% flat rate as income tax on crypto earnings. In December last year, authorities in the country accused several crypto exchanges, including Binance and WazirX, of evading tariffs. According to Pankaj Chaudhary, Minister of State for Finance, Nest Services Ltd, a company linked to Binance, faces nearly $87 million in unpaid Goods and Services Tax (GST) demands.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS.

A report from 404 Media reveals that Meta-owned Facebook has been removing links to Pixelfed, a decentralized competitor to Instagram. Links to pixelfed.social are being flagged as “spam” and swiftly deleted. Meta’s censorship of competitors contradicts its commitment to free expression AJ Sadauskas first noticed the censorship of Pixelfed on Bluesky , a competitor to X founded in 2019 by Jack Dorsey. Sadauskas posted screenshots showing Pixelfed links being removed from Facebook “within seconds.” Another Bluesky user, Johan Vandevelde, shared that the automatic deletions weren’t limited to Pixelfed but also extended to other Facebook competitors. He said: “Someone was asking for [Facebook] alternatives, and I gave a link to Mastodon. My comment was immediately removed, also because of ‘spam.” – Johan Vandevelde On January 7, Meta published a news release titled “More Speech and Fewer Mistakes,” written by the company’s chief global affairs officer, Joel Kaplan. The release featured a five-minute video from Zuckerberg, who vowed that Meta would “get back to its roots around free expression.” Along with reducing moderation, Meta also announced the elimination of third-party fact-checkers in favor of a community notes model similar to X’s. Meta’s policy shift faces criticism amid political pressures Meta’s shift in policy was praised by US President-elect Donald Trump, who suggested it was a response to threats he had made against the company. However, some of Meta’s top executives , including Michael McConnell, co-chair of the company’s oversight board, criticized Zuckerberg for “bowing to political pressure” ahead of Trump’s inauguration. While the apparent censorship of Pixelfed could be seen as Meta trying to prevent the promotion of direct competitors rather than stifling free speech, it seems at odds with the company’s newly stated vision. The Wall Street Journal’s Editorial Board commented that Meta’s changes seem more focused on mending political relationships than advancing free speech. The Editorial Board stated that such changes may be in part motivated by Meta’s desire to rebuild ties with Republicans poised to take control of Washington and avoid regulation. The board added that Zuckerberg is also clearly responding to the message sent by voters in electing Trump.

Amid this performance, some analysts consider BTC’s price will likely see another drop before the flagship crypto aims for new highs. Related Reading: Ethereum Tagged As Crypto’s ‘Most Cursed’ Coin—What’s Haunting It? Bitcoin Needs Daily Close Above $91,000 On Monday, Bitcoin shook off the weekend gains, dropping 5.8% to $90,300, its lowest price since November 18. The flagship crypto ended last week with an overall positive performance, nearing $96,000 and closing Friday above $94,000. This performance was held throughout the weekend, with Bitcoin moving between the $93,700 and $95,900 price range the past two days. This week started with seven straight red 1-hour candles, dropping below $91,000 for the first time since the December 19 correction and dipping lower than the December 5 pullback. However, Bitcoin bounced after dropping below this key level, recovering the recently lost mark. Crypto analyst Rekt Capital stated that BTC’s daily close will dictate the next move, suggesting it needs a close above $91,000 to confirm the reclaim. The analyst explained, “Last week, Bitcoin was deviating beyond the Range High resistance of $101,000. This week, Bitcoin is potentially deviating below the Range Low support of $91,000.” He asserted that BTC closed above the $101,000 range high last Monday but failed to retest it into new support after the breakout, reverting to the $91,000-$101,000 range. For this week, Rekt Capital added that even if Bitcoin closes the day below the $91,000 range low, it will likely need to turn that level into resistance for its price to drop into the $87,000-$91,000 range. Nonetheless, he stated that Bitcoin generally needs to close above this key level to persevere in its current range but noted that “a lot can change through the day.” Is A Dip To $87,000 Coming? Rekt Capital highlighted that BTC’s monthly returns tend to be “patchy and predominately bearish” in January. As CoinGlass data shows, Bitcoin’s performance has been mostly bearish in January. Since 2013, BTC has started the year in red seven times, including 2025’s current performance. According to the post, the market usually “picks up” in February. He added that the higher timeframe levels that are “teasing to be lost as support” are “likely to be reclaimed” in the future. Meanwhile, Altcoin Sherpa considers that “1 last liquidation wick” is due before “we reverse for BTC.” The analyst also suggested that Altcoins are likely to drop another 30%-50% before the Altseason. Similarly, Daan Crypto Trades pointed out that a “bunch of shorts have entered the market in the past few hours.” The trader noted that “price just keeps slowly dribbling back down” as these positions are usually “punished” when bulls are in control. Related Reading: Solana (SOL) Teeters on the Edge: Is a Steep Decline Next? Daan explained, “At some point, the shorts will have to close out, but they probably won’t do so before pushing the market down further, combined with the spot selling from Coinbase.” And added that “the slow grinds down end in a violent wick, after which shorts take profit, and we see a (local) bottom.” Additionally, the trader highlighted the similarities between BTC’s performance between December 2023 and January 2024 and December 2024 and January 2025. If history were to repeat, Bitcoin’s next move could be a correction to the $87,000 support, followed by a consolidation period in the new range. As of this writing, BTC is trading at $91,700, a 2.9% decline in the daily timeframe.

While investors are anticipating the inauguration of the pro-crypto Trump administration to inspire a market uptrend, a recent governmental approval may have tempered investors’ optimism and altered the direction of Bitcoin price predictions. Ethereum (ETH), another top crypto coin, has also continued its fall, and investors are now out for a dark horse that could save the day. Top among them is the new Remittix ($RTX) project which has continued to make headlines for weeks now. The new DeFi project has raised excitement in the crypto market with its PayFi solution, and experts believe the project has enough potential to live up to the bullish hype it’s getting right now. More details on Remittix and the top two cryptos coming up. Silk Road BTC Sale Approval Impacts Bitcoin Price Predictions It’s just a few weeks into 2025, and Bitcoin has already had a roller-coaster experience in the crypto market. Recall that the BTC price set a new ATH at $108K just before Christmas last year. After a minor relapse in the last few days of 2024, the BTC price made a bullish dash for its ATH again earlier this year before the general market crash. Lately, there have been quite a number of bullish Bitcoin price predictions tipping BTC for another rally in anticipation of a new US administration. However, such predictions have now been dealt a big blow as Bitcoin now faces uncertain times following a major regulatory development. The US Department of Justice has approved the sale of 69,370 Bitcoins seized from the Silk Road marketplace at over $6 billion. This news marks the end of a long legal battle, but its impact on BTC could be disastrous. The BTC price is now trading at $95,000, a weekly 3.15% dip. Many experts are rethinking their Bitcoin price predictions, with some developing cold feet about. Ethereum Price Dips 16%: Will ETH Rebound? Before the recent market-wide setback, Ethereum has been quite unimpressive considering how bullish Bitcoin and other top altcoins like Solana got late last year. Although ETH briefly crossed the $4,000 mark in December, the coin soon could not sustain its bullish momentum and is now struggling to stay above $3,200. At $3,068, the Ethereum price has now dipped 26% in the past month, mirroring the overall bearishness in the crypto market. ETH investors are cautious as Ethereum ETFs are experiencing outflows, and Ethereum’s staking yield continues to drop. With such uncertainty clouding the Ethereum price trajectory, ETH holders can only hope for a rebound, especially if the coin can defy the general downtrend in the market. Viral Remittix ($RTX) Steals the Spotlight As Bitcoin and Ethereum struggle to regain momentum due to regulatory pressures and market volatility, the crypto market is jumping on Remittix ‘s dream of a PayFi solution that addresses the problems of crypto-to-fiat transactions. Remittix’s PayFi technology supports over 40 cryptocurrencies and allows for direct transfers into more than 30 fiat currencies across the world. The project is the newest gift of innovation from the DeFi sector. With the entire crypto market egging it on, the Remittix platform would be going head-to-head with traditional payment institutions like Stripe and Wise. Without any hidden fees or conversion delays, there is no doubt that Remittix has what it takes to hold its own. The project’s native $RTX token has quickly gained traction, with presale numbers doing impressive numbers. In a market where Bitcoin and Ethereum are battling bearish pressure, Remittix has earned a reputation as one of the most promising cryptos in 2025. The $RTX token begins its profit journey with up to 800% in its presale for early birds. It gets even better after launch as experts project that the demand for Remittix’s PayFi solution would create a huge demand that could pump the $RTX token by up to 5,000% . The $RTX presale is in high demand and selling out fast. Buy now and lock in short and long-term gains.

As reported by Seek Alpha on Jan. 13, Brett Knoblauch , who is the Head of Crypto and Digital Assets Research at Cantor Fitzgerald, said that he believes the MicroStrategy (MSTR) stocks would reach $613. Currently, the average price of MSTR on Wall Street sits at $518. If MSTR reaches $613, its stock prices would boost up roughly 20%. Cantor Fitzgerald just boosted their price target on $MSTR from $518 to $613. 👀 Getting a little cliche to say Trump insiders know something, but I like the bullishness. — Bitcoin Overflow (@btc_overflow) January 13, 2025 Knoblauch predicts the uptick in the shares for MSTR as the firm has “developed a capital markets flywheel that allows it to accretively add bitcoin on a per share basis”, he wrote in a note. He also credits Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) post-U.S. election surge as a factor which buoyed MSTR, which is why the company raised about 18 billion dollars in capital in November and December of 2024, Cantor adds. You might also like: 3 potential catalysts to reverse crashing Bitcoin and altcoin prices The expert also calculated that MicroStrategy can issue $6.7 billion of equity, $2 billion preferred , $18 billion of debt and another 287K BTC to support his prediction. MicroStrategy is expected to continue to enjoy a yield greater than 10% on Bitcoin until 2025- this could mean an additional $400 million for the U.S. treasury through MicroStrategy, believes Knoblauch. “Ultimately, we are expecting 2025 to be another year where MSTR delivers a BTC yield above 10%, which would suggest treasury operations profits of more than $4B.” Brett Knoblauch MicroStrategy’s “21/21” plan, wherein the firm wants to accumulate $42 billion worth of BTC over the next three years, has already been set in motion. The corporate giant started buying BTC since Aug. 2020 where it acquired 21,454 BTC for approximately $250 million at an average price of about $11,653 per BTC. The firm’s most recent purchase was made yesterday, on Jan 13, where it bought around 2,530 BTC for $243 million, further fueling the market optimism. As of today, MicroStrategy has 450K BTC in its portfolio. In the past 24 hours, MSTR’s price has surged 0.49% to $328.40 , whereas BTC’s price has shot up +0.43% to $94,932, a close alignment in terms of percentage gains. This similarity comes from MicroStrategy’s strong correlation with the price of BTC since the company’s strategy is primarily based on its BTC ownership and acquisitions, and its stock is, therefore, sensitive to fluctuations in the value of BTC.

As Sony steps into the world of blockchain, it seeks to empower fans and creators alike, allowing communities to connect globally while protecting their rights. The tech giant launched two new projects on the layer 2 network: a NFT-based fan marketing platform and a crypto exchange services platform. Here’s What Sony’s Soneium Platform Has to Offer Built on the Ethereum blockchain, Sony’s Soneium is a layer-2 network designed with the goal of inspiring creativity and emotion for its users. The Sony Blockchain Solution Labs (BSL) stated that the launch of layer-2 platform seeks to transcend social, economic, and regional barriers thereby creating an open internet wherein ideas can thrive and value can flow freely and equitably. Being an open-to-all platform, Soneium is a public blockchain that fosters inclusivity without limitations. It leverages the OP Stack and Superchain technology developed by the Optimism Foundation to deliver a cutting-edge blockchain experience. Speaking on the mainnet launch, Jun Watanabe, Chairman, Sony Block Solutions Labs, said: “Soneium is built to transcend boundaries, empowering innovation and collaboration. At Sony BSL, we’re proud to create a platform redefining how communities and creators interact with the internet.” Sony announced Soneium Layer-2 blockchain last year in August 2024. Since then, it has announced developers to test several applications on the “Soneium Minato” testnet. Furthermore, they have also introduced several applications, spanning entertainment, including games, NFTs, and social platforms, as well as financial and other utility-focused apps. The network has surpassed 14 million accounts and verified over 47 million transactions. Stablecoin issuer Circle was quick to announce a collaboration with Sony to introduce its USDC stablecoin on the Soneium Layer-2, in a push into the Web3 industry. Two Key Projects Launched on the Layer-2 Blockchain The official press release from Sony shows that two new projects will launch on the Soneium mainnet soon. The first is the NFT-based fan marketing platform provided by SNFT Inc. Starting February 2025, this fan marketing platform will go live offering comprehensive support for companies engaging in NFT initiatives. This covers everything from execution to the analysis of fan engagement metrics tied to NFTs . The service will enable businesses to easily issue NFTs, opening new opportunities for fan interaction and creating engaging user experiences to strengthen relationships. Unlike many Web3 platforms that require separate crypto wallet setups, the new platform will feature an integrated web-based wallet with social login functionality. In another development, S.BLOX Corporation has rebranded its “WhaleFin” platform into “S. BLOX” to enhance user experience for crypto trading as well as interacting with apps on Soneium. The platform is a crucial addition, as crypto assets serve as primary payment methods within Soneium’s Web3 applications. To celebrate the launch, S.BLOX Corporation has kicked off a promotional campaign starting today. Users who open a new account and trade crypto assets will receive BTC worth 3,000 yen as a reward.

38931420,https://coinpaper.com/6892/uniswap-wallet-faces-security-warning-as-critical-flaw-exposed,1736832600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Uniswap Wallet Faces Security Warning as Critical Flaw Exposed,https://coinpaper.com/6892/uniswap-wallet-faces-security-warning-as-critical-flaw-exposed,"Cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain projects are facing heightened scrutiny as significant technical changes and potential vulnerabilities come to light. South Korea's Upbit has issued a cautionary notice regarding Internet of Services Token (IOST) as it undergoes a major layer-2 transition, potentially impacting its tokenomics and market stability. Meanwhile, security concerns have emerged over Uniswap’s Web3 wallet, with a reported vulnerability that could compromise user funds if exploited. Uniswap Web3 Wallet Users Urged to Stay Vigilant as ScaleBit Reports Critical Vulnerability On Jan. 13, ScaleBit, a subsidiary of security auditing firm BitsLab, raised alarms about a critical vulnerability in Uniswap’s Web3 wallet. According to ScaleBit, the flaw could potentially compromise ”all stored assets” within the wallet. This revelation has sent ripples across the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, sparking concerns over wallet security. In a statement, ScaleBit detailed the purported flaw, which allows attackers with physical access to a device to bypass authentication mechanisms and extract the wallet’s mnemonic phrase. This phrase, commonly referred to as a ”seed phrase,” is a unique string of 12 to 24 random words. It serves as a master key, granting full control over a wallet’s assets from any device. ScaleBit’s statement highlighted the gravity of the issue, stating, “Anyone with access to an unlocked device can obtain the wallet’s mnemonic phrase in under three minutes. This vulnerability persists even in the latest version of the app.” Given the critical nature of mnemonic phrases in securing digital assets, this vulnerability poses a significant risk. ScaleBit advised Uniswap Wallet users to avoid lending their devices to others until a patch is deployed. The reported vulnerability comes against a backdrop of increasing cybersecurity threats in the cryptocurrency industry. In 2024, losses due to exploits surged by 40% compared to the previous year, reaching approximately $2.3 billion, according to cybersecurity firm Cyvers. Access control breaches, especially in centralized exchanges (CEXs) and custodial platforms, contributed significantly to this rise. Deddy Lavid, co-founder and CEO of Cyvers, emphasized that these breaches highlight the urgent need for robust security measures. Despite the alarming annual figures, the last months of 2024 showed a noticeable decline in losses from crypto scams, exploits, and hacks . Blockchain security firms CertiK and PeckShield reported significantly lower figures in December compared to earlier months. CertiK Findings: December saw $28.6 million in known losses, down from $63.8 million in November and $115.8 million in October. PeckShield Analysis: A similar trend was observed, with hack-related losses in December totaling $24.7 million—a 71% decrease from November. These reductions reflect improved security measures across the industry, though vulnerabilities like the one reported by ScaleBit underline the persistent challenges. The Importance of User Vigilance As the cryptocurrency ecosystem continues to evolve, incidents like the reported Uniswap wallet vulnerability bring attention to the need for user awareness and proactive measures. Web3 wallets, touted for their decentralization and user control, must be paired with robust security protocols to mitigate risks. Recommendations for Users: Avoid sharing or lending devices containing Web3 wallets. Regularly update wallet software to ensure access to the latest security patches. Enable additional layers of security, such as device-level encryption and biometric authentication, where available. Use hardware wallets for added protection when holding significant amounts of cryptocurrency. As one of the leading decentralized exchanges, Uniswap’s response to this vulnerability will be closely watched by the community. A timely patch and transparent communication will be critical to maintaining user trust. Until then, Uniswap Wallet users are advised to exercise caution and follow security best practices to safeguard their assets. The cryptocurrency sector’s reliance on trustless systems necessitates unwavering attention to security. Incidents like the ScaleBit report serve as stark reminders that even widely used platforms can harbor vulnerabilities. Strengthening security infrastructure and fostering collaboration between wallet developers and auditors will be essential in ensuring the continued growth and resilience of DeFi. Upbit Issues Warning on IOST Ahead of Layer-2 Transition and Major Tokenomic Overhaul In related news, South Korean cryptocurrency exchange Upbit has issued a cautionary notice regarding the Internet of Services Token (IOST), following an advisory from the Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA). The warning aims to alert investors about significant changes tied to IOST’s upcoming transition to a layer-2 blockchain, which is expected to bring considerable shifts in the tokenomics and network structure. IOST, a blockchain project focusing on decentralized applications (DApps) with a strong emphasis on scalability and high throughput, is preparing to migrate to a layer-2 blockchain in the coming weeks. This move is anticipated to significantly enhance the project’s efficiency, transaction capacity, and fee structure. As part of this transition, IOST plans to issue approximately 21.3 billion new tokens. These will be allocated strategically to support validator rewards, user incentives, community engagement, and ecosystem development. Token Distribution Breakdown: 60%: Validator rewards to strengthen network security and encourage participation. 20%: Airdrops aimed at incentivizing users and fostering adoption. 8%: Community incentives to drive engagement. 5%: Developer grants for building on the ecosystem. 4%: Governance funding managed through the Nexus DAO. 3%: Team compensation and operational costs. This phased token supply expansion is designed to support the network’s transition while mitigating risks associated with sudden market fluctuations. On Jan. 13, Upbit released a notice urging caution to IOST investors, citing the upcoming structural and tokenomic changes. Upbit’s advisory aligns with DAXA’s protocol of flagging digital assets undergoing significant changes or exhibiting unusual market activity. The goal is to ensure transparency and safeguard investor interests amid shifts in market dynamics. The Digital Asset eXchange Alliance (DAXA), a consortium of leading South Korean cryptocurrency exchanges , plays a crucial role in maintaining market integrity. By monitoring digital assets and issuing warnings when necessary, DAXA aims to establish unified standards across the industry. The decision to transition to a layer-2 blockchain was finalized following IOST’s second governance vote, which concluded on Jan. 12. Additionally, the move is expected to bridge IOST’s current layer-1 network with its new, more efficient infrastructure. This shift is anticipated to improve transaction speed, scalability, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining a strong focus on decentralized governance through the Nexus DAO. The issuance of new tokens and the broader network overhaul come with inherent risks. Sudden supply expansions can lead to price volatility, particularly in the short term, as the market adjusts to the new dynamics. However, IOST’s phased rollout and detailed allocation plan aim to minimize disruptions and create long-term value for its ecosystem. The IOST advisory comes at a time when South Korea is intensifying its oversight of the cryptocurrency sector. Recent incidents, such as the $50 million Upbit hack attributed to North Korea and investigations into 600,000 Know Your Customer (KYC) violations, demonstrate the country’s proactive stance on regulatory compliance and investor protection. Meanwhile, the caution surrounding IOST places the spotlight on the importance of transparency and communication during periods of significant change, particularly as the global cryptocurrency industry continues to evolve. What’s Next for IOST Investors? As the IOST transition progresses, investors are encouraged to closely monitor updates from both the project team and their respective exchanges. Upbit has assured its users that it will maintain open communication with IOST’s developers to provide timely information and safeguard assets. Key Recommendations for Investors: Stay informed about the project’s updates and the timing of the layer-2 transition. Exercise caution when trading or holding IOST during this period of change. Consider the potential for short-term volatility and align trading strategies accordingly. IOST’s planned migration to a layer-2 blockchain represents a bold step forward in its mission to enhance scalability and network efficiency. However, as with any major overhaul, the transition introduces complexities and potential risks. Upbit’s cautionary notice and DAXA’s involvement show the importance of vigilance and transparency in navigating these changes. While the road ahead may be uncertain in the short term, IOST’s commitment to decentralized governance and ecosystem growth positions it as a noteworthy contender in the blockchain space. Investors and stakeholders alike will be watching closely as the project enters this transformative phase.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|UNI,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-14 05:30:00

It aims to give the regulator insight into how foreign agencies address challenges related to emerging payments and digital assets. The release said that the first TRE secondment will begin next month, with DFS and the Bank of England exchanging senior staff with expertise in emerging payments and digital assets. The Transatlantic Regulatory Exchange will enhance crypto regulation expertise The TRE program will start in February and last six months, with participants visiting the Bank of England for more learning. According to Harris, those undertaking the program are expected to return to the US well-equipped with adequate knowledge of regulating financial services, including cryptocurrency. Harris, who is in charge of the New York regulator, was earlier working at the White House under Obama’s presidency. According to Partnership for New York City President and CEO Kathy Wylde, the Transatlantic Regulatory Exchange is a program that underscores the importance of New York and London as twin engines of the global finance system. This initiative reinforces DFS’s role as a preeminent global regulator, driving responsible innovation and economic opportunity in the city and state while protecting the global financial system. The United Kingdom and the United States pursue regulatory initiatives The NYDFS is responsible for crypto regulations in New York, where most crypto firms have been taking refuge due to its welcoming business and regulatory environment. The financial regulator oversaw the execution of the BitLicensing scheme in 2015 when it approved projects such as Ripple Labs’ RLUSD stablecoin in December. Although the end game is unclear, the Bank of England has had its challenges handling cryptocurrency regulations. The central bank’s regulatory arm, the Prudential Regulation Authority, is expected to monitor firms’ cryptocurrency exposure and propose UK digital assets rules.

Meanwhile, companies like Semler Scientific are increasing their Bitcoin holdings, with Semler now holding 2,321 BTC worth $192 million. MicroStrategy also surpassed 450,000 BTC after its recent purchase. Despite recent price volatility tied to macroeconomic factors, Bitcoin's supply on exchanges has hit a seven-year low, which signals strong institutional demand and potential for future price growth. Canadian Investors Gain Access to BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is introducing a new Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) on Cboe Canada to provide Canadian investors with access to its flagship US spot Bitcoin fund, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). This Canadian ETF, which is named iShares Bitcoin ETF, will allocate nearly all its assets to IBIT and trade under the same ticker. Additionally, shares denominated in US dollars will carry the ticker IBIT.U . Helen Hayes, BlackRock’s head of iShares Canada, shared that the fund offers Canadian investors an efficient way to gain Bitcoin exposure while eliminating the complexities of directly holding the cryptocurrency. (Source: Cboe Canada ) This launch adds to the growing list of Bitcoin ETFs available in Canada , with over a dozen already trading on local exchanges. BlackRock’s US IBIT ETF was launched in January of 2024, and has become a very dominant player in the global Bitcoin ETF market after attracting over $37 billion in net inflows . Collectively, US Bitcoin ETFs recorded $35 billion in net inflows last year, despite the large outflows from older products like the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which faced stiff competition because of its higher management fees. The growth of Bitcoin ETFs also reflects the shift in investor sentiment where Bitcoin is increasingly seen as a critical asset for hedging against inflation and geopolitical risks. In November, US Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $100 billion in net assets for the first time, and analysts project another $48 billion in net inflows for 2025. JPMorgan’s December report also shed some light on Bitcoin’s growing importance in diversified portfolios, driven by record capital inflows into crypto markets. Asset manager Sygnum Bank suggested that rising institutional demand for Bitcoin ETFs could trigger serious demand shocks which could potentially propel Bitcoin’s price to new highs in 2025. Semler Scientific Boosts Bitcoin Holdings Semler Scientific, a healthcare technology company, bought an additional 237 Bitcoin for approximately $23 million, paying just over $98,000 per coin. This acquisition was funded by stock sales and operating cash flow, and brings the company’s total Bitcoin holdings to 2,321 BTC, which is valued at close to $192 million. (Source: Semler Scientific ) Over $120 million in stock has been issued by the company to finance its Bitcoin acquisitions and other activities. This increased its Bitcoin yield, which is the ratio of BTC holdings to outstanding shares, from 72.6% to 99.3%. This metric was originally popularized by MicroStrategy, and it serves as a key performance indicator for companies integrating Bitcoin into their corporate strategy. Semler’s leadership believes that investing in Bitcoin has been pivotal in transforming the company from a struggling “zombie” entity that barely survived on minimal earnings, into a more dynamic operation. Semler joins other companies like Hoth Therapeutics , Genius Group , and Rumble in following the Bitcoin-buying playbook that was established by MicroStrategy. Bitcoin holdings (Source: Bitcoin Treasuries ) Corporate Bitcoin treasuries now hold more than $54 billion collectively, and Semler ranks 13th in size. MicroStrategy leads the pack with a Bitcoin treasury exceeding $40 billion. This trend certainly reflects growing institutional interest in Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty. Some well known investors like Paul Tudor Jones echoed this sentiment, while asset manager VanEck pointed out that even US state governments are adding Bitcoin to their portfolios to mitigate fiscal risks. MicroStrategy Surpasses 450,000 Bitcoin Milestone MicroStrategy also reached a new milestone in its Bitcoin holdings by surpassing 450,000 BTC after a $243 million investment during the recent market dip. The company’s total Bitcoin acquisition now stands at $28.2 billion, with an average purchase price of $62,691 per Bitcoin. Founder and chairman Michael Saylor revealed the latest purchase , which was made at an average price of $95,972. Hedge funds and some other institutional players, including Semler Scientific, also took advantage of the price drop. Bitcoin’s recent volatility was influenced by macroeconomic factors. The cryptocurrency fell below $92,000 after the release of strong US labor market data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) on Jan. 9. Analysts attribute the decline to concerns over the Federal Reserve’s monetary tightening in 2025, which delayed expectations of rate cuts until late July. This made Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies much less attractive to some investors who are reverting to being reactive to broader economic trends. Bitcoin’s price reached an all-time high of over $100,000 in December of 2024 after Donald Trump’s presidential election victory, but now faces challenges tied to the anticipated slower pace of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite this, continued institutional buying proves that there is still some confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term potential, even as macroeconomic uncertainties weigh on short-term price movements. Bitcoin’s price action over the past month (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Bitcoin Exchange Reserves Hit 7-Year Low Bitcoin reserves on crypto exchanges have fallen to a near seven-year low after reaching 2.35 million BTC on Jan. 13, according to CryptoQuant data . This level was last seen in June of 2018, when Bitcoin traded just above $7,000. Bitcoin exchange reserves (Source: CryproQuant ) The decline in exchange reserves is largely attributed to institutional buying, with hedge funds and spot Bitcoin ETFs acquiring large amounts of BTC during the recent dip. André Dragosch , head of research at Bitwise, pointed out the increased market exposure to Bitcoin by hedge funds. The diminishing Bitcoin supply on exchanges fueled speculation about a potential supply shock, which is a phenomenon where strong demand meets reduced availability that could lead to upward price pressure. In December, spot Bitcoin ETFs purchased nearly three times the number of coins mined, which tightened the supply as Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $108,300 on Dec. 17. Analysts suggest this dynamic may contribute to Bitcoin’s recovery to and beyond the $100,000 psychological mark, though low trading volumes are still a barrier to any major rally. Ryan Lee , chief analyst at Bitget Research, noticed reduced selling pressure and potential consolidation as Bitcoin stabilizes around its current levels. However, he stated that trading volume on daily timeframes is still subdued, which indicates a lack of decisive momentum to break key resistance levels. The broader crypto market is also experiencing low trading activity, with volumes across major assets falling to levels last seen before the US elections in November 2024. This “trading paralysis” reflects fear and uncertainty but may also increase the probability of market rebounds, according to market intelligence platform Santiment . Despite the current challenges, analysts remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory. Predictions for late 2025 suggest a potential cycle top above $150,000, driven by an anticipated $20 trillion increase in the global money supply, which could direct $2 trillion into Bitcoin investments.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-01-14 05:39:19

The cornerstone investor for the round’s final close was Fulgur Ventures, a venture capital firm with a focus on Bitcoin technologies, alongside new and existing strategic and financial backers, according to an official announcement . Notably, Sygnum’s team members also participated, maintaining majority ownership with the co-founders and board. Sygnum Raised Over $40M in January 2023 The milestone comes shortly after Sygnum raised over $40 million in January 2024, led by Milan-based asset manager Azimut Holding, at a $900 million valuation. Earlier, in its Series B funding round in January 2022, Sygnum raised $90 million with backing from notable Asia-based investors like Sun Hung Kai & Co., Animoca Brands, and SBI Holdings. “Sygnum’s market-tested infrastructure, digital asset-native team and global ecosystem makes them the ideal partner to co-develop innovative Bitcoin-related financial products and technologies – as well as for future collaborations with other Fulgur portfolio companies,” Oleg Mikhalsky, a partner at Fulgur Ventures, said. Sygnum plans to utilize the new funds to enhance its Bitcoin technology offerings, expand its institutional infrastructure, and strengthen compliance operations.

With licenses in Switzerland, Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein, the firm is strategically positioning itself for growth, particularly in MiCA-compliant EU markets. “Sygnum reaching Unicorn status is a strong validation by the market of our business model, strategy and team,” co-founder and CEO Mathias Imbach said. Sygnum reported operational profitability in 2024, driven by significant growth in its trading products, including crypto spot, derivatives, FX, and traditional securities. The company’s annual trade volume surged over 1,000% year-over-year, and it now manages more than $5 billion in assets for 2,000 clients across 70 countries. In recent years, Sygnum has launched several innovative services, including Sygnum Connect, a 24/7 multi-asset settlement network, and Sygnum Protect, which enables institutional clients to trade on major crypto exchanges securely. Partnerships with Fidelity International, Matter Labs, and Hamilton Lane have further advanced its tokenization initiatives, while collaborations with Chainlink have brought fund NAV data on-chain. Sygnum Predicts Bitcoin to Soar in 2025 Bitcoin could experience significant price increases in 2025, driven by a surge in institutional investment, according to a report from Sygnum Bank. The bank said that traditional institutional investors, such as pension and sovereign wealth funds, are beginning to allocate capital to crypto assets, which could trigger substantial demand. The institutional demand is met with a minimal supply of Bitcoin , especially considering a significant portion is held by long-term investors and rarely traded. This scarcity amplifies the impact of any investment, potentially leading to substantial price appreciation as demand increases. Sygnum’s Head of Research, Katalin Tischhauser, previously projected that spot Ethereum ETFs would attract $5 to $10 billion in their first year. While Ethereum ETFs have garnered $2.5 billion in net inflows over six months, Bitcoin ETFs have significantly outperformed, drawing $18.9 billion during the same period.

It’s Been Talked About Since 2017 But What Is The Likelyhood In 2025?,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-to-1-its-been-talked-about-since-2017-but-what-is-the-likelyhood-in-2025/,"Is Dogecoin (DOGE) merely another pipe dream in the meme coin market, or will it at last reach the much awaited $1 mark? Dogecoin is still a promising asset among crypto aficionados even as recent whale action fuels hope despite short-term volatility. On the other hand, Remittix (RTX) , a rising star, is revolutionizing the cross-border payment sector with innovative ideas and a cheap presale pricing in the meantime. Which one of these top crypto coins contain the secret to huge rallies in 2025? Read on to find out the key elements and forecasts influencing the long-term direction of RTX and DOGE. Dogecoin Rollercoaster: Can the Memecoin Regain Momentum? With more than a 16% dip in the past week, the Dogecoin price has lately seen bearish times. Bearish momentum pulled the meme coin down to the $0.32 support zone following the surge to the $0.40 resistance level. Reflecting a bearish period for one of the top meme coins in the market, the Dogecoin price has dropped almost 19% over the previous month. Still, community sentiment is quite positive since Dogecoin aficionados are anticipating a significant bullish comeback. Fascinatingly, Dogecoin whales bought 140 million DOGE worth $55 million in one day, indicating ongoing belief in the long-term viability of the memecoin. Looking at the Dogecoin price chart exposes a month-long consolidation between $0.42 and $0.26, therefore stressing the volatility of the meme coin. With a 9.06% price volatility, data from CoinCodex indicates Dogecoin saw green days on 47% of the past 30 days. TradingView data adds another level of complication when technical indicators show conflicting signals. The MAs and MACD imply increasing buy momentum while the CCI and Momentum Oscillator flash sell signals on the Dogecoin price chart. Keeping Dogecoin firmly among the top crypto coins to monitor, this discrepancy suggests a probable future surge. Looking ahead, experts still see great promise for Dogecoin. A 2025 Dogecoin price prediction shows a wide range of possibilities by implying the memecoin might trade within a range of $0.27 to $1.33. Strong community support and active whale activity as the meme coin consolidates indicate likely growth prospects. Remittix: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments for Digital Age Remittix leads in transforming cross-border payments as the globe progresses in the digital age. Moreover, Remittix addresses one of the most urgent issues in global finance by smoothly linking crypto and fiat for effective international transactions, therefore combining the potential of cryptocurrencies with conventional banking institutions.

Priced at only $0.0199 during its presale and expected to see gains in excess of 2,000% the RTX utility token presents early investors with a great chance for exponential returns! Dogecoin (DOGE) vs. Remittix (RTX): The Smart Bet for 2025 Although the road to the $1 mark is still a rollercoaster ride for Dogecoin (DOGE) driven by bullish community sentiment and whale activity, the volatility and confusing signals make the memecoin’s near-term future uncertain. Conversely, Remittix (RTX) shows up as a lighthouse of consistency and creativity in the cryptocurrency field. Remittix is set aside as a really transforming platform by its innovative approach to cross-border payments, safe blockchain architecture, and unsurpassed utility for both individuals and companies. Valued at just $0.0199 during its presale, the RTX token offers investors with an exponential growth potential. Meanwhile, the presale is fast selling out as a result of a huge demand for the limited token supply.

The space has divided into two where one believes this is ending the bull market while for others it is just another opportunity. Market sentiment feels more fearful than opportunism. A Fearful Drop or a Golden Chance? The mention of Bitcoin slipping below $90K in various online discussions caused a stir. While fear usually signals market uncertainty, history shows it can also signal a rebound. The crypto greed and fear index sits at 46, which leans toward fear. But many investors are now talking about strategies to turn this into profit. Keywords like “buy,” “sell,” and “money” used on various social media posts, show how focused people are on making the right moves. Source : Sentiment Social media plays a huge role in understanding market sentiment. Terms like “btc” and “90K” have been trending, shaping how people feel about the market. It’s like a domino effect. Fear spreads fast, but so does optimism when buyers see potential in the chaos. Is Politics Driving Crypto Sentiment? The buzz isn’t just about Bitcoin. Conversations about Donald Trump’s potential return to power have stirred speculation about a “Trump pump.” Could his presidency impact crypto prices? Some think his policies might bring a surge, while others stay cautious. Either way, politics and crypto seem more connected than ever. The top trending topics in crypto are heavily revolving around Bitcoin's temporary drop to under $90K and Trump's inauguration next week. Regarding the former, the fact that '$90K' was being spammed across social media was a great fear signal that would foreshadow a bounce. pic.twitter.com/gL2GY1Lm6S — Santiment (@santimentfeed) January 14, 2025 Beyond Bitcoin, there’s chatter about bull and bear markets, not just in crypto but in stocks too. Words like “week” and “cap” show how much attention people are giving to short-term trends. Everyone’s trying to predict the next move, balancing between risk and reward. What to Expect With Bitcoin recovering from its brief dip, the market remains unpredictable. Fear might be lingering, but history favors the bold. Will Trump’s presidency play a role? Could social media drive another spike? One thing’s clear—crypto is as exciting as ever, with opportunities hiding in the chaos.

This is part of a larger $100 million crackdown aimed at cleaning up Wall Street’s act. Robinhood’s sins? A 2021 data breach that exposed millions of user emails and names, sloppy record-keeping for its fractional share trades, and a lack of attention to regulations that govern everything from cybersecurity to customer communications. The SEC didn’t hold back in detailing Robinhood’s failures. Between 2019 and 2023, the company fell short on several federal compliance requirements. For instance, the broker violated Regulation SHO, which exists to curb abusive short-selling practices. Add that to the list of issues, including their inability to secure customer data and maintain records legally required for their trading operations. A closer look at Robinhood’s “crimes” Robinhood’s 2021 data breach was a big one. Hackers exploited weaknesses in its systems, gaining access to names and email addresses of millions of users. The breach was a major hit to the company’s reputation, but that wasn’t the only issue regulators uncovered. Between April 2019 and July 2022, Robinhood failed to implement solid identity theft protection policies, leaving customers vulnerable to fraud. From June to November 2021, Robinhood ignored a known vulnerability in its cybersecurity systems. That negligence allowed unauthorized access to sensitive customer information. The SEC also slammed the company for failing to investigate suspicious transactions between January 2020 and March 2022. These lapses led to delays in filing legally required Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs), a critical part of financial compliance. The SEC order didn’t stop there. Robinhood was called out for failing to maintain some of its customer communications between 2020 and 2021. This included emails and other correspondence that federal law mandates must be preserved. According to the SEC’s acting director of enforcement, Sanjay Wadhwa, these failures went beyond compliance. “When firms fall short of those obligations, the consequences go far beyond deficient document productions,” Wadhwa said. Robinhood didn’t deny the allegations. Instead, the company issued a statement calling the violations “historical.” Lucas Moskowitz, the firm’s general counsel, said, “We are well-positioned to continue leading the industry in developing the innovative products and services our customers want and need.” Robinhood also made it clear they’re eager to move forward under a new SEC administration, just like the rest of us. Wall Street firms face steep penalties Robinhood wasn’t the only target in this regulatory sweep. The SEC also fined 12 other firms for record-keeping violations, collectively raking in $63 million in penalties. The violations? Using unofficial communication channels like messaging apps that sidestepped record-keeping requirements. Blackstone topped the list of offenders, agreeing to pay $12 million in fines. KKR followed with $11 million, while Charles Schwab shelled out $10 million. Other firms, including Apollo Capital Management, TPG Capital Advisors, and divisions of the Carlyle Group, were hit with $8.5 million penalties each. Santander US Capital Markets paid $4 million, and PJT Partners got away with the smallest fine: $600,000. In Blackstone’s case, senior managing directors had been using unapproved platforms since at least December 2019. These platforms allowed them to share sensitive information about client trades and investment strategies outside of legal channels. The SEC’s investigation revealed that this kind of communication violated federal securities laws requiring firms to maintain records of their activities. The agency’s crackdown is part of a larger effort to enforce strict compliance across the financial industry. Over the past few years, banks alone have paid billions in fines for similar violations, and this latest wave of penalties shows the SEC isn’t letting up anytime soon. Sanjay Wadhwa echoed this sentiment, emphasizing the importance of compliance for maintaining market integrity. “It is essential to the Commission’s broader efforts to protect investors and promote the integrity and fairness of our markets that broker-dealers satisfy their legal obligations,” Wadhwa said. But despite the fine, Robinhood’s finances are in decent shape. The company is set to post its fifth consecutive quarter of profitability. In the third quarter of this year, it reported a net income of $150 million, proving that the penalty likely won’t hurt its bottom line too much. Still, the regulatory scrutiny doesn’t look good for a company that’s already had its fair share of public controversies. Robinhood became a household name during the 2021 GameStop trading frenzy, where it faced backlash for restricting trades during the stock’s meteoric rise. Since then, the company has been trying to rehabilitate its image, but this latest fine is another reminder that it still has a long way to go.

Bitcoin (BTC) may be king, but altcoins are gaining traction for outsized returns. From the established Ethereum (ETH) to the fast-growing BigBossInu, these assets are positioned for remarkable gains. These top picks are expected to soar before the market fully rallies: BigBossInu’s Presale Soars: A Lucrative Opportunity for Investors BigBossInu is taking the crypto space by storm, with its presale generating massive interest from early adopters. Seen as a high-reward venture, those who get in early can seize this lucrative opportunity. With a surge in investor enthusiasm, BigBossInu is a top cryptocurrency to monitor. Backed by bold features and a future-focused roadmap, BigBossInu is primed for explosive growth. >>>>>> Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading around $93,480. Analysts suggest that BTC is showing signs of stability after dropping from the $105,000 support level. The market is anticipating a potential breakout in the coming yesr, with some analysts predicting a move toward 110,000 if momentum continues to build. Ethereum (ETH) has recently been recovering from previous lows, now trading around $3,385. A bullish setup suggests that if ETH can push past key resistance at $3,500, it could move higher above $4,000. However, if selling pressure builds, a drop below $3,000 could occur before any further upward moves. Sei (SEI) has been one of the top performers among altcoins, surging by over 43% in the last 30 days. Despite the recent rally, SEI might experience a short-term pullback due to overbought conditions, with analysts warning that the price could dip to $0.31 before possibly resuming its upward trajectory. >>> Polkadot (DOT) is seeing renewed activity as well, with recent developments driving interest. DOT holders recently received a token airdrop, which has contributed to increased network engagement. Currently trading above $6, analysts are watching for a potential recovery if broader market conditions improve. Conclusion As the crypto market gears up for a rally, altcoins like BigBossInu, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Sei, and Polkadot offer strong potential for significant returns. BigBossInu’s presale, Ethereum’s recovery, and Polkadot’s network activity highlight these assets for growth. Investors aiming to capitalize on market momentum could see gains before 2024, but thorough research and risk assessment are essential in this volatile space.

The rise of meme coins proves that investors can embrace humor while cashing in on serious returns. With innovations like play-to-earn (P2E) gaming, blockchain memes, and even AI-crafted tokens, the meme coin revolution is in full swing. These aren’t your run-of-the-mill assets; they’re a cultural phenomenon turning crypto investing into a joyful experience. One of the brightest stars of this movement is BTFD Coin, currently smashing records with over $5.1 million raised in its presale and 64 billion coins sold. Beyond the staggering numbers, this meme coin introduces a four-level P2E game that blends entertainment and earning potential seamlessly. Joining BTFD Coin at the forefront of innovation are Book of Meme (BOME), decentralizing meme culture, and Turbo Token, an AI-designed experiment that’s captivating the crypto community. Together, they represent the top new meme coins to join this year, offering unique opportunities to laugh, play, and profit. BTFD Coin: Where Bulls Play and Earn BTFD Coin isn’t just a token; it’s an experience. Its P2E game takes players through four levels of excitement, each brimming with opportunities to earn in-game rewards that are convertible to BTFD tokens. Picture this: you’re navigating a fun, challenge-filled environment while building your token stash—all without leaving the game. Whether you’re a seasoned gamer or someone who dabbles for fun, the BTFD ecosystem ensures there’s something for everyone. But let’s crunch some numbers, shall we? Imagine investing $4,000 at today’s presale price of $0.000142. You’d snag over 28 million BTFD tokens. If the price jumps to $0.0006 (a realistic prediction based on its roadmap and community growth), your investment could soar to an impressive $16,800. Now, that’s a game where everyone wins! The fun doesn’t stop there. Aside from gaming, BTFD Coin boasts staking rewards with a jaw-dropping 90% APY , a roadmap packed with community-driven milestones, and the dynamic Bulls Squad characters that make investing more personal and engaging. With so much happening, there’s no better time to join the herd. Book of Meme (BOME): Decentralized Memes for the Digital Age What if memes could live forever? Book of Meme (BOME) answers that question with its bold mission to preserve meme culture on the blockchain. Powered by Solana, Arweave, and IPFS, this project immortalizes viral moments in a digital compendium while also embracing degen trading and gambling. In short, it’s a cultural time capsule with a wild twist. Currently priced at $0.005417, BOME has a live market cap of over $373 million, making it a significant player in the meme coin universe. While the price dipped nearly 5% in the last 24 hours, seasoned investors know that fluctuations are often opportunities in disguise. Turbo Token: The AI-Driven Meme Coin Revolution Meet Turbo Token, the world’s first meme coin designed by AI.

Most major crypto tokens were trading down significantly Monday after an exuberant rally around the time of the new Congress convening in Washington. By Monday afternoon in Chicago, Bitcoin had fallen some 10% for the week’s trading. Meanwhile, Ethereum had fallen by 18% from its average crypto exchange market price seven days earlier. BNB was also trading down some 8.5%, and Solana had fallen by 20% under its intraday high price of $2.21 on Jan. 6 as delegates to the new Congress took their seats for the current session. However, the entire crypto market bounced off on Monday morning. Just wanted to express appreciation for President @realDonaldTrump and so many people, both inside & outside of government, supporting @DOGE . I am confident that the American people will be happy with the outcome. — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 13, 2025 What probably didn’t hurt Dogecoin’s price on Monday was another implicit shout-out from Elon Musk. After naming his advisory office to the new president, the DOGE for Department of Government Efficiency, Musk can rally for cheaper government and Dogecoin in one post. Now that’s efficient. 1. DOGE Sentiment Data Marks Dip Over? According to an analysis by blockchain insights firm Santiment, Dogecoin’s sentiment reading Monday favors the world’s first popular meme coin, which has its own blockchain—a fork from Bitcoin on Dec. 6, 2013. “Since its top exactly one month ago, Dogecoin has shed -28% of its market cap,” wrote Santiment last week in a Thursday note to the blockchain market analytics engine’s users. “Crowd sentiment has been near its lowest point over the past year,” Santiment added. “(This) means there is actually some nice upside to be a daring contrarian toward DOGE (in particular) if crypto markets begin to trend upward again.” Earlier in the month, TradingLounge’s Peter Mathers spotted an Elliot Wave formation that could see Dogecoin rally to above $0.48— and potentially as far as $0.61, Mathers wrote on Jan. 6. 2. Bullish Exchange Signals Data from derivatives markets is also hinting at another rally for Dogecoin soon. To start the month, over 81% of all open interest in Dogecoin futures on Binance was long for DOGE. 3. Crypto Whale Sized Bites Whales bought over 470 million #Dogecoin $DOGE in the last 48 hours! pic.twitter.com/d7oPvnfB6o — Ali (@ali_charts) January 10, 2025 Crypto whale activity in the DOGE pool in January is another sign that Dogecoin is about to make another big splash in crypto markets. In a 48-hour period on Jan 9 and 10, blockchain whales bought 470 million Dogecoin in 48 hours, according to a recent update from sharp whale watcher Ali Martinez. It’s not the first time whales made big moves in Dogecoin this January. Earlier in the month, they bought a billion DOGE tokens in under 24 hours. That follows up on whales buying the Dogecoin dip in late December as well, so support from large sum traders is strong with this one.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is over 60, indicating strong buying interest. The high stochastic value suggests that momentum is on the rise. If the price moves past the resistance level at $0.4553, it could continue its upward trend. Over the past six months, Dogecoin has increased by nearly 200%, hinting at significant growth potential. With the anticipated altcoin season and a bullish crypto market, there's optimism that DOGE may reach higher levels. However, keeping an eye on the support level at $0.2695 is important in case of any market fluctuations.

SOL is central to the ecosystem, facilitating transactions, running custom programs, and rewarding network participants. Solana avoids sharding and second-layer solutions, aiming for high capacity without added complexity. This makes SOL attractive to developers and investors, especially those interested in hosting high-activity products and services. In the current market cycle, SOL's focus on scalability and speed may enhance its appeal as a promising cryptocurrency. Conclusion Despite limited short-term potential for SOL and others, DOGEN stands out for those seeking luxury and success.

King Pepe on Solana (PEPESOL), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 13,000% in price in the coming days. This is because PEPESOL is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, King Pepe on Solana can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and King Pepe on Solana could become the next viral memecoin. King Pepe on Solana launched with over $9,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy King Pepe on Solana on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for King Pepe on Solana by entering its contract address – xArnFwydB12BkKVXKy436TwCrSSfFcC7kXx7p2fGEWh – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like PEPESOL. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-14 07:37:00

As a result, SOL and XRP tokens have picked up upside momentum, showing signs of an upcoming rally. Moreover, the development comes amid speculation that Donald Trump’s administration will greenlight new crypto ETFs already submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). JPMorgan’s Report on SOL ETF and XRP ETF JPMorgan has forecasted that Solana ETF and XRP ETF could collectively bring an inflow of approximately $15 billion within a year. This is based on the portion of market cap that Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have put on paper. Notably, Bitcoin ETFs were approximately $108 billion in assets in the first year, representing around 6% of its total market cap. Similarly, Ether ETFs reached around $12 billion in assets, reflecting a portion of 3% after six months of launch. JPMorgan has applied the same adoption rate to Solana ETFs and XRP ETFs to reach the final number of $3 billion to $8 billion for each. Matthew Sigel on X has reiterated the same sentiment with a few community members. He came forward to share his opinion by calling ETFs a game changer for SOL and XRP liquidity. Interestingly, JPMorgan has forecasted a brighter future for SOL and XRP ETFs days after its CEO Jamie Dimon expressed skepticism on Bitcoin despite massive demand from its clients. Performance of Bitcoin and Ether ETFs Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Spot Ether ETFs have performed well since their respective launches, which forms a timeline of 12 months for BTC and around 6 months for Ether. Historical cumulative inflows for Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Spot Ether ETFs stand at $35.9 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, according to data by Farside Investors. BlackRock leads the inflows chart for both BTC and ETH. The ETF issuer has recorded an inward flow of $37.6 billion in Spot Bitcoin ETF and $3.6 billion in Spot Ether ETF. Spot Bitcoin ETFs and Spot Ether ETFs, on January 13, recorded an outflow of $284.1 million and $39.4 million, applicable in the same order. That was the third consecutive day that both major US crypto ETFs registered outflows. Nevertheless, the confidence in crypto ETFs is evident with the Trump Administration likely to get into action from the first day. SOL and XRP Price Performance Solana and Ripple tokens are showing upticks now that JPMorgan has forecasted a bullish future for their respective ETFs. SOL price is up by 2% in the last 24 hours, exchanging hands at around $185.81. There is a massive surge of 156.75% in its 24-hour trading volume with a reasonable decline of 4.65% in its open interest, as per Coinglass. XRP price is up by more than 2% during the same time window, trading at an approximate value of $2.53. Its 24-hour trading volume has increased by 71.65% and open interest is up by 0.30%.

Public construction firm Ming Shing Group has joined the list of non-tech companies diversifying into cryptocurrency, investing $47 million in Bitcoin ( BTC ) to enhance liquidity and boost asset value. In a Jan. 13 press release , the Hong Kong -based company, mainly engaged in wet trades works like plastering and tile laying, announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lead Benefit, purchased 500 Bitcoins at an average price of $94,375 per BTC. Ming Shing said the funds came from idle reserves and viewed the Bitcoin purchase as a “short-term investment to capture the potential appreciation of Bitcoin and increase its assets.” “The company considers that Bitcoin market is highly liquid and the Bitcoins can be easily disposed to fund the company’s wet trade works business, if required.” Ming Shing You might also like: China’s central bank spotlights Hong Kong’s crypto licensing system in new report Lead Benefit was incorporated in December 2024, with Ming Shing as its ultimate shareholder.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong is also exploring ways to embrace cryptocurrency. Legislator Wu Jiexhuang recently suggested that the region consider adding Bitcoin to its national reserves to strengthen financial security. As crypto.news reported earlier , Wu proposed that regulators first study the effects of U.S.-issued Bitcoin exchange-traded funds on the market before making any decisions about including BTC in reserves.

Cardano's ADA: The Eco-Friendly Crypto Shaping the Future Cardano, with its native coin ADA, is making waves in the crypto world. Built for flexibility and sustainability, it lets developers create decentralized apps and games using smart contracts. What sets it apart is its eco-friendly approach; it uses the energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism instead of the energy-hungry proof-of-work model. This means users can store value, make payments, and stake ADA without leaving a hefty carbon footprint. Cardano splits its blockchain into two layers: one for transactions and one for smart contracts. This innovative design could enable up to a million transactions per second, making it incredibly fast and efficient. Since introducing native tokens in March 2021, Cardano offers secure, low-fee smart contract interactions, setting new standards in blockchain efficiency.

According to a Wired Italia report , this marks the first time in Italy, a credit institution concluded a direct crypto transaction. Some employees of the largest Italian bank first flagged the crypto purchase and sale on the imageboard website 4Chan . “As of today (Monday), Intesa Sanpaolo owns 11 Bitcoins. Thank you all for the teamwork”, said Niccolò Bardoscia, head of digital assets trading & investments at Intesa Sanpaolo in a mail. However, Bardoscia did not reveal further information on Intesa Sanpaolo’s motivations for choosing BTC or its future crypto strategies. It is unclear whether the move signals the bank’s intent to expand its crypto services. Last November, Intesa Sanpaolo expanded the remit of its digital assets desk to cover spot trading for crypto. The biggest lender in Italy had previously only traded crypto options, futures, and exchange-traded funds. However, the spot trading isn’t yet up and running. Milan-based Intesa Sanpaolo has worked with Ripple Custody (formerly Metaco), to facilitate tokenised asset custody. Intesa’s move mirrors a growing trend among traditional financial institutions exploring cryptos. Italy’s Crypto Tax Revisions The bank’s Bitcoin investment came when the country overhauled its crypto taxation laws , particularly focusing on Bitcoin (BTC) capital gains. In December 2024, Italy’s Senate finalised the tax rates for crypto capital gains, confirming a 26% tax for 2025. Further, the parliament approved a government proposal to increase the withholding tax on Bitcoin profits to 33% in 2026. In July 2024, Intesa became the sole institutional investor in Italian development bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti’s digital bond issuance . The move marked a significant step in digital asset adoption in Italy. Besides, the implementation of the European MiCA Regulation marks a significant shift in the regulatory landscape for crypto service providers across the EU. The European Union set a Dec. 30 deadline for its member states to implement MiCA, although not all countries have managed to. In Italy, the MiCA Decree , the Legislative Decree of September 5, 2024, assigns critical responsibilities to the Commissione Nazionale per le Società e la Borsa (Consob) and the Bank of Italy. It designs them as the primary national authorities for overseeing compliance with MiCA’s provisions.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit called the SEC’s move “arbitrary and capricious,” signaling that the regulator might have bitten off more than it can chew with its aggressive stance against the crypto industry. Paul Grewal, Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer, shared the news, saying, “We just won our petition for a writ of mandamus at the Third Circuit.” We just won our petition for a writ of mandamus at the Third Circuit. Rebuking @SECGov for its order denying our rulemaking petition, the Court held that the ""SEC’s order was conclusory and insufficiently reasoned, and thus arbitrary and capricious, we grant Coinbase’s petition… — paulgrewal.eth (@iampaulgrewal) January 13, 2025 He highlighted the court’s rebuke of the SEC’s “insufficiently reasoned” denial of Coinbase’s petition, adding that Judge Stephanos Bibas had flagged looming constitutional concerns over the SEC’s enforcement tactics. According to Paul, the decision sends a strong message: regulators can’t simply enforce laws without providing clear rules upfront. Judges call out the SEC The court’s ruling stopped short of forcing the SEC to draft specific rules for cryptocurrency but made it clear that the agency owes an explanation. Coinbase’s original petition sought clarity on a crucial question: when do digital assets qualify as securities? Without clear guidance, crypto companies have been left in a legal gray zone, navigating unpredictable enforcement actions rather than established rules. Judge Bibas, known for his blunt rulings, criticized the agency’s reliance on enforcement without prior guidance, pointing out that new technologies like crypto come with unique risks that require proactive regulation—not just retroactive penalties. This isn’t the first time the SEC has been called out for its handling of the crypto industry, but the Coinbase case could mark a turning point. By forcing the SEC to explain its reasoning, the court has essentially demanded more transparency from the agency, which has long maintained that most cryptocurrencies, apart from Bitcoin, are securities and therefore fall under its jurisdiction. Coinbase fights on multiple fronts While Coinbase celebrates this partial victory, the company is still deep in the trenches of another legal battle with the SEC. Last year, Judge Katherine Failla denied Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the SEC’s lawsuit against it, setting the stage for a high-stakes court fight over whether crypto tokens listed on Coinbase’s platform qualify as securities. Failla’s ruling leaned heavily on the Howey Test, a decades-old legal standard used to determine whether an asset is a security. She rejected Coinbase’s argument that crypto should be considered a “major question” of economic significance, which would limit the SEC’s authority. Instead, she sided with the agency’s claim that many of the cryptocurrencies offered on Coinbase’s platform, such as Solana, are investment contracts. However, Failla’s ruling wasn’t the end of the road. She granted Coinbase permission to file an interlocutory appeal, allowing the company to challenge her decision before a final verdict. This appeal is important because it could fast-track a definitive ruling on whether crypto tokens are securities, potentially reshaping how the entire industry operates. “We appreciate the Court’s careful consideration,” Paul said after the decision. “On to the Second Circuit we go.” The appeal could add to the complexity. While some judges, like Failla, appear to back the SEC’s arguments, others have pushed back. For instance, the judge overseeing the Ripple case ruled that not all transactions involving XRP qualify as securities. The SEC’s enforcement-first strategy has been a source of frustration for the crypto industry, which has repeatedly called for clear guidelines. Under Chair Gary Gensler, the agency has ramped up its crackdown on crypto companies, bringing high-profile lawsuits against Ripple, Coinbase, and other major players. Gensler has argued that most crypto tokens are securities and that companies are violating the law by failing to register them with the SEC.

According to Gryphon Digital’s press release , the Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining firm plans to use the recently acquired asset to further expand on its AI and high-performance computing data center infrastructure. Gryphon’s deal with Captus is expected to close before or some time in April 2025. Based on the agreement, Gryphon Digital will pay Captus $27 million CAD or equal to $18.7 million, which already includes $3 million CAD ($2 million) worth of four-year-long restricted shares given to the incoming Captus management team. If the deal does not close, then the Captus team will have to return the restricted shares. The 850 acre industrial site has the potential to scale up to 4 gigawatts in capacity and grants Gryphon access to dual natural gas supply, grid connection, water resources, as well as rapid fiber connection providers. Analysts conclude Gryphon could stand to gain $1.5 million in annual revenue per megawatt, though VanEck’s research believes Bitcoin mining revenue related to AI and HPC could reach up to $9.11 million per MW. At full capacity, the asset has the potential to generate over $5 billion of annual revenue for Gryphon. You might also like: Bitcoin miners tap billions in funding to counter energy challenges Chief Executive Officer of Gryphon Digital, Steve Gutterman, stated that the acquisition of Captus Energy’s asset marks a transformative moment for Gryphon as it hopes to expand its reach into the AI and HPC infrastructure market. “The combination of dual natural gas supply, on-site carbon sequestration and abundant water access makes it one of the few locations in North America with all the critical elements needed for large-scale AI computing,” said Gutterman. He added part of the Captus Energy team, led by Chief Executive Officer of Captus Generation Harry Andersen, will be joining the Gryphon under the signed agreement. “We believe that the Captus acquisition, when combined with our recent British Columbia acquisition and the additions to our team, fundamentally transform Gryphon’s trajectory and potential scale,” he said. In December, Gryphon also acquired a natural gas site in British Columbia with an initial 100 MW generation capacity and scalability of up to 1 GW. The projected power cost related to the site could sit below $0.03 per kWh.

An SEC order made public on Jan. 13 claims that Robinhood Securities LLC and Robinhood Financial LLC committed over 10 violations of securities law provisions ranging from failures in reporting suspicious activity to safeguarding customer information, among others, “between at least 2018 and April 2024.” According to the commission, “both firms admitted certain findings in the order and agreed to be censured,” with Robinhood Securities consenting to pay a $33.5 million penalty and Robinhood Financial agreeing to pay a $11.5 million penalty, bringing the total settlement to $45 million. Robinhood’s violations From January 2020 through March 2022, the company failed to promptly investigate and report suspicious activity, undermining its obligations under anti-money laundering laws. Additionally, between April 2019 and July 2022, Robinhood failed to implement adequate identity theft protection policies, exposing customers to heightened risks of fraud, the order stated. Cybersecurity vulnerabilities also plagued the platform. Notably, between June and November 2021, Robinhood failed to address known risks related to remote system access, resulting in a third party gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data from millions of users. Robinhood also failed to maintain and preserve off-channel communications and some customer communications between 2020 and 2021, violating federal securities laws. Additionally, from May 2019 through December 2023, Robinhood failed to comply with Regulation SHO, which governs short-selling practices, in its fractional share trading and stock lending programs. You might also like: Robinhood’s Dan Gallagher declines potential SEC leadership role The SEC order further noted that both entities violated multiple rules under federal securities laws, including provisions designed to protect customer privacy and ensure accurate record-keeping and reporting. Further, Robinhood Securities also admitted to errors in over 11,800 Electronic Blue Sheets submitted to the SEC over a five-year period, which led to inaccurate reporting of at least 392 million transactions. EBS are formal data requests used by regulators to monitor trading activity and investigate potential market abuses. Sanjay Wadhwa, Acting Director of the SEC’s Division of Enforcement, stressed the importance of broker-dealers meeting their legal obligations to uphold market integrity and fairness in a statement , noting that such compliance is “essential to the Commission’s broader efforts to protect investors and promote the integrity and fairness,” of the financial markets. Robinhood’s crypto businesses were not mentioned in the order or included in the scope of these violations; however, that doesn’t mean the company is out of the water. Last year, the brokerage firm received a Wells notice from the SEC. According to a regulatory filing submitted at the time, the SEC’s staff recommended pursuing enforcement action over Robinhood’s cryptocurrency listings, custody practices, and platform operations. The commission currently has ongoing civil enforcement cases against several high-profile crypto firms, including Binance , Coinbase , and Ripple Labs .

Bitcoin Unveiled: The Future of Money Without Banks Bitcoin is the first and most well-known cryptocurrency. It was created by someone known as Satoshi Nakamoto to be a new kind of money. Unlike traditional money, Bitcoin doesn't need banks or governments to work. Instead, it operates on a technology called blockchain, which is like a shared record kept by many computers around the world. People can send Bitcoins directly to each other, and these transactions are verified by miners. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex puzzles, and as a reward, they earn new Bitcoins. Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins, making it scarce. Every four years, there's an event called ""halving,"" where the reward miners get is cut in half. This reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are made and can impact how profitable mining is. In today's market, Bitcoin still holds a strong position compared to other cryptocurrencies. Its technology is proven, and it's seen by many as ""digital gold."" While new coins come and go, Bitcoin's potential to change how we think about money remains strong. For those looking at the current market, Bitcoin could still be an attractive choice due to its established network and the trust it has built over the years. Conclusion While Bitcoin eyes $200K in the 2025 bull run, XYZVerse's unique sports memecoin aims for 1,000x growth, making it a standout opportunity.

In June of 2023, incensed by the chicanery of crypto exchange FTX, the SEC sued Binance and Binance.US, as well as their owner Changpeng Zhao for charges that included violations of securities laws. Later, Binance agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement with U.S. authorities, and Zhao served some jail time. Binance.US, which is a separate legal entity from Binance Global, was not involved in that settlement at all. The firm remains locked in litigation stalemate with the SEC today, having been forced to endure the last 18 months denuded by the assault on its business, operating as a crypto-to-crypto only exchange. “We’ll never get recompense for the damage the SEC did to us,” said Binance.US's interim CEO Norman Reed. “Within two weeks of that lawsuit, we’d lost thousands of customers, billions of dollars went out the door and we were later forced to lay off 70% of our staff. Institutions and banks ran away from us because the SEC said we were another fraudulent firm like FTX. It's ironic that a U.S. financial regulator would essentially create a bank run at a company, which is what they did.” Thankfully there’s light at the end of the tunnel for Binance.US. Reed said he expects to have USD fiat services revitalized and working in the next few weeks; the firm is poised for a dramatic comeback, courting partnerships with banks and in dialogue with state regulators once more. Binance.US doesn’t want or need to play the victim, Reed added, having stoically carried on amid restraining orders, reporting obligations and the loss of banking partners. But in light of a new U.S. administration and the end of Gensler’s ultra-vindictive leadership at the SEC, Reed – himself a former regulatory officer at the SEC – wants to speak out about what he sees as an injustice. “The DOJ looked at us, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District looked at us. The CFTC looked at us. OFAC and FinCEN looked at us – and when I say they ‘looked,’ I mean they did a thorough examination of us – but they all left us alone. We were outside of what happened to Binance Global and CZ. The only entity that went after us was the SEC,” Reed said. The debanking of crypto businesses (and executives in some cases), known colloquially as “ Operation Chokepoint 2.0 ,” has also become a talking point of late, with the likes of a16z boss Marc Andreessen and Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse discussing it in public. The debanking of Binance.US is Chokepoint in action, Reed said. It involved the SEC hitting up the exchange’s partners and fear mongering with subpoenas. Once the lawsuit was brought, the reputational risk was too high and payment processors backed away thanks to their correspondent banks being spooked, he said. “In the intervening period we approached hundreds of banks and financial institutions,” Reed said. “None of them would bank us. Because we were a cauldron of fraud, according to the SEC.” Shortly after Binance.US was sued, the SEC attempted to put the firm out of business with a temporary restraining order that would have frozen all its assets, Reed said. The regulator claimed Binance.US was defrauding clients, abusing client accounts and sending money overseas. “But in court the SEC lawyers were forced to say they had found no evidence of this,” Reed said. “Of course that didn't stop them continuing to issue press releases about us. They are supposed to be the good guys, the regulators, wearing the white hats.” The one thing Binance.US does have in common with Binance.com is that Zhao (widely known as “CZ”) remains the beneficial owner of both firms. Reed said it’s been months since he spoke to Zhao, recalling the time the then-Binance CEO asked him to take over the lead at Binance.US. “At the time, I felt like I'd been nominated captain of the Titanic after it hit the iceberg, to go down with the ship,” Reed said. “But we didn’t give up, and we’re a stronger company today than we’ve ever been. I've been telling my team for over a year that when we save this company and actually make it successful again, this will be some kind of case study.”",Finance,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|FIAT|REGULATION|SPONSORED|BNB,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-01-14 07:48:12

However, the RSI at 62.49 suggests Bitcoin is nearing overbought levels, and a high Stochastic of 94.50 may indicate an upcoming price correction. The MACD at 220.22 shows positive momentum. Bitcoin faces immediate resistance at $103,705. Surpassing this could push the price toward $111,272, offering potential gains of 8% and 16%. Support levels lie at $88,572 and $81,005, with possible declines of 5% and 13%. Based on current data, Bitcoin may see short-term volatility, but long-term growth potential remains strong. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum has seen some notable price changes recently. In the past week, its price has decreased by 4.22%. Over the last month, it has dropped by 8.91%. However, looking at the past six months, Ethereum has gained 4.00%. Currently, the price ranges between $3399.33 and $3772.29. Based on these figures, Ethereum might experience a rise soon. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 58.08, indicating neutral momentum. The Stochastic value is high at 93.25, suggesting the asset is nearing overbought territory. The MACD level is positive at 0.1529, hinting at potential upward movement. These indicators point toward a possible price increase in the short term. The nearest resistance level is $3909.76. If Ethereum breaks through this, it could climb to the second resistance at $4283, representing an increase of around 9% and 19% respectively from the current price. On the downside, the nearest support is at $3163.84, with a second support level at $2790.88. Falling to these supports would mean decreases of approximately 7% and 18%. The price is above both the 10-day SMA of $3274.13 and the 100-day SMA of $3429.36, which may support further growth. Solana (SOL) Over the past week, Solana (SOL) dropped by 7.85%. In the last month, it fell by 10.27%. However, over six months, SOL has risen by 34.96%. This shows that while there have been recent declines, the coin has grown over the longer term. SOL is currently trading between $192.85 and $226.85. The nearest support level is $172.30. This means if the price falls, it might stop there. The nearest resistance level is $240. If the price rises, it might face a hurdle there. The next resistance is at $274, which could be a significant gain if reached. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The 10-day simple moving average is $190.34, and the 100-day average is $201.73. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 55.01, suggesting the coin is in a neutral zone. The Stochastic is high at 89.82, which might mean the coin is overbought. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.08937. Based on this data, SOL's price could either rise or fall. Key levels to watch are the support at $172.30 and the resistance at $240. XRP (XRP) XRP's price has seen minor declines recently. Over the past week, it decreased by 3.65%. In the past month, it dropped by 2.55%. Despite this, over the last six months, XRP surged by 339.28%. The current price ranges between $2.09 and $2.61. Technical indicators show mixed signals. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 53.84, which is neutral. The stochastic indicator is at 80.14, suggesting the asset might be overbought. The MACD level is slightly negative at -0.0002449, indicating bearish momentum. The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $2.30 and $2.34, pointing to price consolidation. If XRP's price rises, it may face resistance at $2.81. Moving above this could push it towards the next resistance level at $3.32, which would be an increase of about 27% from the current upper price range. On the downside, if the price falls, it may find support at $1.79. Dropping to the second support level at $1.28 would represent a decline of about 39% from the current price. The market's next moves will depend on whether it breaks through resistance or support levels.

Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors, says that Bitcoin could soon be one of the best-performing assets in 2025. But there’s a catch it needs to drop further before it can truly soar. As bitcoin already seeing a price drop from its ATH to currently at $94K. So, let’s see what Tom Lee Bitcoin’s prediction says. Tom Lee’s Prediction for Bitcoin In a recent interview with CNBC , Lee explained that a 15% drop in Bitcoin’s price from its peak is not unusual for such a volatile asset. He explains that this type of correction is common and follows global liquidity trends. Lee also mentioned that we are still in the early stages of Bitcoin’s halving cycle, a factor that historically influences Bitcoin’s price. However, Fundstrat’s technical team predicts Bitcoin could dip another $20,000 before it begins to bounce back. Even Lee suggests that Bitcoin might drop to around $70,000 before it starts to recover. He believes this is a key level where Bitcoin could stabilize after a price drop. Bitcoin as a Long-Term Investment However, he further mentions that Bitcoin could fall even lower, possibly to $50,000, before starting its upward trend again. For those considering buying Bitcoin, Lee advises taking a long-term approach . He suggests that trying to time the market might work for some, but it’s not the safest strategy. He encourages investors to view Bitcoin as a long-term investment, with strong growth potential in the years ahead. Key Dates to Watch for Bitcoin’s Lee also points out that January 15 is a crucial date to watch. That’s when the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data will be released, which could impact Bitcoin’s price. Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s decisions on interest rates later in the month will be important for the broader market, including Bitcoin. Big Gains in 2025 Despite short-term challenges, Lee remains confident that Bitcoin will perform well in the long term. Analysts from institutions like VanEck and Bitwise are also optimistic, predicting that Bitcoin could hit between $180,000 and $200,000 by the end of 2025. This would be a huge leap, especially if the U.S. establishes a Bitcoin reserve.",News,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-01-14 07:57:50

Shiba Inu’s TREAT token goes live today, with major exchanges like KuCoin and Gate.io offering airdrops to incentivize user engagement within the ecosystem. Bitcoin (BTC) recovered from a drop below $90,000 to near $95,000, with industry leaders forecasting strong momentum for the cryptocurrency in 2025. XRP Price Explosion in the Making? Ripple’s XRP passed through enhanced turbulence in the past few days. Over the weekend, its price pumped to almost $2.60 but the start of the business week offered pain for the bulls. On January 13, XRP followed the broader decline of the cryptocurrency market and dipped below $2.40. The last 24 hours, though, witnessed a substantial resurgence and the asset is currently worth $2.53 (per CoinGecko’s data). XRP Price, Source: CoinGecko According to many industry participants, XRP has much more room for growth in the near future due to some key upcoming factors. Some of those include Donald Trump’s inauguration as America’s 47th President and the resignation of the SEC’s Chairman Gary Gensler. The Republican has shown a pro-crypto stance during his presidential campaign, while the agency’s leader is considered a huge enemy of the digital asset sector. “XRP is gonna make a big move on January 20 because of Trump taking office and Gary Gensler resigning,” one popular X user predicted . Other market observers envisioning an incoming price pump include CRYPTOWZRD and WSB Trader Rocko. The former claimed XRP “has flipped previous resistance to support” of around $2 and is now ready to jump to a new all-time high of $4 and then $8. They said such a scenario would mimic the pre-bull run in 2017 and the subsequent rally the following year. For their part, WSB Trader Rocko referred to XRP’s price chart as “the most bullish in crypto.” According to them, Ripple’s recent introduction of its stablecoin (RLUSD) and the company’s potential connections with Donald Trump’s future administration could drive the token to reach new peaks. TREAT on the Way Shiba Inu has recently taken the main stage due to a major development related to its ecosystem. As CryptoPotato previously reported , the meme coin TREAT ( which is designed to enhance utility and engagement across the network’s projects) is scheduled to go live today (January 14). The leading cryptocurrency exchanges that have already embraced the token include KuCoin, Gate.io, Bitget, MEXC Exchange, and others. Some of those have even announced special airdrops to users. Gate.io has promised to distribute 1,000,000 TREAT, KuCoin will airdrop 3,000,000 coins, while Bitget users will split 87,450,000 tokens. Those willing to apply for the offer should create an account at the aforementioned platforms . Then, they must visit Shiba Inu’s official website, provide a user ID, and deposit the designated address. Once those details are submitted, the accounts will be whitelisted and “ready to receive TREAT tokens.” BTC Price Outlook Last but not least, we will focus on the primary cryptocurrency, whose price swings have been more than evident lately. BTC started the week trading at approximately $95,000. Shortly after, though, the bears suppressed the valuation below $90,000, the lowest point observed in two months. However, the bulls have recovered much of the lost ground in the past several hours, with BTC currently trading just south of $95K. BTC Price, Source: CoinGecko The price resurgence coincides with some optimistic forecasts coming from industry participants. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley , for one, said 2025 could be the year for Bitcoin and crypto, which has “so many tailwinds and so few headwinds.” Those willing to explore additional price predictions and check whether now is a good time to hop on the bandwagon as investors can take a look at our dedicated video below: The post Bullish Ripple (XRP) Price Predictions, Upcoming Shiba Inu (SHIB) Developments, and More: Bits Recap Jan 14 appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto Bits|Crypto News|XRPBTC|XRPUSD|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Ripple (XRP) Price|Shiba Inu (SHIB),EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|SHIB|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-01-14 07:58:06

What are the factors behind this rapid adoption? According to a recent study by BlackRock, global crypto adoption reached 300 million users in just 12 years—a pace around 43% faster than the adoption of mobile phones and about 20% faster than the internet. By comparison, mobile phones took 21 years to hit the 300-million mark, while the internet reached that milestone in 15 years. Cryptocurrency adoption has outpaced both mobile phones and the internet, achieving 300 million users in just 12 years compared to 15 years for the internet and 21 years for mobile phones. Source: BlackRock The global investment firm also stated that the adoption is buoyed by demographic trends such as “digital natives,” wherein younger generations are more open to Bitcoin ( BTC ) adoption than GenX and Baby Boomers, reads the report. Meanwhile, Empower , a U.S. based financial services company, researched 1,009 American individuals, which supports BlackRock’s views. The poll found that 34% of Gen Z respondents chose cryptocurrencies over cash- the highest rate among any age group. Moreover, according to Stilt , a platform for financial products and resources for immigrants, Buyers in the Gen Z and Millennial age groups account for nearly 94% of all crypto buyers, leaving just over 6% for those over 40. Zooming in on each cohort, Gen Z buyers outnumber Gen X by a factor of 3.5 and Baby Boomers by 14.3. Meanwhile, Millennials outnumber Gen X by 15.5 times and Boomers by 62.9 times—reflecting just how firmly crypto is dominated by younger generations.

Cryptocurrency Capital Inflows Have Seen A Notable Drop Recently As explained by analyst Ali Martinez in a new post on X, capital inflows for the cryptocurrency sector have slowed down over the past month. Capital enters (or exits) the digital asset market through mainly three asset classes: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and the stablecoins. It’s only once that inflows have made it to these coins that they rotate out into the altcoins. Related Reading: Bitcoin Short-Term Holders Now Capitulating: Bottom Here? Thus, the flows related to these assets could be assumed to represent the netflows for the cryptocurrency sector as a whole. As for how the flows can be calculated, the Realized Cap indicator can be used in the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum. The Realized Cap is an on-chain capitalization model that determines the total value of any given asset by assuming that the real value of any token in circulation is equal to the price at which it was last transacted on the network. The last transaction of any coin is likely to be the last point at which it changed hands, so the price at that time would denote its current cost basis. Since the Realized Cap sums up this value for all tokens in the circulating supply, it essentially measures the amount of capital that the investors as a whole have put into the asset. Bitcoin and Ethereum capital netflows can be equated with the changes taking place in this indicator. For stablecoins, there isn’t any need for this model as their price is always fixed around the $1 mark, so changes in their combined market cap serve as a sufficient method for finding capital flows. Now, here is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in the 30-day flows related to the three asset classes over the last few months: As displayed in the above graph, the total netflows related to the cryptocurrency sector have been positive during the last few months, implying that a net amount of capital has been coming into the various assets. The 30-day inflows appear to have peaked last month, however, as they have since been following a downward trajectory. In this period, the metric’s value has declined from $134 billion to $58 billion, representing a decrease of more than 56%. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sentiment Plummets To Neutral: Reversal Signal? “This points to a significant reduction in investment activity,” notes Martinez. The slowdown in capital inflows could be why Bitcoin and other assets have switched to a bearish trajectory recently. BTC Price Bitcoin briefly fell under the $91,000 mark earlier in the day, but it appears the coin has since retraced back above it as its price is now trading around $91,800.

XRP Set for a Breakout as Altcoin Season Looms XRP is bouncing between $2.27 and $2.67. The current momentum shows promise.

Though the MACD slightly dips, the RSI and stochastic hint at potential upward movement. As the market anticipates a massive altcoin season, XRP might soar, rewarding investors aiming for significant returns.

Join the Feline Frenzy! $CATZILLA Is on the Rise—Claim Your Share Today! Uniswap's Next Move: Ready for a Bullish Breakout? Uniswap (UNI) is currently moving between $12.14 and $15.38. It faces resistance at $17 and support at $10.64. With a simple moving average over the last 10 days at $12.62, it's barely above the current price range. The RSI at 30.51 hints it's oversold, suggesting a possible rally. Recent changes show a 28.88% drop over the last month but a 52.12% increase over six months, indicating potential for a comeback. If UNI breaks $17, it could aim for $20, marking a nearly 30% rise from the upper range. The market conditions and bullish sentiment around altcoins could be the push UNI needs to climb higher. Solana Eyes Bullish Breakout Amidst Market Resilience Solana is currently trading between $172.62 and $213.70. The coin has dropped over a week and month, but not by more than what a single bullish run could recover. It finds support at $156.83 and resistance at $238.99, suggesting room for a potential rise. Although its RSI and MACD levels signal a cautious approach, Solana has a chance to climb. Surpassing the resistance could push the price towards $280.07, a gain of about 30% from the upper limit of its current range. A possible altcoin season might be the ideal period for such a surge. Keep an eye on market trends for further direction. Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET): A Hidden Gem Poised for a Surge FET is showing resilience amid a tough market, trading between $1.15 and $1.55. Despite a recent drop, with a 1-week loss of about 25.5% and a 1-month decrease of around 33.6%, it sits above the key $1.01 support. FET faces resistance at $1.80, but its potential shines through. If a bullish trend prevails, surpassing the $1.80 mark could push it to the next target of $2.20, representing an approximate 41% increase from its current level. The RSI and stochastic indicators hovering in oversold territory suggest potential upward momentum. Watch for FET to capitalize on the upcoming altcoin season and its path to recovery and growth. Ethena (ENA) Shows Potential for Growth Amidst Current Correction Ethena (ENA) has been experiencing a dip, with current prices between $0.73 and $1.16. It sits below both the 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages of $0.80 and $0.89, respectively. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 41.38 and stochastic at 38.57 suggest it's approaching the oversold zone. The MACD level is slightly negative, which indicates a slowdown. However, the coin has gained over 74% in the last 6 months, showing its potential. If momentum picks up, it could test the nearest resistance at $1.43, leading to over 60% growth if it reaches the second resistance level at $1.86. Conclusion While UNI, SOL, FET, and ENA show less short-term potential, Catzilla emerges as the ultimate meme coin hero aiming to bring financial freedom to all. Offering a remarkable 700% ROI during its presale—from $0.0002 to $0.0016 over 14 stages—it combines governance, rewards, and staking features to unite enthusiasts against crypto villains.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 147,700 followers on the social media platform X that Bitcoin may be repeating a pattern witnessed in 2023 and 2024. The trader shares a chart suggesting that BTC may correct to around $82,000 and touch the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level before coming back to life. The Fibonacci retracement level is a tool used by traders to identify potential entry and exit points for an asset based on the Fibonacci sequence of numbers. “Short-term BTC volatility IF the pattern were to repeat.” Source: Dave the Wave/X While Dave the Wave is short-term bearish on BTC, he highlights that a move to $82,000 may set up BTC for a 119% surge. “Would BTC at $82,000 odd be so bad if it then enabled a move to $180,000…?” Source: Dave the Wave/X Zooming out, Dave the Wave believes that Bitcoin will print a bull market top in about seven months based on his logarithmic growth curve (LGC) channel. The analyst uses his version of logarithmic growth curves (LGCs), which aim to forecast Bitcoin’s market cycle highs and lows while filtering out short-term volatility. “The suggestion of a mid-year BTC peak here: the price has previously peaked when the one-year moving average hits the midway mark of the LGC channel.” Source: Dave the Wave/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $94,502.

The platform has gained traction in the booming field of prediction markets, allowing users to speculate on the probability of real-time events. The company stands out among its offshore competitors because it operates under the oversight of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). However, the company has seen regulatory problems recently. The CFTC recently threw out Kalshi’s plans to offer contracts on election outcomes with a decision that is currently under appeal. Kalshi appears to be taking steps to move past the minor setback with the evolution of its platform, the expansion of its offerings, and perhaps, its decision to bring Donald Trump Jr. on as a strategic advisor. The move has already given Kalshi extra visibility, and that attention might help it close the gap with Polymarket in the predictions market. Why Donald Trump Jr.? Donald Trump Jr. recently achieved Republican elite status thanks to the central role he played in returning his father to office. It is unsurprising that Kalshi wants him to bring that Midas touch, and maybe influence, to its platform. Don Jr. seems to have the ears of the president-to-be, seeing that he lobbied vigorously for his friend J.D. Vance to get a seat at the table. Don Jr. will also bring his wealth of experience in business and media to Kalshi. In addition to his new advisory role, he serves on the board of Trump Media & Technology Group, the company behind the conservative social media platform Truth Social. Kalshi may have just taken a strategic step ahead of Polymarket by snagging Don Jr. when they did. As stated earlier, the company has been facing many regulatory huddles, which is a side effect of creating a product in a heavily regulated industry. However, with Don Jr.’s endorsement, doors could open for the platform within conservative circles, where skepticism of traditional media and enthusiasm for alternative platforms are gradually becoming the order of the day. In a statement, Trump Jr. expressed enthusiasm for the potential prediction markets have to disrupt traditional mainstream media and alter how people engage with information. “Prediction markets are a powerful tool for democratizing information and enabling individuals to make informed bets on real-world events,” Trump Jr. said. His role at Kalshi will involve advising on strategic partnerships, expanding the company’s user base, and navigating the platform’s growth as it competes in a heavily regulated industry. It may also be a way to safeguard the company from future regulation, especially with Don Jr., the president’s oldest son and republican superstar, heavily invested in the platform. In recent times, presidents have gotten away with showing leniency and favoritism toward family members. Case in point: Hunter Biden received a full pardon because his father just happens to be the POTUS. Kalshi is going all in on the US markets Polymarket cannot operate on US soil, and US residents are prohibited from using the platform “officially.” Still, platforms like Polymarket present stiff competition for Kalshi because they have a first-mover advantage as they are located offshore and operate outside the reach of US regulators. By aligning itself with Don Jr., Kalshi expects to leverage his influence to draw attention to its regulated, legally compliant platform that caters specifically to US residents. Kalshi has been around since 2018, but it will now renew efforts to stay relevant. It got a slice of the action in November because a US appeals court lifted a freeze on it in October, allowing the site to list contracts that allow for bets on the election. On the night of the election, over 500,000 people were using Kalshi simultaneously — both to place bets and to monitor the election results. Bettors invested $476 million into the presidential race’s outcome on Kalshi while Polymarket’s site says people spent more than $3.6 billion betting on the race even though US users weren’t legally allowed to participate. If Kalshi succeeds with US residents, it will become the go-to platform for a liquidity-rich market. “Nothing is as salient as the presidential election,” Xavier Sottile, the head of markets at Kalshi says. Kalshi is already adding contracts for the outcomes of the second Trump administration. It has options on whether Musk or Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will be given Cabinet positions and the removal of taxes on tips. It even has events about Trump getting impeached for a third time. The bets on these pale in comparison to the election bonanza, but Sottile says there are enough of them and enough interest for Kalshi to seize the smaller moments. The race for supremacy Polymarket’s success in predicting Trump’s win has thrown prediction markets to the forefront of event forecasting. Many believe they are very accurate, and for good reasons. People are more decisive with their money, so they pick outcomes they think will happen, not just ones they want to happen. “When they actually put their money behind what they say, they’re putting themselves out there,” says Koleman Strumpf, a professor of economics at Wake Forest University. He believes that prediction markets will last a long time and only get bigger. Similar platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket have already been popping up. In late October 2024, Robinhood started offering election betting, and there’s also PredictIt, which is a platform operated by Victoria University in New Zealand focused specifically on US politics. The race is on, and every platform will be working hard to keep its users satisfied with various updates and upgrades. Kalshi has started the year hot by signing on Don Jr. and is well on the way to becoming a US sweetheart where prediction is concerned.

Historically, Bitcoin and the DXY have shown an inverse correlation , leading many analysts to predict that a significant movement for Bitcoin might be approaching. Crypto educator Quinten Francois noted that high DXY levels have historically coincided with Bitcoin price fluctuations. He emphasized, “When DXY was this high, BTC was at $20,000. Something big is brewing.” This sentiment is echoed by HZ, a crypto researcher, who warned that the surging DXY could trigger a global credit crunch, harm liquidity, and strain markets. “If you’re overleveraged, you’re standing on a trapdoor,” he added. The financial analytics platform Barchart has also reported increased bullishness on the dollar among hedge funds, marking the highest confidence since early 2019. This aligns with the DXY’s current role as a safe haven amid global economic uncertainties. Meanwhile, market research firm Capital Hungry noted that recent DXY strength has been driven by trade tariff concerns. Upcoming economic reports, including PPI and CPI data, are expected to heavily influence market direction. If these indicators suggest cooling inflation, the DXY may retreat, creating opportunities for risk assets like Bitcoin to rebound . Capital Hungry predicted that if Bitcoin stays above $94,000, it could climb to $99,000. However, a stronger-than-expected DXY could push prices lower. A high DXY not only affects cryptocurrencies but also impacts global markets, particularly emerging economies. A strong dollar can increase economic strain, reducing liquidity and potentially causing downturns. Conversely, any easing in the DXY could support risk assets, including Bitcoin. In August, the DXY dipped to its lowest point of 2024, which coincided with a brief Bitcoin rally, further reinforcing their inverse relationship. Institutional developments are adding to the optimism surrounding Bitcoin. BlackRock’s newly launched BTC ETF is viewed as a milestone, signaling growing confidence in Bitcoin from major financial institutions. Many believe this endorsement strengthens Bitcoin’s legitimacy and potential for widespread adoption. Despite these positive signs, Bitcoin remains at a crossroads. The DXY’s direction will likely play a key role in determining the cryptocurrency’s next major move. While a stronger dollar exerts downward pressure, any reversal in the DXY could pave the way for Bitcoin’s resurgence. Investors are closely watching whether Bitcoin can overcome the challenges posed by the DXY’s ascent.",,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-14 08:11:15

With its current RSI at 36.00, it signals that SHIB is oversold. This could mean an opportunity for a price rise. If bullish momentum picks up, SHIB might test the second resistance level at $0.0000308833, which means over 20% potential gain from the current range. Though short-term changes show drops, the last 6 months saw a rise of over 5%. If momentum continues, altcoin season could bring a significant boost. Keep an eye on breaking through resistance for more gains. Title: Pepe Coin Poised for Growth Despite Recent Dips Pepe (PEPE) has been bouncing within a tight range, from $0.00001579 to $0.00002055. It recently fell by over 21% in a week, and more than 34% this past month. Yet, with a relative strength index around 33, it's close to being oversold, meaning it might bounce back. The nearest resistance sits at $0.00002335. If it breaks through, the next target is $0.00002812. Though the coin has declined in the short term, its 6-month gain still shows a 32% rise. This suggests potential for bullish moves if it rebounds off the support level of $0.00001382. Pepe's long-term trends hint at possible growth ahead. CHILLGUY Set for a Rebound: Is Now the Perfect Buy Opportunity? Just a chill guy (CHILLGUY) is at an intriguing price point, currently between $0.0891 and $0.1865. The RSI is low and the stochastic is also on the lower side, both indicating potential for a rebound. The nearest resistance is at $0.2504. If CHILLGUY breaks through, it could climb further to the next resistance at $0.3478. With the current price movement and indicators, CHILLGUY seems poised for growth. It has potential for gains exceeding 30-60% if market conditions favor an uptrend. The MACD is slightly negative but shows signs of reversal. CHILLGUY is in a prime spot, suggesting a possible rally ahead. Pudgy Penguins Set for Potential Breakout Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) currently hovers between $0.0576 and $0.1113. It's testing resistance at $0.1467, with support at $0.0393. The 10-day moving average of $0.0684 is below the 100-day average of $0.0815, hinting at consolidation. The MACD is slightly negative at -0.0035, suggesting mild bearish pressure. If it breaks past $0.1467, a surge to around $0.2004 is possible, which would be a substantial percentage increase. However, if it dips below support, expect a retraction. With the general crypto sentiment leaning bullish, keep an eye out for a potential push upward. Conclusion While SHIB, PEPE, CHILLGUY, and PENGU may have limited short-term potential, Catzilla stands out as the ultimate meme coin hero offering a 700% ROI in its presale. With triple utility and a mission to bring financial freedom, Catzilla invites enthusiasts to join the fight against crypto villains by acquiring $CATZILLA tokens.

Developed by Sony Block Solutions Labs, a collaboration between Sony Group and Web3 infrastructure provider Startale, Soneium aims to revolutionize entertainment, gaming, and finance with blockchain technology. After a successful testnet phase, Soneium now boasts 15 million active wallets and over 47 million transactions. “With Soneium Mainnet, we take the next step in creating an open internet that connects cultures and brings people onchain,” Sony announced. The platform’s mainnet launch follows the earlier deployment of the testnet “Soneium Minato,” which allowed developers and users to explore the network’s capabilities. Blockscout data reveals that Soneium’s blockchain already has 6.8 million blocks, with an average block time of just 2 seconds. The platform supports a vast ecosystem, including 7.3 million contracts and a range of applications developed during its testnet phase. Over 32 projects from the “Soneium Spark” incubation program, selected from more than 1,700 submissions, are now live, alongside additional independent apps spanning NFTs, gaming, and finance. Sony’s vision for Soneium is ambitious yet clear: to create a blockchain-powered internet where creativity thrives, and users are empowered to adopt Web3 technology. “Our mission is to make Web3 more accessible while fostering innovation and collaboration,” said Sota Watanabe, Director of Sony Block Solutions Labs. To support these goals, Soneium has introduced several infrastructure services to enhance user experience. The Fan Marketing Platform, developed by SNFT Inc., provides a one-stop solution for companies launching NFT projects , covering everything from execution to data analysis. Additionally, Soneium’s S.BLOX crypto exchange services offer new opportunities for creators and brands to explore blockchain technology. Sony’s move into Web3 follows its acquisition of the Japanese crypto exchange WhaleFin in 2023, which it later renamed S.BLOX. This acquisition laid the groundwork for Sony’s broader Web3 strategy, enabling it to provide robust crypto services and tools. In a significant partnership, Soneium has teamed up with Chainlink to implement its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP). This collaboration enhances Soneium’s ability to connect with other blockchains, making it easier for developers to create cross-chain solutions and ensuring seamless integration across the ecosystem. The launch of the Soneium mainnet represents a seamless transition for projects developed on the testnet, thanks to consistent network specifications. This approach ensures that apps created during the test phase can easily migrate to the production environment, reducing friction for developers and users. Sony first announced Soneium’s development in August 2024, emphasizing its potential to shape the future of entertainment, gaming, and finance through blockchain. With the mainnet now live, Soneium is positioned to become a cornerstone of Web3 innovation, fostering creativity and providing practical applications for a wide range of industries. By prioritizing accessibility and user experience, Sony is setting the stage for a new era in blockchain adoption , proving its commitment to leading in Web3 technologies.",,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|LINK|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-01-14 08:14:37

The stablecoin (USDH) was created to “avoid the common freezing and transfer restrictions of traditional digital currencies.” The Huione website adds that “USDH is not restricted by traditional regulatory agencies.” Prior to the launch of USDH, users on Huione were almost exclusively using tether (USDT). Tether froze one of Huione Pay’s accounts in July 2024 after a wallet received funds linked to a theft attributed to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. The company also released its own chat service to make it less reliant on third-party apps like Telegram. The report claims that Huione has facilitated $24 billion worth of transactions including a large portion of the funds used in infamous pig butchering scams. It is a Chinese-language market and has links to Huione Group, a Cambodian conglomerate.

The altcoin reached a high of $1.32 in the fourth quarter of 2024 but has been steadily declining. In the last 24 hours, ADA has lagged behind its rivals, rising just 0.65%. According to the data from CoinMarketCap, ADA is currently trading at $0.9507, down 69.18% from its all-time high of $3.10 reached over three years ago.

38944986,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=643037,1736845211,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/38944986.jpeg,US regulators to investigate Crypto.com over football futures trading,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/regulators-crypto-football-futures-trading/,"Crypto.com is in hot water with federal regulators over its new football futures trading contracts. These contracts let users bet on the outcomes of major games, including the Super Bowl, and they’ve triggered a full-blown inquiry by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The five-member agency is reportedly voting on whether to launch a 90-day review, a move that could lead to a ban if the contracts are found to break gaming laws. The contracts, launched on Crypto.com’s Chicago-based derivatives exchange just days before Christmas, let users over 18 place bets on football outcomes without directly naming NFL teams or games. A regulatory review is now underway, but the CFTC doesn’t have the authority to immediately pull the plug on trading. This means the contracts will likely remain available even after the Super Bowl on February 9, unless the commission’s decision leads to a ban. CFTC weighs legality of football bets Crypto.com submitted its filings for the football contracts on December 19. Legally, the CFTC gets one business day to review such filings before trading can start, but with the holidays and a looming government shutdown, regulators didn’t have time to act. Now with scrutiny mounting, questions are being raised about whether the contracts align with U.S. gaming laws. “This isn’t a decision the current leadership of the CFTC should be making,” a Crypto.com spokesperson said, expressing frustration that the issue is being addressed so close to a leadership transition at the agency. Crypto.com isn’t the only firm facing such challenges. Back in 2021, ErisX introduced similar contracts, but they withdrew their proposal before the CFTC could vote to ban them. Crypto.com’s contracts, however, are live—and causing quite a stir. On its app, Crypto.com allows users to bet on the Super Bowl or AFC championship, listing options like “hometown celebration” to describe contracts tied to team victories. These contracts are priced at $100 each, with individual traders capped at 2,500 contracts or $250,000 in notional value. Market makers though, can hold up to 250,000 contracts. Nationwide reach shakes up the market Crypto.com’s move into sports betting is a direct challenge to traditional platforms like DraftKings and FanDuel, which operate state by state. Crypto.com sidesteps that limitation by offering trading across all 50 states. While sportsbooks set odds and take on the financial risk of payouts, Crypto.com simply facilitates trades between two parties and collects a small fee. The platform’s contracts add to a crowded but fragmented market. Mobile sports betting is legal in 30 states and Washington, D.C., with unregulated platforms like Polymarket also allowing bets on events like the Super Bowl. But Crypto.com’s nationwide reach has raised eyebrows among both competitors and regulators. The CFTC has long been wary of contracts tied to sports, war, assassination, and other prohibited activities. However, a recent legal decision in late 2024 opened the door for regulated exchanges to offer political prediction markets, indirectly granting a pathway for contracts like Crypto.com’s football futures. Nick Lundgren, Crypto.com’s Chief Legal Officer, defended the contracts, saying, “Having CFTC oversight ensures market integrity, manipulation controls, and availability in all 50 states.” Regulatory uncertainty ahead The CFTC’s stance on event contracts remains very uncertain. In 2024, the agency drafted—but never finalized—a rule defining “gaming” in such markets. This proposed rule would have banned trading on politics, sports, and other events deemed “against public interest.” Rostin Behnam, the outgoing CFTC chairman, recently commented on the issue, saying, “The line between what’s legal and illegal, what’s permitted and impermissible, is getting blurrier. This moves us far from the original purpose of derivatives markets.” Behnam is stepping down on January 20 and leaving the commission entirely on February 7. His departure comes just as President Trump’s administration, which is expected to take a more crypto-friendly approach, prepares to appoint new leadership. The president is yet to name Behnam’s successor though, but everyone’s expecting a pro-crypto figure. That’s just how Trump rolls now.

Long’s comments came following the news that President Donald is likely to repeal the crypto account policy aka SAB 121, which required banks holding digital assets to count them as liabilities. Ripple President Anticipates Tokenized Asset Growth in 2025 Ripple President Monica Long, in an X post , expressed optimism about the expansion of tokenized assets in the banking sector during 2025, subject to regulatory clarity in the United States. In a recent statement on social media, Long highlighted that 15 of the world’s 25 largest banks have already piloted tokenized asset initiatives. She noted: “I expect several of them to launch market-ready offerings in the US in 2025 IF they have clarity from the US government to engage with crypto.” The Ripple President believes that this should no longer be an issue moving into 2025. Ultimately, such a development would pave the way for broader adoption of tokenized assets within the financial industry. Long’s comments came following the news that President Trump will issue executive orders on first day of his presidency such as repealing the controversial crypto policy of SAB 121 which forces banks to report crypto assets as liabilities. Following Donald Trump’s inauguration next week, the crypto industry is expecting a sea change in crypto regulatory framework from the President-elect. Trump’s Executive Order on Crypto Policy One of the sources familiar with the matter said that “Trump has made it clear that this is a priority”. Speaking on this, financial analyst Frank Chaparro stated that Trump’s decision would play a transformative role, allowing large banks to enter the crypto custody space. Chaparro noted that once major financial institutions begin offering crypto custody services, it could revolutionize the market structure by introducing credit and significantly increasing liquidity. “Credit equals more liquidity,” he stated, emphasizing its potential to act as a “major tailwind” for the cryptocurrency sector. Chaparro further suggested that this development could help temper market volatility, marking a pivotal moment for the broader adoption and stabilization of digital assets. Ripple’s XRP adoption will also get a major boost, which has faced major headwinds due to XRP lawsuit . It will be interesting to see what major changes does the next US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has to bring for the crypto industry. In a detailed 31-page letter to Bessent, anti-crypto Senator Elizabeth Warren has raised pointed questions over the changes in crypto policy.

Donald Pumps (DONPUMPS), a new Solana memecoin that was launched today, is set to explode over 16,000% in price in the coming days. This is because DONPUMPS is set to soon be listed on numerous crypto exchanges, according to reports. This will give the Solana memecoin exposure to millions of additional investors, who will pour funds into the coin and drive its price up. Currently, Donald Pumps can only be purchased via Solana decentralized exchanges, like Jup.ag and Raydium.io, and early investors stand to make huge returns in the coming days. Early investors in SHIB and DOGE made astronomical returns, and Donald Pumps could become the next viral memecoin. Donald Pumps launched with over $8,000 of liquidity, giving it a unique advantage over the majority of other new memecoins, and early investors could make huge gains. How to Buy To buy Donald Pumps on Raydium.io or Jup.ag ahead of the CEX listings, users need to connect their Solflare, MetaMask or Phantom wallet, and swap Solana for Donald Pumps by entering its contract address – 4AiQS1KegadchxjSm4hmifemyRE7gyk3Hieca9wGXGts – in the receiving field. If you don’t have one of these wallets already, you can create a new wallet in a few minutes and transfer some Solana to it (which will then be used to buy the memecoin), from an exchange like Coinbase, Binance and many others. In fact, early investors could make returns similar to those who invested in Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Dogecoin (DOGE) before these memecoins went viral and exploded in price. If this happens, a new wave of memecoin millionaires could be created in a matter of weeks – or potentially even sooner. The Solana memecoin craze continues amid larger memecoins, like Shiba Inu (SHIB), Dogecoin (DOGE) and DogWifHat (WIF) trading sideways in recent weeks and losing momentum. This is why many SHIB, DOGE and WIF investors are instead investing in new Solana memecoins, like DONPUMPS. Such memecoins have no utility and no inherent value, but investors looking for high gains have been investing in them due to their potential to rapidly rise in price.",Blockchain News|Crypto News Today|Press Releases,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|DOGE|EXCHANGE|SHIB|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-01-14 09:04:00

ARE YOU READY? pic.twitter.com/hBwQxcRn55 — Treat (@treatsforShib) January 13, 2025 SHIB Price Shows Signs of Reversal Amid Market Adjustments Shiba Inu price is displaying potential signs of recovery after experiencing significant declines in recent weeks. Despite a 10% drop over the past week and a 20% decline for the month, SHIB has managed to post a modest 2% daily gain. At the time of writing, the SHIB price is trading at $0.00002133, signaling early signs of a possible price rebound. The recent TREAT launch happening today may fuel optimism among traders, with expectations of renewed momentum for the cryptocurrency. If the bullish trend persists, SHIB could break past the $0.000025 level. A further surge might push the price toward $0.00003, particularly if the broader market maintains its recovery trajectory. The global crypto market has experienced a 1.11% uptick in the last 24 hours, with Bitcoin hovering around $94,000. This sideways trading pattern could provide stability and support for SHIB’s potential rally. However, the possibility of bearish pressure remains a concern. A reversal in market sentiment could drive the Shiba Inu price forecast below the $0.00002 mark, erasing recent gains. As market participants monitor developments, the next few weeks could prove pivotal for Shiba Inu’s price trajectory, influenced by market trends and the performance of the TREAT initiative.

While mobile phones took 21 years and the internet 15 years to reach 300 million users, cryptocurrencies achieved this milestone in just 12 years. This rapid growth is seen as a testament to the global interest in decentralised finance and blockchain technology, reflecting their potential to reshape financial systems and digital innovation worldwide. Time taken to 300 million users. source: BlackRock report . Bitcoin leads the pack As per the report, Bitcoin is the world’s leading and most widely adopted cryptoasset and boasts a market cap nearing USD $2 trillion. Its global and decentralized nature positions it as a potential alternative monetary system, particularly appealing during periods of global disorder and waning trust in institutions and fiat currencies. This has attracted significant attention from both institutional and individual investors seeking to diversify their financial assets with Bitcoin. The report added that historically, gaining exposure to Bitcoin has posed challenges, such as the need to open specialized accounts, high trading fees, and security concerns. However, the advent of investment vehicles like IBIT is changing the landscape. Similar to how ETFs have simplified access to hard-to-reach markets like gold and international stocks, IBIT provides a more convenient and efficient way for investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin. Drivers behind Bitcoin’s rapid adoption Since Bitcoin’s launch in 2009, its adoption has outpaced even other transformative technologies like the internet and mobile phones. The reports lists three key factors that have fueled this rapid growth: Demographic patterns: younger generations, often considered “digital natives,” exhibit a stronger affinity for digital innovation, including Bitcoin, compared to older demographics like Gen X and Baby Boomers. This generational shift has bolstered Bitcoin’s adoption. Global shifts: economic and political uncertainties, such as rising inflation, geopolitical tensions, and concerns about banking systems, have heightened Bitcoin’s appeal as a decentralized and non-sovereign asset. Future of finance: the ongoing digital transformation of the global economy has reshaped financial systems. The maturation of infrastructure supporting digital assets has reduced barriers to entry and introduced new use cases for Bitcoin, reinforcing its role in the evolving financial landscape. The future of Bitcoin investing Despite the surge in Bitcoin adoption, direct investment in the cryptocurrency often comes with hurdles. The reports add that this is reason why Bitcoin ETFs would be the next driver behind Bitcoin’s next leg of global adoption. Access: IBIT provides exposure to Bitcoin within a traditional brokerage account. As an ETF, it combines the appeal of Bitcoin with the familiarity of stock trading. Investors can buy and sell IBIT alongside stocks, bonds, and other ETFs across taxable and tax-advantaged accounts, such as a TFSA. Convenience: investing in Bitcoin directly can be complex, requiring accounts on crypto exchanges or specialized brokerages. Securing Bitcoin often involves setting up costly and intricate custody solutions outside these exchanges. IBIT eliminates these challenges by offering exposure to Bitcoin through an ETF — a trusted and widely traded investment vehicle.

However, with the looming ban in the US market, they are contemplating selling the platform’s US operations to Elon Musk. The United States is still discussing the potential TikTok ban. However, with the US Supreme Court judges hinting that they would uphold the law, a TikTok ban is more in sight. The Supreme Court hinted it may not intervene to stop TikTok’s ban TikTok has until January 19 to divest its US operations or face removal from app stores and servers nationwide. The video-sharing platform sought intervention from the US Supreme Court, hoping to avoid the ban, basing its arguments on rights to free speech and expression. The platform has consistently claimed that its removal from the US market would infringe on the rights of its 170 million American users to share content. However, the Supreme Court may be of little help to the platform. On January 10, after listening to multiple oral arguments, most of the court’s judges signaled that US national security concerns take precedence over the free speech interests of companies and creators. Beijing considers Elon Musk for TikTok’s acquisition With the ban becoming more imminent, the Chinese government is considering having Elon Musk take over US operations. Officials have even suggested having Musk’s X merge with TikTok. Nevertheless, there has been no confirmation of any agreement reached between Beijing and the American billionaire. The extent of ByteDance’s involvement in government discussions is still uncertain, as is whether Musk, TikTok, and ByteDance have engaged in talks about any potential deal. TikTok’s US operations are worth about $40 billion to $50 billion. How Musk can finance such a deal remains an open question since he’s still repaying sizable loans after his Twitter acquisition. Whether TikTok decides to sell its US service to Musk or any other individual or corporation, the Chinese government will have a say in the transaction. While TikTok maintains that the Chinese government’s control over ByteDance only extends to its sister application, Douyin, Beijing’s export laws still restrict the sale of software algorithms to foreign parties.

At this point, while many companies are purchasing BTC, the latest news came from Italy.

According to the report by Italian media outlet Criptovaluta, the country's largest banking group, Intesa Sanpaolo, purchased 11 BTC worth 1 million euros. While the acquisition is the first direct investment in cryptocurrency by an Italian financial institution, it remains unclear whether the move is a sign of the bank’s intention to expand into crypto services or is simply an exploratory investment into crypto. The bank also invested in Italy’s first blockchain-based digital bond, worth 25 million euros ($25.6 million), to be issued on the Polygon blockchain by development bank Cassa Depositi e Prestiti in July 2024, the bank said. *This is not investment advice.

Mike McGlone expressed confusion over XRP’s rising value. Over the weekend, XRP saw a price recovery, breaking out from its recent low and overcoming the first bull flag that has been forming for the past couple of weeks. This move has been closely tracked, with expectations of a bull flag pattern developing, similar to the last point of support (LPS) phase in a market accumulation cycle. As the new week begins, XRP is experiencing some backtesting, which is expected to be short-lived as the market stabilizes. Analysts suggest that this price action is part of a larger bullish structure, with a possible second bull flag forming. Currently, XRP is holding key support levels, with $2.20 being a crucial point to watch. As long as XRP remains above this level, the bullish outlook stays intact. If the price dips below this mark, it could mean a trap, though it is still too early to draw any conclusions.

The U.S. SEC-approved options tied to BlackRock's spot bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded fund (IBIT), which debuted on Nov. 19, are already almost half the size of Deribit's eight-year-old bitcoin options market. On Monday, there were 2.16 million open or active IBIT options contracts, representing a notional value of $11 billion, according to data source optioncharts.io. This notional value is derived by multiplying the open interest by the ETF's price and the lot size 100. The tally equates to 50% of the $23 billion locked in the open BTC options on Deribit at press time. One option contract on Deribit represents one BTC. Options are derivative contracts that give the purchaser the right to buy or sell the underlying asset at a preset price at a later date. A call provides the right to buy, and a put offer offers the right to sell. Similar to traditional markets, traders leverage crypto options to speculate on or hedge against price movements, volatility, and the effects of time (referred to as theta). Deribit has held a leading position for years, with traders and investors using its bitcoin and ether options to set up complex directional and non-directional strategies. However, the exchange's offshore status kept U.S.-based investors looking for regulated avenues at the bay. IBIT options are stepping in to fill that gap. ""With BlackRock's spot Bitcoin ETF as its underlying asset, IBIT options appeal not only to institutional investors but also U.S. retail traders who favor regulated markets. This rapidly expanding segment is evident in the increasing demand for IBIT options,"" Volmex Finance, a crypto derivatives protocol, told CoinDesk in an email. Volmex added that the growing popularity of IBIT options is challenging Deribit's dominance in the crypto options market. However, Deribit's Chief Executive Officer Luuk Strijers said IBIT options have created positive ripple effects for the industry. ""IBIT options are predominantly traded by U.S. retail investors, a segment that historically has not had access to Deribit. As such, their activation has not negatively impacted our market activity. If anything, it has created positive effects by introducing new arbitrage opportunities and facilitating enhanced risk-offloading strategies for institutional participants as Deribit continues to act as the global repository for risk and volatility,"" Strijers told CoinDesk.

Bitcoin ( BTC ) is likely to stay in consolidation as long as fiat-to-stablecoin conversions remain muted, according to Singapore-based digital asset firm Matrixport. In a Jan. 14 research note, Matrixport noted that the latest 7-day stablecoin minting indicator shows a “significant slowdown” in fiat-to-crypto on-ramps, particularly in the lead-up to the Christmas holidays. https://twitter.com/matrixport_en/status/1879061318650806474?s=46 Markus Thielen, an independent analyst, said the dip can be attributed to the Federal Reserve’s hawkish pivot in mid-December, which likely dampened investor sentiment. With fiat-to-stablecoin conversions still subdued, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are expected to continue consolidating, Thielen warned. You might also like: Matrixport outlines new risks that could challenge Bitcoin’s rally in 2025 Despite the end of the quieter holiday period, stablecoin inflows have yet to show a meaningful rebound. Even after the holiday period ended, stablecoin inflows have yet to rebound meaningfully. Thielen stressed that this metric is important, as a rise in stablecoin minting “typically signals rising demand for cryptocurrencies.” However, the current uptick in minting is slight, and its sustainability remains uncertain, he admitted. Thielen remains cautious, noting that while any increase in minting is a good sign, it’s still not enough to signal a clear path for BTC or other cryptocurrencies. For now, the market is likely to stay in a holding pattern until more significant movements in stablecoin inflows appear. Meanwhile, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the United States recorded their third consecutive day of outflows this year, as Bitcoin fell below $90,000 amid a broader market risk-off sentiment. As crypto.news reported , the 12 spot Bitcoin ETFs logged nearly $285 million in net outflows on Jan. 13, extending the outflow streak to three days, during which over $1 billion exited the funds.

According to an official release , Tether and its subsidiaries will be located in El Salvador after the company completes all formalities for the move. The stablecoin issuer will also establish its headquarters in the Central American country. Tether to Move to El Salvador Per Tether’s announcement, the latest decision is a step in its journey to foster global Bitcoin adoption. The move to El Salvador will strengthen its position in one of the world’s “most forward-thinking markets,” promoting innovation in the country. El Salvador was the first country to recognize Bitcoin as a legal tender and has since established innovative projects showing its support for the cryptocurrency. The country has a favorable regulatory environment and a budding Bitcoin-savvy community, especially with government programs teaching residents about Bitcoin. While Tether supports El Salvador’s vision for financial freedom, one highlight of its latest decision is the ability to expand its focus on emerging markets. The company says it will be strategically positioned to help shape the future of financial systems, not just in El Salvador but in the global landscape. “This decision is a natural progression for Tether as it allows us to build a new home, foster collaboration, and strengthen our focus on emerging markets,” Tether’s CEO Paolo Ardoino said. Past Collaborations With El Salvador It is worth mentioning that Tether and its subsidiaries have already begun and gotten involved in several projects in El Salvador. In 2023, the government of El Salvador collaborated with Tether to launch a citizenship program that offered a residency visa and a route to citizenship for individuals willing to invest $1 million in bitcoin (BTC) or Tether (USDT) in the country. Last year, Tether became a part of a $1 billion Bitcoin mining initiative in El Salvador, a project powered by the country’s volcanoes and seeking to foster sustainable digital asset mining. “El Salvador represents a beacon of innovation in the digital assets space. By rooting ourselves here, we are not only aligning with a country that shares our vision in terms of financial freedom, innovation, and resilience but is also reinforcing our commitment to empowering people worldwide through decentralized technologies,” Ardoino added.

Bitcoin (BTC) remains the top player, but altcoins are emerging as powerful contenders for impressive gains. Ethereum (ETH) and the rising BigBossInu are primed to deliver extraordinary returns. These top picks are expected to surge before the broader market enters a full-fledged rally. BigBossInu Presale Lights Up the Crypto Scene: Get in Early BigBossInu is blazing a trail in the crypto space, with its electrifying presale attracting widespread attention from investors. Offering the chance for high returns, early involvement is seen as a strategic move. With growing excitement, BigBossInu is positioned as a top pick. Its forward-thinking roadmap and game-changing features signal a powerful rise ahead. >>>>>> Solana (SOL) is showing strong upward momentum, currently trading around $192. With a 5% increase in the last 24 hours, SOL is experiencing significant buying pressure as indicated by its RSI, pushing the price higher. If SOL crosses the $195 resistance level, analysts suggest it could rally toward $220 and possibly $250. Polygon (MATIC) has seen a 3.7% increase, with recent spikes in on-chain activity. Despite the overall bearish market, MATIC’s network activity is picking up, signaling a possible reversal. Analysts are keeping an eye on a potential price resurgence driven by rising user engagement and decentralized application (dApp) activity. Injective (INJ) has reached a significant milestone, breaking above its April 2021 high of $25.30 and now trading around $21.1. Although the token is in overbought territory, buyers continue to push the price up, suggesting more gains ahead unless a short-term correction occurs​. >>> Sei (SEI) continues to experience rapid growth, with the network’s recent upgrades driving increased transaction activity. SEI’s price rose by 7.95%, supported by new features and developments like Sei v2, which blends the strengths of Solana and Ethereum. Its expanding ecosystem is also drawing attention in the DeFi space​. Conclusion As the crypto market gears up for a bull run, altcoins like BigBossInu, Solana, and Polygon are top picks for investors aiming for substantial returns by 2025. BigBossInu’s presale, Solana’s momentum, and Polygon’s network activity highlight strong growth potential. With the market primed for movement, positioning for gains now is crucial, but thorough research and risk management are essential in this volatile space.

Related Reading: Bitcoin To $350,000? Top Crypto Influencer Makes Bold Prediction Based on recent figures from Glassnode, net inflows for the week ending January 6 amounted to 17,567 BTC, equivalent to around $1.7 billion. This increase surpasses the weekly average inflows of 15,900 BTC documented in the final quarter of 2024 and indicates a resurgence of investor enthusiasm. A Turbulent Journey Of Inflows Inflows into Bitcoin ETFs have shown an erratic pattern. These inflows showed notable fluctuations in late 2024. In September, there was a significant decline as Bitcoin prices dropped below $64,000, leading to large withdrawals. Nevertheless, things began to change by October. Inflows increased dramatically; in few weeks, they topped 24,000 BTC. With the average weekly inflow settling at around 15,900 BTC, the increase continued into November and December, demonstrating the high demand for Bitcoin investments. After a slow start to the year, demand for US spot #Bitcoin ETFs has normalized. In the week of January 6, inflows reached 17,567 #BTC ($1.7B), which is slightly higher than the weekly average of 15.9K $BTC ($1.35B) from October to December 2024: https://t.co/0Cpfm8lpak pic.twitter.com/u4FksOSLuZ — glassnode (@glassnode) January 13, 2025 As the price of Bitcoin increased, so did ETF inflows. In December 2024, the most popular digital asset in the world reached a record-breaking high of $108,135. This association suggests that as more people switched to exchange-traded funds, investors’ confidence in Bitcoin’s worth grew, leading to a positive market sentiment. Bitcoin ETFs: Who Possesses The Most? The total holdings of US spot Bitcoin ETFs as of early January 2025 are approximately 1.13 million BTC. Grayscale has 204,300 BTC, Fidelity holds 205,488 BTC, and BlackRock has 559,673 BTC, making it the largest holding. In 2024, BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) garnered attention by accumulating $37.25 billion in assets during its inaugural year, securing the third position on the Top 20 ETF Leaderboard for that year. This significant surge highlights the rising institutional demand for cryptocurrency-backed financial solutions. Will 2025 Be A Good Year For ETFs? Bitcoin ETFs look like they will do well in 2025. Experts in the field think that this year there may be a lot of new, innovative offerings on the market. There will be at least 50 new bitcoin ETFs this year, according to Nate Geraci of the ETF Store. These will cover a wide range of strategies, such as covered call ETFs and Bitcoin-denominated equity ETFs. Furthermore, there is conjecture that Bitcoin spot ETFs may soon exceed physical gold ETFs in asset size. This would represent a pivotal advancement in the development of digital assets as conventional investment instruments. Such a change would highlight a rising confidence in Bitcoin as a valid store of value and investment tool, therefore challenging the long-held view of gold as the best hedge.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court declined Binance's appeal in a class-action lawsuit alleging unregistered securities sales. This is in addition to the exchange’s growing list of global legal troubles. Additionally, the US indicted three Russians for operating crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io, accusing them of laundering funds linked to cybercrimes. Robinhood Reaches $45 Million Settlement with the SEC Robinhood agreed to a $45 million settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after an investigation that uncovered violations of more than ten securities law provisions. The penalty affects Robinhood Securities LLC and Robinhood Financial LLC, both of which failed to meet a wide range of regulatory requirements. These included inaccuracies in reporting trading activity, non-compliance with short sale rules, delayed filing of suspicious activity reports, failure to maintain and preserve customer communications, and inadequate safeguarding of customer information. (Source: SEC ) The SEC's order was released on Jan. 13, and revealed that Robinhood entities admitted to certain findings, including the failure to preserve electronic communications from customers between 2020 and 2021. The company also submitted more than 11,849 Electronic Blue Sheets with errors or omissions, which caused it to misreport data for at least 392 million transactions. Additionally, Robinhood did not report suspicious activity quickly enough between January of 2020 and March of 2022 and failed to implement sufficient identity theft protection measures from April 2019 to July 2022. The regulator also pointed out Robinhood’s non-compliance with Regulation SHO, which addresses abusive short-selling practices, from December 2019 to May 2022. In 2021, a cybersecurity vulnerability also allowed unauthorized access to customer information involving millions of accounts. Both Robinhood Securities and Robinhood Financial admitted to specific findings in the SEC’s order and agreed to be censured. Robinhood Securities will pay $33.5 million, while Robinhood Financial will pay $11.5 million, with the total $45 million penalty due by Jan. 27. Robinhood’s stock (HOOD) was not impacted much by the settlement as shares only fell by about 1.22% to $39.59 on Jan. 13. Share prices also recovered slightly in after-hours trading. Robinhood Markets stock price (Source: Google Finance ) It is still unclear if Robinhood’s cryptocurrency business played a role in these violations. However, the company’s crypto division settled with California regulators last September for $3.9 million over allegations of restricting customer withdrawals between 2018 and 2022. In this case, Robinhood did not admit or deny wrongdoing. Despite its regulatory challenges, Robinhood’s crypto operations have seen a lot of growth. In the third quarter, its crypto trading volume increased by 112% year-on-year to $14.4 billion, while revenue from crypto trading surged by 165% to $61 million. Supreme Court Rejects Binance Appeal Other crypto companies are also currently budding heads with the law. The US Supreme Court recently declined to hear an appeal from Binance and its founder, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, in a class-action lawsuit that was filed by investors alleging the exchange sold unregistered tokens that subsequently lost value. On Jan. 13, the Supreme Court denied a petition to review a lower court ruling that determined US securities laws applied to Binance, even though the exchange lacks a physical headquarters in the United States. (Source: Supreme Court ) The lawsuit was initially filed in April of 2020 by Chase Williams on behalf of investors, and it claims Binance operated as an unregistered securities exchange or broker-dealer. A lower court ruled in March of 2023 that the case could proceed due to the fact that token purchases were finalized in the US and transactions occurred on US servers. Binance argued that the interconnected nature of global markets allowed Americans to trade on foreign exchanges without necessitating the application of US securities laws but failed to convince the courts. The decision by the Supreme Court allows the case to move forward, which only adds to Binance’s mounting legal troubles in the United States. Since mid-2023, the SEC accused Binance and Zhao of selling unregistered securities and illegally providing services to US citizens. Additionally, in November of 2023, Binance agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice over violations of money laundering and terrorism financing laws. Its legal challenges are not limited to the United States. Binance faces a class-action lawsuit in Canada for alleged securities law violations after its exit from the country in May 2023. In another case, the FTX bankruptcy estate is suing Binance and Zhao for $1.8 billion over claims of a fraudulent share deal in 2021. In August of 2024, Zhao and Binance were also sued over allegations of laundering stolen cryptocurrency. Zhao’s personal legal battles intensified in April 2024 when he pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering at Binance and failing to enforce proper Anti-Money Laundering controls. He was sentenced to four months in prison and was released in late September. US Indicts Russians Behind Crypto Mixers Blender and Sinbad The US Justice Department indicted three Russian nationals , Roman Vitalyevich Ostapenko, Alexander Evgenievich Oleynik, and Anton Vyachlavovich Tarasov, for money laundering related to their operation of crypto mixers Blender.io and Sinbad.io. A federal grand jury in the Northern District of Georgia charged the trio, and alleged their mixing services facilitated laundering funds that were stolen through ransomware, cryptocurrency thefts, and other crimes, according to US Attorney Ryan Buchanan. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brent Wible stated that the mixers made it possible for state-sponsored hackers and cybercriminals to profit from offenses that threatened public safety and national security. Blender.io was sanctioned by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in May of 2022 for its alleged role in laundering illicit proceeds from a crypto heist tied to North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Elliptic, a crypto analytics firm, reported that Blender likely rebranded as Sinbad.io in February 2023, which led the OFAC to sanction Sinbad in November of 2023. Authorities dismantled Sinbad.io later that year, but the investigation continued by focusing on identifying and prosecuting those responsible. Ostapenko and Oleynik were arrested in December 2024, while Tarasov is still at large. If convicted, the three face charges of conspiracy to commit money laundering and operating an unlicensed money-transmitting business. Their sentences could exceed 25 years. The enforcement actions against crypto mixers are part of broader efforts to address illicit financial activity in the crypto space. In addition to targeting Blender and Sinbad, US and international authorities have started cases against Tornado Cash. However, sanctions against Tornado Cash in August 2022 drew a lot of criticism from the crypto industry. Advocacy groups like Coin Center and Coinbase-backed individuals even challenged the sanctions in court . Legal proceedings are still ongoing for Tornado Cash co-founders, including Roman Storm. His US money laundering trial is set for April.

L’asset ha sfondato la barriera dei 2 dollari, superando le performance di molti altri asset. Il picco è stato raggiunto il 2 dicembre, quando XRP ha toccato i 2,71 dollari, ma da allora ha perso parte dello slancio. XRP ha continuato a registrare una certa volatilità, con episodi come il rapido crollo sotto i 2 dollari il 20 dicembre. Nonostante il forte slancio iniziale di novembre, il token non è riuscito a mantenere la spinta rialzista. Al momento sta scambiando al livello di 2,53 dollari, con un rialzo del 3,80% in 24 ore. Nel grafico settimanale rimane in positivo con un guadagno del 3,94%, mentre in quello mensile del 5,28%. Gli sviluppi previsti per questo mese potrebbero influenzare in modo decisivo l’andamento di XRP. Domani, 15 gennaio, la SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) presenterà la sua memoria di apertura nell’appello contro Ripple, un passaggio fondamentale per l’esito della battaglia legale. Inoltre, il 20 gennaio Donald Trump assumerà ufficialmente la presidenza degli Stati Uniti, mentre Gary Gensler, il tanto criticato presidente della SEC, lascerà il suo incarico per fare spazio a Paul Atkins, noto per la sua posizione favorevole alle criptovalute. Tutti questi fattori potrebbero avere un impatto notevole sulla traiettoria di XRP. Per capire come potrebbe evolversi nei prossimi giorni, abbiamo consultato l’algoritmo avanzato di PricePredictions , una piattaforma che analizza i movimenti del mercato crypto, per scoprire a che livello potrebbe arrivare XRP entro la fine del mese. L’AI prevede un rialzo per XRP L’algoritmo, tenendo conto di tutti gli sviluppi, prevede un trend rialzista per il token di Ripple. Secondo l’AI, l’asset potrebbe arrivare a 2,70 dollari entro la fine di gennaio. Si tratterebbe di un aumento di circa il 7% rispetto al prezzo attuale. Le previsioni si basano su un’analisi tecnica approfondita, che prende in considerazione diversi indicatori per valutare la forza delle tendenze in corso e determinare se l’asset sia in una fase di ipercomprato o ipervenduto. Tra questi strumenti, troviamo la divergenza della media mobile di convergenza (MACD), l’indice di forza relativa (RSI) e le bande di Bollinger (BB). Nel lungo termine, le previsioni sono ancora più ottimistiche: secondo l’intelligenza artificiale, XRP potrebbe superare la soglia dei 3 dollari a metà febbraio. Prevede anche una correzione nel breve termine, che potrebbe influenzare temporaneamente lo slancio rialzista. Anche diversi analisti prevedono un rialzo di XRP nei prossimi giorni. Ad esempio, il 12 gennaio Alan Santana ha condiviso la sua analisi, presentando un grafico di consolidamento che lo ha portato a ipotizzare un rally fino a 2,70 dollari, a condizione che si sviluppi uno slancio rialzista nel breve periodo. Ma l’analista è più ottimista rispetto all’intelligenza artificiale. Secondo Alan Santana, l’asset potrebbe proseguire lo slancio e raggiungere il livello di 2,90 dollari nelle prossime settimane. Anche l’esperto di trading The Great Mattsby ha rilasciato una previsione rialzista per XRP, stimando che l’asset potrebbe toccare a breve nuovi massimi storici (ATH) sopra la soglia dei 2,70 dollari. La sua analisi si basa sui ritracciamenti di Fibonacci, una tecnica ampiamente utilizzata per individuare i punti di inversione e le possibili nuove tendenze del mercato. Anche se le analisi tecniche prevedono un possibile rialzo per XRP, è cruciale considerare fattori esterni che potrebbero influenzare la sua traiettoria. Il recente dump di 690 milioni di dollari di XRP da parte di Ripple rappresenta un evento significativo che potrebbe innescare una pressione al ribasso nel breve termine, offuscando le previsioni degli esperti più ottimisti. Alternative a XRP Nel frattempo, mentre XRP continua a guadagnare slancio, molti investitori stanno diversificando i loro portafogli per cogliere nuove opportunità nel settore crypto. Progetti come Wall Street Pepe , attualmente in prevendita, stanno attirando molta attenzione. Wall Street Pepe sta costruendo una community esclusiva, denominata $WEPE Army, che offre ai titolari del token l’opportunità di accedere a segnali di trading, strategie vincenti e consulenze specializzate.

The altcoins are also in recovery mode, with ETH reclaiming $3,200, while DOGE has jumped by over 7% daily. BTC Bounces Off The primary cryptocurrency was in a freefall state since last Tuesday, when it peaked above $102,000. Its inability to sustain that level resulted in immediate retracements that pushed it south hard. Within 48 hours alone, it had lost over ten grand, but that was just the start. After a minor recovery last Friday and during the weekend, bitcoin headed straight south on Monday. This time, the bears were even more persistent, pushing BTC down to under $91,000 for the first time since late November and later to below $90,000. In fact, that crash took bitcoin down to a multi-month low of $89,200 (on Bitstamp). At this point, the bulls finally reminded of their presence and didn’t allow another breakdown that could have driven BTC to under $85,000. The cryptocurrency started to recover some ground rather rapidly and jumped to $95,000 earlier today. The bulls kept the pressure on and drove the asset to just under $97,000 as of now. Its market cap has risen to over $1.910 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts stands just shy of 55%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Turn Green The altcoins suffered even more during the past several days, but green now dominates the charts. Ethereum was among the poorest performers, dumping to under $3,000 yesterday for the first time in over two months. Now, though, the second-largest cryptocurrency stands close to $3,250. Even more impressive daily gains come from XRP, SOL, DOGE, ADA, SUI, LINK, HBAR, APT, and AAVE. The case with AAVE is particularly impressive as it has risen by over 11%. The cumulative market capitalization of all crypto assets has recovered $200 billion in a day and is up to $3.5 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Solana has emerged as a fierce rival of Ethereum thanks to its low transaction fees and high scalability. Investors are lining up to buy Solana, which has resulted in a price increase of over 300% in the last two months alone. It’s currently priced at $186.52. And this momentum should be amplified by the launch of ETFs. For fellow crypto traders and investors, we’ve shortlisted four of the best altcoins that are all set to benefit from Solana’s potential ETF launch. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana’s First-Ever Layer-2 Solution Solaxy ($SOLX) is designed to enhance liquidity, speed, and multi-chain interoperability on Solana. It benefits from the high-performance infrastructure of Solana, supporting seamless liquidity pools and fast swaps. This altcoin has raised an impressive $10M during presale, which reflects the strong confidence of investors in its vision. Currently priced at $0.0016, it offers a significant upside potential. As Solana continues to expand into institutional finance through its upcoming ETF, $SOLX is likely to ride this growth trajectory. Solana can process thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. This makes it a preferred choice for DeFi and enterprise applications. With $SOLX being integrated into this ecosystem, it’s positioned as a key player for investors looking for exposure to Solana. 2. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) – Empowers Retail Traders with Unique Market Insights Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) has captured the attention of crypto enthusiasts and influencers alike with its serious ambitions. This altcoin brings a fresh twist with its community-driven ecosystem that engages users with innovative features. The project powers several decentralized applications (dApps) and rewards users when they engage with its ecosystem. Furthermore, $WEPE investors will get unique market insights often reserved for whale investors. Simply put, it aims to even the playing field and empower the average Joe. $WEPE also boasts gamified staking options. As a holder, you can earn passive income while participating in its vibrant community activities. The presale has raised over $47M, which demonstrates the strong interest in its playful approach. As Solana ETFs move closer to approval, $WEPE is poised to gain further traction. It’s currently available at just $0.00036647, with prices set to increase in the next couple of days. 3. Bonk ($BONK) – Proven Performer to Get a Boost The first dog-themed coin on the Solana blockchain, $BONK, is revolutionizing the concept of community-driven cryptocurrencies. This altcoin was launched in December 2022 and carries the ethos ‘for the people, by the people.’ 50% of $BONK’s total supply has been airdropped to the Solana community. This strategic move significantly enhanced its visibility and led to a 34% rise in $SOL’s price in just 48 hours. $BONK was designed to bring back liquidity to the Solana-based DEXs. However, its broader mission is to create a full-fledged ecosystem where all participants have an equitable chance to contribute and benefit. The uniqueness of the project lies in its airdrop mechanism, which significantly rewarded collectors, developers, and artists across the Solana network. This initiative has increased trading activity, with Orca, Solana’s DEX, reporting a trading volume of $20M. $BONK had grown over 2,000% within a week by January 2023, which made it the top-performing crypto asset in terms of percentage return that year. Currently, the tokens have over 350 on-chain integrations from various verticals. As the launch date of Solana ETFs approaches, $BONK will ride the momentum, emerging as a key force in the Solana ecosystem. 4. Pudgy Penguins ($PENGU) – One of the Most Popular Meme Coins Pudgy Penguins is a meme coin inspired by the popular NFT project that shares the same name. Since its launch in late 2024, it has been gaining traction. This altcoin combines the playful essence of its NFT with Solana’s efficient blockchain infrastructure. Pudgy Penguins has established itself as a favorite among community-driven projects. Currently, it has a market cap of $2.06B , which reflects $PENGU’s rapid surge in popularity . Analysts also consider its influencer partnerships and the growing trend of Solana-based meme coins to be key drivers of this demand. $PENGU’s future largely hinges on market sentiment and how it engages with the Solana ecosystem. The launch of the Solana ETF is likely to further drive the momentum of this promising meme coin. Verdict – Where There’s Reward, There’s Risk While these 4 of the best altcoins are undoubtedly poised for massive returns, it’s always advisable to do your own research before investing your money into them or any other asset class for that matter. After all, the crypto market has its fair share of ups and downs, and you must be prepared for it all. Also, remember that none of the above is financial advice, so you need to DYOR before investing in cryptocurrencies.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|BONK,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-01-14 09:53:13

But this much is already clear: the convergence of web3 and artificial intelligence is happening at scale and it’s going to change everything – both onchain and off. From DePIN supplying the backbone for startups to access GPU compute to protocols tokenizing AI assets, the scope and diversity of innovation is breathtaking to behold. It’s also becoming extremely hard to keep pace with. To simplify matters, the following blockchain projects meet the criteria that denotes they’re not just using the right buzzwords – they’re also walking the walk. From Singularity Finance to OpenLedger, the following five are tackling the AIFi economy from different angles, but with the same broad goal: ensuring onchain AI achieves its full potential through unlocking new monetization opportunities. Here’s how they’re going about it. Singularity Finance: Tokenizing the AI Value Chain There’s a lot of buzz building around Singularity Finance , the EVM Layer 2 optimized for tokenizing key components of the AI ecosystem. Singularity addresses challenges such as liquidity and compliance, transforming AI compute, applications, and services into yield-bearing tokenized assets seamlessly integrated with DeFi. Singularity Finance is intent on accelerating development of new asset classes, such as AI compute tokens, empowering individuals and businesses to invest in AI infrastructure. The result is a dynamic marketplace for AI resources that enhances accessibility and fosters innovation within the sector. Currently on testnet , where devs can put Singularity Finance’s tech to the test, expectations are high for its mainnet launch and what this means for mainstreaming access to AiFI. VIRTUALS Protocol: Co-Ownership of AI Agents VIRTUALS Protocol is pioneering the use of AI agents in gaming and entertainment. It provides a decentralized co-ownership layer for AI agents, treating these autonomous, revenue-generating entities as productive assets. The agents are multimodal, capable of operating across diverse platforms like Roblox, TikTok, and Telegram games, with memory and functionality that persist across applications. AI agents created using VIRTUAL can plan, interact with environments, and manage onchain wallets. The use of vaults, meanwhile, ensures contributors to AI development are compensated fairly, with their work’s provenance recorded onchain. VIRTUALS also facilitates tokenized co-ownership of AI agents, making them accessible to a broader audience. Its plug-and-play approach simplifies the integration of AI agents into consumer applications, enabling businesses to harness the full potential of AI with minimal technical overhead. OpenLedger: Attributable AI Data. There are many blockchains for AI, but OpenLedger is adroitly targeted at where the greatest value add can be found: data, supplying the lifeblood for AI models and agents to flourish. OpenLedger unlocks the true potential of AI by leveraging blockchain’s ability to efficiently divert revenue streams, ensuring that data and IP owners are fairly remunerated. This way, developers can still access the models they need to train AIs, but without the copyright issues that have plagued centralized AI to date. OpenLedger is also particularly focused on AI agents, offering payable AI models that can support an array of agents for all kinds of use cases, from trading to gaming. The ability to create a custom agent using a model of your choice opens the door to all kinds of possibilities, with full data provenance providing proof that everything has been correctly attributed. NEAR Protocol: User-Owned AI NEAR Protocol may not have launched as an AI-centric chain, but since embracing the technology it’s demonstrated that it’s not just cashing in on the latest craze. There’s some real substance to be found and original ideas that position NEAR as one of the leading “pre-AI” chains that’s best suited to hosting this fast-growing onchain vertical. NEAR enables developers to build scalable AI applications while ensuring users maintain control over their data and AI interactions. It’s funding advancements in data collection, compute access, and monetization for AI applications and has established NEAR.AI R&D Lab, a dedicated research arm focused on creating AI tools for developing web3 applications directly from user intent. From a technical perspective, NEAR is also well equipped for the task at hand, its scalable architecture supporting the massive computational demands of AI. For example, TurboChain, the first AI-generated memecoin blockchain, was deployed on the Aurora Network , which is a prominent layer 2 on the NEAR protocol. The TURBO ecosystem began as a memecoin that was created from the ChatGPT prompt: “Create the next great meme coin, starting with a budget of just $69.” Injective: AI-Driven Blockchain Interactions With iAgent Injective is another general-purpose blockchain ecosystem whose architecture and business model makes it a natural fit for hosting AI applications. It’s recently launched iAgent, an AI-powered SDK that simplifies onchain interactions. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, iAgent allows users to execute tasks such as trading, checking balances, and sending payments through natural language commands. With a particular focus on crypto use cases for AI, iAgent continuously monitors markets, providing insights for informed decision-making, while its SDK uses machine learning to anticipate trends and enable strategic actions. Everyday language inputs make advanced functionalities accessible to non-technical users, enabling them to automate tasks like placing trades or transferring funds with speed and precision. With iAgent, Injective is democratizing blockchain usage by combining the power of AI with intuitive, user-friendly tools, opening new possibilities for both casual users and advanced traders. The Race to Monetize Onchain AI Tokenizing AI components allows individuals to invest in and benefit from the growing AI economy. In other words, everyone can capture the upside to the most transformative tech since the internet itself. For some individuals, that will mean acquiring tokens representing AI compute or stocks in AI companies. For others, it’ll mean leveraging the technology itself through creating agents to do their bidding. While there are hundreds of protocols now operating at the intersection of web3 and AI, the five profiled here have successfully combined superior tech with a sound business model. They’re not just riding the wave in other words: they are the wave, pushing the capabilities of onchain AI further up the beach with every innovation they launch. From tokenizing AI infrastructure to enabling decentralized ownership of AI agents, these projects are redefining how artificial intelligence operates in the web3 era.

33767162,[object Object],1736848821,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,El Salvador Welcomes Tether: USDT Completes Key Formalities For Relocation,https://bitcoinist.com/el-salvador-welcomes-tether-usdt/,"Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, announced on Monday its plans to relocate its headquarters to El Salvador. This decision follows the successful acquisition of a Digital Asset Service Provider (DASP) license, a critical milestone in Tether’s ongoing mission to bolster global Bitcoin adoption. Tether Eyes El Salvador For HQ In an interview with Reuters, Tether’s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, stated that the company’s management and co-founders would be moving to El Salvador, marking the first time Tether will establish a physical headquarters. Previously, the firm was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Ardoino emphasized that while the company is taking this significant step, it does not intend to relocate its entire staff of over 100 employees; most of the workforce will continue to operate remotely. The move comes amid a rapidly growing market for stablecoins, which has raised concerns among regulators about the potential risks these digital assets pose to the broader financial system. As outlined by Reuters, stablecoins serve as “a crucial bridge between the cryptocurrency space and traditional financial markets,” and their increasing reserves have caused unease among financial watchdogs. Tether has faced scrutiny regarding its reserves, particularly regarding transparency about where and in what form they are held. Ardoino noted that while the majority of Tether’s stablecoin reserves are backed by traditional currency held with Wall Street brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald, there are some liquidity holdings in other banks. This lack of full disclosure continues to be a point of contention among critics and regulators alike. The Emerging Crypto Hub When asked about the possibility of establishing headquarters in alternative locations, Ardoino mentioned that Tether currently lacks a license to operate within the European Union and has ruled out the United States for the time being. Ardoino also indicated that it is “quite premature” to speculate on potential regulatory changes under the next US administration , particularly with regard to former President Donald Trump, who has expressed intentions to create a more favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies. El Salvador’s interest in becoming a digital currency hub is noteworthy, especially since it was the first country to declare Bitcoin as legal tender, a decision made by President Nayib Bukele three years ago. Interestingly, the report highlights that Tether’s dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDT, accounts for approximately two-thirds of the total $212 billion worth of stablecoins in circulation, according to CoinGecko data. The overall stablecoin market has expanded by around 45% over the past year, underscoring the increasing demand for these digital assets amid a volatile wave for other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Bitcoin’s recent price action may have formed a “head and shoulders” formation, a classic indicator of a reversal from an uptrend to a downtrend, said Piotr Matys, senior forex analyst at Intouch Capital Markets. “A break below $91,600 is a strong technical bearish signal for Bitcoin,” Matys said. The bearish outlook was echoed by Alex Kuptsikevich, a senior market analyst, who predicted that Bitcoin’s next low could be around $88,000 if the negative sentiment continues. Kupikevich added that a sharper correction to $74,000 was on the cards.

He stated, “The rule is inconsistent with free market capitalism and oppressive in a society of self-determination.” Coinbase Secures Partial Win Against SEC The US Third Circuit Court ordered the SEC to reconsider providing clear guidelines on cryptocurrency regulation in Coinbase vs SEC lawsuit . In 2022, Coinbase filed a petition of rulemaking, asking the SEC to provide clarity on crypto regulation. While the exchange sought crypto-specific rules, including asset classification, the SEC rejected the petition. However, the recent court ruling ordered the regulator to explain its denial of the exchange’s motion. The judge opined: “Rather than force the agency to make a rule, we order it to explain its decision not to. Indeed, a rule may not prove necessary to solve the notice problems here; the agency could just state its position on crypto assets unequivocally.” Crypto Community Exalts Coinbase’s Win Coinbase’s Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal revealed the exchange’s victory via his X post, stating “We just won our petition for a writ of mandamus at the Third Circuit.” According to his statement, the court deemed the SEC’s move “arbitrary and capricious.” At the same time, Ripple CLO Stuart Alderoty applauded Coinbase and Grewal for their win over the regulatory agency. Meanwhile, lawyers including ex-SEC James Farrell and pro-XRP lawyer Fred Rispoli discuss how the lawsuit will pave the way for the SEC under incoming Chair Paul Atkins to work on crypto regulations and implications for other crypto lawsuits.

De koers is in een week tijd met 20% gedaald, maar is vandaag weer 3,4% omhoog geschoten naar $186,70. Kan Solana zijn belangrijke support rond $183 behouden of zal een rejection leiden tot een daling? In het geval dat Solana verder stijgt, kan hij uit een downtrend breken die sinds het eind van november speelt. Hiervoor zal SOL echter eerst opnieuw boven $200 moeten breken met een stijging van 7%. Solana herstelt van daling naar laagste niveau sinds 6 november Solana is gisteren zo laag gegaan als $170, het laagste niveau sinds 6 november. Op die dag schoot de crypto markt omhoog na de overwinning van Donald Trump. De scherpe daling liet zien dat Solana veel momentum heeft verloren. De de sterke support geeft juist aan dat nog niet alle hoop verloren is. Na toename van bearish druk leek een verdere daling voor Solana aan het begin van de week onvermijdelijk. In de onderstaande analyse is te zien dat Solana rond $165 een nieuwe accumulatie-zone heeft. De analist voorspelde hier een bounce, wat vandaag (tot zover) te zien is. #SOLUSDT 1H ANALYSIS Price for #SOLANA has reached a very critical decision point! If price cannot find recovery from the current zone to higher levels, then it is bound to go lower to find more buyers around 165$ support zone. Either way, with the current market conditions,… pic.twitter.com/gN8v9ivvIl — Crypto Master ( Futures/Spot ) (@master_binance) January 12, 2025 Maar zoals eerder gezegd, is de stijging van deze ochtend nog niet genoeg om uit de downtrend te breken die zich sinds november afspeelt. En door de stijging van $170 naar $187 zit de kans erin dat de koopdruk toeneemt vanuit short-term holders. Wat gaat Solana doen? De Solana koers is sinds het einde van november gedaald en bevindt zich voor het grootste deel van afgelopen twee maanden in een trading range die nu tussen $180 en $210 ligt. Het niveau rond $210 dient dan mogelijk als extra resistance, maar een stijging hierboven maakt een breakout boven de downtrend mogelijk. SOL heeft gisteren meerdere support levels getest, zoals de 200-daagse moving average (blauw) op $173 en de onderkant van de trading range op $180. Ondanks de bearish druk, lijkt het nog steeds lastig om de koers onder $170 te duwen, tenzij de crypto markt instort. De Relative Strength Index (RSI) van 42 geeft aan dat Solana weinig momentum heeft, wat het lastiger kan maken om door resistance levels te breken. De eerstvolgende resistance ligt op het huidige niveau van $188, gevolgd door de 30-daagse moving average (geel) van $197. Mogelijk zien we vandaag welke kant Solana opgaat. Een lichtpuntje is het feit dat we nog 6 dagen verwijderd zijn van de inauguratie van Donald Trump. Dit kan zorgen voor veel hype rondom crypto, waardoor SOL een extra duwtje in de rug kan krijgen. Alternatieven voor Solana De crypto markt lijkt voor nu weer op te fleuren. Zo is Bitcoin al 4% gestegen in de afgelopen 24 uur, na een doorbraak boven $96k in de ochtend. Dit is positief voor de hele markt, die over het algemeen beter presteert als het goed gaat met de grootste cryptomunt. Kleine cryptomunten die veel aandacht weten te trekken van investeerders, profiteren het meeste, want een kleinere influx van kapitaal kan zorgen voor grote stijgingen. Hieronder kijken we naar 3 opkomende crypto projecten met een lage market cap en potentie om veel te stijgen in de komende tijd. Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) Meme coins kunnen binnenkort ook een comeback maken. Een stijging van 7% voor Dogecoin hint erop dat investeerders nog niet hun vertrouwen hebben verloren. De nieuwe Wall Street Pepe ($WEPE) heeft ook veel aandacht gekregen van investeerders en met zijn presale al meer dan $47,7 miljoen opgehaald. Een mogelijke reden dat $WEPE een van de grootste presales is van de afgelopen periode is dat $WEPE een meme coin is die veel utility biedt. Token holders kunnen winst maken als $WEPE stijgt, maar krijgen ook toegang tot een exclusieve community met elite trading inzichten. The strength of Wepe is in every hand that holds it. 🐸 ⚔️ pic.twitter.com/Z8M3bsxTwf — Wall Street Pepe (@WEPEToken) January 13, 2025 Wall Street Pepe is nog voor een vaste lage prijs te koop van $0,00036647 per token, maar deze prijs stijgt in zo’n 24 uur. Vroege investeerders krijgen de mogelijkheid om hun tokens direct te staken, voor een APY van nog 27%. Nu naar Wall Street Pepe Solaxy ($SOLX) Solaxy ($SOLX) is wellicht het beste alternatief Solana, omdat het de allereerste Solana Layer-2 blockchain is. Niet alleen heeft dit concept veel hype opgewekt, ook heeft Solaxy een veel lagere market cap dan Solana. Dat terwijl het wel kan meeliften op het succes van de grote altcoin. Als Layer-2 profiteer je met Solaxy nog steeds van de lage transactiekosten en hoge snelheden, maar dan zonder de kans op storingen of mislukte transacties. Daarnaast is het mogelijk om met $SOLX te investeren in projecten die op de nieuwe blockchain gelanceerd worden. Als toegangssleutel tot de nieuwe blockchain, kan $SOLX erg waardevol worden. Daarom is de huidige presale prijs van $0,0016 mogelijk erg laag en is het niet gek dat de presale al $10 miljoen heeft opgehaald. Koop en stake $SOLX vandaag nog voor een APY van 343%. Nu naar Solaxy Best Wallet Token ($BEST) De Best Wallet Token ($BEST) presale is een unieke kans om de utility token van Best Wallet voor een vaste lage prijs te kopen. Deze token biedt in combinatie met deze crypto wallet unieke voordelen vergeleken met andere bekende wallets zoals Metamask en Phantom. Als token holder profiteer je van korting op handelingen binnen de app en vroegtijdige toegang tot nieuwe presales en launches. Verder krijg je exclusieve voordelen bij partners en hogere staking beloningen. Hierdoor kan de prijs van $BEST na de presale mogelijk veel hoger worden. Keep it up, king 👑 pic.twitter.com/kSqYs40qDI — Best Wallet (@BestWalletHQ) January 13, 2025 Na het ophalen van $7 miljoen in de presale, is de prijs van $BEST gestegen naar $0,0236.

According to a report by The Washington Post on Jan. 13, Trump is expected to prioritize executive orders addressing crypto de-banking and revising a controversial bank accounting policy. The anticipated orders include a repeal of a policy introduced under the Biden administration, requiring banks holding cryptocurrency to list the digital assets as liabilities. This policy stems from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s March 2022 Staff Accounting Bulletin, SAB 121, which has faced resistance from the crypto industry. Trump Team to Reverse SAB 121 The Trump team has reportedly emphasized the urgency of reversing these measures, with sources close to the discussions confirming their high priority. The crypto industry has long criticized the Biden administration for what it perceives as a targeted crackdown, often referred to as “Operation ChokePoint 2.0,” aimed at severing the sector’s access to financial services. Industry leaders have urged Trump to take decisive steps, including issuing crypto-related executive orders, within his first 100 days in office. Some insiders predict that at least one such order could be signed on his inauguration day. In addition to crypto-focused policies, Trump’s administration is expected to revisit other tech-related regulations. David Sack, Trump’s designated crypto and artificial intelligence advisor, recently signaled intentions to revoke Biden’s 2023 AI executive order. This order had been criticized by conservatives for its emphasis on advancing equity through AI technologies. *TRUMP TO ISSUE EXECUTIVE ORDERS RELATED TO CRYPTO ON DAY ONE @DavidSacks ready to roll. pic.twitter.com/ez1CDMeRd0 — Geiger Capital (@Geiger_Capital) January 13, 2025 Meanwhile, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen has reportedly been instrumental in shaping Trump’s incoming administration. Known for his investments in tech and crypto, Andreessen has been actively recruiting candidates for key positions, including roles in technology, defense, and intelligence. During his campaign, Trump pledged to bolster the U.S. crypto sector, promising a Bitcoin strategic reserve and reduced regulatory hurdles. New Hampshire and North Dakota Latest U.S. States to Propose Bitcoin Reserves New Hampshire and North Dakota have introduced legislation to establish strategic Bitcoin reserves, marking a growing trend among U.S. states to diversify their treasuries with cryptocurrency. Previously, Ohio proposed adding Bitcoin to its treasury reserves, following the introduction of a new bill by House Republican leader Derek Merrin. Likewise, on 12 December 2024, Texas Representative Giovanni Capriglione introduced the Texas Strategic Bitcoin Reserve Act, which proposes that the state comptroller hold Bitcoin as a reserve asset for at least five years. Pennsylvania took a similar step in November, with Representative Mike Cabell proposing a bill to allow its treasury to allocate up to 10% of its balance sheet in Bitcoin, citing the asset’s potential to hedge against economic uncertainty. Furthermore, corporate Bitcoin holders like MicroStrategy and Metaplanet have expanded their Bitcoin holdings.
