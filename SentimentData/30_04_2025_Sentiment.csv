As of April 29, both platforms are predicting that the US will log an economic contraction during the first quarter of 2025 in an upcoming economic data release. The US has logged positive growth figures every quarter since 2022, and a reversal in that trend could mark the start of a recession. The pessimistic outlook marks a stark sentiment shift for prediction markets, which had recently anticipated a positive US growth report. On April 29, consensus Q1 US growth estimates on Kalshi, a US derivatives exchange, plunged from around 0.5% to -0.4% in less than 24 hours. Meanwhile, Polymarket bettors are setting the odds of a US economic contraction in Q1 at around 70%. On April 28, they still had a mostly favorable outlook. The shift comes one day after Canada, America’s second-largest trading partner, elected Liberal Mark Carney as prime minister. Carney has vowed to take a more hawkish stance in Canada’s ongoing trade war with the US. Bettors on Kalshi now expect a negative US GDP print. Source: Kalshi Related: Analysts brace for Bitcoin slide on gloomy US manufacturing data The markets are pegged to the outcome of an April 30 report by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, which issues official measures of America’s gross domestic product (GDP). The report will provide the clearest view yet into the impact of US President Donald Trump’s controversial trade policies. Prediction markets work by letting users trade contracts tied to specific events, with prices fluctuating dynamically based on expected outcomes. In 2024, event contracts proved to be as reliable as traditional polling, forecasting not only Trump’s election win but also his party’s sweep of the US House and Senate. Polymarket’s US GDP growth wagers. Source: Polymarket Tariff turmoil On April 2, Trump announced plans to place sweeping tariffs on US imports. The president has since paused the rollout of tariffs on certain countries, but the prospect of a global trade war still looms. The macroeconomic uncertainty has already weighed on US economic data. In April, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Manufacturing Index — a monthly survey of 250 US-based manufacturers — reported the sharpest declines in activity since 2020 . Analysts said factories are bracing for the impact of Trump’s tariff plans, which could potentially raise production costs for manufacturers.

While activity cools on Ethereum (ETH), RCO Finance is gaining momentum, backed by a fresh $7.5 million from a top venture capital firm. Now entering its next development stage, RCO Finance is preparing to launch new features that could redefine how traders engage with the platform. This upcoming wave of features could give new investors a compelling reason to take notice. Why Ethereum’s Price Action Could Cause Uncertainty Over the last month, ETH dropped by 13.83% , falling to around $1,783. With the current price below its realized value of $2,002, many holders could be facing unrealized losses. This pattern often signals a period of sideways trading or further price drops, especially when Ethereum struggles to break through key resistance levels like $2,000. Some experts suggest that Ethereum (ETH) might be entering a consolidation phase similar to its 2022 market structure, marked by slow momentum and cautious accumulation. Although there has been some increase in long-term wallet inflows and a small bounce from the lows, the recovery has been slow. Most traders are buying the dips rather than showing strong bullish sentiment, which creates uncertainty in the market. While the market adjusts to Ethereum’s recent performance, RCO Finance is strengthening the market with innovative features, offering new opportunities that stand out in an unstable crypto market. What to Expect from RCO Finance’s New Features RCO Finance’s token presale has raised over $14.7 million so far, and this new capital injection signals strong institutional interest in the project. As more people join, RCOF’s price potential is expected to increase, and the project is already introducing new features that aim to reinforce its long-term stability and market position. The beta platform , for instance, lets traders access AI-driven strategies with its Robo Advisor. This tool helps maximize profits and reduce risks by offering personalized investment insights. RCO Finance also supports over 120,000 assets, covering both crypto and traditional markets. More updates are coming soon, like the AI-powered simulated trading feature, which will launch in Q2 2025. This feature will allow users to compare manual trades against AI strategies in a risk-free environment. Additionally, the Demo Trading Leaderboard will launch in Q2 2025, providing accurate updates on the top 50 traders. Other features are also being expanded. Calendar-based profit/loss tracking will be available by May 13, 2025, allowing users to track their performance over different periods. Crypto-funded demo trading, launching May 24, 2025, will allow users to start trading instantly with real crypto. CRM integration, launching May 7, 2025, will personalize user experiences and improve engagement. The RCOF project is working to offer more tools for traders, and with even more exciting updates to come, we may not have seen the best of RCOF just yet. Key Features That Make RCO Finance Stand Out The RCO Finance token has experienced impressive growth since the start of its presale, increasing from $0.01 to $0.13 per token. A massive 1,200% rise, and with the price expected to reach $0.15 in the next stage, early investors are anticipating potential gains of over 3,000% after the token is listed. The RCO Finance platform offers a set of core features designed to appeal to a wide range of investors and users, and one standout feature is the non-KYC model. This means that users who worry about privacy can get started without undergoing the usual identity verification process Another key feature is the AI-powered Robo Advisor. The Robo Advisor leverages advanced algorithms to spot profitable market opportunities. It is designed to help users make smarter investment decisions by analyzing market trends in real time, and can benefit both new and experienced investors. RCOF also prides itself on having undergone a thorough audit by SolidProof , a well-known name in the crypto security space. This audit ensures that the platform’s smart contracts are safe and secure, which should give users peace of mind when interacting with the platform. The project also offers staking and leverage features. Users can stake their tokens and earn passive income without needing to actively trade. The platform also provides leverage, which could enable users to amplify their investments and take advantage of greater market movements. Don’t Miss Out on RCO Finance’s Next Big Step RCO Finance is moving forward with new features that aim to change the way traders interact with the platform. With fresh backing from a top venture capital firm, the project could be set to scale to another stage. As Ethereum faces market changes, RCO Finance is stepping in with tools and updates that could provide real value to investors. Join RCO Finance today. Now could be the right time to explore the project and see how its upcoming features unfold.

This significant increase from merely 20% earlier this year reflects growing institutional confidence in Cardano’s ecosystem and future potential. On April 27, crypto analyst Nala shared a Polymarket screenshot highlighting Grayscale ‘s strategic repositioning towards Cardano. “Grayscale is accumulating more Cardano. The chances of an ADA ETF have jumped from 20% to 70%. Is the ADA ETF closer than we think?” She wrote. Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) has significantly expanded its ADA holdings to over $11 million, representing a calculated re-entry after previously reducing its exposure to the asset. This institutional accumulation, combined with notable whale activity, where major holders acquired over 180 million ADA tokens in March, indicates strong institutional conviction in Cardano’s long-term viability. That said, Cardano , distinguished by its academically driven research-based development approach and robust Web 3.0 infrastructure, continues to make significant advances in decentralized finance. A primary catalyst behind the ETF speculation is Cardano’s groundbreaking integration with BitcoinOS, a specialized Bitcoin smart contract platform that enables seamless Bitcoin DeFi operations without the need for traditional bridging mechanisms. Notably, this technical collaboration unlocks access to Bitcoin’s $1.3 trillion liquidity pool for Cardano’s ecosystem through advanced zero-knowledge cryptographic protocols, ensuring secure transactions without the need for intermediaries. This innovation will position Cardano as a frontrunner in cross-chain functionality, further cementing institutional interest in the platform. Meanwhile, ADA’s price trajectory has become a focal point of speculation, with several analysts projecting potential valuations around $3, representing a substantial appreciation from its current price of around $0.7054 According to analyst LucksideCrypto, ADA could be on the verge of a major price movement within the next 4–6 weeks, with potential gains of 20– 100% against Bitcoin. “These next four to six weeks could be very beneficial for ADA compared to the broader crypto market,” LucksideCrypto said on Monday, noting that several key market signals “ haven’t appeared in a very long time .” Central to the analyst’s thesis is the current state of Bitcoin dominance, which has been “straight up and to the right for a very long period” but now appears “very toppy” and potentially ready for a breakdown. The stochastic RSI indicator on the weekly chart displays similar patterns to those of previous periods, where Bitcoin dominance dropped from around 61% to 54%, potentially signaling a major shift into altcoins. The pundit specifically noted that ADA/BTC is currently “heavily oversold” on the weekly timeframe and is creating a bullish flip. According to him, this particular pattern has occurred approximately four times during the current bull market cycle, with each instance preceding ADA gains of 20-100% against Bitcoin within a 4–6-week timeframe.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-29 23:04:32

The exchange issued the clarification via its official wallet account on X (formerly Twitter) following growing complaints from users encountering failed, disappearing balances, and stalled transactions while interacting with Kamino Finance through Binance Wallet . Over the past days, multiple Binance Wallet users have raised concerns on social media about failed transactions when engaging with Kamino Finance, a decentralized protocol built on the Solana blockchain. The complaints range from unsuccessful token swaps to liquidity transactions that appear to hang or fail without refunds or visible confirmations. These reports prompted users to tag Binance Wallet’s official account in hopes of receiving technical support or intervention. However, Binance was quick to clarify its position. Translated post of Binance recommending that users direct questions about failed transactions to the Kamino Finance DEX. Source: Binance Wallet (X/Twitter) Binance wallet blames Kamino Finance In a direct reply to user complaints on April 29, Binance Wallet stated: “Hello, the reason in the screenshot is related to the underlying DEX. The failure rate of the KMNO token is relatively high. This problem needs to be solved by the underlying DEX.” Binance also mentioned in the statement that they are in touch with the Kamino Finance team, stating, “We have communicated with the underlying DEX, and the other party has confirmed the problem. We will continue to track this problem and optimize it in the future.” Kamino Finance, a Solana-based DeFi protocol known for offering lending, leverage and liquidity provisioning, has not yet publicly responded to the wave of user complaints on X or Binance’s claim that it’s responsible for the current issues plaguing users who run transactions with it via Binance’s platform. Kamino operates outside the control of centralized platforms like Binance. Community split on responsibility Reactions within the crypto community have been divided. Some users argued that Binance is getting it wrong, as it’s not about the success rate of Kamino Finance but that balances are disappearing after failed transactions. Another user , under whose initial post, Binance shared one of the posts clarifying its position on customers’ challenges, posted that the issue wasn’t unique to Kamino Finance transactions, stating that, “AERO also fails, so there is something wrong with AERO’s dex, right?” The user also highlighted that the response they got from Binance customer service was different from the statement Binance posted on X. According to the user, Binance customer service said, “Thank you for your patience while I learn about your concerns. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Regarding price volatility, unfortunately this is one of the risks you face when trading such products, it is a common situation in the cryptocurrency space and you must take these factors into account when developing your trading strategy. Thank you for your understanding.” Another user shared similar issues with Fartcoin while pointing out to Binance that the issues may be beyond Kamino Finance and more from Binance’s trading platform. While alpha traders are bringing up this current issue to Binance for resolution, the exchange continues to point accusing fingers at DeFi actors. Some of the conversations between Binance and the customers occurred in the Chinese language and were translated. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

A tidal wave of attention shifts toward crypto, that’s what. As traditional finance loses its shine, sharp early adopters are tuning into new-age blockchain projects that could reshape the future — not just Sonic’s DeFi revolution or SEI’s bullish technicals, but something even bigger brewing with Qubetics. Qubetics isn’t riding the crypto hype train — it’s building real solutions that are about to flip Web3 on its head. With its disruptive Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, Qubetics is stepping up where legacy chains stalled out. It’s no surprise the project’s Qubetics presale is already making waves among those hunting for the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now . Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet: The Gateway to True Web3 If blockchain wants to go mainstream, it needs tools real people can actually use. That’s where Qubetics comes charging in. The project’s Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet isn’t just another wallet — it’s an entire Web3 control center that lets anyone move, store, swap, and manage assets across dozens of blockchains without ever giving up custody or getting tangled up in bridges and swaps. Picture this: a freelance graphic designer in Austin who gets paid in USDT on Ethereum but wants to cash out into SOL on Solana without touching a centralized exchange. Or a small import-export business in Toronto needing to move stablecoins across Binance Smart Chain and Polygon to avoid heavy banking fees. Or a gamer in South Korea who wants to jump between Avalanche and SUI-based games without jumping through three layers of tech headaches. Qubetics makes all of that a simple, no-hassle, one-tap reality. This real-world usability is why early buyers are treating Qubetics as the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now. While others talk about interoperability and multi-chain dreams, Qubetics is handing it over on a silver platter — with privacy, speed, and complete ownership baked in. Qubetics Presale Numbers Are Getting Too Big to Ignore If there were ever a “last call” bell ringing in crypto right now, it would be the Qubetics presale. Each stage of the presale lasts exactly 7 days — and every Sunday at midnight, the price automatically jumps 10%. No hype tricks, no sudden rug pulls. Just steady, locked-in momentum. As of Stage 32, the $TICS token sits at $0.2093, with over $16.5 million raised, 510 million tokens sold, and a loyal crowd of more than 25,400 early adopters already on board. Now, let’s talk numbers because the upside here is bananas. Someone throwing $100 into the Qubetics presale today could be looking at a 377.76% return if $TICS hits $1. If it hits $5, that same $100 could balloon into $2,288.80. Hit $10 after mainnet launch in Q2 2025? That’s a clean $4,677.59. And if $TICS rockets to $15 — and plenty of analysts say it could — that original $100 turns into $7,066.39. This is why serious community members are jumping now instead of hesitating. Qubetics isn’t just offering a shiny token — it’s offering a way to actually join this crypto presale early and ride the asset tokenization wave that’s expected to dominate blockchain markets for the next decade. And for those scanning for the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now, Qubetics is flashing bright green. Sonic Is Redefining DeFi Standards with Its Breakthrough Model Sonic is buzzing hard right now after HTX Research dropped its latest report, calling it a model for the new DeFi paradigm. According to the research breakdown, Sonic brings together scalable DeFi architecture, sustainable liquidity mining, and dynamic yield generation — key ingredients missing from the first DeFi wave that exploded and imploded during the last bull cycle. HTX Research points out that Sonic’s emphasis on Layer 2 scalability solutions and dynamic on-chain incentives could make it the foundation for safer, more sustainable DeFi platforms moving forward. No more unsustainable APYs or runaway inflation models that doom protocols from the start. Sonic’s blueprint is aimed at making DeFi robust enough for serious long-term participation, not just quick flips. And while Sonic’s new approach is grabbing headlines, it’s clear the market is starting to prioritize real innovation over temporary yield farming fads. Projects like Sonic are rebuilding trust in decentralized finance, but it’s Qubetics, with its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, that could hand ordinary users the seamless Web3 experiences they’ve been waiting for. SEI Price Analysis Sparks Bullish Hopes of 600–800 Sats Rally SEI is riding high on a serious technical breakout that’s got crypto traders buzzing. According to blockchain.news, SEI’s price action has triggered a strong bullish divergence, with technical analysis suggesting a possible rally toward the 600–800 sats range if current momentum holds. That’s not just optimism — it’s based on specific key resistance breakouts and volume confirmations signaling a true shift in market sentiment. The report emphasizes how SEI’s resilient price action, even amid broader market chop, has drawn attention from both short-term traders and longer-term participants. The bullish pattern isn’t just about speculation either; it reflects deeper confidence in SEI’s underlying growth fundamentals and its positioning as a fast, efficient trading platform built for high-volume transactions. Still, while SEI’s technicals look great for momentum plays, the biggest opportunities often lie in fundamental shifts — like Qubetics leading the Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet evolution. That’s why those scouting for the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now are looking past just technical analysis and locking into projects driving real-world adoption. Conclusion: Qubetics, Sonic, and SEI Light Up the Crypto Watchlist for April 2025 The winds are changing fast in the blockchain world. With 12% of Americans ditching stocks and traditional markets feeling more uncertain than ever, smart community members are zeroing in on the projects that aren’t just hyped — but built to last. Sonic’s DeFi revamp is definitely exciting. SEI’s bullish surge points to renewed market confidence. But Qubetics? Qubetics is laying the foundation for the future of Web3 itself. With a world-class Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, a thriving Qubetics presale, real-world asset tokenization use cases, and explosive ROI projections, Qubetics is showing exactly why it’s the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now. For those who want to join this crypto presale before the next stage and price hike, the clock is ticking. And once $TICS takes off post-mainnet, this window won’t be open for long.

Job openings fell to 7.2 million in March versus the 7.5 million forecast and consumer confidence hit its lowest level since January 2021. If past patterns hold, Bitcoin could rally by mid-July and possibly reach $140,000 by October 2025. Macroeconomic conditions have long been seen as a major influence on cryptocurrency prices. Generally, Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins perform poorly when investors fear that employment and consumer data are weakening. According to a US Labor Department JOLTS report released on April 29, job openings in March approached their lowest levels in four years. US employers posted 7.2 million vacancies in March, below the 7.5 million that economists had forecast. Meanwhile, US consumer confidence fell for the fifth straight month in April, reaching its lowest point since January 2021. US Consumer Confidence (left) vs. Total non-farm US job openings (right). Source: TradingView/Cointelegraph Worsening conditions raise the chances that central banks will introduce economic stimulus measures, making the overall impact on cryptocurrency markets uncertain. Typically, the additional liquidity encourages investment in risk-on assets like Bitcoin, as more capital flows into the economy. Future expectations matter more than today’s weak economic data The last time the US experienced a drop in job openings and weakening consumer confidence was between January and June 2024. In the three months that followed, Bitcoin’s price moved between $53,000 and $66,000. Then, a 60% rally began in mid-October, pushing BTC above $100,000. The final result was positive, but it took more than 105 days for this effect to show in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin/USD, log scale. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Although these conditions may seem worrying at first, weaker labor and consumer sentiment are usually backward-looking. Financial markets and companies base their decisions on expectations for future economic growth, rather than just past data. Also, improved sentiment among crypto investors tends to come after there is some confirmation of better macroeconomic conditions. This explains why the 105-day lag is not unusual. Before 2024, a similar situation occurred between January and June 2023, with declines in both job market data and consumer confidence. The next four months were difficult, as Bitcoin’s price fell 18% to $25,000. It took 115 days for the price to recover to $30,500 by late October. However, the following two months were very positive, with BTC gaining 45% to reach $43,900. Bitcoin/USD in 2020, log scale. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph The last time in the past eight years when both the labor market and consumer confidence suffered significantly was between February 2020 and May 2020, right after the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdowns. This period saw Bitcoin briefly drop below $4,000 on March 13, 2020. As a result, a longer period of consolidation was expected before investors regained confidence in the crypto markets.

Looking back at the macroeconomic data, there was no major impact on Bitcoin between May 2020 and September 2020, as its price increased from $8,900 to $10,600, a 20% gain. However, the next 60 days brought an impressive 85% rally to $19,700. For the third time, weaker labor and consumer sentiment data seemed to come before a rally in Bitcoin prices. While the time between the lowest point of economic conditions and Bitcoin’s rally ranged from 105 to 130 days, the result was clear in all three cases. Therefore, if US job openings and consumer confidence improve from April 2025, it is likely that Bitcoin’s price will start to rise by mid-July. If history repeats itself, this could mean a minimum target of $140,000 by October 2025, but further positive macroeconomic data is needed to confirm this outlook.

Per the Russian Parliamentary Gazette , the plan is the brainchild of the Federal Financial Monitoring Service (Rosfinmonitoring). The agency is also working on the plan with the Russian Finance Ministry and the Central Bank. Russian AML Agency: Time to Criminalize Illegal Mining Rosfinmonitoring also wants to hit offenders with administrative liability. German Neglyad, the agency’s Deputy Director, said he told members of the Federation Council about the plans earlier this month. The council is Russia’s upper parliamentary house.

Nikolai Zhuravlev, the Federation Council’s Deputy Speaker, said that lawmakers needed to “stay ahead of the curve” if they want to “effectively eliminate the vulnerabilities of the modern financial system.” The Deputy Director of the Department of Financial Policy at the Ministry of Finance, Osman Kabaloev, has also said that legal amendments “are already being prepared.” Kabaloev said that the new legislation would help widen the range of punishments courts can hand out to illegal miners.

However, crypto mining in these areas is not yet punishable under the terms of the Russian criminal code. Irkutsk, Russia. (Source: Stas Serebrennikov) Instead, police can only charge illegal or quasi-legal miners with electricity theft or the improper use of subsidized power. This means, in most instances, courts do not have enough power to deliver jail terms or hefty fines. In some cases, illegal miners have simply been ordered to pay back the cost of the electricity they have “stolen” from local grids, in addition to legal costs. In the rest of the nation, Russians are free to mine crypto at home, so long as they do not use more than 6,000 kWh of energy per month. Any individual or firm using more than this amount must sign up to a national register managed by the Federal Tax Service. Rosfinmonitoring said that the new legislation would establish liability for those who fail to comply “with the established requirements for the circulation of cryptoassets.” The agency added that the new rules would cover “both administrative and criminal liability, differentiated depending on the severity of the crime.” Putin announces May 8-10 ceasefire, Ukraine wants truce now https://t.co/C15vlV9ZWW https://t.co/C15vlV9ZWW — Reuters (@Reuters) April 29, 2025 New Bans Incoming?

While blue-chip assets like XRP and Solana (SOL) continue to deliver steady growth, a rising group of analysts now believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform both by a significant margin by 2025. XRP: Institutional Growth, But Limited Room for Acceleration XRP is trading around $2.31 , posting a 10.06% gain over the past 7 days . Positive sentiment is fueled by continued adoption of Ripple’s cross-border payment infrastructure and growing institutional partnerships. Despite renewed interest, analysts caution that XRP’s large market capitalization, now at $135.57 billion , may limit its ability to deliver high-multiple returns relative to emerging projects. Resistance zones near $2.50 remain a key technical battleground, and while accumulation by whales suggests long-term confidence, major upside surges may require new, significant catalysts such as global regulatory clarity or expanded utility integrations. Solana: Strong Fundamentals, But Competition Is Rising Solana (SOL) trading at $148.69 records 7.99% gain in the last 7 days. The ever-expanding ecosystems in decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and gaming projects on Solana have led to the adoption of the digital asset. In the last 24 hours, there was a surge in volume by 64.13%. As a result, the rise in volume can be attributed to growing interest from investors on Solana. As reported by technical analysts, Solana is consolidating just below key psychological resistance at $150. As other Layer 1 networks get more competitive, future upside may become more incremental unless Solana can unlock fresh use cases or further scale without performance issues. The current bullish sentiment (with 85% of the community votes in favor of bullishness) supports a positive mid-term narrative. However, top analysts argue that Solana’s larger market position makes it less likely to deliver big, early-stage returns like smaller projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Under-the-Radar Asymmetric Play MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting the attention of tactical investors and fund managers scouring the market for the next strategic entry point before mainstream exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE, which trades under $0.01, has a scarcity-based tokenomics system with no centralized exchange dilution and is community-first. Analysts highlight several reasons why MAGACOIN FINANCE’s upside potential is seen as superior heading into 2025: Strategic Scarcity: Designed with deflationary mechanics that reward early holders and limit long-term token inflation. Early Positioning: Available exclusively through magacoinfinance.com, providing early investors with a rare first-mover advantage before any major listing events. Technical Momentum: Predictions suggest it may place among the leading ROI altcoins in Q3 of this year in terms of investing. This is clear from its early accumulation, coupled with some whales making strategic moves. Smart Money Interest: The smart money is getting in early, knowing that the biggest multiples often occur before exchange listings and institutions enter the market. While XRP and Solana continue to offer stability and ecosystem growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving a unique narrative centered around early-stage accessibility, high scarcity, and aggressive strategic expansion — key elements that historically drive the largest return cycles in crypto. Final Takeaway Investors prioritizing stability will likely continue to favor XRP and Solana. However, those seeking transformative upside are increasingly aligning with projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE — where early access, strategic scarcity, and tactical market positioning create a high-reward setup heading into 2025.

Despite facing stiff resistance near this zone, LINK continues to show strength amid a broader market rebound, holding steady while many other altcoins experience mixed performance. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows 4H Bearish Divergence – Can Bulls Hold $1,750? The asset is now up over 50% from its April lows, suggesting that bullish momentum is building beneath the surface. Market participants are closely watching for signs of a breakout, especially as the overall crypto market heats up and investors rotate capital back into high-potential altcoins. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Ali Martínez shared a technical chart indicating that the SuperTrend indicator has just flashed a buy signal on Chainlink’s daily chart. This indicator is often viewed as a reliable tool for identifying the start of new bullish phases or trend reversals. A confirmation of this signal could set the stage for further gains if bulls manage to clear the current resistance. As the market awaits clarity, LINK’s ability to hold its current level and potentially break higher may set the tone for its next significant move, possibly reigniting a long-awaited rally for the popular oracle protocol. Chainlink Eyes Breakout as Momentum Builds Chainlink has been range-bound between $10 and $16 since March, consolidating after a volatile start to the year. Despite the sideways action, market participants are increasingly focused on the potential for a breakout as LINK presses against its key resistance level around $16. A sustained move above this barrier could trigger a strong upside move, especially if accompanied by a broader altcoin rally. The current setup comes amid high-risk macroeconomic conditions. Global tensions continue to rise, particularly between the US and China, where escalating tariffs and trade disputes have sparked fears of a global recession. Such a backdrop adds a layer of caution to any bullish outlook, as risk assets remain vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. Nevertheless, optimism for Chainlink has grown after Ali Martínez pointed out that the SuperTrend indicator has flashed a buy signal on LINK’s daily chart. This technical tool is often used to detect early trend reversals or sustained shifts in market direction. When it appears after a prolonged consolidation, as it has now, it can signal that bullish momentum is about to accelerate. If bulls manage to reclaim and hold levels above $16, it could confirm a trend change and potentially send LINK surging toward new 2024 highs. Still, until the price breakouts, the range remains in play—and so does the risk of another rejection. Related Reading: Solana Forms Textbook Cup And Handle Pattern – Massive Breakout Ahead? LINK Price Analysis: Key Levels Chainlink is currently trading at $15.10, gradually climbing toward the critical $16 resistance level. This zone has acted as a ceiling throughout April and May, and bulls now face a pivotal test. Reclaiming and holding above $16 would not only break the multi-week range but also set the stage for a possible breakout if momentum continues to build. The technical picture highlights the importance of the 200-day moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), both clustered in the $16–$17 range. These trend indicators have served as dynamic resistance in recent months, and a clean push above them could confirm a bullish reversal and open the path toward higher targets. However, the structure remains fragile, and failure to maintain strength could put LINK at risk of a deeper pullback. If the $14 support level breaks, selling pressure may accelerate, potentially dragging the price toward lower demand zones around $12 or even $10. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims Local Range Against BTC – Can Bulls Target The Range High? As the broader market heats up and speculative appetite returns, LINK’s positioning around this key resistance will likely determine its short-term trend.

This news comes as a major relief to users and the broader community, demonstrating that even after a security breach, positive outcomes and user protection are possible. What Exactly Happened During the DeFi Hack? On April 26, 2024, the Loopscale protocol experienced a security incident that resulted in the unauthorized withdrawal of digital assets. The extent of the breach was significant, involving substantial amounts of cryptocurrency. Specifically, the attacker managed to siphon off 5,726,725 USDC and 1,211 SOL from the protocol’s vaults. This type of event, commonly referred to as a DeFi hack , highlights the inherent risks present in the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance, where smart contract vulnerabilities or other exploits can be targeted by malicious actors. Initial reports of the incident spread quickly across social media and crypto news platforms, causing concern among Loopscale users and observers of the Solana DeFi scene. The immediate aftermath of a DeFi hack is often characterized by uncertainty regarding the fate of the affected funds and the protocol’s future viability. How Did Loopscale Facilitate the Crypto Recovery? Unlike many incidents where stolen assets disappear into the labyrinth of blockchain anonymity, Loopscale pursued a different path: negotiation. The team confirmed via their official X (formerly Twitter) account that the full recovery was a result of successful negotiations with the party responsible for the exploit. While the specifics of these negotiations have not been fully disclosed – which is common practice in such sensitive situations to protect the integrity of the process – the outcome speaks for itself: the return of all stolen funds . This approach to crypto recovery through dialogue rather than solely relying on law enforcement or on-chain tracking efforts is becoming an increasingly discussed strategy in the crypto space. It often involves intermediaries or direct communication channels being established with the exploiter, sometimes offering a ‘white hat’ bounty or a promise not to pursue legal action in exchange for the return of funds. The success of Loopscale in retrieving 5,726,725 USDC and 1,211 SOL underscores the potential effectiveness of this method under specific circumstances. Key elements often involved in a negotiated crypto recovery include: Rapid identification of the exploit method and potentially the exploiter’s identity or wallet movements. Establishing a secure and anonymous communication channel. Proposing terms for the return of assets, which might include allowing the exploiter to keep a small percentage as a ‘bug bounty’. Verifying the return of funds before publicly confirming the resolution. Loopscale’s ability to navigate this complex process effectively is a testament to their commitment to their users and the resilience of the project, despite facing a significant DeFi hack . What Does This Mean for Loopscale Users and the Solana Protocol Ecosystem? The most critical outcome of this successful crypto recovery is the assurance that users of the Loopscale protocol will not suffer any financial loss from the incident. The return of the full amount of stolen funds means that the protocol is in a position to make affected users whole. This is a stark contrast to many other DeFi hack scenarios where users’ funds are permanently lost. For the broader Solana protocol ecosystem, this event serves as a valuable case study. While hacks are detrimental and highlight areas for improvement in security practices across all blockchains, a successful recovery story like Loopscale’s can help restore confidence. It demonstrates that the ecosystem is maturing and that protocols and the community are developing mechanisms, including negotiation and collaboration, to mitigate the impact of security breaches. Benefits highlighted by this event: User Confidence: Knowing that a protocol prioritizes recovery and succeeds in returning funds builds trust. Protocol Resilience: Successfully navigating a major security event proves the team’s capability to handle crises. Ecosystem Maturity: Developing effective post-hack response strategies benefits all protocols within the Solana ecosystem. Precedent Setting: This case might encourage other protocols and even attackers to consider negotiation as a path to resolution. Challenges that remain: Preventing the initial exploit is always the primary goal. Negotiations are not guaranteed to succeed and can be complex. Reputational damage, even with recovery, can be long-lasting. What Are the Next Steps for Loopscale? With the stolen funds now back in the protocol’s control, Loopscale is focusing on the final steps of resolution. Their announcement mentioned that they are finalizing the process and will provide further updates. A key upcoming step involves detailing how users can withdraw funds from the affected vaults. Users who had assets deposited in the vaults impacted by the DeFi hack will be keenly awaiting these instructions to regain access to their capital. Actionable insights for users: Stay informed by following Loopscale’s official communication channels (like their X account) for updates on vault withdrawals. Exercise patience as the team finalizes the technical and logistical aspects of returning funds. Review your own security practices, even when using reputable protocols, such as enabling two-factor authentication where possible and being wary of phishing attempts. The successful crypto recovery by Loopscale is a positive sign, but it also serves as a reminder of the dynamic risk landscape in DeFi. Protocols on the Solana protocol and other chains continue to innovate rapidly, and security must remain a paramount concern. Lessons Learned from the Loopscale Incident The Loopscale DeFi hack and subsequent crypto recovery offer several important lessons for both protocols and users in the decentralized finance space: Rapid Response is Crucial: Loopscale’s quick communication and apparent swift action to engage with the exploiter were likely key factors in the successful negotiation. Negotiation as a Tool: While controversial to some, negotiating with attackers can, in certain circumstances, be an effective way to recover stolen funds and protect users, especially when on-chain enforcement is difficult. User Safety First: Loopscale’s commitment to ensuring users incur no loss sets a high standard for how protocols should handle security incidents. Continuous Security Audits: This incident, like many others, underscores the absolute necessity for rigorous, ongoing security audits of smart contracts and protocol infrastructure to prevent future DeFi hack attempts. Community Communication: Transparent and timely updates, even when details are scarce, help manage user expectations and maintain trust during a crisis. The fact that a Solana protocol was able to achieve a full crypto recovery after a significant DeFi hack provides a glimmer of hope in an area often plagued by permanent losses. It reinforces the idea that while the technology is cutting-edge, the human element – in terms of both security practices and crisis management – remains vital. Conclusion: A Positive Turn for Loopscale and DeFi Recovery The news from Loopscale is undeniably positive. The successful negotiation leading to the return of all 5,726,725 USDC and 1,211 SOL in stolen funds is a significant achievement. It means that the users affected by the April 26th DeFi hack on the Solana protocol will be made whole, avoiding the financial pain typically associated with such exploits. As Loopscale works towards finalizing the resolution and enabling vault withdrawals, the focus shifts to rebuilding confidence and strengthening security measures to prevent future incidents. This event serves as a powerful example of successful crypto recovery and offers valuable insights into potential strategies for mitigating the impact of security breaches in the fast-paced world of decentralized finance.

As the industry continues shifting, Nexo appears to be adapting by exploring new marketing strategies, business verticals, and client engagement methods. One of these, and perhaps a more exciting one for the broader audience is through sports partnerships. Strategic Sponsorships to Build Relevance Nexo has recently started to explore partnerships in the sports world, with a focus on tennis. Their first involvement came through a sponsorship at the tennis tournament held in Acapulco, but further plans are underway. According to Stalimirov, this move isn’t just about visibility, but about aligning with a target audience. “Our audience are people who are more interested into, I would say, affluent sports,” he said. “But we’re not excluding any opportunity that might be invited to the table.” The goal is to bring the brand closer to its users, not just through financial services, but by participating in areas their clientele already engages with. “We want to be not just a service provider, but also a relatable brand,” Stalimirov explained. He emphasized that Nexo is responding to client feedback in its pursuit of brand awareness, saying, “We want to be closer to them in every way possible.” From Exchange to Ecosystem With a recent rebranding and a growth plan in the works, Nexo is positioning itself as more than a traditional exchange. The company is working on expanding its offering to include a broader set of financial products, particularly in the field of digital assets. “We’re surely going to expand in terms of types of products and ways for our clients to diversify their portfolios,” Stalimirov said. He noted that clients are not coming to Nexo simply to trade. They’re looking for a broader, more integrated financial experience. “You can exchange from Nexo, but that’s not why you’re coming,” he said. “If you’re looking purely for an exchange, there are quite a bit of exchanges out there.” The company’s direction appears to emphasize client-centric development. Plans include new B2B solutions and international brand campaigns intended to build awareness and drive engagement with new audiences. Navigating Challenges in a Shifting Landscape Like many in the digital finance space, Nexo is navigating a rapidly evolving regulatory and market environment. Compliance is non-negotiable, but so is maintaining a appropriate client experience. “You have to be compliant for sure, but you have to do it in the swiftest way possible and in the best way from a consumer standpoint,” said Stalimirov.

This week, Meta is hosting its first-ever LlamaCon AI developer conference. The goal? To convince AI Developers to build their next big applications using Meta’s open Llama Models . Why LlamaCon Matters for Meta AI Just a year ago, pitching developers on Llama was straightforward. Meta’s Llama 3 family, especially the Llama 3.1 405B model, was seen as a top performer among openly available models, even rivaling models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o at the time. This success made Meta a favorite among AI Developers , offering strong performance with the flexibility of open models. However, recent months have seen Meta struggle to maintain this lead. Competition from both ‘open’ labs like DeepSeek and commercial giants like OpenAI has intensified. LlamaCon is a critical moment for Meta to demonstrate its commitment and capabilities in building a robust Llama ecosystem. Challenges Facing Llama Models Today The reception to the recent Llama 4 family has been notably different from Llama 3. Jeff Boudier from Hugging Face noted that Llama 3.3 is still downloaded more often than Llama 4. What happened? Underwhelming Performance: Llama 4’s benchmark scores came in below some competitor models, including DeepSeek’s R1 and V3. This was a shift from Llama’s previous position at the forefront. Benchmarking Controversy: A specific version of Llama 4 Maverick optimized for conversationality performed well on the LM Arena benchmark but was never broadly released. The released version performed worse. This incident led to concerns about transparency and impacted developer trust. Ion Stoica, an LM Arena co-founder, highlighted this loss of trust, stating Meta needed to be clearer. Missing Reasoning Model: The Llama 4 release lacked a dedicated reasoning model, a type of AI model that works through questions carefully and often performs better on specific tasks. Many competitors have released such models, making Meta’s omission noticeable. Nathan Lambert, a researcher at Ai2, suggested this might indicate the Llama 4 launch was rushed. These issues have created pressure on Meta, especially as rival Open AI Models from labs like Alibaba (with their Qwen 3 family) are showing strong performance on various benchmarks. Winning Over AI Developers: What Meta Needs to Do To regain its position and strengthen the Llama Models ecosystem, Meta needs to deliver superior models. Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, an AI researcher at NYU, suggests this might require taking more technical risks and exploring new techniques. LlamaCon is Meta’s opportunity to address the recent setbacks and showcase upcoming advancements. The company needs to demonstrate that it can still produce boundary-pushing models that compete with the best from OpenAI, Google, xAI, and others. Winning back the trust and excitement of AI Developers is paramount for the future growth of the Llama platform. The Path Forward for Meta AI The conference provides a platform for Meta to communicate its roadmap, explain the Llama 4 decisions, and generate enthusiasm for future releases. Success at LlamaCon is not just about showcasing technology; it’s about rebuilding relationships and demonstrating that Meta is committed to leading in the open AI space. If Meta fails to deliver compelling updates and rebuild trust, it risks falling further behind in this highly competitive field.

""We're exploring the introduction of a utility token within a Truth digital wallet that can initially be used to pay for Truth+ subscription costs, and later be applied to other products and services in the Truth ecosphere,"" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes wrote in an April 29 letter to shareholders. He added that the crypto token and wallet would be part of a rewards program that Trump Media is exploring across its services, which include the social media platform Truth Social and the financial services platform Truth.Fi. Trump Media first signaled plans for a potential crypto payments venture last November when it filed a trademark application with the US Patent and Trademark Office for computer software designed to function as a digital wallet, enable digital asset trading and process crypto payments on Truth.Fi. Source: Cointelegraph Truth+ launched in October, offering movies and shows mainly targeting a politically conservative audience. Trump Media signed a binding agreement with the crypto exchange Crypto.com and asset manager Yorkville America Digital to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that will include crypto and stocks “with a Made in America focus” to launch on Truth.Fi. The company said in January that it plans to invest up to $250 million of its cash reserves into a range of financial products, including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other crypto tokens or crypto-related securities, which would be custodied by asset manager Charles Schwab . More potential for conflict of interest The launch of a Trump Media utility token would only heighten concerns about the president’s crypto-related ventures potentially conflicting with his duties. Trump, however, transferred his 59% stake into a trust last December. Related: Trump’s first 100 days ‘worst in history’ despite crypto promises Trump has also been criticized for backing the crypto platform World Liberty Financial , where he’s named the firm’s “Chief Crypto Advocate” and draws a portion of its profits. Some senators have raised concerns that Trump’s influence on policy could benefit World Liberty, which is 60% owned by the Trump family. Trump also received backlash for the controversial launch of his memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), on Jan. 18 — just two days before he re-entered the White House.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 245,200 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks “a dip is going to come soon,” but he doesn’t see any reason to be super bearish once the correction takes place. According to the analyst, a correction should provide an opportunity for investors to enter the crypto market before another leg up. Should a marketwide pullback materialize, Altcoin Sherpa says he plans to accumulate five altcoins. “Coins I want to buy: BONK ($0.00001600s) Fartcoin ($0.85) POPCAT ($0.33) HYPE ($15-$16s) GUN ($0.055s) Loads of others too, but those are on my short list for now.” Looking closer at the memecoin Fartcoin, the trader notes that FART needs to stay above $1.05 to witness new rallies. Otherwise, he thinks the altcoin could fall to as low as $0.8. “Fartcoin: wouldn’t be surprised to see this pullback a little bit here, but don’t forget that hot air rises in the end. Three different scenarios, all mostly dependent on BTC, frankly. I think this just continues up.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that FART can rally to as high as $1.40. At time of writing, FART is worth $1.09. Turning to fellow memecoin Bonk ( BONK ), Altcoin Sherpa thinks that the altcoin looks really strong. “The chart itself still looks fire.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, BONK is trading for $0.00002, up over 10% on the day.

This drive for innovation is particularly relevant to anyone following the digital landscape, including those in the cryptocurrency space who understand the value of technological advancement and data control. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has made a significant move by launching its own Meta AI as a standalone application, stepping directly into the ring with established players like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. What is Meta’s New Standalone AI App? Building upon its strategy of integrating AI across its popular platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger, Meta has now introduced a dedicated application for its AI Assistant . Unveiled during the LlamaCon event, this move allows users to access Meta AI capabilities outside the confines of Meta’s social media ecosystem, much like users access other AI assistants via their dedicated apps. The creation of a Standalone AI App signals Meta’s ambition to be a central hub for AI interaction. While the integrated AI is convenient within its existing apps, a standalone version suggests Meta wants AI to be a primary tool for users, available whenever and wherever they need it, regardless of whether they are actively using a Meta social product. How Does Meta AI Leverage User Data for Personalization? One of the key differentiators Meta is highlighting for its Generative AI assistant is its ability to offer personalized responses. Unlike many general-purpose AI models, Meta AI can potentially draw on information users have already shared across Meta’s products. The company states the AI can “[draw] on information you’ve already chosen to share on Meta products,” such as your profile details and the content you engage with. This approach aims to make the AI’s responses more relevant and tailored to the individual user. For example, if you frequently interact with content about hiking on Instagram, the AI might incorporate this interest into suggestions or conversations. Furthermore, users have the option to explicitly provide Meta AI with information to remember for future interactions. Telling the AI you have a specific dietary restriction, for instance, could influence its recommendations for activities or dining, making the interaction feel more personal and helpful. Initially, these personalized features are available in the US and Canada. Addressing Data Privacy Concerns with Meta AI The ability of Meta AI to leverage user data, while potentially enhancing personalization, also brings inherent Data Privacy considerations to the forefront. Meta’s business model heavily relies on targeted advertising powered by vast amounts of user data collected across its platforms. When users interact with the standalone AI app, they are sharing information directly with a company whose core revenue stream is data monetization. Users should be mindful of how the data shared with the AI chatbot might be used. While Meta states the AI draws on information users have “chosen to share,” the context of sharing data with an AI for personalized responses adds another layer to the ongoing discussion about user data ownership, transparency, and control. This is a particularly sensitive topic for those interested in decentralized technologies like cryptocurrency, which often emphasize user sovereignty and control over personal information. Exploring Features: The Discover Feed and Social Sharing Beyond its core function as an AI Assistant , Meta’s new standalone app includes a ‘Discover’ feed. This feature allows users to share examples of how they are using the AI with their friends. A mockup image provided by Meta shows a user asking the AI to describe them using three emojis and then sharing the result to this feed. Importantly, sharing interactions to the Discover feed is entirely opt-in. Users retain control over whether their conversations or AI-generated content are made public within the app’s social component. This feed could potentially amplify certain trends in Generative AI usage, mirroring how trends spread on social media platforms. However, the inclusion of a social feed in an AI utility app has also drawn comparisons to other apps that have controversially added social features, raising questions about whether such a feature is necessary or beneficial for a productivity/utility tool. Conclusion: A New Front in the AI Race Meta’s launch of a dedicated Standalone AI App marks a significant escalation in the competition among tech giants in the artificial intelligence space. By positioning Meta AI as a direct competitor to services like ChatGPT and leveraging its extensive user data for personalization, Meta is attempting to carve out a unique niche. While the promise of a highly personalized AI Assistant is appealing, the implications for Data Privacy remain a critical point of discussion, especially given Meta’s history and business model. The inclusion of social features like the Discover feed also adds an interesting, albeit potentially debated, dimension to the app’s design. As the landscape of Generative AI continues to evolve, Meta’s bold move demonstrates the increasing importance companies place on making AI accessible and integrated into users’ daily digital lives.

A significant development grabbing attention is the recent funding round for Unto Labs , a San Francisco-based startup co-founded by former Jump Crypto engineer Liam Heeger and Will Yoo. They’ve successfully raised a substantial $14.4 million, setting the stage for an ambitious project: building a new blockchain from the ground up. This investment signals strong confidence from major players in the crypto space and highlights the ongoing drive for more accessible and efficient blockchain infrastructure. Unto Labs Secures Significant Crypto Funding The $14.4 million funding round for Unto Labs was notably led by prominent venture capital firms Framework Ventures and Electric Capital. These firms are well-respected in the blockchain ecosystem, known for backing promising technologies and protocols. The investment values Unto Labs at an impressive $140 million, underscoring the potential investors see in the team and their vision for a new blockchain . This significant capital injection provides Unto Labs with the resources needed to accelerate development and bring their innovative ideas to fruition. Securing substantial crypto funding is a critical milestone for any startup in this competitive landscape. It allows Unto Labs to move beyond initial concepts and into serious execution. The backing from Framework Ventures and Electric Capital also brings valuable expertise and network effects, which can be crucial for navigating the complexities of launching a new Layer 1 or Layer 2 protocol. Building a New Blockchain: What’s the Vision? Unto Labs isn’t just tweaking an existing chain; they are embarking on the challenging but potentially rewarding path of building a fundamentally new blockchain . The core motivation behind this endeavor is to address some of the limitations and complexities faced by current blockchain platforms. While existing chains like Ethereum, Solana, and others have paved the way, they often present hurdles for developers, particularly those coming from traditional software backgrounds who are not deeply familiar with crypto-native languages or execution environments. The vision is to create a platform that lowers the barrier to entry for a wider pool of developers, thereby fostering greater innovation and adoption. A new blockchain designed with accessibility in mind could unlock a wave of new applications and use cases that are currently difficult or impossible to build efficiently on existing infrastructure. This focus on developer experience is a recurring theme in the evolution of blockchain technology, as the industry strives for mainstream utility. Introducing ThruVM: A Game-Changing Virtual Machine At the heart of Unto Labs’ new blockchain lies a key innovation: a new virtual machine called ThruVM . A virtual machine (VM) is essentially the engine of a blockchain, responsible for executing smart contracts and processing transactions. The most well-known example is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which powers Ethereum and many other compatible chains. However, VMs like the EVM have their own characteristics and limitations that can impact performance, cost, and developer experience. ThruVM aims to offer an alternative, designed with different principles to potentially achieve better performance, flexibility, or developer friendliness. The choice of VM is a foundational decision for any blockchain, as it dictates how code runs and interacts within the network. A novel VM like ThruVM suggests that Unto Labs is taking a fresh approach to blockchain computation, potentially enabling new types of applications or improving the efficiency of existing ones. Why RISC-V Architecture for a Blockchain? One of the most intriguing aspects of ThruVM is its foundation on the RISC-V blockchain architecture. RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) – essentially, the language that a computer processor understands. Unlike proprietary ISAs like x86 (used in most PCs) or ARM (common in mobile phones), RISC-V is open-source, allowing anyone to design, manufacture, and sell RISC-V chips and software without paying licensing fees. Building a virtual machine like ThruVM on RISC-V blockchain architecture offers several potential advantages in the context of blockchain: Openness and Flexibility: The open nature of RISC-V allows for greater transparency and customization of the VM’s underlying instruction set, potentially tailoring it specifically for blockchain workloads. Efficiency: RISC-V is designed to be simple and modular, which can lead to more efficient hardware and software implementations. This could translate to faster or cheaper transaction processing on the blockchain. Accessibility for Developers: By leveraging a more standard, open architecture, Unto Labs might make it easier for developers familiar with traditional computing concepts to build for their blockchain, rather than requiring them to learn entirely new, crypto-specific paradigms. This directly ties into their goal of improving accessibility for non-crypto native developers. Long-term Viability: As an open standard with growing industry adoption, RISC-V offers a strong foundation for long-term development and support, reducing reliance on a single vendor or proprietary technology. The decision to use RISC-V blockchain architecture for ThruVM is a strategic one that differentiates Unto Labs’ approach and could be key to achieving their goals of performance and developer accessibility. Unto Labs’ Strategic Growth Plans With the significant crypto funding secured, Unto Labs is now focused on scaling its operations. A primary use of the $14.4 million is to expand the team. According to reports, the company aims to double its workforce by the end of the year. This expansion is crucial for accelerating the development of the new blockchain and ThruVM , building out the necessary infrastructure, and fostering a developer ecosystem. Hiring top talent in blockchain development, cryptography, and distributed systems is essential for the success of such an ambitious project. Doubling the team size indicates a rapid scaling phase, moving from a smaller core group to a larger organization capable of handling the complexities of launching and maintaining a new network. This growth plan is a direct consequence of the successful crypto funding round and a necessary step towards realizing their vision. What This Funding Means for the Future The $14.4 million raised by Unto Labs is more than just capital; it’s a vote of confidence in their approach to building a new blockchain centered around ThruVM and the RISC-V blockchain architecture. For the broader crypto ecosystem, this development signifies the continued pursuit of better foundational technology. If Unto Labs succeeds in creating a highly accessible and performant blockchain using ThruVM , it could attract a significant number of developers who have previously found the learning curve for blockchain development too steep. Attracting non-crypto native developers is often cited as a key factor for achieving mass adoption of blockchain technology. By making it easier for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps), Unto Labs could potentially contribute to a new wave of innovation and utility within the space. The success of their new blockchain will ultimately depend on execution, the developer tools they provide, and the network effects they can build, but this initial crypto funding provides a strong launchpad. Challenges remain, of course. Building a new blockchain from scratch is complex and faces competition from established players and other emerging networks. However, the focus on developer accessibility and the novel approach with ThruVM and RISC-V blockchain architecture position Unto Labs as an interesting project to watch in the evolving landscape of blockchain infrastructure. Conclusion Unto Labs has made a significant splash with its $14.4 million crypto funding round, backed by heavyweights like Framework Ventures and Electric Capital. This capital infusion empowers the San Francisco startup to pursue its ambitious goal of building a new blockchain featuring the innovative ThruVM , built on RISC-V blockchain architecture. Their focus on improving accessibility for non-crypto native developers through this novel technical approach is a key differentiator and could unlock new potential for decentralized applications. As they double their team and push forward with development, the industry will be watching closely to see how Unto Labs’ vision takes shape and contributes to the future of blockchain technology.

Recently, analysts from the American investment bank turned their attention to the world of cryptocurrency trading on popular platforms, specifically focusing on Robinhood crypto trading . Their forecast paints a picture of cooling activity for the first quarter of the year, predicting a notable decrease in revenue generated from digital asset trades compared to the previous quarter. Understanding the JPMorgan Forecast for Robinhood The core of the recent analysis from JPMorgan revolves around anticipated trading activity on the Robinhood platform. According to their projections, the total crypto trading volume handled by Robinhood in the first quarter of the current year is expected to land somewhere around $52 billion. While this is still a substantial figure, it represents a significant step down from the $71 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of last year (Q4 2023). This predicted drop of approximately $19 billion in quarterly trading volume directly impacts Robinhood’s potential earnings. Since platforms like Robinhood primarily generate revenue from transaction fees associated with trading volume, a decrease in activity naturally leads to a projected decrease in Q1 crypto revenue . The scale of this forecast suggests a considerable shift in user behavior or market conditions impacting the platform. Here’s a quick comparison based on the JPMorgan forecast: Metric Q4 2023 (Actual) Q1 2024 (JPMorgan Forecast) Change Crypto Trading Volume ~$71 billion ~$52 billion ↓ ~$19 billion Implied Revenue Trend Higher Lower Negative This table clearly illustrates the magnitude of the expected decline as highlighted by the JPMorgan forecast . Why the Expected Drop in Crypto Trading Volume? JPMorgan analysts didn’t just provide numbers; they also offered insight into the potential reasons behind this expected slowdown in Robinhood crypto trading . They noted that while there was an initial upward trend in cryptocurrency activity at the beginning of the year, this momentum was reportedly ‘offset by the risk aversion that has spread in the market in recent months’. Understanding ‘risk aversion’ is key here. In financial terms, risk aversion refers to investors’ tendency to prefer lower-risk investments over higher-risk ones, even if the latter might offer potentially higher returns. The cryptocurrency market is widely considered a high-risk, high-reward environment. When overall market sentiment shifts towards caution, investors tend to reduce their exposure to volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Several factors can contribute to increased risk aversion: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Concerns about inflation, interest rates, or potential economic slowdowns can make investors more cautious. Regulatory Developments: Increased scrutiny or uncertain regulations around crypto in major markets can dampen enthusiasm. Price Volatility: Sharp price drops or periods of sideways trading can lead some retail traders to step back. Geopolitical Events: Global instability often drives investors towards perceived safe-haven assets, away from riskier ones. While the start of Q1 2024 saw some positive catalysts, such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which did inject some optimism and likely contributed to that initial ‘upward trend’, JPMorgan’s analysis suggests that this positive impulse was eventually overshadowed by broader market caution that developed later in the quarter, impacting overall crypto trading volume . Robinhood’s Position in the Cryptocurrency Market Robinhood has become a significant player in the retail crypto trading space, offering access to a range of popular cryptocurrencies alongside stocks and options. Its user-friendly interface and commission-free trading model (though other fees may apply) have attracted a large base of individual investors. The revenue generated from Robinhood crypto trading is a material part of the company’s overall financial performance, although the exact percentage can fluctuate significantly based on market cycles. For Robinhood, high trading volume translates directly to higher revenue from transaction fees. Conversely, periods of low volume, driven by factors like market-wide risk aversion as highlighted by the JPMorgan forecast , can negatively impact their top line. This makes Robinhood’s crypto revenue particularly sensitive to the ebbs and flows of the broader cryptocurrency market sentiment and activity. Challenges and Opportunities for Robinhood’s Crypto Business The volatility inherent in crypto trading volume presents both challenges and opportunities for Robinhood. The primary challenge is the unpredictable nature of a significant revenue stream. Relying heavily on trading fees means revenue can surge during bull markets but contract sharply during downturns or periods of low volatility and high risk aversion, precisely the scenario described by the JPMorgan forecast for Q1. To mitigate this challenge and build a more resilient business, Robinhood has been actively working to diversify its crypto offerings beyond simple buying and selling. These efforts represent key opportunities for growth and stability: Expanding Token Listings: Adding more cryptocurrencies to the platform can attract new users and increase trading options for existing ones. Offering Crypto Wallets: Providing users with self-custody options allows them to move assets off the platform, increasing trust and utility. Introducing Staking Services: Allowing users to earn passive income by staking certain cryptocurrencies can generate new revenue streams and keep assets on the platform longer. Educational Resources: Providing information and tools to help users understand the cryptocurrency market can encourage informed participation. While these initiatives are crucial for long-term growth and reducing reliance on volatile trading fees, the Q1 crypto revenue is still heavily influenced by the core trading activity, making forecasts like JPMorgan’s particularly relevant for near-term performance expectations. What Does This JPMorgan Forecast Mean for Investors? For investors looking at Robinhood stock (HOOD) or participating in the cryptocurrency market via the platform, the JPMorgan forecast serves as a useful data point. It suggests that the first quarter might show a dip in one of Robinhood’s key growth areas, which could potentially impact their earnings report for the period. However, it’s important for investors to look beyond a single quarter’s projection. They should consider: Overall Business Health: How are Robinhood’s other segments (stocks, options, Gold subscriptions) performing? Long-Term Strategy: Are the diversification efforts mentioned above gaining traction? Market Cycles: Cryptocurrency markets are cyclical. A dip in volume in one quarter doesn’t preclude a rebound later if market sentiment improves. Analyst Consensus: Is JPMorgan’s forecast an outlier, or do other analysts share a similar view on Robinhood crypto trading ? For users of the platform, the forecast primarily reflects the broader market environment. A decrease in overall crypto trading volume across platforms is often correlated with less dramatic price movements or periods of consolidation, which can influence individual trading strategies. Conclusion: Navigating the Currents of Crypto Trading Revenue The JPMorgan forecast for Robinhood’s Q1 crypto trading revenue highlights the inherent volatility and sensitivity of this business line to broader market sentiment. The projected drop from $71 billion in Q4 2023 to around $52 billion in Q1 2024 underscores the impact of increased risk aversion offsetting earlier positive trends in the cryptocurrency market . While this likely points to a softer quarter for Q1 crypto revenue specifically, it also reinforces the importance of Robinhood’s strategic efforts to diversify its offerings and build a more stable financial model less dependent on the sometimes-whimsical nature of trading volume. For investors and market watchers, this forecast serves as a reminder that even amidst long-term growth potential, the path of cryptocurrency adoption and trading activity will likely continue to see fluctuations influenced by global economic conditions and investor psychology.

43965652,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153850,1745973653,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Base Network Takes Monumental Leap Towards Full Decentralization,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/base-network-decentralization-leap/,"Big news is brewing in the world of Layer 2 networks! Coinbase’s Base network , a prominent player in the Ethereum scaling space, has just taken a significant step forward on its path towards full blockchain decentralization. This move is more than just a technical upgrade; it signals a maturing ecosystem and a commitment to the core principles of web3. Understanding the Evolution of Base Network When Coinbase first launched Base, it was designed as an optimistic rollup built on the OP Stack, aiming to provide a low-cost, secure, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications. As a Layer 2 network, its primary goal is to alleviate congestion and high transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet (Layer 1) by processing transactions off-chain and then posting bundled transaction data back to Ethereum. Initially, like many new rollups, Base operated in what’s often referred to as a ‘training wheels’ or ‘phase 0’ state. In this initial phase, certain security and upgrade mechanisms are often centralized to ensure stability and the ability to quickly fix critical bugs in a nascent system. While necessary for rapid development and deployment, this phase is inherently less decentralized, relying heavily on the core team (in this case, primarily Coinbase) for critical decisions and security oversight. The recent announcement, reported by CoinDesk, is that Base has transitioned to a ‘phase 1’ rollup. This is a crucial milestone on the rollup decntralization roadmap defined by teams like Optimism (on whose stack Base is built) and recognized within the broader Ethereum community. It represents a move away from some of that initial centralization towards a more distributed control structure. What Does Becoming a Phase 1 Rollup Actually Mean for Coinbase Base? The shift to phase 1 signifies that the network has implemented specific technical and governance changes that reduce reliance on a single entity. According to Tom Vieira, Base’s head of product, a key element of this transition is the introduction of a Security Council . Think of the Security Council as a multi-signature (multisig) body. Instead of a single entity having control over critical functions like pausing the network or initiating emergency upgrades, these powers are now distributed among a group of independent entities. These entities are chosen from within the Base ecosystem, aiming to represent a diverse set of stakeholders rather than just Coinbase itself. Here’s a breakdown of what this typically entails for a phase 1 rollup: Multi-signature Control: Critical operations (like upgrades or emergency pauses) require agreement from a supermajority of the Security Council members, not just the core team. Reduced Upgrade Risk: While upgrades might still be relatively fast compared to Layer 1 governance, the multisig introduces a check on the core team’s power, reducing the risk of a malicious or faulty upgrade being pushed unilaterally. Emergency Response: The council can act swiftly in emergencies (e.g., a major bug or exploit) to protect user funds or network integrity, but this power is now shared. Increased Transparency (Potential): The operations requiring the multisig are often public on the Layer 1 chain, adding a layer of transparency. This is a significant step towards genuine blockchain decentralization because it distributes control over potentially harmful actions. It’s not full decentralization yet (that’s phase 2, which involves permissionless fraud proofs), but it’s a critical intermediate stage that builds trust and resilience. Why is This Step Important for the Base Network? This transition brings several key benefits: Enhanced Security Posture: By requiring multiple independent parties to sign off on critical actions, the network becomes more resistant to attacks or errors originating from a single point of failure (like a compromised core team key). Increased Trust and Credibility: Moving away from centralized control demonstrates a commitment to decentralization principles, which is vital for attracting users, developers, and institutional adoption in the crypto space. Community Involvement (Indirect): While the council members are selected, they represent broader ecosystem interests, giving the community more confidence that decisions are not solely made by Coinbase. Pathway to Phase 2: Phase 1 is a necessary stepping stone towards achieving Phase 2 decentralization, where the network relies on permissionless fraud proofs (or validity proofs for ZK rollups) executed by anyone, not just a privileged set of validators or a security council, to ensure correct state transitions. Alignment with Ethereum’s Vision: This aligns Base more closely with Ethereum’s long-term vision of a highly scalable ecosystem built on decentralized and secure Layer 2 solutions. This move makes the Coinbase Base ecosystem more robust and less reliant on the central exchange itself for core security functions. Potential Challenges or Considerations While highly positive, the phase 1 transition isn’t without its nuances: Security Council Composition: The selection process and independence of the council members are crucial. Ensuring they truly represent diverse interests and are technically capable is key. Emergency Speed vs. Decentralization: While the multisig adds security, it can potentially slow down emergency responses compared to a single entity having immediate control. Not Fully Permissionless: Phase 1 still relies on a designated group (the council) for certain security overrides. True permissionless security comes in Phase 2 with open participation in fraud proving. Technical Complexity: Implementing and managing the multisig and the associated governance processes adds technical overhead. These aren’t necessarily drawbacks but important aspects to monitor as the network continues its decentralization journey. The effectiveness of the Security Council will largely depend on its members and operational transparency. Comparing Decentralization Approaches: Base vs. Others It’s useful to look at how other prominent Layer 2 networks are approaching decentralization. Arbitrum and Optimism, also optimistic rollups, have been on similar paths. Optimism, the base layer for Base, has its own multi-signature setup and is also working towards the next phases of decentralization, involving fault proofs. Arbitrum has also implemented decentralized governance and is progressing through its own stages. Base’s move to phase 1, leveraging the OP Stack’s defined stages, shows a clear commitment to following a recognized path towards greater security and decentralization within the optimistic rollup paradigm. While the specifics of Security Council composition and operation may vary slightly between networks, the underlying principle of distributing critical control is consistent among maturing Layer 2 solutions. This progress across multiple major Layer 2 network implementations is a positive sign for the scalability and security of the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Users and Developers What does this mean for you if you use or build on Base? For Users: This transition increases the security and resilience of the network you’re using. While direct interaction with the Security Council isn’t typical for users, their presence means critical safety mechanisms are now under distributed control, not just Coinbase’s. Continue to use Base with increased confidence in its long-term security roadmap. For Developers: Building on Base becomes even more attractive as its underlying infrastructure matures and moves towards greater decentralization. This reduces platform risk associated with a single point of control. Stay informed about potential future protocol upgrades managed by the Security Council. For Ecosystem Participants: Keep an eye on how the Security Council is formed and operates. Transparency in this process is key to building community trust. Opportunities might arise in the future for ecosystem participants to contribute to or monitor these decentralized governance structures. This step reinforces Base’s position as a serious and maturing player in the blockchain space, built on a foundation aiming for true decentralization. What’s Next? The Road to Full Decentralization (Phase 2) Phase 1 is a crucial stop, but the journey doesn’t end here. The ultimate goal for optimistic rollups like Base is to reach Phase 2. This phase is characterized by the implementation of permissionless fraud proofs (or fault proofs). In Phase 2, anyone can run a node and submit a fraud proof to Ethereum if they detect an invalid state transition (a dishonest rollup block). The system then automatically verifies this proof on Layer 1, penalizes the sequencer that submitted the invalid block, and corrects the state. This removes the reliance on a trusted Security Council or any specific set of validators for the core security guarantee; the network’s security is then rooted directly in Ethereum’s consensus and cryptography, enforced by open participation. Achieving Phase 2 is a complex technical challenge, particularly implementing robust and efficient fraud proving systems. Base, leveraging the work done on the OP Stack (like Optimism’s fault proofs), is on a clear path towards this goal. This final step will solidify Base’s status as a truly decentralized Layer 2 network, inheriting the full security of Ethereum without relying on centralized overrides. A Monumental Step for Blockchain Decentralization Coinbase’s Base network moving to a phase 1 rollup is a significant and highly positive development. It demonstrates a clear commitment to shedding centralized control mechanisms necessary in the early stages and embracing a more decentralized architecture. The introduction of a Security Council composed of independent ecosystem entities distributes critical power and enhances the network’s resilience and trustworthiness. While the journey to full, permissionless decentralization (Phase 2) is still ongoing and presents its own technical hurdles, this phase 1 transition is a vital milestone. It signals the growing maturity of the Base ecosystem and its alignment with the broader vision of scalable, secure, and decentralized blockchain technology. For users and developers, it means building and transacting on a network that is progressively becoming more robust and community-aligned. This step solidifies Base’s position as a key Layer 2 network driving innovation and adoption in the decentralized web.

A large inflow of Bitcoin into Coinbase Institutional could indicate preparation for custody, trading, or other services utilized by big players. Cumberland: A subsidiary of DRW, a global principal trading firm. Cumberland is one of the leading liquidity providers in the cryptocurrency space, specializing in large, over-the-counter (OTC) block trades. OTC desks facilitate direct peer-to-peer trading of large crypto volumes, bypassing public exchanges, which helps minimize price impact. When Cumberland moves a large amount of BTC, it’s often related to fulfilling a client order or managing their own inventory related to large trades. Why Institutional Investment in Bitcoin Matters The flow of large sums of Bitcoin into institutional platforms like Coinbase Institutional is a significant indicator of the growing interest and participation of traditional finance in the crypto market. Here’s why this matters: Validation: Increased institutional activity lends credibility and maturity to the asset class. Capital Influx: Institutions manage vast amounts of capital, and their allocation into Bitcoin can significantly impact market size and liquidity. Market Structure: Institutional platforms often operate differently from retail exchanges, and large flows here can signal different types of market pressure (e.g., long-term holding vs. short-term trading). Adoption Trend: Consistent large transfers point towards an ongoing trend of institutional adoption, moving beyond early adopters to more mainstream financial entities. This particular transfer could be a result of an institution buying a large block of Bitcoin through Cumberland’s OTC desk and then transferring it to their custodial account at Coinbase Institutional. Tracking a Whale Transfer : What Can We Learn? Tracking whale movements, while not a crystal ball, provides valuable insights into potential market dynamics. A large whale transfer to an institutional platform could signal: Accumulation: An institution has acquired a large amount of BTC and is moving it into secure custody. Preparation for Sale: Less likely if moving to custody, but possible if moving to a trading account. However, OTC desks like Cumberland often handle the sale side too, so a move *from* Cumberland to an exchange could also signal a sale preparation. This move *to* Coinbase Institutional is more indicative of accumulation or secure holding. Internal Reorganization: The institution might be moving funds between their own accounts for various operational or strategic reasons. ETF Activity: With the advent of Bitcoin ETFs, large movements to or from institutional custodians could be related to the creation or redemption process of these funds. While we can’t know the exact reason for this specific 2,930 BTC transfer without more information, the destination (Coinbase Institutional) strongly suggests it’s related to significant institutional activity, likely involving accumulation or secure storage following a large purchase, potentially facilitated by Cumberland . The Role of Cumberland in Large OTC Deals Cumberland acts as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the crypto market for large-volume trades. Their involvement in this transfer underscores their role as a key liquidity provider. When an institution wants to buy or sell a large amount of Bitcoin without impacting the price on public exchanges, they often turn to OTC desks like Cumberland. This transfer could represent the delivery of BTC from Cumberland’s inventory (or from a seller they sourced) to the buying institution’s account at Coinbase Institutional. Such transfers highlight the ‘dark pool’ nature of large OTC trades – the public only sees the movement of funds *after* the trade has been agreed upon and executed, often providing a delayed signal of significant market interest or pressure. Actionable Insights for Observers For those watching the market, keeping an eye on significant whale movements, especially those involving institutional platforms and major OTC desks, can be insightful. While one transfer doesn’t dictate the market direction, a pattern of large inflows into institutional custodians over time can be a bullish signal, indicating sustained institutional demand. Conversely, large outflows might suggest distribution. It’s important to remember that these are just signals, not guarantees. Market prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, and individual whale movements are just one piece of the puzzle. Conclusion The transfer of 2,930 BTC from Cumberland to Coinbase Institutional is a notable event, underscoring the continued and significant participation of large financial entities in the Bitcoin market. It highlights the roles of key players like Cumberland as OTC facilitators and Coinbase Institutional as a gateway for institutional adoption. While the precise reason for this specific transaction remains private, its nature strongly suggests it’s tied to substantial institutional investment or activity, adding another data point to the narrative of Bitcoin’s increasing integration into the traditional financial system.

Among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now gaining momentum, offering a much sharper growth profile compared to others like ADA and Polygon (MATIC). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is rapidly positioning itself as a must-watch DeFi platform, built for real-world lending and borrowing while offering passive income through its mtTokens. With flexible interest rates, upcoming real-world asset integrations, and a buy-and-distribute model favoring long-term holders, the foundation for sustainable growth is clear. The presale is advancing fast, having already raised over $7.3 million with more than 9,300 holders onboard. More than 431 million tokens have already been sold, with the 4th presale phase now over 51% complete. Currently priced at $0.025, the next phase will push the price to $0.03, while the official launch is set at $0.06 — representing a 140% surge from today’s entry. With a strong real-world utility plan, passive income features, and the anticipated launch of its DeFi platform, analysts expect MUTM to approach $2 by the close of 2025. In a market searching for the best crypto to invest in, Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as a clear favorite. With a $2,000 investment at today’s presale rate of $0.025, you’d be holding 80,000 MUTM tokens in your portfolio. When MUTM reaches $2 as projected, those same tokens would be worth $160,000 — delivering an astonishing 80x return. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) continues to maintain a strong presence among leading cryptocurrencies, trading around $0.72. The project is recognized for its research-first approach and commitment to building a scalable blockchain ecosystem. Over the last 24 hours, ADA has climbed +3.20%, while its 7-day performance shows a +12.41% gain. Cardano, backed by a market cap of $25.5 billion and a circulating supply of 35.3 billion ADA, continues to hold strong influence in the market, though its growth is unfolding at a more measured pace. Analysts expect ADA to approach $0.83 by the end of May 2025. Sentiment around Cardano is bullish, but the Fear & Greed Index positions it at a neutral level (54), indicating that investors expect gradual progress rather than immediate surges. Polygon (MATIC) Polygon (MATIC) serves as a major scaling solution for Ethereum, helping speed up transactions and lower costs across decentralized applications. Trading currently around $0.24, MATIC has seen a 23.03% gain over the past seven days, despite a minor -1.39% slip in the last 24 hours. With a market capitalization of $415 million and a circulating supply of 1.73 billion MATIC, the project holds a significant role within the crypto ecosystem. MATIC’s sentiment is currently neutral, and the Fear & Greed Index ranks it at 65 (Greed). An oversold RSI (~25) points to potential for a technical rebound in the near future, though major breakouts are not the immediate expectation. Why MUTM Is Leading the New Cryptocurrency Race While ADA and MATIC continue their slow but steady climbs, Mutuum Finance is pushing forward with fresh momentum, real-world solutions, and a presale that is gaining serious traction. The upcoming dashboard launch and a $100K giveaway further strengthen its appeal to early adopters. With its presale still open and excitement growing, MUTM stands out as the clear answer for investors asking what crypto to buy now. With the potential for a major surge, Mutuum Finance is increasingly seen as the next big crypto poised for breakout gains in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just keeping pace with other leading projects under $1 — it’s outpacing them with stronger fundamentals, a rapidly growing community, and clear upside potential. For anyone looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in today, MUTM is a name to watch closely.

The analyst’s chart compresses seven years of ADA/USD history into one pane and shows that – despite a 45 % retracement from the late-2024 peak – the coin has not violated the rising dashed trend-line that has connected every cycle low since the 2020 Covid panic. Cardano Price Ready For Liftoff? In fact, the most recent dip stopped inside a long-standing demand band that now stretches from roughly $0.57 to $0.78 and immediately printed a textbook higher low (HL) while never closing a week beneath that dynamic support. Price action is again trading above the 50-week exponential moving average, currently near $0.66, after reclaiming it with two decisive green candles. Back in March 2024 the same moving average acted as a springboard for a vertical breakout that carried ADA to a higher high (HH) just shy of $1.31 – the top of the dotted, upward-sloping channel that has contained every impulsive rally since 2020. Because the upper channel boundary now lies close to $1.50, Maelius argues that a clean break of the demand zone could unleash enough momentum to retest that ceiling. Related Reading: Cardano Price Set For 300% Explosion With Major Bullish Impulse Momentum gauges back the thesis but have not yet flashed full confirmation. The weekly relative-strength index sits at 49 and has been squeezing into a falling wedge since the March high; it is carving a sequence of higher lows that mirrors price, yet the down-sloping resistance line – drawn from the HH reading near 82 – still caps any advance. The Wave-Trend Oscillator tells a similar story: it produced a glaring bearish divergence at the 2024 top, bled into oversold territory around −50, and is only now curling upward, with the fast and slow curves on the verge of a bullish cross. “ADA looks dope, or is just me?! Would like to see RSI breakout w/ decisive move on WTO to get super-confident, but price will be higher when (and if) we get it,” Maelius wrote when he released the chart. In other words, momentum confirmation may lag behind price, as it did in previous cycle accelerations during 2020 and 2023. Related Reading: Cardano Sets Voting Record: Nearly 100% Of 4.6 Billion ADA Cast Via Delegates From a pure market-structure perspective, ADA remains in an unbroken sequence of higher highs and higher lows on the weekly chart, the prevailing down-trend line from the 2021 record high was breached more than a year ago, and the recent correction resembles nothing more sinister than a throw-back to new support. As long as weekly candles respect the lower edge of the grey demand block (~$0.57) and the multi-year rising trend-line, the path of least resistance points north – with the next confluence of resistance stacked near $0.81 (the March-2024 swing high) as well as the December 2024 high at $1.31 and the upper channel wall around $1.50. Should the RSI pierce the 60 level and the Wave-Trend Oscillator confirm with a bullish cross, Maelius contends that the market will already be trading at materially higher prices, validating his conviction that a fresh surge is only a matter of time. At press time, ADA traded at $0.709.

A recent development has caught the attention of the crypto community, particularly those interested in meme coins and institutional adoption: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again postponed its decision regarding Bitwise’s application for a spot Dogecoin ETF . This news, initially reported by Golden Finance, adds another layer of anticipation and uncertainty to the path for a Spot Crypto ETF focused on the popular meme coin. The Latest on the SEC Dogecoin ETF Delay Regulatory reviews for cryptocurrency products, especially ETFs, are known for being thorough and often lengthy. The SEC’s decision to delay on the Bitwise ETF for Dogecoin follows a pattern seen with previous applications for Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. While the delay itself isn’t entirely unexpected given the novelty and unique characteristics of Dogecoin compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum, it certainly keeps market participants waiting. What does this delay signify? Essentially, the SEC is taking more time to evaluate the application. This could be due to various factors: Complex Asset: Dogecoin started as a meme but has evolved. The SEC needs to understand its market structure, potential for manipulation, and whether it fits within their regulatory framework for investment products. Investor Protection: A primary goal of the SEC is protecting investors. They will scrutinize how a Dogecoin ETF would be structured to ensure it mitigates risks associated with the asset’s volatility and unique community-driven nature. Setting Precedent: Approving a spot Dogecoin ETF could set a precedent for other altcoin ETFs. The SEC is likely treading carefully, considering the implications for future applications. Understanding the Spot Crypto ETF Landscape Before diving deeper into the specifics of Dogecoin, let’s quickly recap what a spot crypto ETF is and why it’s a big deal. A spot ETF holds the underlying asset directly – in this case, actual Dogecoin. This is different from a futures ETF, which holds contracts speculating on the future price of the asset. Spot ETFs are often preferred by investors because: They provide direct exposure to the asset’s current price movements. They are typically more accessible and familiar investment vehicles for traditional investors. They can simplify the process of investing in crypto by handling custody and security issues for the investor. The approval of several Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year, followed by progress on Ethereum spot ETFs, signaled a significant shift in the U.S. regulatory stance towards crypto investment products. This paved the way for firms like Bitwise to apply for ETFs based on other cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. Why a Dogecoin ETF Matters Dogecoin, born from an internet meme in 2013, has grown into one of the most recognizable cryptocurrencies globally. Despite its whimsical origins, it boasts a large and active community, has seen significant price swings, and has even garnered attention from prominent figures like Elon Musk. The prospect of a spot Dogecoin ETF is significant for several reasons: Increased Accessibility: A DOGE ETF would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin through regulated brokerage accounts, without needing to navigate crypto exchanges, wallets, or private keys. Institutional Interest: An ETF structure could attract institutional investors who are currently unable or unwilling to directly hold volatile cryptocurrencies like DOGE. Perceived Legitimacy: Regulatory approval from the SEC would lend a significant degree of legitimacy to Dogecoin as an investable asset class in the eyes of mainstream finance. Potential for Liquidity: A successful ETF could increase trading volume and liquidity for DOGE. However, the challenges are equally apparent. Dogecoin’s price is famously volatile and often influenced by social media trends rather than fundamental developments. This inherent characteristic is likely a major point of focus for the SEC’s review. What This Delay Means for Bitwise ETF and the Market For Bitwise, a firm that has been at the forefront of crypto asset management and successfully launched one of the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, this delay is part of the standard regulatory process but extends the timeline for potentially bringing a new product to market. Bitwise, like other applicants, must address the SEC’s concerns and provide sufficient information regarding market surveillance, custody arrangements, and other critical factors. For the broader market, the delay on the Bitwise ETF for Dogecoin reinforces that the path for altcoin ETFs will likely be deliberate and cautious. While Bitcoin and Ethereum may have cleared significant hurdles, each subsequent asset will be evaluated on its own merits and risks. This process could set a precedent for how the SEC approaches other meme coins or less established cryptocurrencies in the future. Potential Impact on DOGE Price Market reactions to ETF news are often speculative. The initial news of the delay might lead to a neutral or slightly negative sentiment among traders hoping for a quick approval catalyst. However, the fact that the application is still under review, rather than being rejected, could be viewed positively by those who remain optimistic about future approval. The DOGE price is influenced by a multitude of factors, including overall crypto market sentiment, social media trends, development updates (like progress on Dogecoin scaling or utility), and macroeconomic conditions. While ETF approval is seen as a potential long-term bullish catalyst due to increased demand and accessibility, the delay itself is unlikely to cause a dramatic, sustained price movement in isolation. Traders and investors should consider the broader market context and Dogecoin’s unique volatility profile. Actionable Insight: For those tracking the DOGE price , regulatory updates like this are important data points, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on delay news. Consider your long-term investment strategy and risk tolerance. Looking Ahead: The Path to Approval (or Rejection) With the delay announced, the SEC will set a new deadline for its decision. This period allows for further dialogue between Bitwise and the regulator. Bitwise will likely provide additional information or clarify aspects of their proposal to address the SEC’s concerns. The outcome remains uncertain. While the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs provides a hopeful framework, Dogecoin presents unique challenges due to its origins and market dynamics. The SEC could approve the ETF, request further delays, or ultimately deny the application if they believe it doesn’t meet the necessary standards for investor protection and market integrity. Key factors the SEC is likely considering include: Market Surveillance: Can Bitwise and its partners demonstrate sufficient mechanisms to detect and prevent market manipulation in the underlying DOGE market? Custody: Are the proposed methods for securely storing the underlying Dogecoin robust and compliant? Valuation: Is there a reliable and transparent method for pricing the DOGE held by the ETF? Conclusion: Waiting Game Continues for the Dogecoin ETF The SEC’s decision to delay the Bitwise spot Dogecoin ETF application is a significant moment for the Dogecoin community and the broader crypto market. It underscores the cautious approach regulators are taking towards approving investment products for assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. While the delay means a longer waiting period, it also signifies that the application is still actively under review, keeping the possibility of a spot DOGE ETF alive. The coming months will be crucial in determining whether Dogecoin can clear the regulatory hurdles necessary to become accessible through a traditional ETF structure, potentially impacting the DOGE price and its standing in the financial world.

43966563,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153854,1745975442,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent: SEC Delays Franklin Spot XRP ETF Decision, What Happens Now?",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-xrp-etf/,"Crypto markets are always buzzing with anticipation, especially when it comes to regulatory milestones. The latest news sending ripples through the community is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to delay its ruling on the Franklin spot XRP ETF application. This move, initially reported by Golden Finance, is a standard part of the SEC’s review process, but it underscores the ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP. What Does the SEC Delay on the Spot XRP ETF Mean? When an asset manager like Franklin Templeton files for a Spot XRP ETF , it triggers a formal review process by the SEC. This process involves several stages, including public comment periods and potential delays. A delay, in this context, doesn’t necessarily signal an impending rejection. Instead, it typically means the SEC requires more time to review the application thoroughly, consider public comments, and assess the market and regulatory landscape surrounding the proposed product. For the proposed Spot XRP ETF , the SEC’s delay extends the review period, pushing back the deadline for a final decision. This extra time allows the commission to delve deeper into the unique aspects of an XRP-based product, especially given the history of regulatory scrutiny around the digital asset. Understanding the Journey to XRP ETF Approval The path to XRP ETF approval in the United States has been complex, largely due to the ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs, the company associated with the XRP ledger. The SEC has argued that XRP is an unregistered security, a claim that Ripple has disputed vigorously in court. While there have been partial court rulings providing some clarity on XRP’s status in certain contexts (like programmatic sales), the overall regulatory picture remains somewhat cloudy compared to assets like Bitcoin. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in 2024 set a precedent and fueled optimism for other crypto assets, including Ethereum and potentially XRP. However, each asset presents unique challenges. For XRP ETF approval , the SEC must be satisfied that the underlying market is resistant to manipulation and that offering an ETF aligns with investor protection mandates. The outcome of the Ripple lawsuit is a significant factor hanging over any decision regarding XRP financial products. The Role of Franklin Templeton in the Spot XRP ETF Race Franklin Templeton is a major global investment firm with a long history in traditional finance. Their application for a Franklin Templeton XRP ETF adds significant weight and credibility to the pursuit of a spot XRP product. Large, reputable financial institutions entering the crypto space through ETF applications signal growing institutional interest and potentially pave the way for broader adoption among retail and institutional investors who prefer regulated, familiar investment vehicles. Their involvement in seeking a Spot XRP ETF highlights the perceived demand and potential market opportunity for such a product, despite the existing regulatory hurdles. Franklin Templeton’s experience navigating regulatory environments in traditional finance is a valuable asset in this process. Why the SEC Decision on XRP Matters The final SEC decision XRP related to a spot ETF is highly anticipated for several reasons: Regulatory Clarity: An approval could signal increased regulatory comfort with XRP as an investable asset, potentially influencing its classification and treatment globally. Institutional Adoption: A spot ETF provides a straightforward, regulated way for large institutions and traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the asset. Market Liquidity and Price: Increased demand from ETF inflows could boost XRP’s liquidity and potentially impact its market price positively. Investor Access: Retail investors could access XRP exposure through brokerage accounts, simplifying the investment process compared to using cryptocurrency exchanges. Conversely, a rejection or prolonged uncertainty from the SEC decision XRP could reinforce regulatory concerns and temper enthusiasm for XRP in the short term. Potential Benefits and Challenges of an Approved Spot XRP ETF Launching a Spot XRP ETF comes with potential upsides and significant challenges: Benefits: Accessibility: Makes investing in XRP easier for traditional investors via standard brokerage accounts. Liquidity: Increases trading volume and market depth for XRP. Institutional Capital: Opens the door for large funds and institutions to invest. Price Discovery: Could lead to more efficient price discovery as arbitrage opportunities between the ETF and the underlying asset arise. Legitimacy: An SEC-approved product could lend further legitimacy to XRP as an asset class. Challenges: Regulatory Risk: The primary hurdle remains the SEC’s stance on XRP’s security status, tied to the Ripple lawsuit outcome. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC scrutinizes the underlying market’s resistance to manipulation. Volatility: XRP, like other cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile, posing risks for ETF investors. Custody Issues: Securely holding the underlying XRP presents operational challenges for the ETF provider. What’s Next for the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF? The SEC’s delay on the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF application means the review process continues. The commission will now use the extended period to gather more information, potentially engage in further discussions with Franklin Templeton, and closely monitor developments, including the ongoing legal proceedings involving Ripple. There will be a new deadline set for the next step, which could be another delay, a decision, or the initiation of further proceedings. Market participants will be closely watching for further announcements from the SEC and any updates regarding the Ripple lawsuit, as both are critical factors influencing the fate of the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF and potentially other similar applications in the future. Navigating the Path Forward: Actionable Insights For investors and enthusiasts following the potential for a Spot XRP ETF , here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from the SEC and updates on the Ripple lawsuit. Avoid relying solely on rumors or speculation. Understand the Risks: Remember that a delay or even eventual approval does not eliminate the inherent volatility and risks associated with cryptocurrency investments, including XRP. Diversify: Do not place all your investment hopes on a single asset or regulatory outcome. A diversified portfolio is key. Evaluate Your Investment Goals: Consider whether an ETF structure aligns with your investment strategy compared to direct ownership of XRP. The process for crypto ETFs in the U.S. is still evolving, and each asset faces its own set of challenges and opportunities. Conclusion The SEC’s decision to delay the ruling on the Franklin spot XRP ETF is a predictable step in a lengthy and complex regulatory process. While it postpones immediate clarity, it keeps the possibility of a spot XRP ETF alive. The outcome hinges significantly on ongoing regulatory discussions and the resolution of legal matters surrounding XRP. The involvement of major players like Franklin Templeton underscores the growing institutional interest in bringing crypto assets into traditional investment structures. As the SEC takes more time for its SEC decision XRP related, the crypto community watches eagerly, understanding that the path to broader adoption is paved with regulatory milestones like this one.

A recent development suggests a significant shift in the legal challenges facing a prominent crypto privacy tool. Reports indicate that the New York AG might be considering a pivotal move regarding the Samourai Wallet lawsuit, potentially impacting the broader landscape of DOJ Crypto enforcement and the use of cryptocurrency mixing services. What Sparked the Samourai Wallet Crypto Lawsuit? Before diving into the latest news, it’s important to understand the origins of the legal troubles for Samourai Wallet. The core of the issue stems from allegations that the service facilitated illegal activities. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) took significant action against the platform and its founders, Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill. The DOJ’s charges were serious, alleging that Samourai Wallet operated as an unlicensed money transmitting business and engaged in money laundering. Specifically, the DOJ claimed that the service processed over $100 million in criminal proceeds. This wasn’t just a minor regulatory slap on the wrist; it involved federal criminal charges, highlighting the government’s focus on illicit finance within the crypto space. The allegations centered on the wallet’s primary function: enhancing transaction privacy. While privacy is a sought-after feature in the crypto world, tools like Samourai Wallet’s coin mixing capabilities can be used to obscure the origin and destination of funds, making them attractive to cybercriminals, fraudsters, and other illicit actors. The DOJ argued that the founders not only knew this but actively promoted the service as a way to bypass regulations and law enforcement scrutiny. Key points from the initial DOJ action included: Charges against co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill. Allegations of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Claims of facilitating over $100 million in criminal proceeds. Focus on the platform’s privacy features, particularly its mixing capabilities. This initial action sent ripples through the crypto community, particularly among those who prioritize financial privacy and view such services as essential tools rather than instruments of crime. It underscored the ongoing tension between technological innovation aimed at privacy and regulatory efforts to combat illicit finance. Is the New York AG Really Changing Course? Now, the plot thickens. Recent reports, notably from CoinDesk, suggest that the New York AG ‘s office is considering a different path than the one initially pursued by the DOJ. While the DOJ’s federal case proceeds, the state-level action from New York appears to be under review for potential withdrawal. This development is significant because it could indicate a divergence in legal strategies or priorities between state and federal authorities regarding cryptocurrency mixing services and their operators. The exact reasons behind the New York AG’s potential reconsideration are not fully clear from the reports, but possibilities include: Coordination with the ongoing federal DOJ case: The AG’s office might decide that the federal prosecution is sufficient and a parallel state case is redundant or complicates matters. Legal or evidentiary challenges: Perhaps the state’s case faces unique legal hurdles or lacks specific evidence required for a state-level conviction that differs from the federal standard. Resource allocation: The AG’s office might prioritize other cases, deciding to focus resources elsewhere while the DOJ handles the Samourai matter federally. Jurisdictional considerations: There could be complexities regarding the jurisdiction of the state charges versus the federal charges, especially concerning the nature of the alleged crimes and where they occurred. It’s crucial to remember that ‘considering dropping’ is not the same as ‘has dropped.’ The situation remains fluid, and the AG’s office has not made a final public announcement. However, the mere consideration is noteworthy and suggests a potential softening or strategic shift in the state’s approach compared to the federal government’s stance on this particular crypto lawsuit . What Does This Mean for DOJ Crypto Enforcement? While the New York AG’s potential move doesn’t directly halt the federal case brought by the DOJ Crypto unit, it could have indirect implications. Federal prosecutors often collaborate with state law enforcement. A state deciding to step back from a parallel case might signal potential complexities or a lack of complete alignment in strategy, although this is speculative. The DOJ has made it clear that cracking down on the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes is a high priority. Cases against mixers and other privacy-enhancing tools are central to this effort. The Samourai Wallet case, alongside actions against other services like Tornado Cash, demonstrates the DOJ’s resolve to pursue operators they believe are facilitating criminal activity, regardless of the technology involved. This situation highlights the layered nature of cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement in the United States, involving multiple federal agencies (DOJ, Treasury, SEC, etc.) and state-level authorities like the New York AG . Different jurisdictions may have slightly different interpretations of laws like money transmitting regulations when applied to novel technologies like crypto wallets and mixers. Challenges in DOJ Crypto enforcement often include: Tracing funds through complex blockchain transactions, especially when mixing services are used. Applying existing financial regulations (like those for money transmitters) to decentralized or pseudo-anonymous technologies. Establishing intent and knowledge on the part of the service operators regarding illicit use. Navigating international aspects, as crypto services often operate globally. The Samourai Wallet case is a test case for many of these challenges. How it ultimately concludes, both at the federal and potentially state level, will likely set precedents for future actions against similar services and impact the broader landscape of crypto lawsuit s. Understanding Cryptocurrency Mixing: Why Is It Controversial? At the heart of the Samourai Wallet case and many other regulatory actions is the concept of cryptocurrency mixing . But what exactly is it, and why does it attract so much scrutiny from regulators and law enforcement? Cryptocurrency mixing , also known as tumbling, is a service that aims to break the link between a user’s cryptocurrency address and the addresses they send funds to. It works by pooling funds from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to trace the original source of the coins sent to a recipient. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it generally works: Step Action Outcome 1 User sends coins to the mixer’s pool. Coins are added to a large pool of other users’ coins. 2 Mixer holds the coins for a period. Adds time delay to obscure the transaction path. 3 Mixer sends back equivalent value (minus fee) to new addresses provided by the user. User receives ‘clean’ coins from the pool, not their original ones. 4 The coins sent to the recipient come from the mixed pool. Difficult for observers to link the recipient’s coins back to the original sender’s deposit. For users in oppressive regimes, whistleblowers, or simply individuals who value financial privacy and don’t want their transactions publicly visible on a blockchain, mixers can be a legitimate tool. However, because they obscure the flow of funds, they are also heavily utilized by criminals seeking to launder illicit gains from hacking, ransomware, drug trafficking, and other illegal activities. Regulators and law enforcement agencies argue that operators of mixing services, especially centralized ones, have an obligation to implement anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, just like traditional financial institutions. When they fail to do so, or worse, actively market their services to avoid detection, authorities view them as facilitating crime. The debate is complex: Is the technology inherently illegal, or is it the *use* of the technology for illegal purposes that is the problem? And where does the responsibility lie – with the user or the service provider? The Samourai Wallet case, and the differing approaches from the New York AG and the DOJ, underscore the ongoing legal and ethical challenges surrounding these tools. What are the Potential Outcomes and Future Challenges? The potential decision by the New York AG to drop the state-level crypto lawsuit against Samourai Wallet founders introduces several possibilities and highlights future challenges for the crypto space. Potential Outcomes: Focus shifts entirely to the federal case: If the AG drops the state charges, the legal battle for Rodriguez and Hill will be solely against the DOJ. This could simplify the defense’s strategy but still leaves them facing serious federal charges. Setting a precedent for state vs. federal roles: The AG’s decision, whatever it is, could offer insight into how state regulators view their role when federal authorities are already pursuing similar cases against crypto entities. Impact on other privacy tools: The outcome of the overall Samourai case, both federal and state (or lack thereof), will likely influence how other developers and users of privacy-enhancing crypto tools are viewed and potentially regulated. Future Challenges: Regulatory Clarity: The differing approaches from the AG and DOJ highlight the urgent need for clearer regulatory frameworks regarding cryptocurrency mixing and other privacy technologies. What constitutes a legal privacy tool versus an unlicensed money transmitter or money laundering facilitator? Balancing Privacy and Compliance: Developers face the challenge of building tools that offer users desired privacy features while simultaneously complying with stringent AML/KYC regulations aimed at preventing illicit use. This is a difficult tightrope walk. Global Coordination: Cryptocurrency operates globally, but regulations are often national or even sub-national. Effective enforcement and regulation require international cooperation, which is complex and often slow. Technological Evolution: As regulators develop methods to trace crypto transactions, developers create new privacy techniques, leading to a continuous technological arms race between privacy tools and surveillance capabilities. For users, the actionable insight is to stay informed about the legal status of the services they use, especially those related to privacy or mixing. While privacy is a valid concern, using services deemed illegal by authorities can expose users to significant risks, including asset forfeiture or criminal charges, particularly if the funds involved are linked to illicit activities. Understanding the risks associated with cryptocurrency mixing is paramount. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Samourai Wallet and Crypto Regulation? The news that the New York AG is reportedly considering dropping the state-level crypto lawsuit against the founders of Samourai Wallet marks a potentially significant moment in this ongoing legal saga. While the federal charges brought by the DOJ Crypto unit for alleged money laundering and operating an unlicensed business remain, a withdrawal of state charges could signal a shift in strategy or focus among regulators. This situation underscores the complex and often conflicting approaches taken by different governmental bodies when dealing with novel technologies like cryptocurrency mixing . It highlights the challenges authorities face in applying existing laws to decentralized or privacy-focused tools and the ongoing debate about balancing financial privacy with the need to combat illicit finance. The ultimate outcome of the Samourai Wallet case will likely have lasting implications for how crypto privacy tools are regulated and perceived. It serves as a stark reminder for both developers and users of the regulatory risks inherent in the cryptocurrency space, particularly concerning services that touch upon anonymity and fund flows. As this story develops, the crypto community will be watching closely to see if the New York AG indeed drops the case and, more importantly, how the federal prosecution against the founders of Samourai Wallet proceeds. The resolution of this case will provide valuable insights into the future direction of DOJ Crypto enforcement and the legal status of privacy-enhancing technologies in the digital asset world.

In a bold twist, the company will accept payments in cryptocurrency for condos in its new $1 billion project, Trump Tower Dubai. The modernist community on the site of an airport in the futuristic development is scheduled to start construction in 2025 and will take about five years to build. Eric Trump, one of the sons of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is also the Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, recently announced that the tower will be welcoming Bitcoin and other digital currencies for property purchases. “This is going to be the first large-scale project that takes Bitcoin to buy units,” Eric said. “That’s exciting because I love that world and believe in cryptocurrency.” So far, there is no list of accepted cryptocurrencies, but it is clear only condominium units (not hotel rooms) can be bought with crypto. The condos are expected to be ultra-luxe, costing anywhere from $1 million to $20 million. At the top, there will be penthouses, each expected to fetch $20 million. But, while they make substantial use of crypto, there are no plans for tokenized real estate or blockchain ownership tracking. The new payment alternative will be cryptocurrency, but a real estate model will not emerge. Dar Global joins Trump in Dubai tower deal The Trump family has teamed up again with Dar Global, a London-listed real estate developer that has carved out a name for its luxury projects in the Middle East. This partnership is not new—the two have worked together on Trump-branded developments in Oman and Saudi Arabia. Ziad El Chaar, the CEO of Dar Global, said that the upcoming Trump Tower Dubai is among the most ambitious Trump-branded residential towers in the world. He noted that the statement reflects the project’s magnitude, stature, and symbolic significance in the region and internationally. This further remark is a testament to their ever-increasing belief in Dubai’s capacity as a real estate hub and a leader in innovation around the burgeoning blockchain industry. The Trump Tower Dubai will have an ultra-luxury hotel offering the highest international standards for ultra-high-net-worth travelers and long-stay residents. A members-only clubhouse will further enhance this, The Trump Private, providing members with a dedicated space to network and enjoy private social events. The ultra-luxury condos form the project’s core and feature design excellence, futuristic technology, and all-encompassing vistas of Dubai’s skyline. While Trump Tower Dubai’s location hasn’t been revealed, reports say it will stand in a major part of the fast-growing city. Finer details of the site, architecture, and interior will be released by the end of 2025. Construction will start in late 2025, and the development is anticipated to be fully built by 2030. Upon completion, Trump Tower Dubai is set to revolutionize luxury living in the city and mark a milestone in the era of cryptocurrency and real estate luxury. Crypto buyers flock to Dubai’s booming market Dubai is part of the world’s fastest-growing luxury property market. Dubai is also an emergent cryptocurrency center, attracting blockchain companies, investors, and tech leaders. That makes it a perfect fit for a crypto-centric luxury project like Trump Tower Dubai. Accepting crypto payments falls into this category. It could help rewrite the rules on how high-end real estate is bought and sold internationally. Eric Trump is also scheduled to appear at TOKEN2049, one of the biggest crypto conferences in Dubai. There, he can market the project to crypto investors and fans.

In an April 29 X post, tech commentator Jacob Canfield shared a scam letter sent to his home via post that appeared to be from Ledger claiming he needed to immediately perform a “critical security update” on his device. The letter, which uses Ledger’s logo, business address, and a reference number to feign legitimacy, asks to scan a QR code and enter the wallet’s private recovery phrase under the guise of validating the device. The letter threatens that “failure to complete this mandatory validation process may result in restricted access to your wallet and funds.” Source: Jacob Canfield A seed phrase, or recovery phrase, is a string of up to 24 words that unlocks access to a crypto wallet. A scammer with the phrase can access and control the associated wallet to transfer its holdings elsewhere. Earlier this month, the X account of a crypto hardware wallet reseller said it had also received multiple reports of Ledger users receiving a similar letter. In response to Canfield’s post, Ledger said the letter is a scam and cautioned its device users to stay vigilant against phishing attempts . Related: Ledger wallet user reports 10 BTC loss — Community blames phishing “Ledger will never call, DM [direct message], or ask for your 24-word recovery phrase. If someone does, it's a scam,” it added. “Please don't engage with accounts claiming to be Ledger employees or anyone offering to help recover funds.” Unclear whether connected to the Ledger’s data leak Canfield suggested that scammers were sending letters to Ledger customers whose data was leaked nearly five years ago. In July 2020, a hacker breached Ledger’s database and dumped the personal information of more than 270,000 of its customers online, which included names, phone numbers and home addresses The following year, several Ledger users claimed to have been mailed fake Ledger devices that were tampered with and designed to install malware upon use, Bleeping Computer reported at the time.

43967732,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153924,1745977849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Donald Trump’s Market Focus: Shocking Claim by Commerce Secretary Lutnick,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/donald-trump-market-focus/,"In a surprising turn of events reported via the Walter Bloomberg account on X, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has reportedly stated that former President Donald Trump is not focused on the US Markets . This claim, coming from a high-ranking economic official, raises significant questions about potential future economic approaches and their implications for investors and the broader financial landscape, including areas like the cryptocurrency market which often reacts to macro-economic signals and political rhetoric. Why Does a President’s Market Focus Matter? Understanding a president’s approach to financial markets and Economic Policy is crucial because presidential actions, statements, and priorities can directly and indirectly influence market sentiment, regulatory environments, and overall economic stability. When a figure like the Commerce Secretary suggests a lack of Market Focus , it prompts speculation: Does this mean a different set of priorities will guide economic decisions? Could it lead to less predictable policy interventions or a hands-off approach? How might this perception of focus (or lack thereof) impact investor confidence, both domestically and internationally? Historically, presidential administrations have often paid close attention to market performance, viewing it as a barometer of economic health and a reflection of their policies’ success. Therefore, a statement suggesting a departure from this traditional focus is noteworthy. Exploring the Claim: What Could ‘Not Focused’ Mean? The exact meaning behind Secretary Lutnick’s reported statement that Donald Trump is ‘not focused on the markets’ is open to interpretation. It could imply several things: Prioritizing Other Areas: Perhaps Trump’s current or future economic agenda places greater emphasis on areas like trade negotiations, specific industry support, or regulatory reform, with less direct attention paid to the day-to-day fluctuations of stock indices or bond yields. A Different Economic Philosophy: It might suggest a belief that markets are best left to operate with minimal presidential commentary or intervention, a contrast to periods where presidential tweets or speeches directly addressed market movements. Focus on Underlying Economy: The focus might be more on fundamental economic factors like job creation, GDP growth, or inflation control, assuming that healthy fundamentals will naturally support strong markets, rather than focusing on market levels themselves. Without further context from Secretary Lutnick or clarification from Trump’s camp, the statement remains a subject of significant discussion among economic analysts and political observers. It’s one of those Presidential Statements that can spark considerable debate and analysis. Potential Implications for US Markets and Beyond A perceived lack of direct presidential Market Focus could have various implications for the US Markets : Increased Uncertainty: Markets often prefer clear communication and predictable policy frameworks. If investors perceive that market stability is not a primary concern, it could introduce a layer of uncertainty, potentially leading to increased volatility. Policy Surprises: Decisions related to trade, regulation, or fiscal spending might be made with less consideration for their immediate market reaction, potentially leading to unexpected market movements. Shift in Administration Communication: It could signal a change in how an administration communicates with the public and investors regarding economic matters, potentially relying less on market performance as a key metric of success. For the cryptocurrency market, which is already influenced by a complex mix of technological developments, regulatory news, and traditional market sentiment, increased uncertainty in the traditional US Markets could contribute to volatility. Some investors might view crypto as a hedge against traditional market instability, while others might see it as an asset class that could suffer during periods of broad economic uncertainty. How Have Past Presidential Statements Impacted Markets? History shows that Presidential Statements can indeed move markets. During his previous term, Donald Trump’s tweets and remarks on trade, interest rates, and specific companies were often followed by noticeable market reactions. This highlights the power of the presidential platform and why Secretary Lutnick’s comment about Trump’s current Market Focus is being discussed. Consider the impact of statements on: Trade negotiations (e.g., tariffs on China) Federal Reserve policy Specific industry regulations These examples underscore why market participants pay close attention to the President’s priorities and communication style regarding the economy and financial systems. Challenges and Considerations for Investors Secretary Lutnick’s reported statement presents a potential challenge for investors who rely on clear signals from policymakers. Here are some considerations: Navigating Uncertainty: Investors may need to prepare for potentially less predictable market reactions to future policy announcements if market impact is not a primary consideration in decision-making. Focus on Fundamentals: The emphasis might shift further towards analyzing the underlying fundamentals of companies and sectors, as well as broader economic indicators, rather than trying to anticipate market-specific political interventions. Diversification: In times of potential policy-driven volatility, diversification across different asset classes, including potentially uncorrelated assets, becomes even more important. Staying Informed: Paying close attention to official statements, policy proposals, and the interpretations from trusted economic analysts will be key to understanding the potential impact on the US Markets . Understanding the nuances of an administration’s approach to Economic Policy is vital for making informed investment decisions. Connecting the Dots: Economic Policy, Markets, and Crypto While Secretary Lutnick’s comment is directly about Donald Trump and the traditional US Markets , it exists within a larger economic context that absolutely impacts the crypto world. Macroeconomic conditions, interest rates, inflation, and regulatory approaches to finance all influence investor behavior and capital flows, which in turn affect the cryptocurrency market. If a future administration’s Economic Policy leads to significant shifts in inflation or interest rates, or if their regulatory philosophy towards finance evolves (which could include views on digital assets), these changes would undoubtedly ripple through the crypto market. A perceived lack of Market Focus in the traditional sense doesn’t necessarily mean a lack of focus on the broader economy or specific sectors relevant to crypto. Therefore, for crypto investors, this statement serves as a reminder to look beyond just crypto-specific news and understand the broader macroeconomic and political landscape. Presidential Statements , even those seemingly unrelated to digital assets, can contribute to the overall climate of risk tolerance and investment strategy. Summary: Interpreting the Signals U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s reported remark that Donald Trump is ‘not focused on the markets’ is a significant piece of information for anyone observing U.S. Economic Policy and the potential direction of the US Markets . While brief, this statement from a key official highlights the potential for a different approach to the relationship between the presidency and financial markets compared to traditional norms or even Trump’s own past interactions. Understanding the potential implications of this perceived lack of Market Focus – from increased uncertainty to a shift in policy priorities – is crucial for investors navigating the current and future economic climate. As always, staying informed about official statements, analyzing potential policy impacts, and maintaining a diversified strategy remain key principles for approaching both traditional and cryptocurrency markets in an environment influenced by such significant Presidential Statements .

The meme coin, which is now trading at $0.17, has recorded a 10% gain in the last week and continues to be up 11% over a 14-day period. Related Reading: XRP Headed For $1,000 – CryptoGuard Exec Drops Bold Prediction Bullish Divergence Indicates Possible Upswing Based on Crypto Bio’s analysis, two separate bullish divergence patterns have emerged on Dogecoin’s chart. The first was seen between June and August 2024, when prices fell to between $0.07 and $0.09 while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) made higher lows. It was followed by a large-scale rally that saw DOGE rise above $0.40 by December 2024. Another pattern with a similar scenario has been developed between the periods of March and April 2025. Although Dogecoin’s value printed lower lows near $0.1300, the RSI once more produced higher lows. Based on such technical features, certain experts anticipate that DOGE might find itself at $0.5 over the coming two or three months. The Math Behind ‘Dogecoin Millionaires’ There are discussions about new ‘Dogecoin millionaires’ that have excited investors. The figures, though, paint a more serious picture. Assuming a price of $0.5, a $10,000 investment would become around $27,530 – a gain of $17,530. $DOGE is waking up. The same signs, the same setup. Millionaires will be made in the next 2-3 months!🔥#DOGECOIN 🚀🚀 pic.twitter.com/mKQjjglJiO — Crypto Bio (@CryptoBio_) April 27, 2025 In order to actually become a millionaire if DOGE reaches $0.5, an investor would need to have around 2 million coins, currently valued at around $360,000. According to Crypto Bio, given all these figures and probabilities, “millionaires will be made in the next two to three months.” This reality check underscores the vast amount of money required to meet the ‘millionaire’ goal that is utilized to recruit prospective investors in the cryptocurrency. Technical Support From Parabolic Trendline Another analyst, “abermix,” notes that Dogecoin is presently riding a long-term parabolic trendline that started around $0.05 during 2022-2023. Although there were numerous tries to fall below this curve at different price levels ($0.06, $0.08, and $0.14), DOGE has repeatedly jumped back to hold ground above the line. $doge is conforming to this parabolic trendline at the moment idk if it’s valid but it looks like it xD can we expect a bounce soon?#Dogecoin pic.twitter.com/moQHd7WCpt — abermix (@abermixcrypto) April 27, 2025 Related Reading: Justin Sun Bets Big On JUST Token – Here’s Why He Sees 100x Potential The price is trading slightly below both short-term and long-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) currently. Experts believe that a breakout above $0.20 will validate a larger trend reversal and open the doors for further advances. Falling Wedge Formation Adds To Bullish Outlook According to April 25 reports, Dogecoin has extricated itself from a “falling wedge” formation that had placed it in a downtrend for many months. Previous levels of resistance were tested in February at $0.28 and April at $0.16. Market observers comment that although these technical indicators look encouraging, cryptocurrency prices are extremely volatile. The present price movement comes after several months of horizontal trading following DOGE’s peak at $0.19, and any investment choice should account for the volatility of the market.

A recent analysis from Fidelity Digital Assets suggests this might be the case, offering a glimmer of hope for investors watching the Ethereum Price navigate challenging market conditions. Fidelity, a major player in traditional finance increasingly active in the crypto space, released a report highlighting signals that Ethereum (ETH) could be potentially undervalued. This assessment isn’t based on simple price action but dives into the underlying health and activity of the network itself, leveraging sophisticated Crypto On-Chain Metrics. What Does the Fidelity Ethereum Report Tell Us? The core of the latest Fidelity Ethereum Report points to specific on-chain data indicators that historically correlate with market bottoms or periods of significant undervaluation. Despite a notable 45% drop in Ethereum’s price during the first quarter of 2025, these metrics paint a different picture of the network’s fundamental state. Fidelity specifically cited metrics such as the MVRV Z-Score and the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio. Let’s break down briefly what these mean and why they matter: MVRV Z-Score: This metric compares Ethereum’s market capitalization (the total value of all ETH coins) to its realized capitalization (the sum of the prices at which each ETH was last moved). The Z-score normalizes this data. Low Z-scores often indicate that the market value has fallen significantly below the ‘fair value’ based on when coins were last transacted, historically signaling potential buying opportunities or market capitulation. NUPL Ratio: This metric calculates the overall profit or loss status of the Ethereum network’s investors. It’s the difference between market cap and realized cap, divided by market cap. A low or negative NUPL suggests that a large portion of the network’s investors are holding ETH at a loss, another sign often associated with market capitulation and potential bottoms as weaker hands sell off. According to the Cointelegraph report on Fidelity’s findings, these metrics are currently showing signs indicative of market capitulation, a phase where investors who bought at higher prices finally give up and sell, often marking the tail end of a bear trend. Beyond Price: The Strength of Ethereum Layer 2 While the spot Ethereum Price has faced headwinds, the Fidelity report doesn’t ignore the underlying activity. In fact, it highlights a critical counter-trend: the booming activity on Ethereum Layer 2 networks. Layer 2 solutions, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and Polygon (in its zkEVM form), are built on top of the main Ethereum blockchain to increase transaction speed and reduce costs. Their health and activity are strong indicators of real-world adoption and demand for the Ethereum ecosystem. Fidelity’s report noted that Layer 2 network activity hit a record 13.6 million active addresses during the same period the price was falling. This is a significant figure and suggests: Growing User Adoption: More users are actively engaging with decentralized applications (dApps) and services built within the Ethereum ecosystem, preferring the scalability and lower fees offered by Layer 2s. Network Utility: Despite price volatility, the fundamental utility and demand for interacting with Ethereum-based protocols remain high. Future Potential: The growth of Layer 2s is crucial for Ethereum’s long-term scalability vision, indicating a healthy expansion of its user base and potential for future growth, which could eventually be reflected in the Ethereum Price. This divergence between price performance and network activity is a key element in the argument that ETH may be Undervalued from a fundamental perspective. So, Is ETH Undervalued Right Now? Based on the Fidelity Ethereum Report , the on-chain signals like low MVRV Z-Score and NUPL ratios strongly suggest that the market is currently in a phase historically associated with undervaluation and capitulation. The robust activity on Ethereum Layer 2 networks further supports the idea that underlying demand and adoption are strong, despite the price dip. However, Fidelity’s stance is one of cautious optimism. While the signals are compelling, the report also includes a crucial warning: past market trends show that even after capitulation signals appear, further price declines are still possible before a definitive recovery takes hold. Markets can remain irrational longer than investors might expect. This means that while the fundamental picture looks increasingly strong, the short-term Ethereum Price remains subject to broader market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and potential further sell-offs. Actionable Insights for Investors What can investors take away from this Fidelity Ethereum Report and the current market situation? Look Beyond Price: Don’t solely focus on the daily or weekly price charts. Pay attention to fundamental metrics like Crypto On-Chain Metrics and network activity, especially on Ethereum Layer 2 networks. These provide deeper insights into the network’s health and adoption. Understand Capitulation: Recognize that capitulation phases can be painful but historically precede periods of recovery. While challenging emotionally, these times can present opportunities for long-term investors if the underlying fundamentals remain strong. Long-Term Perspective: The record Layer 2 activity is a bullish signal for Ethereum’s future. It demonstrates that the ecosystem is growing and adapting, building scalable infrastructure that will be essential for mass adoption. This long-term growth potential is key when assessing if ETH is Undervalued. Risk Management: Fidelity’s caution is warranted. Market timing is difficult. Consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging to build a position over time, mitigating the risk of investing a lump sum right before a potential further dip. Conclusion: A Complex Picture for Ethereum The latest Fidelity Ethereum Report presents a compelling argument that, from a fundamental perspective, the market may be significantly undervaluing ETH. The signals from key Crypto On-Chain Metrics point towards a capitulation phase, while the surging activity on Ethereum Layer 2 networks underscores robust and growing adoption. However, the report wisely balances this optimism with a reminder that historical patterns suggest volatility and potential further downside cannot be ruled out in the short term. For investors, this paints a complex but potentially opportunistic picture: fundamental strength meets short-term market uncertainty. Ultimately, the question of whether ETH is Undervalued depends on your investment horizon and tolerance for risk. But insights from institutions like Fidelity, combined with objective on-chain data, provide valuable tools for navigating the volatile world of crypto and assessing the true potential of the Ethereum Price.

43968620,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153888,1745979610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial SEC Decision on Grayscale Spot ETH ETF Staking Postponed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/grayscale-eth-etf-postponed/,"The cryptocurrency market is once again watching the regulators closely. A significant development has emerged from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), impacting the potential launch of a new investment product that many investors are eagerly anticipating. The SEC has officially postponed its decision regarding Grayscale Investments’ proposal for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund ( Spot ETH ETF ) that includes a feature allowing for the staking of the underlying Ethereum (ETH) held by the fund. Understanding the SEC ‘s Latest Move on Grayscale ‘s Proposal This recent postponement by the SEC concerns the application filed by Grayscale , a prominent crypto asset management firm. Grayscale is seeking approval to convert its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ethereum ETF . What makes this particular application stand out is the inclusion of a staking component. This means the fund would not only hold ETH directly (spot) but would also engage in Crypto Staking using a portion of that ETH to earn yield. The decision deadline was extended, pushing back the timeline for potential approval or disapproval. This is not an uncommon move by the SEC when reviewing complex or novel financial products, especially those involving cryptocurrencies, which the regulator often views with caution. Here’s a quick breakdown of what’s involved: Applicant: Grayscale Investments Product Proposed: Spot Ethereum ETF with a staking feature Underlying Asset: Ethereum (ETH) Regulator: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Latest Action: Decision Postponed Why is a Spot ETH ETF Significant? A Spot ETH ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency themselves. This simplifies access, potentially attracts traditional investors, and integrates crypto into existing brokerage accounts and retirement funds. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year demonstrated the significant market demand and potential impact of such products. For many, a Spot ETH ETF is seen as the next logical step following Bitcoin ETF approvals. It could open up substantial capital inflows into the Ethereum ecosystem, similar to what was observed with Bitcoin. The Unique Angle: Including Crypto Staking The staking feature proposed by Grayscale adds a layer of complexity and novelty to their Ethereum ETF application. Crypto Staking is a process specific to proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum, where participants lock up their cryptocurrency to support the network’s operations and earn rewards in return. Including this in an ETF would mean the fund could potentially generate additional returns for investors beyond just the appreciation of ETH’s price. This aspect is likely a key reason for the SEC ‘s careful deliberation. Regulators are still navigating how to classify and oversee various aspects of the crypto market. The income generated from staking could be viewed differently from capital gains, potentially raising questions about fund structure, investor protection, and compliance with existing securities laws. What Does the SEC Decision Postponement Mean for the Market? The postponement of the SEC decision creates continued uncertainty in the market regarding the timeline for potential Ethereum ETF approvals. While delays are common, they can temper enthusiasm and lead to price volatility as traders react to the news. It suggests the SEC is taking its time to thoroughly evaluate the proposal, particularly the innovative staking component. This decision impacts not only Grayscale but also other firms that have filed for spot Ethereum ETF s. The SEC ‘s approach to Grayscale ‘s application, especially concerning staking, could set a precedent for how other similar applications are handled. Key implications include: Extended Uncertainty: Investors and the market must wait longer for clarity on the future of spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. Regulatory Scrutiny: The staking feature is clearly under intense review by the SEC. Potential Precedent: The outcome of this decision could influence the structure of other proposed ETH ETFs. Market Reaction: The news might contribute to cautious sentiment around Ethereum and related assets in the short term. Challenges and Regulatory Hurdles The path to getting crypto ETFs approved in the U.S. has been a long one, marked by numerous delays and rejections before the spot Bitcoin ETFs finally received the green light. The SEC has historically expressed concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. For Ethereum ETF s, additional questions arise regarding Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake and the regulatory implications of staking activities. The SEC has previously suggested that certain staking services might constitute securities, adding another layer of complexity to applications that include this feature. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For Investors and market observers should keep a close eye on future deadlines set by the SEC for Grayscale ‘s application and others. Pay attention to any commentary or statements from SEC officials that might shed light on their specific concerns regarding staking or the Ethereum market itself. The outcome of this and other Ethereum ETF applications will be a significant indicator of the regulatory trajectory for crypto investment products in the U.S. Summary: Waiting Game Continues for Grayscale ‘s Staked Ethereum ETF In conclusion, the SEC ‘s decision to postpone its ruling on Grayscale ‘s proposed spot Ethereum ETF , particularly one incorporating Crypto Staking , highlights the ongoing regulatory caution surrounding novel crypto investment products. While delays are common, this specific postponement underscores the complexity introduced by the staking component and the SEC ‘s detailed review process. The market awaits further clarity, with the outcome having potential implications for the broader adoption and accessibility of Ethereum as an investment asset in traditional finance.

There are currently 427 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), but the agency said on April 29 that it suspects a significant number are inactive and possibly vulnerable to being bought and co-opted by criminals . The agency is contacting any so-called digital currency exchanges (DCEs) that appear to no longer be trading, and AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said they’ll be told to “use it or lose it.” “Businesses registered with AUSTRAC are required to keep their details up to date; this includes details about services that are no longer provided,” he added. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas says scammers can use inactive crypto firms to appear legitimate. Source: AUSTRAC Businesses wanting to offer Australians conversions between cash and crypto, including crypto ATM providers, must first register with AUSTRAC, which monitors for crimes including money laundering, terror financing and tax evasion. The agency can cancel a registration if it has reasonable grounds to believe the business is no longer active or offering crypto-related services. Ten firms have had their AUSTRAC registration canceled since 2019, with the most recent being FTX Express in June 2024 , the local subsidiary of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX. AUSTRAC to launch public list of registered exchanges Following its blitz on inactive crypto exchanges, AUSTRAC said it will publish a list of registered exchanges to help Australians verify legitimate providers. Thomas said the goal is to make it harder for criminals to scam people and improve the integrity and accuracy of AUSTRAC's register. “If a DCE does intend to offer a service, they need to contact us otherwise we will cancel the registration and this information will be added to the register,” he said. “Members of the public should feel confident that they can identify legitimate cryptocurrency providers that are registered and subject to regulatory oversight and that we are driving criminals out of this industry,” Thomas added. Related: Australia’s top court sides with Block Earner, dismisses ASIC appeal In February, the Anti-Money Laundering regulator took action against 13 remittance service providers and crypto exchanges, with over 50 others still being investigated regarding possible compliance issues. Six providers were refused registration renewal on the grounds that key personnel were either convicted, prosecuted, or charged with a serious offense. Australia has yet to pass crypto regulations. In August 2022, the ruling center-left Labor Party initiated a series of industry consultations to draft a crypto regulatory framework . In March, the government proposed a new crypto framework regulating exchanges under existing financial services laws ahead of a federal election slated for May 3.

While established players like Solana (SOL) maintain strong momentum, emerging networks like Optimism (OP), SEI, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are quickly becoming focal points for tactical investors seeking strategic exposure. Which project is best positioned to lead the next major market cycle? Here’s how these contenders are shaping up. Solana (SOL): Consolidation Before a Bigger Move? Solana is holding strong at $148.69 as it gains 7.99% for the past week. The trading volume increased 64.13%, showing a strong return of interest in the network, which dominates DeFi, NFTs, etc. Community sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish, with 85% of votes favoring continued upside. Traders see that SOL coin is currently consolidating just below the critical $150 psychological level. If prices can stay above this level, it could open the door to further gains but, given competitive Layer-1s, volatility is a possibility. Optimism (OP): Layer-2 Strength Meets Long-Term Vision Optimism (OP) is trading at $0.7817, up 7.02% this week. OP has benefited from an increase in Ethereum Layer-2 adoption, while there has been a 20% increase in volume activity in the last 24 hours which suggests the investor base is strengthening. Although Optimism is not a Layer-1 (it is built on top of the Ethereum), unlike Ethereum, its significance concerning scaling solutions means it is competing for throughput. The experts are evaluating the OP’s ability to sustainably move through the $0.85 to $0.90 resistance band. Whale activity suggests increasing confidence in its Layer-2 positioning as Ethereum’s roadmap progresses. SEI: Emerging Challenger with Growing Momentum SEI, priced at $0.2111, is one of the strongest performers among small projects, with a 16.17% 7-day gain. The trading volume has increased 115.23% showing growing interest among the investors. The interest in SEI’s optimized Layer-1 design focused on order book-based DEXs is growing. The network gains an edge in a growing space, thanks to its agility and ability to facilitate quick transactions. The overall sentiment in SEI is decidedly bullish, according to the report. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Strategic Early-Stage Positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE remains a standout for those targeting early-stage, asymmetric opportunities. Trading under $0.01 , it’s still largely undiscovered compared to SOL, OP, and SEI, yet it boasts a strong foundation built on scarcity-driven tokenomics, a community-first strategy, and no centralized exchange dilution. Top analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE’s roadmap, which includes pre-listing positioning, staged growth models, and whale accumulation trends that mirror patterns seen before previous major crypto runs. With early access limited to direct purchase through magacoinfinance.com, investors view MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare setup for significant upside without competing against entrenched institutional flows — at least for now. Final Takeaway Solana continues to offer resilience, Optimism is cementing itself as a critical Ethereum solution, and SEI is gaining ground fast. Yet for those seeking the sharper edge of early-stage opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a compelling candidate to lead the next layer-1 narrative into 2025. Positioning early could make all the difference as the next wave unfolds.

43968893,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153890,1745980208,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,USDT Minting: Massive 1 Billion Surge Reported by Tether Treasury,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usdt-minting-tether-treasury/,"In the fast-paced world of digital assets, news travels quickly, and few events grab the attention of traders and investors quite like significant movements involving stablecoins. Recently, the cryptocurrency community buzzed with a report from Whale Alert indicating a massive USDT minting event: 1 billion USDT was created at the Tether Treasury . This isn’t just a number; it’s a development that carries potential implications for the entire crypto market . But what exactly does a mint of this size signify, and why does it matter for anyone involved in or watching the digital asset space? Let’s dive into the details and explore what this means for the liquidity, stability, and overall dynamics of the market. Understanding USDT: The King of Stablecoins Before we dissect the implications of a 1 billion USDT mint, it’s crucial to understand what USDT is and why it holds such a dominant position. USDT is a stablecoin issued by Tether Limited. Its primary goal is to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. This stability makes it a crucial bridge between traditional fiat currency and volatile cryptocurrencies. Think of stablecoins as the reliable anchors in the often turbulent crypto seas. They allow traders to: Lock in profits without converting back to traditional currency. Move funds quickly and cheaply between exchanges. Participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Avoid the volatility of assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum during market downturns. Among stablecoins, USDT has historically held the largest market capitalization and trading volume, making it the most widely used stable asset in the crypto ecosystem. Why Does Tether Mint USDT? The Role of Demand The minting of new USDT isn’t a random event. According to Tether, new tokens are created in response to market demand. When individuals or institutions want to acquire large amounts of USDT – perhaps to deposit onto an exchange for trading or to use in DeFi applications – they typically purchase it directly from Tether or authorized partners. Tether then mints the corresponding amount of USDT and places it into circulation, supposedly backed by reserves. This process is intended to maintain the peg. If the price of USDT on exchanges rises slightly above $1 due to high demand, Tether can mint and sell new USDT, increasing supply and pushing the price back towards the peg. Conversely, if the price falls below $1, holders can redeem USDT with Tether for traditional currency, reducing supply and supporting the price. A mint of 1 billion USDT, as reported by Whale Alert at the Tether Treasury , suggests a significant anticipated or existing demand for USDT in the market. This could stem from various sources: Increased institutional interest in crypto. Retail investors entering or re-entering the market. Growing activity in DeFi protocols requiring stablecoins. Exchanges needing more liquidity to facilitate trading pairs. Decoding the Tether Treasury Whale Alert specifically noted that the 1 billion USDT was minted at the Tether Treasury . It’s important to understand what this signifies. The Tether Treasury acts somewhat like an internal holding account for Tether Limited. When USDT is minted, it’s often initially sent to this treasury address. Crucially, tokens in the Tether Treasury are not immediately considered to be in circulation in the broader market. They are essentially authorized but not yet distributed to exchanges or users. The movement of USDT from the Tether Treasury to exchanges or other wallets is the step that indicates the tokens are entering circulation and becoming available for trading and use. So, while the minting event itself signals Tether’s readiness to meet demand, the actual impact on market liquidity depends on when and where these tokens are moved from the treasury. Monitoring outflows from the Tether Treasury address provides further clues about where this new supply is heading and its potential market impact. What Does This Massive USDT Mint Signal for the Crypto Market? A 1 billion USDT mint is a substantial event and can be interpreted in several ways regarding the state and potential direction of the crypto market . 1. Increased Demand and Liquidity: The most direct interpretation is that there is significant demand for stablecoins, specifically USDT. This demand often comes from participants preparing to buy other cryptocurrencies. Increased USDT supply provides more liquidity, making it easier to execute large trades without causing significant price slippage. 2. Potential for Inflows into Risk Assets: While not a guarantee, large USDT mints are often seen as a precursor to capital potentially flowing into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Traders and institutions acquire USDT to have readily available capital to deploy when they see buying opportunities. 3. Market Sentiment Indicator: Some analysts view large stablecoin mints as a bullish signal, suggesting that significant capital is being positioned on the sidelines, ready to enter the market. Conversely, large redemptions or burns of stablecoins might indicate capital flowing out of the market. 4. Arbitrage Opportunities: Increased liquidity from new USDT supply can facilitate arbitrage strategies between different exchanges, helping to keep prices aligned across platforms. It’s vital to remember that minting is just one side of the coin. The true impact unfolds as these funds move from the Tether Treasury and are utilized in the market. Observing the destination of these funds (e.g., major exchanges) provides more concrete evidence of their intended use. Implications for the Stablecoin Ecosystem While USDT dominates, it exists within a growing ecosystem of stablecoin competitors like USDC, BUSD, DAI, etc. A large USDT mint reinforces its leading position but also highlights the overall growth in the demand for stable digital assets. The increasing reliance on stablecoins underscores several key trends: The maturation of the crypto market, requiring more sophisticated tools for hedging and trading. The expansion of DeFi, which heavily relies on stable assets for lending, borrowing, and yield farming. The potential for stablecoins to be used in traditional finance or cross-border payments, although regulatory hurdles remain significant. However, the dominance of one stablecoin issuer also raises questions about centralization and systemic risk, which we will touch upon later. Are There Concerns Around Large USDT Mints and Tether? Despite USDT’s utility and widespread adoption, Tether has faced scrutiny and controversy over the years. A large minting event inevitably brings these concerns back into the spotlight. 1. Reserve Transparency: The most persistent criticism revolves around the backing of USDT. Tether claims each USDT is backed by reserves, including cash, cash equivalents, and other assets. However, the exact composition and sufficiency of these reserves have been questioned, leading to regulatory actions and ongoing debate. 2. Centralization: Tether is a centralized entity. The power to mint or burn billions of dollars worth of tokens resides with a single company, which contrasts with the decentralized ethos of much of the crypto space. This centralization introduces potential counterparty risk and reliance on Tether’s management and compliance. 3. Market Influence: The ability to inject billions of dollars of liquidity into the market has led to accusations (though largely unsubstantiated or debated) that Tether could potentially influence crypto prices. While Tether maintains minting is demand-driven, the sheer volume of USDT in existence gives it significant weight. While a 1 billion USDT mint is a mechanical process tied to anticipated demand according to Tether, the context of these ongoing discussions is important for any market participant to consider. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Market For traders and investors, a significant USDT minting event offers several points to consider: Monitor Flows: Keep an eye on where the newly minted USDT from the Tether Treasury is sent. Movements to major exchanges could indicate potential buying pressure on other assets. Understand the Nuance: Remember that minting isn’t the same as circulation. The tokens are only liquid and market-impacting once they leave the treasury wallet. Assess Market Context: Consider the minting event alongside other market factors – overall sentiment, news headlines, technical indicators – rather than as an isolated signal. Diversify Stablecoin Risk: If you hold significant value in stablecoins, consider diversifying across different issuers (like USDC, DAI) to mitigate risks associated with a single entity, especially given the concerns surrounding Tether. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from Tether and reputable crypto news sources to understand the reported reasons behind large mints and updates on reserve audits or regulatory matters. Historical Context: Past Minting Events Large USDT mints are not new. Over the years, as the crypto market has grown, minting events of hundreds of millions or even billions of USDT have occurred periodically. Often, these events have coincided with periods of increased market activity or anticipation. For example, significant mints were observed during the bull runs of 2017 and 2020-2021, correlating with surging demand for crypto assets. While correlation doesn’t equal causation, the historical pattern reinforces the idea that large mints are typically linked to periods where more stablecoin liquidity is needed to facilitate trading volume and capital flows within the ecosystem. The Growing Role of Stablecoins in the Future Regardless of the debates surrounding Tether, the role of the stablecoin in the digital economy is undeniable and likely to grow. They provide the necessary stability for various applications, from trading and lending to potentially everyday payments in the future. Regulatory bodies worldwide are increasingly focusing on stablecoins due to their potential systemic importance. Future regulations will likely shape how stablecoins are issued, backed, and used, potentially increasing transparency and oversight for issuers like Tether. The 1 billion USDT mint is a reminder of the scale at which stablecoins operate and their integral role in the current crypto financial infrastructure. It highlights the continuous flow of capital within the system and the mechanisms stablecoin issuers use to meet market demand. Conclusion: A Signal of Activity The report of 1 billion USDT being minted at the Tether Treasury is a significant data point for anyone tracking the crypto market . While the tokens aren’t immediately in circulation, the minting signals Tether’s anticipation of considerable demand for its stablecoin. This demand is often linked to participants positioning themselves for trading or investment activities within the ecosystem. Understanding the process of USDT minting , the function of the Tether Treasury, and the broader context of stablecoins provides valuable insight into the mechanics of the digital asset market. While concerns surrounding transparency and centralization persist, the utility and demand for USDT remain high, making events like this noteworthy indicators of potential shifts in market liquidity and activity.

43969779,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=30438,1745981632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,Why Arizona Might Not Become the First US State to Create a Bitcoin Reserve,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/why-arizona-might-not-become-the-first-us-state-to-create-a-bitcoin-reserve/,"In a landmark move that could set a national precedent, Arizona lawmakers have passed two innovative bills designed to integrate Bitcoin and other digital assets into the state’s financial infrastructure. If signed into law, these measures would make Arizona the first U.S. state to establish a formal Bitcoin reserve. Two Key Bills Receive Legislative Approval The Arizona House of Representatives passed Senate Bill 1025 and Senate Bill 1373 , both of which are now on Governor Katie Hobbs’ desk awaiting final approval. SB 1025 enables the state to allocate up to 10% of its treasury and pension assets into digital assets, including Bitcoin. Meanwhile, SB 1373 lays the foundation for a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund , designed to hold and manage these crypto assets for future use. Together, the bills represent a strategic pivot toward blockchain-based asset management, aligning Arizona with other crypto-forward states such as Texas, Florida, and New Hampshire. Funded by Seized Crypto and Future Appropriations The legislation authorizes the use of seized digital assets as well as future budget appropriations to fund the reserve. These assets will be managed under strict audit protocols, featuring on-chain transparency and risk controls to ensure responsible stewardship. Supporters argue that integrating Bitcoin into Arizona’s financial strategy could offer protection against inflation and traditional market volatility. The effort marks a bold step into crypto adoption at the state level—one that could ripple across the country if successful. Bitcoin Prices Surge Amid Legislative Buzz Shortly after the bills passed, Bitcoin’s price surged to nearly $95,000 , a 25% increase from early-April lows. The price jump appears to be driven by renewed institutional interest and speculation over state-level crypto integration. Crypto analysts view Arizona’s move as a confidence boost for broader adoption, potentially attracting similar initiatives elsewhere. If implemented, the state-backed reserve could serve as a blueprint for how governments can securely incorporate decentralized finance into their public asset strategies. Governor Hobbs’ Decision Looms Governor Hobbs has not yet taken a public position on the bills. Previously, she had threatened to veto all legislation over unresolved disability funding disputes.

Priced at just $0.007125 during its presale and having already raised over $19.6 million, Lightchain AI is turning heads with serious momentum. These days, investors are more immune to hype. Profitable market punters bet on projects with solid roadmaps, robust community support, and future-proof plans. SHIB falls flat in many of these categories, riding high on the waves of speculation. On the other hand, there’s Lightchain AI , building steady value from the ground up. When smart money traders are presented with both options, the correct option is immediately apparent. Why Lightchain AI Could Outshine Shiba Inu in 2025 Although Shiba Inu received its fair share of headlines during its viral ascent, 2025 is emerging as the year of investments with substance and long-term promise. And that’s where Lightchain AI comes in – a revolutionary platform that combines the best of artificial intelligence with blockchain. SHIB is a big beneficiary of community hype. However, that form of support is limited in scope. It doesn’t compare favorably with a project like Lightchain AI that enjoys multi-dimensional backing in the form of strong institutional support based on its real-world innovation. Based on a decentralized architecture, Lightchain AI is the platform to easily merge AI with your existing systems (if you like too, APIs, SDKs, developer resources, you see: there’s more than one)ん. This is an environment where creator can implement AI models, process tasks and construct sophisticated applications for a more smarter, more effective technological future. And far from marching to the tune, Lightchain AI is calling the shots – carving out a new era in decentralized intelligence. A future that isn’t just promising for investors who are hungry for growth and real innovation—it’s driven by Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI – Poised for Q2 2025 Lightchain AI is poised for a breakout in Q2 2025, driven by its intelligent architecture and inclusive innovation strategy. Its streamlined workflow and data flow systems efficiently distribute AI tasks across decentralized nodes, allowing for real-time processing and cryptographic verification of results. This ensures smooth, secure operations even at scale. A key differentiator is Lightchain AI’s focus on mitigating bias through federated learning, which trains models on diverse data sources without exposing sensitive information—promoting fairness and inclusivity. Additionally, its meme coin launchpad offers a unique, AI-enhanced space for launching creative, community-driven tokens in a secure, decentralized environment. Together, these elements position Lightchain AI as both a technical powerhouse and a dynamic hub for blockchain culture in 2025. How to Snag Your Lightchain AI (LCAI) Tokens Ready to join the AI revolution and snag some LCAI tokens before everyone else? Lucky you— Lightchain AI is in its exclusive presale phase, meaning you get first dibs at discounted rates before the public goes wild. Getting started is easier than explaining crypto to your grandma. First, set up a decentralized wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet (pro tip: make sure it’s set for the Ethereum network—ERC-20 is the vibe). Then, fuel up your wallet with some Ethereum (ETH), which you can grab from platforms like Coinbase or Binance. Now for the fun part; head over to the official Lightchain AI presale site. Connect your wallet (securely, of course), choose how you want to pay—ETH or USDT—and decide how many shiny LCAI tokens you want. Double-check everything, hit confirm, and voilà! Your tokens will land directly in your wallet faster than you can say, AI for the win. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|SHIB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-30 03:00:00

The SEC delayed making a verdict on the Franklin Templeton-linked spot XRP ETF until June 17, 2025, according to a newly released notice . According to Eleanor Terrett, on April 29, 2025, the SEC released a notice that revealed it needed additional time to evaluate Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot XRP ETF, also known as the Franklin XRP Fund. The SEC delayed its verdict on the Franklin Templeton-linked spot XRP ETF until June 17, 2025. Source: SEC According to the documents, the financial watchdog has now extended the review period by an additional 45 days, postponing its decision until June 17, 2025. This is standard procedure, and even though it only added an extra 45 days, the SEC is allowed to extend the reviews by up to 240 days from the initial publication in the Federal Register. In essence, there could still be more pain on the way for impatient speculators. The application was originally filed on March 13 and published in the Federal Register on March 19. If approved, the ETF will track the spot price of XRP, with assets custodied by Coinbase Custody. Shares would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, and the fund’s net asset value will be determined with the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate. According to Eleanor Terrett, who spoke to ETF analyst James Seyffart, the dates listed in the notice are all “intermediate.” In fact, Seyffart believes the $XRP spot ETF could be approved by mid-October with a final decision deadline set for October 18. “It’s possible the SEC won’t take all that time to make its decision, but a lot will hinge on how actively they engage on the applications,” Terrett wrote on X. The SEC postpones decisions on other ETF applications The SEC delayed its decision on other ETF applications besides the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF. There are also other XRP ETF applications, including those from Grayscale, Canary Capital, Bitwise, WisdomTree, CoinShares, 21Shares, ProShares, and Volatility Shares, but none of them have been approved yet. Aside from the XRP ETF applications, the agency has also delayed making a decision on Bitwise’s DOGE ETF application until June 15. The SEC’s actions have triggered mixed reactions on social media with a majority unsure whether to get mad or remain optimistic about the ETFs. The agency is known for cautiously deliberating on crypto-related ETFs, as seen with the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which took years to approve. However, that was under the Gary Gensler administration. The SEC has come under new leadership with Paul Atkins, and many expect it to move more quickly and positively. There are now over 70 ETF proposals for altcoins like Solana, Litecoin, Hedera, and Dogecoin waiting for the SEC’s review. Not all will be approved but some, like the XRP ETF, have been deemed inevitable by people in the know. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Resistance for SOL is at $150. Support for SOL/USD is at $140. The price analysis of Solana for April 28 shows that SOL tried and failed at crossing past the $150 level. The price is still trading at $149 but may retrace further. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL fails to cross past $150 Solana showed significant bearish pressure on the daily chart, as the bulls could not climb past the $150 level, and the price has returned towards $148. The bulls still hold strong at the level but the exhaustion might cause SOL to retrace further. Solana price 1-day chart analysis : SOL rises back towards $150 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 61.66, showing room for further upwards movement across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line crosses the signal line downwards, suggesting strong bullish momentum.

Solana price analysis: Bulls clawback above $140 as bullish momentum escalates From a technical perspective, the MACD shows declining bearish momentum at 0.14, with the indicator showing rising bearish momentum with recent candles.

The 4-hour chart reinforces this downward trend with a bearish crossover in the MACD and the RSI falling into unfavorable territory, signaling potential continued downward momentum as SOL retraces to $140.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-30 03:15:00

Larry Fink Says Tokenization Could Reshape Finance BlackRock’s recent move matches CEO Larry Fink’s recent remarks on how tokenization could change investing. In a recent letter to investors, Fink explained that tokenization could speed up transactions, remove delays, and quickly reinvest money back into the economy to help it grow. Fink also said that the main challenge with tokenized assets is the lack of proper identity checks. Once that is fixed, he thinks that the tokenised funds could become as familiar as ETFs.

PayPal disclosed the decision in a Tuesday filing , marking another high-profile crypto probe closed under President Donald Trump’s administration. It said that the SEC’s Division of Enforcement had issued a subpoena in Nov. 2023, requesting documents related to PYUSD. The company said that in Feb. 2025, the SEC informed them that the inquiry had been closed with no further action. Trump-Era SEC Scales Back Crackdown On Digital Assets The move comes as part of a broader shift at the SEC. Since Trump took office in Jan. 2025, the agency has scaled back its regulatory crackdown on digital asset firms. It has dropped or paused investigations and lawsuits against several major crypto companies, including Gemini , Coinbase, Ripple Labs and Uniswap Labs, among others. Enforcement actions against high-profile individuals such as Justin Sun and Hex founder Richard Heart have also been shelved . PayPal Gains Breathing Room As Regulatory Pressure Eases PayPal launched PYUSD in Aug. 2023 in partnership with Paxos Trust Company, a US-regulated entity. The stablecoin, backed 1:1 by the US dollar, is available to US users on PayPal and Venmo and can be transferred to external wallets, subject to compliance checks. PYUSD has earlier surpassed $1b in market cap , signaling strong demand and growing traction within the digital payments ecosystem, though its valuation has since declined. The closure of the SEC’s inquiry could boost confidence among institutional partners and retail users, especially as stablecoins remain under close global scrutiny. While no comprehensive US regulation currently governs stablecoins, Congress continues to debate a legal framework that could reshape how such assets are issued and used. SEC Exit Offers Relief, But Uncertainty Still Shadows PYUSD PayPal noted that the regulatory environment remains fluid. As a result, future legislation could bring new costs or risks for stablecoin issuers and partners. Additionally, the company acknowledged potential reputational harm. This could occur if its issuer partner faces legal trouble or if PYUSD is used in illicit transactions. Even so, the SEC’s decision to abandon its investigation adds to a growing list of crypto enforcement rollbacks. This trend reflects a broader shift toward lighter regulatory oversight. For PayPal and other fintech firms moving into stablecoins, it suggests that regulatory headwinds may be easing, at least for now.

Up to $250 million has been allocated to this venture. However, the crypto ambitions have sparked concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Despite transferring his 59% stake to a trust, Trump remains linked to several crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial, where he’s named “Chief Crypto Advocate” and profits from the company, which is mostly owned by the Trump family. His memecoin launch, Official Trump (TRUMP), just before returning to office, also drew criticism. Nunes also expressed concern about stock manipulation, citing a hedge fund’s 6 million short positions and notifying the SEC. He added that the company is actively pursuing mergers and acquisitions to find “crown jewel” assets that align with its long-term vision. Stock Pressure and M&A Plans Despite the announcements, Trump Media’s stock (DJT) fell 3% on the day and is down 26% for the year, as investor interest appears to be cooling off amid broader market uncertainty.

This upward movement represents a 12% gain in the past seven days, signaling a potential shift in short-term market sentiment following a multi-week period of correction and volatility. Despite this upward trajectory, some underlying metrics suggest that investors remain cautious, especially within the derivatives market. Related Reading: Technical Indicators Suggest Bitcoin May Reach $120,000 In Q2, Says Standard Chartered Bitcoin Negative Funding Rates Return Amid Price Rally A CryptoQuant analyst known as ShayanBTC has pointed to a developing divergence between price action and funding rates, particularly on perpetual futures contracts. Funding rates serve as a measure of trader sentiment, showing whether long or short positions dominate. While the price of Bitcoin has climbed, Shayan revealed that recent funding rate behavior suggests that many participants are hedging against potential downside risks or actively reducing exposure at these levels. The divergence raises questions about whether the current rally will sustain or if a short-term retracement is likely before further continuation. Shayan highlighted that Bitcoin’s funding rates have turned negative again, even as the price pushed toward $95,000. This dynamic mirrors a trend observed during the prolonged correction between March and October 2024, when funding rates remained negative during intermittent rallies. Negative funding rates typically indicate a dominance of short positions or hedging behavior among traders in the derivatives market. The analyst suggests that this renewed divergence may reflect a lack of conviction in the rally, with participants preparing for a possible reversal at key resistance levels. Shayan also noted that the current structure shows similarities to previous periods where the market saw a temporary pullback before resuming upward movement. In this context, traders might be reducing risk exposure or engaging in distribution strategies by selling into strength. The presence of cautious positioning at a time of rising prices often signals market imbalance that could trigger a short-term correction. STH-Realized Price and Structural Considerations Meanwhile, BTC’s Short-Term Holder Realized Price (STH-RP) is also a metric worth assessing Bitcoin’s macro trend. The STH-RP reflects the average cost basis of coins held by recent market participants. Related Reading: Record-Breaking Week: Bitcoin Climbs Over $95,000 Amidst $3 Billion ETF Inflows According to on-chain data, sustainable bull markets often maintain price levels above the STH-RP. At present, Bitcoin remains near this threshold, and its ability to hold or break above it could shape near-term momentum. The analysis from Shayan concludes that while a pullback may occur in the short term, the retracements due to the divergence between rising prices and falling funding rates could strengthen the overall market structure if they result in healthier accumulation and shake out weak hands.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump told reporters outside the White House that the negotiations were moving fast, and he believes both countries will sign a deal soon. “I think we’ll have a deal with India,” Trump said. “The prime minister, as you know, was here three weeks ago, and they want to make a deal.” Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, had visited Washington in late February. Since then, both countries have been pushing to wrap up talks. According to CNBC, the White House sees this trade deal as one of several negotiations happening globally right now, but the India deal appears to be the closest to being done. Bessent and Vance say India deal is nearly ready Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed during a White House briefing that the U.S. is “very close on India.” He said the administration had also been holding talks with Japan, and he suggested the U.S. is also nearing a possible agreement with South Korea. “The contours of a deal” with Seoul are coming together, he said, without sharing specific terms or a deadline. But India seems to be the focus. Bessent pointed to a recent meeting between Vice President JD Vance and Modi, saying the two leaders “made some very good progress.” He said that the discussions went well enough that an announcement on India could happen soon. “A country like India, which has the posted and ready tariffs, it’s much easier to negotiate with them,” Bessent said. The structure of India’s existing tariffs is one of the things making this easier. They’re already written down, not hidden or vague. That helps U.S. negotiators know exactly what they’re working with. That’s not the case with every country, Bessent added, and it’s why talks with India have moved faster than others. The potential benefits are not one-sided. Raghuram Rajan, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told CNBC that India stands to gain a lot if it can get those tariffs lowered. “India benefits hugely if it can negotiate tariffs to a much lower level, even while some other countries have it at a higher level,” Rajan said. He explained that this could make India more attractive to companies, especially because of its huge local market. Lutnick hints at another trade deal done While all eyes are on India, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added fuel to the fire shortly after by claiming that one deal was already done, but it was not yet public. Speaking to CNBC’s Brian Sullivan, Howard said , “I have a deal done, done, done, done, but I need to wait for their prime minister and their parliament to give their approval, which I expect shortly.” He refused to name the country, but the markets responded anyway. Right after Howard’s comments, the stock market spiked. Traders saw the statement as a sign that real progress was being made. The details of the unnamed deal are still under wraps, and Howard didn’t confirm if India was the country involved. When asked whether he was involved in any talks with China, Howard quickly said no. “My portfolio is the rest of the world’s trade deals,” he said. China is being handled separately by Bessent. As for who else is being courted, Bessent told reporters that the White House has active talks going with 17 different countries. “We have 18 important trading relationships; we will be speaking to all of those partners, or at least 17 of them, over the next few weeks,” he said. According to him, many of those countries have already come to Washington. China isn’t one of them. So far, the administration hasn’t signed anything official. Bessent said many countries have reached out about deals, but nothing has been announced. Right now, India, Japan, and South Korea are the top prospects. Later in the day, Bessent went on Fox Business and was asked directly about Lutnick’s claim of a finished deal. He didn’t confirm or deny. “I’m not going to get ahead of the president,” Bessent said. “Nothing’s done until President Trump announces it. So we should wait to hear from President Trump over the next couple of days.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

ETH is now consolidating near the $1,800 zone and might aim for a move above $1,820. Ethereum started a downside correction and traded below the $1,800 level. The price is trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,850 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Upsides Ethereum price remained stable above the $1,745 level and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin . ETH climbed back above the $1,800 resistance level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $1,842 and the price corrected some gains . There was a move below the $1,820 level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,746 swing low to the $1,842 high. However, the bulls remained active near the $1,780 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,746 swing low to the $1,842 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,810 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,820 level. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $1,850 level. A clear move above the $1,850 resistance might send the price toward the $1,920 resistance. An upside break above the $1,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,950 resistance zone or even $2,000 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,850 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,780 level. The first major support sits near the $1,750 zone. A clear move below the $1,750 support might push the price toward the $1,620 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,600 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,550.

He says that Strategy should consider accelerating purchases as the Bitcoin supply on exchanges continues to decline. Byworth argues that aggressively increasing Bitcoin holdings would boost Strategy’s mNAV, benefiting shareholders. Michael Saylor’s Strategy should take a more aggressive approach to buying Bitcoin by acquiring companies to use their cash holdings to fund purchases and do away with over-the-counter buys, a crypto executive says. “Saylor’s strategy so far has been the right one,” Syz Capital partner and Jan3 adviser Richard Byworth said on an April 29 podcast. Strategy should try “super aggressive” buying However, Byworth pondered what happens when Bitcoin ( BTC ) reaches an “illiquid supply” point where no Bitcoin is left on crypto exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) desks. “Should Saylor buy Bitcoin really carelessly? As in, not try and buy it through OTC desks…and actually just buy it with the intention of massively ramping the price,” Byworth said. “The point where things are getting less liquid, maybe you should try for a period going super aggressive, super careless buying, market impact all across, and push the price higher.” Strategy currently holds 553,555 BTC, valued at approximately $52.48 billion at the time of publication, according to Saylor Tracker. Fidelity Digital Assets said on April 24 that it has seen Bitcoin supply on exchanges dropping due to purchases by public companies, which it anticipated would accelerate “in the near future.” Byworth said a firm like Strategy wouldn’t be concerned with the price of Bitcoin when buying it as its primary focus would be on its mNAV (multiple of Net Asset Value), the value of the assets held , as “it is much more beneficial to [its] shareholders.” Richard Byworth spoke to Bram Kanstein on the Bitcoin for Millennials podcast. Source: Bram Kanstein He added that when there is no more Bitcoin, “you may as well go aggressive buying, because what happens is it will just ramp the price, it will massively increase [Strategy’s] MNAV, which means [its] dilution will become much more accretive.” Movements in the NAV premium and discount can give signals about market sentiment or potential future price movements. Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in May — Here is why Byworth said that Japan has a “large number of zombie companies” holding significant cash reserves. He proposed that Strategy could adopt an aggressive approach by acquiring these companies and “immediately converting that cash into Bitcoin,” similar to the strategy taken by Japanese investment firm Metaplanet. “There are plenty of companies out there in Japan like that, sitting on these cash flow generative businesses that are pretty boring and have very low price-to-cash ratios,” Byworth added. On April 21, Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings to more than $400 million after its latest $28 million purchase . Bitcoin is trading at $94,680 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap Byworth’s comments come as Bitcoin trades below the psychological $100,000 price level, a threshold it fell below in early February , which has widely been attributed to the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. Bitcoin is trading at $94,680, down 13.22% from its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This follows confusion that began due to an April 15 regulatory filing, which some media outlets misinterpreted. ProShares later clarified that they have no XRP ETF scheduled for April 30 and would make an update. With the confusion, commentators clarified that such a possible ETF by ProShares would be a futures-based ETF, not an XRP spot ETF. Futures ETFs can provide exposure to XRP without holding it directly, but futures ETFs are generally more sensitive. ProShares targets May 14 launch for XRP futures ETF With a new filing amendment with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ProShares reveals that it will launch its futures-based XRP ETFs on May 14. However, the document is a procedural update and does not confirm final SEC approval. The initial filing led to confusion across financial media and social networks. Some sources incorrectly reported that the SEC had allowed the ETF to begin trading on April 30. This news led to a short-lived price jump for XRP; however, it was later clarified that no such approval had been granted. ProShares also submitted a filing for an actual XRP ETF along with the futures-based ETF. Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Grayscale are among the other companies that have applied for such funds. Franklin Templeton’s application can be regarded as one of the most popular of all the applications submitted. On April 29, the SEC extended its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposal until June 17. The firm registered the XRP ETF in March after registering a similar request for the Solana ETF. Eleanor Terrett, a journalist following ETF developments, wrote on social media that: “For the $XRP spot ETF, James [Seyffart] is eyeing mid-October, around the 18th, as a final decision deadline.” Crypto ETF decisions loom as SEC leadership shifts Large asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity have yet to file for XRP ETFs, but rumors suggest they may enter the market in 2025 if demand for competition rises. While ProShares and Franklin Templeton have captured the most attention, the U.S. SEC has also extended deadlines for other ETF filings, including Bitwise’s proposed Dogecoin ETF and Fidelity’s plan to incorporate staking into its Ethereum spot ETF. The SEC is required to make a final decision on ETF proposals within 240 days of their official publication in the Federal Register. As a result, Bloomberg reports that several cryptocurrency-related ETF decisions could be finalized in the fourth quarter of the year. The recent changes in the SEC leadership could affect the agency’s approval pace of crypto ETF filings. Paul Atkins officially became the new SEC Chair earlier this month, with a pro-crypto stance and Senate backing. Under prior leadership — including former Acting Chair Mark Uyeda — the SEC was more conservative, with the commissioner’s office extending review periods for numerous applications. But, despite these delays, the current regulatory situation suggests that several key XRP-related and other crypto ETF decisions are due to be made by October. Meanwhile, futures-based products like ProShares proposed could reach the market soon. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

According to its most recent filing , the SEC has extended the review period to June 17, from the initial deadline of May 3. The SEC noted that additional time was required to assess the application and the associated regulatory concerns. Franklin Templeton, which manages over $1.5 trillion in assets, filed the proposal on Mar. 13, through the Cboe BZX Exchange. The SEC officially published the filing for public comment in the Federal Register on Mar. 19. Under current rules, the SEC can take up to 90 days to approve , deny, or extend its decision. In this case, it chose to delay. In the filing, the SEC noted: “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action… so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” You might also like: CME Group plans to launch XRP futures on May 19 Despite growing market anticipation, XRP’s ( XRP ) price reacted with caution. XRP is currently trading around $2.22, showing little volatility and a noticeable drop in volume. As per crypto.news data , trading volume is down 32% in the last 24 hours, suggesting traders are waiting on clearer signals. At 55, the relative strength index indicates neutral momentum. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Moving averages present a more optimistic picture. XRP is currently trading above almost all significant short and mid-term moving averages. The moving average convergence/divergence suggests a potential upward push, but the majority of oscillators also show indecision. If bullish pressure persists and XRP recovers higher support above $2.30, the next resistance lies near $2.50, and a breakout could possibly target the $2.85–$3.00 area. On the other hand, XRP may decline toward $2.00 or, in the worst scenario, back to $1.85 if the current consolidation breaks downward.

At $0.5832, the token is currently trading roughly 80% lower than its all-time high of $2.99. The recent trading volume, however, paints a slightly different picture. Pi Network’s ( PI ) trading volume rose by nearly 35% over the last day, surpassing $128 million. Though the technical picture is still uncertain, this suggests that traders are once again paying attention, which could be a sign of a more significant move. The biggest hurdle right now is the 50-day simple moving average, which sits around $0.82. PI is still below that line, and many other short-term moving averages like the 10-day and 20-day, also show a bearish trend. Pi Network price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The relative strength is at 38.7, which means the token is leaning toward oversold, but not quite there. Still, a few indicators like the moving average convergence/divergence suggest buyers may be slowly stepping in. You might also like: Here’s why Pi Network founders could be crypto billionaires Bollinger Bands show PI is near the lower band, suggesting it’s trading in the lower volatility range and may be oversold. A bounce from here could take the price back toward the middle band near $0.75, or higher. If PI breaks above the 50-day SMA with strong volume, it could push toward $0.85–$0.90. A rally past $1.00 would flip sentiment, especially if driven by major news. If prices stay under key moving averages and selling continues, PI could retest support near $0.55 or even fall to $0.45, close to its historical low. One of the biggest risks for Pi Network is token dilution . In April, 21.4 million new tokens were unlocked, worth about $12.3 million. An estimated 131 million tokens are expected to be unlocked every month for the next 12 months. Unless demand rises or the team takes action, this gradual increase in supply could have a big effect on price. One solution could be a token burn. The Pi Foundation currently owns more than 70 billion PI tokens, valued at over $40 billion. To ease investor fears and support the price, some of these could be burned. Token burns can also be combined with fee-burning mechanisms. Another potential catalyst is listing on a major exchange like Coinbase or Binance. There is increasing positive community sentiment for a future listing, which, like other tokens, could unlock new demand and liquidity. For the time being, Pi Network’s ability to turn the 50-day MA into support may be the first indication that true strength is returning.

While some investors are getting nervous, experts say this isn’t surprising — and there’s no need to panic. The reason? XRP futures contracts aren’t even live yet on the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange). The SEC has followed a clear pattern with other crypto ETFs like Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past: they wait for futures markets to be active and collect enough trading data before considering approval for a spot ETF. This ensures they have a reliable market sample to monitor before giving the green light. Not just XRP — the SEC is also delaying decisions on other crypto-related ETFs, including those tied to Ethereum staking and Dogecoin. According to James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, further delays are expected this week for ETF applications involving Solana (SOL) and Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR). Most final deadlines for these applications won’t arrive until late 2025, so there’s still plenty of time for the regulatory process to play out. Also, Paul Atkins recently stepped into office at the SEC, and it may take time before new leadership shapes policy decisions alongside other commissioners like Hester Peirce. A Theory For Thought? Adding to the XRP conversation, a social media user raised an interesting theory: if the SEC and Ripple Labs are considering settling their long-running legal battle with payment in XRP tokens instead of cash, the SEC might delay approving any XRP Spot ETFs until after the settlement. That’s because an ETF approval would likely boost XRP’s price, possibly affecting the value of any settlement made in XRP. For now, the SEC vs Ripple case is on hold (in abeyance) as both sides work toward a settlement. The deadline for this process is set for June 10th, 2025 — just a week before the new XRP ETF decision date.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-30 03:58:46

The stream happened on X Spaces during Trump’s campaign. Elon told him, “We need a government efficiency commission.” Trump ignored him and started talking about building up the military. Elon had already poured hundreds of millions into getting him elected. Eight months later, Trump finally gave in. That commission became DOGE, a budget-crushing machine run by Elon, named after a meme coin, and packed with random engineers in their 20s. In just 100 days, DOGE started gutting the federal government. And yet even after everything they cut, federal spending still went up. DOGE was supposed to save the US $2 trillion. Elon said it has saved $160 billion so far. But total government spending rose by 6.3% — or $156 billion — in Trump’s first four months back in office compared to the same period last year. Even with inflation adjusted, there’s still $81.2 billion more in spending than in 2024. That data came from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, which tracks weekly Treasury figures. DOGE nuked departments. The federal workforce got slashed to 1960s levels. Nearly 250,000 workers either quit or got fired. That includes over 112,000 who joined the “deferred resignation” scheme and another 121,000 that were just removed. DOGE cuts departments while spending rises Elon built his DOGE squad before Trump even stepped into the White House again. Around 40 staff were selected, most of them with backgrounds in engineering, crypto, venture capital, or internet infrastructure. Not public service. Elon kept his titles at Tesla, SpaceX, and X, and still had billions in government contracts. He was everywhere: Oval Office, Cabinet meetings, running the whole thing like another tech company. The first place to fall was USAID, the US Agency for International Development. DOGE wiped it out completely, firing 10,000 workers and leaving a skeleton crew to destroy files. Other foreign aid groups like the US Institute of Peace and the Millennium Challenge Corporation got shredded too. As a result, programs tied to America’s international presence — including the State Department — lost about $2 billion in spending during the first four months of 2025. DOGE engineers followed Elon’s rule: cut 20% more than needed, then bring people back if something breaks. He told his staff, “If you’re not in pain, then you didn’t cut enough.” So people were in pain. Bird flu scientists, nuclear workers, and even medical device regulators lost their jobs, then some were quietly rehired. The Department of Education was first to officially trigger a reduction in force. Around 1,300 workers were cut, which is over 30% of the department. This was one of the only areas where spending actually went down as its budget dropped by $10 billion in one year. DOGE’s latest project is focused on immigration. Elon’s team is trying to create a national database to track migrants entering the US and make deportation faster and easier. By March, lawsuits hit hard. At least 60 different legal actions were filed against DOGE. Republicans at town halls got grilled by pissed-off constituents. Veterans, rural patients, parents — all furious. Polls showed Americans don’t like DOGE, and Elon’s approval dropped under Trump’s. Democrats took advantage. They called Elon an unelected billionaire with way too much power. In a Wisconsin Supreme Court election earlier this month, which became a public referendum on DOGE, Elon lost — badly. Inside the government, things fell apart too. Elon fought with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth didn’t support the deepest cuts and tried to block them quietly. Elon’s own life took a hit. Forbes reported his net worth fell over $100 billion since December. Tesla’s sales and stock crashed after public boycotts. His personal safety was also at risk. People were attacking Tesla vehicles. The Justice Department said some of those attacks counted as domestic terrorism. Elon admitted he was scared. During Tesla’s earnings call last week, after a 71% drop in net income, Elon told shareholders he was cutting back his government work. He said he’d only give “a day or two” per week to DOGE moving forward. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Some social media posts and reports claimed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved it and that it would go live this week. But that’s not true. A spokesperson from ProShares cleared up the confusion. They said: “ProShares does not have any ETF launches scheduled for Wednesday, April 30. We have no further news to share at this time.” So where did the rumor come from? The misunderstanding seems to have started because people confused the “effective date” listed in a regulatory filing with an official launch date. When a fund’s registration becomes “effective,” it means it has cleared one step with the SEC, but that doesn’t guarantee a launch on that date. In fact, the SEC could still object to the launch. A fund’s registration statement becoming effective is only one part of the process. It’s required before a launch, but it doesn’t confirm the exact timing or guarantee approval. While the news isn’t true—yet—talk of an XRP futures ETF is still important. It shows that XRP is gaining attention from major financial players.

New Futures ETFs Fuel Bullish XRP Price Prediction,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-xrp-about-to-jump-to-10-new-futures-etfs-fuel-bullish-xrp-price-prediction/,"The XRP (XRP) price is poised for a potential short-term rally back to its 2025 highs, driven by hype surrounding XRP futures ETFs in the coming weeks. Proshares Trust’s XRP future ETF launch was just delayed until the 14th of May. BREAKING: ProShares Trust #XRP ETF’s launch has been rescheduled to May 14, 2025! pic.twitter.com/xDPeBTtsdu — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) April 29, 2025 However, that hasn’t dampened sentiment. Indeed, SEC’s approval of these ETFs, following Ripple’s legal victory in March 2025, has sparked investor enthusiasm – the XRP price was last around $2.25, up over 40% from monthly lows. Moreover, bullish technicals, including the XRP price’s recent breakout above a multi-week downtrend and its 21 and 50DMAs, signal short-term targets of $3.40. Crypto traders will remember how the market initially underestimated the impact of the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Could the market be underpricing the impact of the XRP futures ETFs, and could XRP be about to surge all the way to $10? XRP to $10 Not Likely Yet Thanks to Macro Uncertainties Traders should avoid chasing this rally blindly. Economic uncertainty, fueled by President Trump’s trade war, is rattling global markets and the US economy is already showing signs of cracking. *US APRIL CONSUMER CONFIDENCE 86.0; EST. 88.0 *US MARCH JOB OPENINGS 7.192M; EST. 7.500M pic.twitter.com/7jsXr03ZDi — Christian Fromhertz (@cfromhertz) April 29, 2025 Consumer expectations just cratered to their worst levels since 2011, while job openings just tanked 300,000. Meanwhile, concerns about sticky inflation thanks to tariffs is likely to keep the Federal Reserve hawkish at the time when the market needs them the most. Altcoins like XRP , highly sensitive to risk-off sentiment, could face sharp pullbacks in such conditions. A $10 price target seems unrealistic in this climate, as macro headwinds could cap gains. Time to Accumulate XRP? Despite short-term risks, long-term investors should view market choppiness as a buying opportunity. The Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance, including potential regulatory clarity under new SEC Chair Paul Atkins, bodes well for XRP. Trump’s favoritism toward XRP, which he named back in March as one of the key cryptos to be included in the digital assets stockpile, is another reason to be long-term bullish. In the background, XRP’s fundamentals remain robust: Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch in December 2024 boosted liquidity, and 80% of Japanese banks now use Ripple Payments for cross-border transactions.

What Analysts Predict After ETF Breakthroughs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ripple-xrp-still-reach-5-what-analysts-predict-after-etf-breakthroughs/,"Ripple’s XRP is regaining attention following a major regulatory milestone: the approval of XRP futures ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Analysts are now debating whether XRP could achieve the much-anticipated $5 target — a move that would mark a new era for the digital asset. Meanwhile, emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also seeing early investor rotation as traders seek strategic early-stage entries ahead of the next wave. XRP’s ETF Approval Sparks Optimism With the recent approval of ProShares Trust for the issuance of three XRP futures ETFs—namely, Ultra XRP ETF, Short XRP ETF and Ultra Short XRP ETF—the stage is now set for institutional involvement. These products, launching on April 30, will enable investors to gain exposure to XRP price movements without owning the asset. XRP experienced a notable shift in events following the announcement. According to CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has increased by 10.06% over the last 7 days, reaching a value of $2.31. In the past 24 hours, the volume surged by 71.87%, as traders look to the ETF catalyst. Technical analysts stated that XRP has broken and closed above its previous resistance level of $2.20 and is currently consolidating near $2.30. The major resistance area is between $2.50 and $2.70. XRP may reach $5 soon if things remain positive post-ETF launch. Investor Sentiment: Institutional Confidence Growing The impact of the spot ETF approvals will extend beyond temporary price movements. Investor sentiment towards XRP could also improve, giving hope to the long-suffering holders. According to experts, the liquidity connections from futures ETFs may lead to regulatory approval for spot-based XRP ETFs. This further links Ripple to the traditional financial ecosystem. Investor sentiment is highly bullish on whales’ accumulation pattern as well as a sharp increase in social and trading volume. XRP positions itself in the payments infrastructure space, marking a crucial distinction from speculative altcoins. This provides a strong utility thesis for investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Strategic Early-Stage Play While XRP moves toward mainstream acceptance, forward-looking investors are also rotating capital into emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Still trading under $0.01 , MAGACOIN offers early access to a high-scarcity, community-driven asset before centralized exchange exposure. Analysts see parallels between MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current stage and XRP’s early growth period — particularly the focus on real-world use cases, scarcity mechanics, and strategic accumulation by smart capital. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s roadmap includes phased expansion, staged token releases, and upcoming integration opportunities designed to foster organic demand. Early whale activity combined with grassroots adoption trends suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could mirror the type of strong early-stage moves seen historically in assets that later achieve significant market caps. Final Takeaway XRP could reach $5 in the long term, driven by fresh momentum following the catalyst of ETFS. At the same time, tactical investors seeking earlier-stage opportunities have begun to look at MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next mover before the market catches up. In the evolving landscape of digital assets, timing remains critical — and both XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing attention for the next phase.

BitMart Resumes Pi Coin Trading, Banxa Creates Thousands of New Accounts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The price of Pi Coin (PI) has slipped below the key $0.60 level, falling by over 3% in the past 24 hours. On a 30-day timeframe, the token has recorded a -15% decline, making it one of the few major cryptocurrencies trading in the red this month. While this downward trend has raised concerns among holders, some traders are starting to wonder if this dip could actually be a strategic buying opportunity. Since mid-April, Pi Coin has been trading sideways in a narrow range between $0.59 and $0.67, and with the current price now testing the lower boundary at $0.58, the market could face further downside risks if it breaks below this support. The big question circulating in the community right now: can Pi Coin climb back to $3? Despite the recent price pressure, there are a few positive developments stirring excitement among Pi supporters: BitMart has officially resumed trading for Pi Coin, bringing back much-needed liquidity to the market. Banxa, a fiat-to-crypto payment platform, is reportedly creating thousands of new accounts, signaling growing interest in Pi. HTX (formerly Huobi) is teasing Pi Coin activity on its platform, hinting at possible future support. And perhaps most notably, Pi Network founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis is set to be a keynote speaker at the Consensus Summit in Toronto in May 2025 — a major event for the global crypto industry. According to crypto influencer Dr. Altcoin, these updates could mean one thing for Pi’s price outlook: bullish momentum might be building.

Expert Claims That’s All You Need To Succeed,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/only-xrp-expert-claims-thats-all-you-need-to-succeed/,"Renowned crypto influencer “DustyBC” has caused controversy after stating that owning only XRP might be sufficient for investors to “make it” financially. The bold assertion comes at a time when XRP trades below its all-time high, but still captures the attention of both fans and critics throughout the market. Related Reading: XRP Headed For $1,000 – CryptoGuard Exec Drops Bold Prediction Single-Asset Strategy Raises Eyebrows Based on reports, DustyBC’s comment implies that investors can achieve significant wealth by adopting an XRP-only investment strategy. The perception has gained traction with some supporters who feel that “one strong hand beats a hundred weak plays.” The sentiment is indicative of increased interest in focused investment strategies over diversified portfolio strategies. I seriously think only holding $XRP is enough to make it.. — DustyBC Crypto (@TheDustyBC) April 27, 2025 The token, which runs Ripple’s payments network, already has a valuation of several billion dollars. A few market commentators have made claims published that the XRP currency may see targets of as much as $10,000 per token. Those are wild claims, but they have driven some enthusiasm among certain investors. Market Size Claims Support Bull Case Backers cite the enormous payment market as the basis for their optimism. The international payments space is said to be valued at multi-trillion dollars, with some estimates placing the industry at the $300 trillion mark by the end of this decade. According to these figures, XRP supporters believe that taking just 1% of this market would have a dramatic effect on the token’s price. This has caused some analysts to caution that not holding at least 1,000 XRP tokens demonstrates bad financial sense. Ripple’s ongoing business expansion, partnerships and acquisitions have been listed as further causes for optimism. These actions continue to provide talking points for those still optimistic about XRP’s potential future. Critics Question Growth Potential Not all people are so keen on XRP as a vehicle to get rich. X user Shero reacted to DustyBC’s remarks by saying XRP’s possible growth is only seven to 10 times its current value – a gain that some critics don’t view as “life-changing.” There’s not big ROI atm.. max is 7-10x — Shero (@shero12269724) April 27, 2025 Related Reading: Justin Sun Bets Big On JUST Token – Here’s Why He Sees 100x Potential These more conservative voices highlight XRP’s current valuation of over $133 billion as a constraint on future growth.

On Balance & Risks While some XRP advocates get their juices flowing, others within the crypto community are placing a high premium on risk mitigation. They claim that having several solid assets ensures greater security compared to focusing on one coin.

Following a successful closed beta phase that attracted over 200 million dollars in total value locked (TVL), the protocol makes its core features available to all users. The launch also marks the debut of “Falcon Miles”, a points program designed to reward meaningful participation across the ecosystem and drive user growth. Public access now includes Falcon’s core minting and redemption functions. $USDf, the protocol’s overcollateralized synthetic dollar, can be minted by depositing supported collateral, including both stablecoins and non-stablecoins. Eligible assets include USDT, USDC, ETH, BTC, TON, NEAR, and more. Importantly, all $USDf holders who interact with the Falcon App can stake or unstake $USDf through the platform and earn protocol-generated yields through $sUSDf. The staking process is designed to be accessible and flexible, with the option to restake into fixed-tenor vaults for enhanced returns. Once staked, $USDf is converted into $sUSDf, a yield-bearing token that grows in value over time. $sUSDf is powered by Falcon’s diversified yield strategies, which include both positive and negative delta-neutral funding rate arbitrage, cross-exchange spreads, liquidity provisioning and altcoin staking. As of today,$sUSDf offers around 15% APY, with higher returns available via fixed-tenor restaking through Boosted Yield NFTs. Alongside the public launch, Falcon Finance introduces Falcon Miles, an ecosystem-wide points program designed to reward user participation. In its initial phase, Falcon Miles tracks primary activities available directly on the Falcon App, including minting USDf, staking into sUSDf, and holding assets on the platform. Points are accumulated based on the scale and duration of engagement. Expansion of eligible activities will be incorporated progressively as the broader ecosystem rollout continues. In future phases, users will also earn points by providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges, interacting with lending protocols, and participating in yield tokenization platforms. “With Falcon Finance now live to the public, our goal is to bring greater optionality to users seeking flexible synthetic dollar solutions,” said Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of Falcon Finance. “Falcon Miles marks the beginning of a broader effort to build a strong community where users are meaningfully rewarded for their participation and contributions to Falcon Finance.” The next chapter for Falcon Finance will include additional collateral support, partnerships-driven “miles” program, and cross-chain deployments. These will enable Falcon Finance to advance its mission to help shape the next era of synthetic digital assets. For more information, visit falcon.finance .

In a semiannual financial stability report published on Tuesday, the Bank of Italy pointed to a temporary but sharp rise in crypto valuations after the US administration signaled support for digital assets. The bank said speculative crypto-assets, particularly those like Bitcoin , experienced strong inflows after Trump’s inauguration and subsequent policy announcements. Officials in Rome cautioned that if these highly volatile instruments become more closely tied to traditional financial systems, they could amplify vulnerabilities for both markets and financial intermediaries. Italy’s central bank noted that the value of crypto-assets reached $2.75t by the end of March, with Bitcoin accounting for over 60% of that total. #Esceoggi #29aprile il 1° Rapporto sulla #StabiliitàFinanziaria del 2025, pubblicazione semestrale con le informazioni sulle condizioni del sistema finanziario italiano Lo trovi qui https://t.co/jSGLRh949B #RSF #Bankitalia pic.twitter.com/nbcNWtaMwt — Banca d'Italia (@bancaditalia) April 29, 2025 Italy Sees Financial Fragility in Growing Role of Bitcoin and Stablecoins According to the report, a significant share of Bitcoin is now held by ETF issuers, trading platforms and non-financial corporations. These entities are either betting on Bitcoin as a stock-price enhancer or using it to reshape business models, despite its high volatility. Many operate outside traditional regulatory frameworks, especially in the US, China, Canada and the UK. Their limited presence in the eurozone has so far insulated European markets, but Italian regulators warned that contagion risks are growing. The report also raised concerns about the dominance of dollar-based stablecoins such as Tether and USD Coin . If such instruments become systemic, their issuers’ heavy reliance on US government bonds as reserves could trigger market instability during redemption crises. EU Authorities Monitor Offshore Crypto Exposure as Stablecoin Risks Mount The central bank warned of a potential liquidity crunch in the event of a large-scale stablecoin failure, with spillover effects that could reach both US bond markets and global financial systems. European officials have echoed those concerns. ECB President Christine Lagarde said in April that MiCAR, the EU’s landmark crypto regulation, may not be strong enough to shield European financial institutions from fallout linked to a US-driven stablecoin boom. She warned that a mass shift of savings into dollar-pegged assets could weaken the euro area’s monetary sovereignty. Meanwhile, Natasha Cazenave of the European Securities and Markets Authority added that though crypto remains a small slice of global finance, its growing entanglement with the real economy could soon amplify risks . Italian authorities said they are closely monitoring business models and liquidity practices of firms offering crypto-assets in both EU and offshore markets. As European lawmakers move to strengthen rules under MiCAR, Italy’s warning points to the growing need for global coordination. Without it, national regulations may struggle to keep pace with the rapid global spread of crypto, especially as political support fuels faster adoption in major economies. Without it, national frameworks could be overwhelmed by the rapid internationalization of crypto-finance, especially as political backing accelerates adoption in key economies.

Gold extended its recent decline to below $3,310 per ounce on Wednesday, as easing concerns over the impact of US tariffs reduced demand for safe-haven assets. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.20% rose on Wednesday as markets reopened following a one-day holiday. The Japanese yen slipped to around 142.4 per US dollar on Wednesday, marking its second consecutive day of losses, as a string of disappointing economic data pressured sentiment. March figures revealed that industrial production fell more than expected, while retail sales growth also underwhelmed, raising concerns about the strength of Japan’s recovery. Investor sentiment was buoyed by comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said the US held “substantial talks” with Japan regarding a potential trade agreement. Markets are now focused on the Bank of Japan’s upcoming policy decision, where the central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates steady at 0.5%. China ( SHCOMP ) f ell 0.08% mixed on Wednesday, with the Shanghai Composite slipping 0.2% to around 3,280, while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.5% to 9,895, and the offshore yuan weakened to around 7.27 per dollar, as investors reacted to disappointing PMI data from China. Official data showed that the manufacturing PMI contracted more than expected in April 2025 , after reaching a one-year high in March. Similarly, the services PMI edged lower in April from a three-month peak in March, missing expectations. Meanwhile, a private survey revealed that manufacturing PMI declined in April from a four-month high in the preceding month. China’s top legislature on Wednesday enacted the Private Economy Promotion Law, the first of its kind, signaling stronger support for the country’s private sector amid ongoing trade risks with the West. In its latest update, China’s Foreign Ministry released a video on social media urging the international community to resist US economic aggression. Although the video does not directly mention the steep tariffs exchanged by both sides, it serves as a defiant message to the US and a call for global unity. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.23% to 21,934 in early trade on Wednesday, reversing modest gains from the previous session as investors reacted to China’s April PMI data. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.13% Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.34% rose 0.4% to around 8,100 on Wednesday, marking its fifth straight session of gains. The Australian dollar edged higher toward $0.64 on Wednesday, recouping some losses from the previous session, as investors digested the latest inflation data. Australia's h eadline inflation held at an annual pace of 2.4% in the first quarter , topping expectations of 2.3%. Meanwhile, core inflation, the Reserve Bank’s preferred measure of trimmed mean inflation, fell to 2.9% from 3.3% in the previous quarter, returning to the RBA’s 2-3% target band for the first time since late 2021. Australia’s private sector credit rose by 0.5% month-over-month in March 2025, maintaining the same pace as in the previous two months and aligning with market forecasts. Singapore bank loans increased to SGD 846.5 billion in March 2025 from SGD 841.1 billion in February. This marked the largest amount since records began in 1980.

Caixin and S&P Global April manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) slipped to 50.4 from March’s 51.2. The 50-point line separates growth from contraction. The result, the lowest since January, still topped the average forecast in a Reuters poll . The slowdown arrived as Beijing resisted rolling out new stimulus and waited out what officials expected would be a long trade dispute with Washington. On the same day, the government’s own PMI pointed to an even quicker fall in activity. “The ripple effects of the ongoing China-U.S. tariff standoff will gradually be felt in the second and third quarters,” said Wang Zhe, economist at Caixin Insight Group. “Policymakers should be well-prepared, with action taken sooner rather than later.” Demand from abroad is already fading. The survey recorded the sharpest drop in new export business since July 2023, leaving only a slight overall rise in total new orders. Factories kept output growing, but at a slower pace, by working through existing backlogs. Supplier delivery times have lengthened in China, and hiring reduced Producers also reduced inventories, while business confidence slipped to its third-lowest level since the series began in April 2012. Managers blamed the trade uncertainty for their caution. Trade disruptions and supply snags slightly lengthened supplier delivery times in April. At the same time, weak demand for raw materials and fiercer competition among vendors drove another fall in average input costs. Hiring has also reduced noticeably. After a brief gain in March, manufacturing employment dropped last month as some workers resigned and companies moved ahead with restructuring plans to cut costs. Foreign trade is a major source of employment. Former Premier Li Keqiang said in 2020 that the Premier sector supports about 180 million jobs, directly or indirectly. At the Politburo meeting last week, China’s top leaders promised help for firms and workers most exposed to the impact of U.S. tariffs that now run in the triple digits on some goods. On Monday, senior officials from several economic ministries tried to calm worries that the levies could knock China’s fragile recovery off course. Beijing has offered assistance to exporters who are willing to shift more sales to the domestic market, yet many firms hesitate. They cite weak local demand, bruising price battles, thin margins, slow payments, and high product return rates at home. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The DLT shares will track BlackRock’s BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), which may only be purchased from BlackRock Advisors and The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), the firm said in its April 29 Form N-1A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The money market fund holds over $150 million worth of assets, invested almost entirely in US Treasury bills and cash. BlackRock said that the shares “are expected to be purchased and held through BNY, which intends to use blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for its customers.” Unlike the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), DLT shares won’t be tokenized but will instead be used as a transparency tool to verify ownership. BlackRock will continue to maintain traditional book-entry records as the official ownership ledger. BlackRock didn’t propose a ticker or set a management fee for the DLT shares in its filing. A minimum initial investment of $3 million worth of DLT is required for institutions seeking to purchase the digital shares. BlackRock follows Fidelity’s March 21 filing to list an Ethereum-based OnChain share class, which seeks to track the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX) — an $80 million fund consisting almost entirely of US Treasury bills. While the OnChain share class filing is pending regulatory approval, Fidelity expects it to take effect on May 30. Wall Street heavyweights continue to explore blockchain use cases Asset managers have increasingly turned to blockchain to tokenize Treasury bills, bonds and private credit over the past few years.

The potential move was revealed in a letter sent to shareholders by CEO and chairman Devin Nunes on Tuesday, ahead of the company’s annual shareholder meeting. According to Nunes, the proposed utility token would be part of a rewards program and could initially be used to pay for subscriptions to Truth+. He added that over time, the token may be used across additional services within the broader Truth ecosystem. Letter Echoes Crypto Terminology Without Explicit Recognition While the letter stopped short of labeling the token as a cryptocurrency or confirming blockchain integration, the language used aligns with terminology common in the crypto sector. TMTG operates Truth Social, a social media platform modeled after X (formerly Twitter), which Trump helped launch after being banned from major platforms for violating their policies. The company became publicly traded in March 2024 and at one point reached a valuation nearing $8 billion, despite modest revenues. Its market capitalization currently sits around $5.5 billion. This isn’t TMTG’s first foray into digital assets. In January, the company announced the formation of Truth.fi, a fintech division aiming to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. NEW: In a letter to shareholders, CEO of Trump Media @DevinNunes announced the platform is mulling launching a utility token for subscription payments and possible other future uses within the ‘Truth ecosphere.’ pic.twitter.com/Sq2a6TdBdi — Eleanor Terrett (@EleanorTerrett) April 29, 2025 It also disclosed plans to launch crypto-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in partnership with Crypto.com. The potential wallet and token for Truth+ would add to a growing portfolio of crypto ventures linked to Trump and his allies. These include NFTs, memecoins, a stablecoin project, Bitcoin mining operations, and a DeFi platform dubbed World Liberty Financial. A Trump-themed real estate video game is also reportedly in development. These developments come as the Trump administration pushes forward with a pro-crypto agenda. Since retaking office, Trump has approved the creation of a strategic digital asset reserve, advocated for stablecoin legislation, and dialed back enforcement against crypto projects across multiple federal agencies. Crypto-Friendly Paul Atkins Sworn as SEC Chair As reported, Paul Atkins was sworn in as Chairman of the SEC earlier this month, marking a leadership shift that is being welcomed by the digital asset industry. Under Atkins’ leadership, the SEC has already withdrawn or delayed several prominent cases against crypto firms. The agency dropped its lawsuits against Coinbase and Cumberland DRW earlier this year, and a separate investigation into Uniswap Labs closed in February without enforcement action. Last week, the agency also closed its investigation into CyberKongz , a prominent Ethereum-based NFT and gaming project, with no enforcement action taken. More recently, the SEC announced it would not pursue further legal action against Richard Schueler, better known as Richard Heart, the founder of Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX.

Trump Media announced it is exploring the launch of a utility token and digital wallet for its Truth+ streaming service, while Bunq debuted its new crypto trading feature that enables users in six European countries to invest in over 300 cryptocurrencies directly through its banking app. Trump Media Eyes Crypto Integration for Truth+ Amid Broader Blockchain Push Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the media empire founded by President Donald Trump , is reportedly considering the integration of a cryptocurrency token and digital wallet into its subscription-based video streaming platform, Truth+. The move is part of a broader effort to bring blockchain-based payments and rewards into the company’s growing ecosystem of conservative-focused digital services. In a letter to shareholders dated April 29, TMTG CEO Devin Nunes detailed the company’s exploratory plans to roll out a “utility token” and “Truth digital wallet,” which would initially allow users to pay for Truth+ subscriptions. The token, Nunes said, could eventually serve broader purposes, including transactions across the Trump Media ecosystem—spanning the flagship social media app Truth Social and the financial services platform Truth.Fi. ”We're exploring the introduction of a utility token within a Truth digital wallet that can initially be used to pay for Truth+ subscription costs, and later be applied to other products and services in the Truth ecosphere,” Nunes wrote. The announcement is the latest in a string of crypto-related developments from the Trump-led media conglomerate. In November 2024, Trump Media filed a trademark application with the US Patent and Trademark Office, covering a range of blockchain services, including software for digital wallets, crypto trading, and payment processing on Truth.Fi. In January 2025, the company also revealed plans to allocate up to $250 million of its cash reserves into Bitcoin and other digital assets, including crypto-related securities. According to disclosures, the assets would be held in custody by Charles Schwab, marking a notable endorsement of cryptocurrency from a media company so closely associated with a sitting US president. The firm also signed a partnership with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to launch a suite of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Truth.Fi that would blend crypto exposure with “Made in America” equities. These products are aimed at attracting patriotic investors interested in blockchain technology and domestic economic interests. Truth+ and Political Streaming Truth+, which launched in October 2024, has positioned itself as a conservative alternative to mainstream streaming platforms. Its programming slate includes films, documentaries, and series designed to appeal to right-leaning audiences, and the potential for crypto integration could enhance its appeal to younger, tech-savvy viewers as well. The planned token and wallet system would be part of a loyalty and rewards initiative that Trump Media is developing. Though details remain sparse, Nunes emphasized that the rewards program would span the entire suite of Trump Media products. However, the prospect of launching a Trump-branded crypto token has reignited concerns among lawmakers and ethics experts. Critics argue that Trump’s direct or indirect financial ties to blockchain ventures—particularly those integrated into platforms bearing his name—could represent conflicts of interest as he simultaneously holds the highest office in the nation. Although Trump formally transferred his 59% stake in Trump Media to a trust in December 2024, skeptics question the independence and effectiveness of that move. A number of senators have voiced apprehensions that Trump's policy decisions could benefit ventures like World Liberty Financial, a crypto company in which the Trump family holds a 60% stake. Trump currently serves as its “Chief Crypto Advocate,” a title that comes with a share of the company’s profits. A Pattern of Politically Charged Crypto Moves This is not Trump’s first brush with blockchain controversy. In January, just two days before his return to the White House, he oversaw the launch of the meme coin ”Official Trump (TRUMP),” a move that was widely criticized by both political opponents and financial regulators for its timing and ethical implications. Despite the backlash, the TRUMP meme coin soared in popularity and trading volume following announcements of VIP dinners for top token holders and other exclusive perks—raising further questions about the blending of political influence and digital asset promotion. As Trump Media gears up for potential crypto integration, industry watchers are closely monitoring the implications not only for the company’s future but also for the broader intersection of politics and cryptocurrency. With more Americans adopting digital assets and with regulatory frameworks still evolving, Trump’s continued involvement in blockchain initiatives could have a far-reaching impact on both the market and the presidency. Whether the Truth+ utility token becomes a cornerstone of the TMTG ecosystem or another flashpoint for ethical scrutiny, its development will likely be a key narrative in the ongoing convergence of media, politics, and crypto. Bunq Launches Crypto Offering Across Europe, Paving Way for Unified Financial Superapp In other news, Bunq, Europe’s second-largest neobank by valuation, has officially entered the cryptocurrency market, launching a service that allows users to invest in over 300 digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The initiative, unveiled on April 29, marks a significant milestone in the bank’s evolution into an all-in-one financial platform — and signals intensifying competition in the digital finance sector. Branded as Bunq Crypto, the new feature is now available to users in six European countries — the Netherlands, France, Spain, Ireland, Italy, and Belgium. The rollout is part of a larger vision by Bunq to offer fully integrated financial services that seamlessly combine traditional banking, savings, and crypto investing in a single mobile application. Responding to Soaring Retail Demand Ali Niknam, Bunq’s founder and CEO, said that the move was primarily motivated by the increasing interest in digital assets among retail investors. “We believe that now many, many people — the large majority — are interested in crypto,” said Niknam. “And we believe they’re interested in buying crypto through an environment they can trust, relate to, and recognize.” With cryptocurrency adoption expanding beyond early adopters and tech-savvy traders, Bunq sees an opportunity to meet growing demand among mainstream users — especially those who have felt underserved by current crypto platforms that often lack simplicity or perceived safety. A study commissioned by the bank supports this strategy. Bunq’s research found that 65% of European consumers are actively seeking a unified financial platform that combines banking, savings, and cryptocurrency investing. Meanwhile, over half of retail investors surveyed reported a strong interest in gaining crypto exposure, but cited complexity and inadequate security on current platforms as barriers. The launch of Bunq Crypto comes in partnership with Kraken, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, which will provide the backend infrastructure and liquidity for the service. As the 14th-largest centralized exchange globally by volume, Kraken lends technical expertise and regulatory confidence to the endeavor. Bunq’s leadership emphasized that recent improvements in Europe’s crypto regulatory clarity were critical to moving forward. “For a long time, the future of crypto from a regulatory perspective was a bit unclear,” Niknam said. “But we’ve seen a lot of that change over the past couple of months. As a regulated entity, we now feel sufficiently assured to offer this to the public.” Indeed, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework — which begins phasing in this year — has given regulated entities like Bunq the confidence to develop compliant crypto services while providing customers with stronger protections. Setting the Stage for Global Expansion Bunq Crypto is just the first phase of the bank’s broader strategy. The company plans to expand its crypto trading capabilities to users across the entire European Economic Area (EEA) in the coming months, with additional plans to launch in the United States and the United Kingdom thereafter. This global ambition mirrors Bunq’s rapid growth trajectory. The neobank, founded in 2012, reported over 12.5 million users as of June 2024 — a dramatic increase from just 9 million a year earlier. The company’s rise has been fueled by its user-friendly interface, innovative product lineup, and strong brand positioning as a digital-first, socially responsible financial institution. Bunq’s push into crypto aligns with an emerging global trend: the consolidation of financial services into superapps. These platforms aim to provide users with comprehensive financial management tools under a single digital roof, eliminating the need for multiple accounts across various banks, brokers, and crypto exchanges. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong echoed this sentiment in a February post, saying he believes the financial system of the future will revolve around “a single primary financial account” — an account that will likely include cryptocurrency management as a core feature. In this context, Bunq’s move is more than just another crypto feature — it’s a step toward redefining what it means to be a bank in the 21st century. Competition Intensifies in European Fintech Bunq’s announcement comes months after rival neobank Revolut expanded its own crypto exchange services across 30 EEA countries in November 2024, underscoring the growing race among fintech firms to dominate the retail crypto market. With a stronger regulatory foundation now in place in Europe, more traditional financial institutions and neobanks are expected to follow suit, integrating digital assets into their service offerings to stay competitive and meet evolving customer expectations. As Bunq enters the crypto arena, it positions itself not only as a challenger to legacy banks, but as a forward-thinking platform capable of bridging traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-30 05:30:00

The lawsuits, both filed in the Delaware bankruptcy court, alleged that NFT Stars and Delysium failed to deliver all the tokens paid for by FTX despite repeated attempts to resolve the matter. FTX claimed in an April 28 statement that it made “numerous unanswered attempts” to engage with both firms, and it would be “contacting numerous other token and coin issuers regarding FTX assets and will be filing additional suits against non-responsive parties.” Source: FTX As part of the complaint against Delysium, FTX claimed its defunct trading arm, Alameda Research, paid $1 million in January 2022 for 75 million of the gaming firm’s AGI tokens. It claimed the original token launch was in April 2023, and Alameda Research’s share of the tokens was subject to a vesting schedule that started with 20% unlocking after 12 months. However, FTX said the timeframe was extended to 48 months and then halted altogether due to its bankruptcy following its collapse in November 2022. Meanwhile, FTX’s complaint against marketplace NFT Stars claimed it paid $325,000 in November 2021 for 1.35 million SENATE tokens and 135 million SIDUS tokens. After a partial delivery, FTX claimed NFT Stars halted delivery of the remaining 831,000 SENATE tokens and 83 million SIDUS tokens, also due to the bankruptcy proceedings, the company claimed. FTX wants tokens plus damages FTX asked the court to award it the remaining tokens plus damages, arguing the tokens hit a peak value and could have been sold for a profit had they been delivered on time. Delysium’s token AGI hit a peak price of $0.672 in May 2024, according to CoinGecko. It has since lost 90% of its value and is trading for $0.067. SENATE reached $5.85 in January 2022 but has since lost 99% of its value, while Sidus hit its top price so far of $0.19 in January 2022 as well, but has since plunged 99%, CoinGecko data shows . NFT Stars and Delysium didn’t immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s requests for comment. FTX has been trying to claw back funds it claims are owed to the collapsed crypto exchange.

Biggest real-world asset flow to Ethereum yet. — Eric Conner (@econoar) April 30, 2025 Ethereum Industry Standard for RWA The BlackRock Treasury Trust Fund is a money market fund that invests only in short-term US Treasury securities to provide income while preserving liquidity and principal. It keeps fees low and is designed for very low-risk, stable returns. The new tokenized DLT shares of its $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund will use blockchain technology to track ownership via BNY Mellon. BlackRock previously launched the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) on the Ethereum blockchain, in partnership with Securitize.

The asset has struggled to make any progress above $1,800 over the past week and is still lingering around levels last seen in September 2023. ETH is still 63% down from its 2021 peak price and has declined almost 50% since the beginning of the year, but analysts and advocates still think it will reach five figures soon.

In an interview with The National , Eric Trump, son of President Donald Trump, touted Dubai as a leading global investment destination. “It’s become a safe haven for so many people,” he said, highlighting the city’s appeal to investors from Europe, Asia, and Africa. “Dubai has really become the epicentre.” Trump Expands Dubai Footprint with New Luxury Tower The Trump International Hotel and Tower in Dubai, unveiled earlier this year, is the latest in the family’s partnership with UAE-based Damac Properties. The project will feature a branded hotel, luxury residences, a private clubhouse, and what is being billed as the world’s tallest swimming pool. Completion is expected within five years. Apartments in the tower will start at around $1 million, with three- and four-bedroom units available. Two penthouses are expected to sell for $20.4 million each.

However, its property market has also drawn scrutiny. Investigations, including a major 2023 leak of property records, have raised concerns about the city’s role in facilitating money laundering and hosting illicit capital from sanctioned individuals and criminal networks. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) has linked Dubai real estate to money laundering, drug trafficking, and organized crime operations. The Dubai tower is the latest chapter in the Trump family’s growing involvement in crypto. What began with a line of Trump-branded NFTs has evolved into a sprawling portfolio that now includes meme coins, stablecoins, DeFi ventures, and partnerships with crypto firms. The Trump Media & Technology Group has also floated the idea of integrating digital wallets into its Truth Social platform. Eric Trump has recently stepped up his crypto presence, accepting an advisory role at Japanese firm Metaplanet and appearing at industry events like Token2049 in Dubai, where he’s scheduled to speak alongside entrepreneur Justin Sun later this week. Trump’s Truth+ Considers Adding Crypto Wallet and Token As reported, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the media company behind Truth Social, is weighing the launch of a utility token and a digital wallet as part of an expansion of its streaming platform, Truth+. The potential move was revealed in a letter sent to shareholders by CEO and chairman Devin Nunes on Tuesday, ahead of the company’s annual shareholder meeting. According to Nunes, the proposed utility token would be part of a rewards program and could initially be used to pay for subscriptions to Truth+. He added that over time, the token may be used across additional services within the broader Truth ecosystem.

PayPal said in an April 29 regulatory filing that the SEC concluded its investigation into PayPal USD (PYUSD) and wouldn’t be taking any action. The company said it received a subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement over its stablecoin in November 2023. “The subpoena requests the production of documents. We are cooperating with the SEC in connection with this request,” PayPal stated at the time. In its latest filing, the firm said the SEC notified it in February that the agency “was closing this inquiry without enforcement action.” PayPal has said its stablecoin is 100% redeemable for US dollars and “fully backed” by dollar deposits, including short-term treasuries and cash equivalents. However, the stablecoin has struggled to gain momentum in a crowded market dominated by rivals Tether and Circle. PYUSD has a market capitalization of just $880 million, less than 1% of Tether’s ( USDT ) $148.5 billion. PayPal’s stablecoin has seen better growth this year with a 75% increase in PYUSD circulating supply since the beginning of 2025, according to CoinGecko. It remains down 14% from its peak supply of just over $1 billion in August 2024. PayPal USD market capitalization. Source: CoinGecko Earnings on PYUSD, Coinbase partnership That growth could be bolstered by a company announcement on April 23 introducing rewards for PYUSD in a new loyalty offering that will enable US users to earn 3.7% annually for holding the asset on the platform. Meanwhile, on April 24, PayPal announced a partnership with Coinbase to increase the adoption of PYUSD. “We are excited to drive new, exciting, and innovative use cases together with Coinbase and the entire cryptocurrency community, putting PYUSD at the center,” said Alex Chriss, PayPal President and CEO.

Speaking to Bloomberg News live at the Rio de Janeiro Web Summit on Tuesday, she added that Bitcoin accumulation remains a government priority. “Bitcoin keeps being an important project,” she noted. “There is an asset accumulation that we’re seeing from the government perspective, from the private sector perspective.” The Salvadoran government reached a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), last December, after four years of negotiations. They agreed on a $1.4 billion loan program to be disbursed over 40 months. The international financial body highlighted the reduced risks from Bitcoin adoption, which had been a major sticking point. After receiving $1.4 billion in funding, the country made a series of pledges, including scaling back its Bitcoin buying spree.

It’s much more, much deeper in structural reforms, in terms of governance, in terms of transparency,” he said.

The bill introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty in February and passed by the Senate Banking Committee in March, seeks to regulate the issuance of stablecoins in the United States . Under the GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) Act, stablecoin issuers would be required to be licensed entities, known as “permitted payment stablecoin issuers.” What Does the GENIUS Act Mean? The GENIUS Act is designed to bring much-needed clarity and structure to the growing stablecoin market. Complementing the GENIUS Act, the STABLE Act has been introduced in the Republican-controlled House. Together, the two bills aim to set clear regulatory guidelines for the issuance of dollar-pegged stablecoins—cryptocurrencies intended to maintain a stable value by being backed by real-world assets. Currently, stablecoins are a popular digital dollar used for fast, low-cost payments. However, the absence of clear regulations has led to concerns around safety and trust. The GENIUS Act addresses these concerns by mandating that stablecoin issuers hold full reserves, comply with anti-money-laundering regulations, and undergo regular audits. The act also makes clear that stablecoins are not classified as securities or commodities, resolving a key area of confusion. With these measures in place, the GENIUS Act aims to foster safer growth for stablecoins, positioning them as potential competitors to traditional payment systems in the future. Broader Regulatory Context The GENIUS Act is part of a broader push for stablecoin regulation. In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order forming a working group to explore stablecoin regulations and the possibility of creating a national crypto stockpile. However, while executive orders signal intent, they lack the legal weight of Congressional approval. The timing of Trump’s order has raised some concerns, particularly after World Liberty Financial—a crypto firm backed by his family—launched the USD1 stablecoin. Critics, mainly from the Democratic camp, argue that Trump’s influence, combined with his financial ties to the firm, creates a significant conflict of interest as Congress debates this critical piece of crypto legislation. As the Senate prepares to vote on the GENIUS Act, the future of stablecoin regulation in the U.S. hangs in the balance. FAQ What is a Stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to real-world assets, like the U.S. dollar. How Will the GENIUS Act Impact Stablecoin Issuers in the U.S.? The GENIUS Act will require stablecoin issuers to hold full reserves, comply with audits, and follow anti-money laundering rules. What Are the Key Requirements for Stablecoin Issuers Under the GENIUS Act? Issuers must be licensed, hold full reserves, undergo regular audits, and follow anti-money laundering regulations.",News|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-30 05:53:29

The delegation plans “technical discussions” with staff at the office of the United States Trade Representative. Their goal is to win exemptions, or at least softer terms, for automobiles, steel, and other goods before the Trump administration’s tariffs resume on 8 July after a temporary pause. Rates of up to 25% were announced in March and are to apply unless exceptions are granted. Last week, Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun and Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok visited the U.S. capital, where the two allies agreed to draw up a package that could remove the planned duties. Wednesday’s trip is meant to carry that work forward. Negotiations between South Korea and the U.S. have not begun yet Officials in Seoul stress negotiations have not yet begun. Instead, both sides are laying the groundwork for future talks, likely to stretch beyond South Korea’s 3 June presidential election and the seating of a new government. Domestic politics are a factor in Washington. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters on Tuesday that some partners are “much more keen to come to the table, get this done, and then go home and campaign on it.” Asked whether the remark pointed at Seoul, Choi replied that progress is “moving very slowly” and said Bessent’s words were not aimed at South Korea. Seoul has asked for exemptions on cars, steel and several other items and has offered cooperation on shipbuilding, energy projects and the reduction of trade imbalances. The ministry’s submission lists electric vehicles, steel sheets, ship components and consumer electronics among the goods it wants spared. Vice Industry Minister Park Sung-taek told parliament this week that U.S. red tape blocks shipbuilding discussions. He pointed to the Jones Act, which requires vessels carrying goods between U.S. ports to be built domestically, and said the rule must be eased before discussions can move forward. “So we are conveying this to the U.S. and expect to discuss them going forward,” Park said. Separately, South Korea is in talks with Alaska over a USD $44 billion liquefied natural gas project that Washington hopes to finance with funds from South Korea and Japan. The two countries plan to review what Washington calls non-tariff barriers, including currency practices and regulations affecting automobiles, rice and beef imports over the coming months.

TBF will offer accredited investors exposure to some of the around $2.4 billion of outstanding bonds issued by Telegram , providing institutional-grade yield products that will also be available as collateral for on-chain borrowing and product development on TON, Libre said. “What we’ve created is like a fixed income fund that acquires the bonds and then we tokenize the fund,” Libre CEO Avtar Sehra in an interview. “When you purchase units in the fund these are on the TON chain, giving you access to the returns of the underlying bonds themselves. This opens up opportunities to use the bonds for collateral, ease of transfers, etc, to ultimately create utility with these financial instruments.” The past year or two has seen a rush to create blockchain-based representations of real world assets (RWAs), bringing the traditional finance world rapidly within the ambit of crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi). Sehra said many of his customers want either tokenized money market products because they're looking for quick access to cash, or something that’s associated with an ecosystem they are involved in or work within. The TON network was originally developed by Telegram before continuing as an independent operation. Over the last year or so, TON has been focused on bringing a large swathe of Telegram’s 950 million-plus users on-chain. Libre has already tokenized over $200 million in assets across funds from leading institutions including BlackRock, Brevan Howard, Hamilton Lane, and Laser Digital. “Our objective isn't just to tokenize things for the sake of tokenizing them,” Sehra said. “I think the real value in tokenizing traditional financial instruments is unlocking the utility of those assets.”",Finance|Tokenization|Telegram|TON|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TON,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-30 06:00:00

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/may-2-could-change-everything-for-xrp-heres-what-is-coming/,"A pivotal date is fast approaching in the ongoing legal and regulatory odyssey surrounding Ripple and its native token, XRP. On May 2, Ripple Executive Chairman Chris Larsen is set to meet with Paul Atkins, the newly appointed Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development , brought to public attention by John Squire via X, is fueling a fresh wave of speculation across the crypto industry about what could be a transformative shift in the future of digital asset regulation in the United States. May 2 could change everything for $XRP Chris Larsen (Ripple) will meet with new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins. A pro-innovation shift? End of the legal saga? The future of crypto regulation in the U.S. is on the line. pic.twitter.com/oYijYOHddw — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) April 29, 2025 Why This Meeting Matters Since December 2020, Ripple has been embroiled in a protracted legal battle with the SEC, which alleges that the company conducted an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP. The case has had sweeping implications—not just for Ripple, but for the entire crypto industry, casting a long shadow of regulatory uncertainty over digital asset innovation in the U.S. Now, with Paul Atkins, a known proponent of market-friendly regulation and technological advancement, stepping into the SEC’s leadership role, the tides may be turning. Chris Larsen’s upcoming meeting with Atkins marks the first major dialogue between Ripple and the commission under new leadership, potentially laying the groundwork for a more pragmatic, innovation-driven approach to crypto policy. A Shift Toward Pro-Innovation Regulation? Paul Atkins, who previously served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008, has historically advocated for less burdensome regulation and greater market efficiency. His return as Chairman has already sparked optimism among blockchain proponents who argue that outdated regulatory frameworks are stifling innovation in the U.S. fintech sector. If Atkins’ leadership reflects his past philosophy, the SEC may finally consider clarifying crypto asset classifications, providing a path to compliance for legitimate blockchain projects, and possibly reevaluating ongoing enforcement actions, including the Ripple lawsuit. In this light, May 2 isn’t just a meeting—it could be the turning point that reshapes the U.S. regulatory stance on digital assets. For XRP holders and Ripple investors, the implications are enormous. Should the meeting lead to renewed negotiations or policy recalibrations, XRP could shed its long-standing legal baggage and reemerge as a leading player in the global remittance and cross-border payments space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The End of the Legal Saga? While no official statements have been released regarding the agenda of the May 2 meeting, market sentiment suggests that a settlement or resolution of the SEC v. Ripple case may be within reach. This would not only unshackle XRP from its regulatory limbo but could also set a precedent for how other digital assets are treated in future litigation. Ripple has already notched partial victories in the legal arena, most notably Judge Analisa Torres’ July 2023 ruling that XRP sales on public exchanges did not constitute securities offerings. However, the case has dragged on with unresolved issues around institutional sales and financial penalties. A strategic discussion between Larsen and Atkins could accelerate a settlement timeline or at least foster a collaborative tone that has been sorely missing in crypto-regulatory relations. A Broader Implication for the Crypto Market Beyond XRP, this meeting signals something more profound: the U.S. government may be ready to course-correct its approach to digital assets. As other jurisdictions like the UK, EU, and UAE sprint ahead with clear regulatory frameworks, the U.S. has risked losing its edge in blockchain innovation. A thaw in relations between Ripple and the SEC could open the door for industry-wide reform, giving crypto companies the clarity and support they need to thrive. For now, all eyes are on May 2. As John Squire aptly hinted in his X post, this meeting could be the moment everything changes—for Ripple, for XRP, and the future of cryptocurrency in America.

For inflows to increase again, Balchunas said ETH would need a multimonth run along with a strong narrative. Spot Ethereum ETFs being able to stake a portion of the tokens under their control may not help garner inflows without a more sustained rally in the token’s price, says Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Balchunas said on an April 29 episode of the New Era Finance Podcast that staking being approved for Ether ( ETH ) ETFs would have “a little” impact on inflows, adding “it’s only going to help — it can’t hurt.” ETFs to do well on price rally However, Balchunas noted that one of the main reasons for the weak inflows into Ether ETFs since their July launch in the US is that ETH has yet to sustain a prolonged rally. “The bigger problem with Ethereum is performance; it just doesn’t ever go on a nice long rally.” He added that when Ether’s price surged during a run in December, there was a direct correlation with an increase in inflows. Donald Trump’s election win in November sparked a crypto market rally which saw ETH surge 71% to reach $4,107 on Dec. 16. From Nov. 22, spot Ether ETFs saw a 19-day positive inflow streak, amassing approximately $2.44 billion in inflows, according to Farside data. Ether is trading at $1,809 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap However, since tapping the $4,107 price level, Ether entered a downtrend and has since fallen 56% to trade around $1,809 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. Balchunas said that for inflows to pick up again, Ether would need a “multimonth run” paired with a “strong narrative.” “It needs something that is more than just a good week here and there,” he added. Balchunas noted that after the Ether ETFs launched, the price “went down quickly,” making any recovery difficult, unlike spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a new all-time high just two months after they launched in January 2024. “When you launch an ETF, and you have that sort of performance out of the gate, it’s tough,” he said. Related: Ethereum’s ‘capitulation’ suggests ETH price is undervalued: Fidelity report US ETF issuers are still waiting for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to allow Ether ETFs to offer staking after filing numerous requests for permission earlier this year Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said that “it’s possible they could be approved for staking early, but the final deadline is at the end of October.” “Potential intermediate deadlines before the final approval (or denial) are in late May and late August,” he added.

Despite $1 billion inflows in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, Bitcoin has stayed below $95,000. After a week of holding steady, major altcoins broke key resistance levels on Tuesday. Ethereum and Cardano led the way with 2% gains, outpacing Bitcoin’s 0.6% rise. This shows growing momentum for altcoins, with many market watchers hinting that altcoin season could be here. ADA Set For Major Breakout After a strong recovery last week, Cardano is currently trading at $0.7019, up 0.4% in the past day. Analyst Mintern believes that ADA could be gearing up for a major breakout. The current setup mirrors the 2020 inverse head-and-shoulders pattern that led to an explosive rally. He believes that the real bull run hasn’t even started yet. Analyst Ali Martinez also believes that Cardano is heading toward a crucial test at $0.74; if it breaks above, it could rally to $0.88. Cardano Surpasses Ether in Developer Activity Recently, Cardano has surpassed Ethereum in developer activity, which has sparked fresh excitement, hinting at a possible rally for Cardano. Data from Cryptometheus shows that Cardano has outpaced Ethereum in core developer activity over the past year, with 21,439 GitHub commits across 550 repositories. The Cardano ecosystem thrives with 38 projects and 4,012 public repositories. However, developer engagement has decreased by 10.28% this month, with 262 developers making 1,845 commits, marking a 19.2% decline from the previous month. Besides, Hoskinson recently announced that Cardano is set to integrate Bitcoin into its Lace wallet, which will allow BTC holders to access Cardano DeFi with a simple one-click feature.

According to Bloomberg’s prediction, the least odds of approval are for an Avalanche ETF at 75%. More ETFs may be approved in 2025 with relatively high odds, even for altcoins. The lowest odds for an Avalanche ETF are at 75%, while DOGE faces 80% chance of approval, noted Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg. Would love to hear directly from Atkins, but all good chance of happening. Here’s our latest odds of approval for all the dif spot ETFs via @JSeyff https://t.co/nLhYJJmO9U pic.twitter.com/4AcJVwhics — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) April 30, 2025 The odds are for some of the most prominent applications, from entities already experienced in running BTC and ETH funds. The queue for ETF approvals already has 72 applications for even smaller altcoins. Some of those funds may have much lower odds of approval, and are yet to file all the required forms. The long-awaited ETFs may keep seeing delays in the short term, with the first approvals expected toward the last quarter of 2025. ETFs have taken years for their first approvals, based on the SEC procedure. Delays are common for ETF approvals, as the SEC delayed their decision on several funds. The delays affected the XRP spot ETF by Franklin Templeton, as well as the DOGE ETF and Ethereum Staking ETFs. In total, five ETF were delayed for further revision and discussion. Despite attempts to launch ETFs for niche tokens or even memes, most bids are for Solana or XRP-based funds. A total of 19 XRP funds are awaiting approval, with no hard deadline, as most are at a different stage in their applications. Despite the heightened sentiment for XRP, the asset traded in its usual range, at around $2.24 after the latest fund delay. Niche applications include Polkadot and Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), though those retain low odds of approval. The biggest shift in ETFs permissions may be the addition of staking, where applicable, for Ethereum and Solana investors. Polymarket odds expect a slow summer for ETFs Polymarket estimates match the general odds by Bloomberg’s analysts. The prediction market has relatively low odds for approvals in Q2, but higher odds for the end of 2025. The odds of approval before the end of Q2 are currently falling rapidly after the latest series of SEC delays. The Solana ETF is a highly volatile market, currently pointing between odds of 83% and 91%. | Source: Polymarket The most active Polymarket pair is for the Solana ETF approval by the end of 2025. The market shows odds of 83%, lower than the 90% proposed by Bloomberg. The market is highly volatile, though with volumes of around $142K at this point. Other relatively high odds for ETF include Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), and XRP, with the highest odds of 87%. The ETF narrative no longer boosts altcoins as it did during the run-up to the Ethereum ETF approvals. Despite this, interest in launching new funds supports a selection of altcoins from older bull markets. The addition of those assets sparks hopes of recovery after years of trading far from peak valuations. ETF effects on crypto prices remain unpredictable.

However, despite these promising signs, XRP’s potential gains appear limited compared to the meteoric rise predicted for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in Q2 2025. The pre-sale currently stands at Phase 4 while investors actively participate in this stage. Institutional investors have actively acquired MUTM tokens at the Phase 4 price of $0.025 per token because Phase 5 will raise the value to $0.03. Over 9100 unique investors have snapped tokens raising more than $7.2 million in funds. Phase 4 participants will achieve a 140% investment growth when the token reaches its official $0.06 launch price. Existing investors see Mutuum Finance as a standout altcoin for 2025 which provides better monetary potential than projected XRP market expansion. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges with Growing Investor Interest Mutuum Finance has established rapid growth as a decentralized lending platform because of its groundbreaking dual lending model. The presale data shows that more than 9,100 investors are participating and have collectively raised $7.2 million in funds. Investors expect a 20% increase in the token value because the price tier of $0.025 in Phase 4 will transition to $0.03 in Phase 5. The official launch of Mutuum Finance will reward phase 4 buyers with a 140% profit as the token is set for market debut at a $0.06 price. The stability of Mutuum Finance contrasts with the recently seen XRP volatility since it provides suitable investments for DeFi sector participants. The platform is also set to reward its biggest 50 holders with bonus tokens as part of a recently launched leaderboard. Mutuum Finance disrupts the decentralized finance (DeFi) market through the unification of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending mechanisms. Through P2C model users provide liquidity to smart contract-based pools using USDT to obtain passive income. Users can eliminate intermediaries under the P2P model because transactions directly connect P2P. Mutuum Finance connects P2C and P2P lending models which results in a smooth secure and efficient DeFi solution for users who want to earn returns through their investments. Building Stability and Security in DeFi Mutuum Finance implements a USD-backed stablecoin that operates on Ethereum blockchain as a measure to boost security alongside trust levels. The platform decreases risk by using over-collateralization to satisfy its process. Open-source smart contracts in combination with regular audits help the project stay secure because they prevent security vulnerabilities that affected previous DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance is also boosting community development through their $100,000 giveaway that will grant ten participants $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens. The project also integrates a referral mechanism which gives rewards to members who encourage new investors to join the system. XRP’s Momentum Is No Match for MUTM’s Explosive Potential XRP currently demonstrates short-term growth while its maximum expansion potential falls notably lower than Mutuum Finance’s tremendous investment potential. MUTM demonstrates tremendous market potential through its $7.2 million capital raise and over 9,100 investors who are set to secure a 140% ROI before launch while analysts predict a 9,730% price growth during Q2 2025. The dual lending model together with security-first architecture and community-generated $100,000 incentive are features that make MUTM one of the most promising altcoins for market investors. Join the presale immediately during Phase 4 because the prices will rise soon.

BlackRock , managing trillions in assets, has taken a significant step towards integrating traditional finance with digital asset technology. The firm has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to introduce a groundbreaking Digital Share Class for one of its colossal funds. This isn’t just any fund; it’s a $150 billion money market fund, making this development particularly noteworthy. What Exactly are BlackRock DLT Shares? According to reports, including insights from ETF analyst Henry Jim on X, BlackRock’s filing proposes a new share class specifically named ‘DLT Shares’. The ‘DLT’ here stands for Distributed Ledger Technology, the underlying technology powering blockchains. The core idea is to use blockchain technology to represent ownership of shares in the fund. Here are the key details emerging from the filing: Fund Involved: The filing pertains to a $150 billion money market fund managed by BlackRock. Money market funds are popular investment vehicles known for their stability and liquidity, typically investing in high-quality, short-term debt instruments. The New Class: The proposed share class is called ‘DLT Shares’, indicating its reliance on distributed ledger technology. Technology Use: The intention is to leverage blockchain technology to reflect ownership records of these DLT Shares. This suggests a move towards tokenization, where traditional assets are represented digitally on a blockchain. Key Partner: The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) is designated as the sole distributor for these DLT Shares. BNY Mellon has been increasingly active in the digital asset space, offering crypto services to institutional clients, making them a logical partner for this initiative. This move by BlackRock, often seen as a bellwether for institutional adoption, is a strong indicator of the growing interest in leveraging blockchain technology for traditional financial products. Why Tokenized Assets for Money Market Funds? The concept of Tokenized Assets is gaining traction across the financial industry. Applying this to money market funds offers several potential advantages that could modernize and enhance these traditional investment vehicles. Tokenization essentially breaks down the ownership of an asset into digital tokens recorded on a blockchain. For money market funds, this could mean: Increased Efficiency: Settlement times could potentially be reduced from days to minutes or even seconds, facilitated by the near real-time nature of blockchain transactions. Enhanced Transparency: Ownership records on a public or permissioned blockchain could offer greater transparency and auditability. Improved Accessibility: While this specific filing targets institutional investors through BNY Mellon, tokenization generally holds the promise of making assets more accessible and potentially enabling fractional ownership more easily in the future. Greater Liquidity: Tokenized assets can theoretically be traded 24/7 on digital asset platforms, potentially increasing liquidity compared to traditional trading hours. Streamlined Processes: Automation of certain processes like dividend distribution or redemptions could become more efficient through smart contracts. By creating a Digital Share Class , BlackRock is exploring how these blockchain-native benefits can be applied to a highly regulated and widely used traditional financial product like a money market fund. The Significance of the SEC Filing Any major financial product launch in the U.S. requires regulatory approval, and an SEC Filing is a critical step in that process. BlackRock’s decision to file with the SEC for the DLT Shares is highly significant for several reasons: Regulatory Engagement: It shows BlackRock is actively engaging with regulators regarding the use of blockchain technology in mainstream financial products. This engagement is crucial for the broader adoption of tokenized assets. Precedent Setting: While not the first instance of exploring tokenization, a filing from an entity as large and influential as BlackRock for a fund of this size sets a powerful precedent. It signals to the market and other institutions that exploring tokenization is a serious and viable path. Potential Approval Pathway: The SEC’s response to this filing will be closely watched. A positive outcome could pave the way for similar initiatives from other asset managers and financial institutions. It helps define the regulatory landscape for tokenized securities. Institutional Confidence: The act of filing itself demonstrates BlackRock’s confidence in the potential of DLT to offer tangible benefits for fund management and ownership, even within the existing regulatory framework. The SEC’s review process will likely involve assessing how the proposed DLT Share class complies with existing securities laws, investor protection regulations, and operational requirements for money market funds. This filing is not just about BlackRock; it’s a test case for how regulators view the tokenization of traditional financial instruments. Bridging TradFi and Digital Assets This move by BlackRock represents another important bridge being built between traditional finance (TradFi) and the digital asset space. For years, the crypto world has envisioned a future where assets of all kinds are tokenized and traded on blockchains. BlackRock’s initiative brings that vision closer to reality for institutional-grade products like Money Market Funds . It’s a different approach than directly investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, it’s about applying the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies (DLT) to existing, regulated financial products. This approach might be more palatable to traditional institutions and investors who are comfortable with established fund structures but see the potential efficiency gains offered by DLT. The partnership with BNY Mellon, a major player in custody and distribution for traditional assets, further underscores this bridging effort. They bring the necessary infrastructure and relationships within the traditional financial ecosystem to make DLT Shares accessible to the intended audience. Challenges and Considerations While the potential benefits are significant, introducing a Digital Share Class for a money market fund also comes with challenges: Regulatory Clarity: Although the SEC filing is a step towards engagement, complete regulatory frameworks for tokenized securities are still evolving globally. Technology Integration: Integrating DLT seamlessly with existing financial infrastructure requires significant technical effort and robust security measures. Interoperability: Ensuring these DLT Shares can interact with different platforms or other tokenized assets in the future will be key. Market Adoption: While BlackRock’s name carries weight, convincing a broad base of institutional investors to adopt a new share class based on relatively new technology will take time. Security Risks: Like any digital system, the DLT platform used will need stringent security protocols to protect against hacks or errors. These challenges are not insurmountable, but they require careful planning, robust technology, and ongoing dialogue with regulators and market participants. What Does This Mean for the Future? BlackRock’s SEC Filing for DLT Shares could be a harbinger of things to come. If successful, it could: Encourage other large asset managers to explore tokenization for their funds. Accelerate the development of infrastructure for tokenized securities. Increase institutional comfort levels with blockchain technology beyond just crypto spot ETFs. Potentially lead to the tokenization of other types of funds and assets, from bonds to real estate. This move solidifies the trend that distributed ledger technology is not confined to native cryptocurrencies but is increasingly being viewed as a foundational technology for the future of finance. It’s about creating more efficient, transparent, and potentially more accessible ways to manage and transfer value. Actionable Insights for Observers For those watching the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets, BlackRock’s DLT Shares filing provides several points of focus: Monitor the SEC Review: The outcome and details of the SEC’s review process will provide crucial insights into the regulatory path for tokenized securities. Watch BNY Mellon’s Role: As the sole distributor, BNY Mellon’s implementation and marketing efforts will be key to the adoption of these DLT Shares. Look for Similar Filings: See if other major asset managers follow suit with their own tokenization initiatives. Understand the Technology: While not needing to be a blockchain expert, understanding the basics of how DLT can represent asset ownership is valuable. Assess Market Reaction: Observe how institutional investors respond to the availability of this new share class. This development isn’t just news; it’s a case study in how large, established financial players are beginning to integrate disruptive technologies into their core offerings. Summary: A Digital Leap for BlackRock and Money Markets In conclusion, BlackRock’s filing with the SEC to launch a Digital Share Class , known as DLT Shares, for its $150 billion Money Market Funds is a landmark event. It signifies a serious institutional exploration into leveraging distributed ledger technology to potentially enhance the efficiency, transparency, and accessibility of traditional financial products. With BNY Mellon as the distributor and the SEC Filing process underway, this initiative is poised to offer valuable insights into the future of Tokenized Assets and the ongoing convergence of TradFi and digital finance. It underscores the growing belief that DLT is not just about cryptocurrencies, but a powerful tool for modernizing the global financial system.

According to the commentator, 74.1% of XRP investors are unfamiliar with the concept of “token velocity,” a fundamental aspect that influences the behavior of digital assets, including XRP. As explained, token velocity measures how often a token changes hands within a certain period. The formula is presented as total transaction volume divided by the circulating supply. A high token velocity means that tokens are frequently traded, while a low token velocity implies more holding by investors. The commentary stresses that while the idea appears simple, its consequences are profound. The direct impact of token velocity on asset prices was a central point of the commentary. High velocity tends to apply downward pressure on a token’s price, as frequent trading increases available supply on exchanges. In contrast, low velocity, associated with holding behavior, typically supports upward price movements due to restricted supply. This relationship is framed as a basic application of supply and demand principles within the cryptocurrency market. How XRP’s Design Drives High Token Velocity The commentator specifically points to XRP’s intended functionality as a payment and liquidity solution as a driver of its high token velocity. Within RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), XRP facilitates instant transaction settlements. As a result, banks and institutions often purchase XRP, transfer it across borders, and immediately sell it, causing rapid turnover of the token. According to the commentary, this inherent design focus on speed and liquidity has unintended consequences for price appreciation. Unlike assets such as Bitcoin, which is often held as a store of value and exhibits low velocity, XRP’s structure causes it to be treated more like a transactional tool. The situation is further amplified by significant trading volumes on cryptocurrency exchanges and periodic escrow releases that increase the circulating supply. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Solutions to Manage Token Velocity The commentary suggests several strategies that could help mitigate XRP’s high token velocity. These include introducing staking mechanisms to encourage long-term holding, implementing token burns to reduce overall supply, and developing new use cases such as tokenizing real-world assets. Each approach aims to incentivize holding behavior and lower the rate at which XRP changes hands. The comparison to other major digital assets provides additional context. Bitcoin is noted for its low velocity due to a widespread “HODL” culture, while Ethereum exhibits a moderate velocity due to its use in decentralized finance and staking mechanisms. Stablecoins, commonly used for transactions and trades, display ultra-high velocity, a behavior pattern to which XRP is currently closer. Investor Implications and Closing Observations The commentary from “All Things XRP” delivers a cautionary message to XRP investors. It stresses that simply holding XRP with the expectation of future price surges may overlook the asset’s fundamental design. He says the likelihood of price appreciation hinges on massive adoption and real-world demand, rather than the mere passage of time. The analysis concludes by emphasizing that token velocity is a crucial but often overlooked concept in the broader cryptocurrency landscape. A deeper understanding of this factor, especially in the context of XRP, could equip investors with more realistic expectations and smarter strategies moving forward.

Fidelity Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-it-bullish-time-for-ethereum-eth-fidelity-explained/,"The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), continues to lag behind Bitcoin with its weak performance. While Bitcoin (BTC) was racing from record to record, ETH could not keep up with the upward momentum in BTC and has been steadily declining against Bitcoin. While ETH is expected to make an attack like Bitcoin, surpass its 2021 ATH and reach new record levels, Fidelity has published a comprehensive report on Ethereum. Fidelity, one of the giant names in the industry, stated that Ethereum was below its fair value and interpreted ETH's weakness in the first quarter as a buying opportunity. Related News: 50-Year Analyst Peter Brandt Has Issued a Warning for Ethereum (ETH) This Time! Fidelity Digital Assets noted that multiple on-chain metrics suggest that the ETH price has bottomed and is trading undervalued. Ethereum had a tough first quarter, falling 45% from its January peak of $3,579. ETH also formed a death cross in March, a traditionally bearish technical signal. However, Fidelity noted that despite the short-term downturn, Ethereum is showing bullish signals. “Despite multiple on-chain indicators, we remain optimistic for Etheruem in the medium to long term. On March 9, the MVRV Z-Score, which compares market value to realized value, fell to -0.18, entering undervalued territory. Historically, these levels have signaled market bottoms and potential buying opportunities, suggesting that Ethereum is cheap compared to its fair value. Again, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio has fallen to 0, indicating that unrealized profits are equal to losses, with a large portion of investors holding ETH at a loss. This is another sign that is often associated with market capitulation and possible bottoms as weak hands sell.” Fidelity noted that the data signaled a bottom and rise for Ethereum, but also warned that past trends suggest further declines are possible before a recovery. *This is not investment advice.

In a regulatory filing on Apr. 29, PayPal confirmed the SEC had wrapped up its inquiry and decided not to pursue enforcement. The investigation began in November 2023, when the SEC’s Division of Enforcement issued a subpoena asking PayPal to provide documents related to the launch and structure of PYUSD. The company said it cooperated fully. In its latest filing, it revealed that the SEC informed it in February that it “was closing this inquiry without enforcement action.” The stablecoin, launched in August 2023, is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, including short-term Treasuries and other cash equivalents. It is designed to be redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars and is primarily issued on the Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) blockchains. You might also like: Coinbase waives fees for PayPal’s PYUSD stablecoin conversions In a market already dominated by USD Coin ( USDC ) and Tether ( USDT ), PYUSD has had a sluggish start despite the financial giant’s backing and support. After reaching a $1 billion market cap in August 2024, PYUSD’s circulating supply dropped to $460 million before rebounding to its current $880 million supply, as per DeFiLlama data . To boost adoption, PayPal introduced a 3.7% annual reward for PYUSD holdings on Apr. 23. Users in the U.S. holding PYUSD in PayPal or Venmo wallets will earn daily rewards, credited monthly, starting summer of 2025. Rewards can be used for purchases, peer-to-peer transfers, crypto exchanges, or international payments through PayPal’s Xoom service. PayPal CEO Alex Chriss said the company sees stablecoins as a key part of future payments , adding that PYUSD is already being used for commerce, crypto, and peer-to-peer transfers. PayPal still needs to be aware of the dangers associated with potential abuse and future regulations . It pointed out that the stablecoin’s reputation might be impacted by any legal issues involving its partners or the use of PYUSD in illegal activities. The SEC’s decision echoes a similar outcome in the Paxos-BUSD case and could signal growing clarity for stablecoin issuers moving forward.

According to a letter addressed to shareholders, CEO and Chairman of Trump Media Devin Nunes declared the platform is considering a number of crypto-related innovations for users within what the firm deems as a ‘Truth ecosphere.’ Among those proposed features, the company is considering the addition of a rewards program involving its own utility token for its streaming service, Truth+. The concept of a Truth+ digital wallet and token aligns with the company’s future plan to monetize Truth+ through advertising and a subscription package that offers users premium content. “We’re exploring the introduction of a utility token within a Truth digital wallet that can initially be used to pay for Truth+ subscription costs, and later be applied to other products and services in the Truth ecosphere,” wrote Nunes. If implemented, users would be able to use the Truth utility token to pay for various other products and services linked to Trump Media, potentially including the company’s social media platform Truth Social and its financial technology and financial services branch Truth.Fi.

The letter stated that the Truth.Fi’s ETFs would offer both cryptocurrencies and traditional equities. As previously reported by crypto.news, Truth.Fi has established a partnership with Crypto.com and asset manager Yorkville America Digital to launch its own customizable crypto-backed ETFs. To bring these proposed plans into reality, Trump Media is prepared to invest as much as $250 million of the company’s cash reserves, Bitcoin ( BTC ) investments and other cryptocurrencies or crypto-related securities, with custody provided by Charles Schwab. Trump Media and Technology Group became a publicly traded company in March 2024 and once reached a valuation nearing $8 billion. At press time, the company’s market cap currently stands at more than $5.5 billion. Since taking office, President Donald Trump has adopted a much more crypto-friendly approach compared to the Biden administration. So far, the Trump administration has issued an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve , pushed for stablecoin legislations and dissolved the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Unit through the U.S. Department of Justice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As altcoin giants like Sui and Solana lead the latest market rally, rising project Remittix is stealing the spotlight with real-world payment solutions and strong early adoption. Table of Contents Sui remains thriving L1 powerhouse Solana hits new heights with market dominance Remittix continues to rise in value and adoptions This week, breakouts across the entire altcoin market have occupied the front pages of most crypto news outlets. Sui and Solana have been at the forefront of this new boom, with prices skyrocketing. Sui, a fast-growing Layer-1 project, recorded price growth of more than 18% in the past seven days as the need for decentralized gaming and AI applications on its network spiked. Solana’s price also shot up, thanks to a sensational recovery for a blockchain that seemed to have hit rock bottom after the FTX crash. However, while these popular names are surging, a new project is shaking up experts’ market forecasts as they tip it to be the best crypto to invest in this year. This PayFi breakout star, Remittix (RTX), is not just surviving the market but solving core real-world problems and attracting adoption. Sui remains thriving L1 powerhouse When Sui ( S UI ) launched, everyone wrote it off as “yet another Ethereum takeover.” Still, it has created its stand-out niche, concentrating on scalability, minimal fees, and a developer-focused ecosystem. Reviewing the market at press time, Sui’s price drifted around $3.57, rising dashingly from the start of the year when it exchanged hands for almost $0.90. Such a quick rise is thanks to several high-profile game studio partnerships and a torrent of new dApps building on the Sui blockchain. While Sui’s performance is remarkable, it still battles fierce competition from other next-gen networks focusing on the same sector. Sui’s growth will eventually rely on strengthening developer loyalty and beating rival ecosystems to market dominance. Solana hits new heights with market dominance Another spectacular coin is the Solana ( SOL ) crypto, which has continued its positive rebound. Coming off the back of 2022 chaos that almost broke its ecosystem, Solana’s price performance has returned with remarkable strength. Solana’s price is fast-rising to nearly $148, rising threefold from its low in mid-2023. The factors behind Solana’s revival include new DeFi protocols building and growing on Solana rather than Ethereum because of speed and cost, the preference for NFT marketplaces, and its thriving stablecoin ecosystem, which is much sought-after for real-world use. Thanks to its speed, which is comparable to old payment networks, and gas prices that are far less than a penny, Solana is dominating the Layer-1 sector. However, with the Solana price boom already over, several investors wonder if big profits still exist here. This question and the subsequent search have led them to undervalued projects like Remittix. You might also like: Investors rush to Remittix presale, Dogecoin and Solana could fall up to 30% in April Remittix continues to rise in value and adoptions Sui and Solana might attract all the interest due to their technical abilities. But, Remittix is where early-stage investors are investing thanks to its more straightforward solution that deals with a global, commonly-faced issue and fast and affordable cross-border payments. Remittix focuses on underserved areas like Southeast Asia and Africa. The project is already attracting users and recording a massive influx of investments before its final public launch. With a remarkably affordable value at just $0.0757 and having sold RTX tokens worth over $14.6 million before launch, Remittix is tipped to be today’s “under the radar” gem with tomorrow’s blue-chip prospect. Thanks to its real-world use cases, massive demand, and one of the largest sectors in the crypto space, Remittix looks primed to be the next big winner. With Solana’s price increasing alongside Sui, savvy investors are fast setting themselves up for what they call the breakout story of the year.

According to a Wednesday Reuters exclusive, Chinese authorities have not publicly announced the exemptions. Beijing seemingly wants to ease the country’s economic strain without appearing to have accepted defeat from US tariffs. Two individuals with direct knowledge of the situation said the list of products exempt from tariffs is being communicated privately to firms. Many of these firms rely on American technologies and had previously lobbied for relief. Pharmaceuticals, chips, and aircraft engines are already exempt Prior to April 27, China had already granted public tariff exemptions on a limited selection of imports, including pharmaceuticals, microchips, and aircraft engines. However, the existence of an unpublished “whitelist” of US goods qualifying for exemptions had not been reported until now. One source working for a drug company that imports US-made medicines said the Shanghai Pudong government contacted them on Monday about the new list. The source claimed that the company, which had pushed for a reprieve, depends heavily on American technology. “ We still have many technologies we need from the US ,” the person said. Another individual said some firms have been instructed to reach out to authorities and ask if their imported goods are eligible for tariff relief. Per an April 25 report from the Wall Street Journal , which cited a financial news update from Chinese outlet Caijing , China dropped tariffs on at least eight categories of US-made semiconductors. The article was later removed, but importers confirmed the changes to WSJ. A Shenzhen-based company listed the new exemptions on the Chinese social platform WeChat, including screenshots from a customs database showing zero percent tariff rates on specific US chip imports. Are the US and China negotiating? The behind-the-scenes concessions from Beijing and Washington could mean the two capitals have started negotiations or will soon. In mid-April, China insisted it would fight until the end unless the US rolls back its 145% tariff rates. Merely weeks later, US President Donald Trump said he is considering reducing the rates “substantially,” but not completely. President Trump, speaking Tuesday, said he believed a trade deal with China was possible but insisted that it would have to be fair. Beijing, however, has not mentioned or insinuated it would fall back on its tariff hikes. The Chinese government has been mostly “defiant” and refuted reports that any formal talks are ongoing. “ So much for ‘trade wars are easy to win.’ Turns out… when both countries depend on each other, the real war is about who can retreat more elegantly ,” said one user on X. In the southeastern port city of Xiamen, government officials distributed surveys to companies in the textiles and semiconductor sectors. The surveys asked about the products traded with the US and requested estimates on how tariffs have impacted business operations. Targeted relief instead of concessions Chatter on Chinese social media and industry experts say China is opting for targeted relief to its manufacturers, not sweeping exemptions. However, the focus of the trade tax waivers is on “irreplaceable” goods used for technological and medicinal purposes. According to Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, China needs to protect its economic interests rather than any willingness to strike a near-term deal. “ Higher tariffs on these goods would’ve risked significant blowback onto China’s tech industry ,” Marro said. “ These carve-outs are a necessary evil .” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The surge, largely attributed to renewed political support from U.S. President Donald Trump following his return to office, has revived bullish sentiment across digital assets. #Esceoggi #29aprile il 1° Rapporto sulla #StabiliitàFinanziaria del 2025, pubblicazione semestrale con le informazioni sulle condizioni del sistema finanziario italiano Lo trovi qui https://t.co/jSGLRh949B #RSF #Bankitalia pic.twitter.com/nbcNWtaMwt — Banca d'Italia (@bancaditalia) April 29, 2025 Trump’s Return Sparks Crypto Rally According to a recent report , Bitcoin led a market-wide surge after Trump re-entered the political stage with a pro-crypto agenda. His comeback helped propel the total crypto market capitalization to $2.75 trillion by March , with Bitcoin accounting for over 60% of that value. Contributing to the momentum is Trump Media & Technology Group’s announcement of a utility token and digital wallet to expand its Truth+ streaming service. This move has further reinforced perceptions of a crypto-friendly administration. Stablecoin Risks Could Trigger Market Shock Italy’s central bank is particularly concerned about the growing dominance of dollar-backed stablecoins such as USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) . These tokens are pegged to U.S. Treasuries, and officials warn that mass redemptions could destabilize global bond markets. “If large-scale withdrawals occur, it could trigger a shock across both U.S. and international financial systems,” the bank cautioned. EU Regulators Worry About Euro’s Future Despite the EU implementing its MiCA Regulation (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) , Italian authorities fear it may not be sufficient to counter the rapid spread of crypto assets, especially stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar. ECB President Christine Lagarde has echoed concerns that the euro’s influence could weaken if stablecoin adoption continues at its current pace. Italy is calling for deeper global cooperation to prevent systemic risks as crypto usage expands beyond tightly regulated sectors. U.S. Oversight Also Under Scrutiny In the United States, regulatory concerns are also mounting. President Trump has reportedly appointed pro-crypto officials to key regulatory positions and disbanded a Justice Department unit that previously focused on investigating crypto-related fraud. Adding to the controversy, Trump’s sons are supporting a new stablecoin , coinciding with the advancement of the GENIUS Act , a legislative proposal that critics argue could loosen crypto oversight and weaken investor protections. Why is Italy’s central bank so worried about crypto now? Because the recent crypto surge, driven by speculation and weak oversight, could cause financial instability. Why is Italy panicking over stablecoins like USDT and USDC? Because they’re tied to U.S. Treasuries, and a mass sell-off could disrupt global financial stability.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-30 07:39:57

Have you been watching Ethereum (ETH) lately? It’s had a pretty good run, gaining over 10% in the past week. That’s exciting news for anyone holding ETH or looking at the market. However, as with any rally, it’s crucial to look beyond just the price chart and check the underlying health of the move. Right now, some key technical indicators are flashing signals that suggest this recent Ethereum rally might be running out of steam. BeInCrypto recently highlighted this potential shift, pointing to May as a potentially pivotal month for Ethereum’s price action. Why is Ethereum’s Rally Facing Headwinds? Analyzing Momentum Indicators Technical analysis uses various tools to understand market sentiment and predict potential future movements. Two important indicators are the Average Directional Index (ADX) and the Directional Movement Index (DMI). These help traders gauge the strength and direction of a trend. Understanding the Average Directional Index (ADX) The ADX is a lagging indicator that measures the strength of a trend, regardless of whether it’s an uptrend or a downtrend. It doesn’t tell you the direction, just how strong the current trend is. ADX values range from 0 to 100. Readings above 25 generally indicate a strong trend. Readings below 20 suggest a weak trend or that the asset is trading in a range. Values between 20 and 25 are often seen as a transition zone. The recent data for Ethereum shows the ADX dropping from 39 to 24.91 in just two days. This move from a level clearly indicating a strong trend (39) down towards the threshold of 25 suggests that the bullish momentum is significantly weakening. While 24.91 is *just* below 25, the rapid decline is what catches the eye and warrants attention for any crypto market analysis . Understanding the Directional Movement Index (DMI) The DMI complements the ADX by indicating the direction of the trend. It consists of two lines: the Positive Directional Indicator (+DI) and the Negative Directional Indicator (-DI). The +DI measures bullish pressure. The -DI measures bearish pressure. When +DI is above -DI, it suggests bullish sentiment is dominant. When -DI is above +DI, it suggests bearish sentiment is dominant. The DMI components for Ethereum have also seen a notable shift. Over three days, the +DI fell from 31.71 to 22.71, while the -DI rose from 7.16 to 17.68. This is a classic sign of weakening bullish control (+DI falling) and increasing bearish influence (-DI rising). This convergence and potential crossover of the +DI and -DI lines could signal growing downside risk for the Ethereum price . Let’s summarize the indicator changes: Indicator Previous Reading Current Reading Implication ADX 39 (Strong Trend) 24.91 (Weakening Trend) Loss of trend strength +DI 31.71 (Strong Bullish) 22.71 (Weakening Bullish) Decreasing buying pressure -DI 7.16 (Weak Bearish) 17.68 (Increasing Bearish) Increasing selling pressure What Key Price Levels Should Ethereum Investors Watch? Beyond indicators, watching specific support and resistance levels is crucial for predicting potential price movements. These levels often act as barriers where price direction might change. For Ethereum, two levels stand out based on recent price action: Resistance Level: $1,828 Ethereum has tested this level multiple times recently but hasn’t managed a decisive breakout. This acts as a ceiling that the bulls need to overcome. Actionable Insight: A strong, convincing break *above* $1,828, ideally with increased volume, would be a significant bullish signal. This could potentially invalidate the weakening momentum signals and fuel a rally towards the next major resistance area, possibly around $2,320. This is a key target in any bullish ETH price prediction scenario following a breakout. Support Levels: $1,749 and $1,689 The $1,749 level has been providing support during recent pullbacks. The $1,689 level is the next significant support below $1,749. Actionable Insight: If Ethereum fails to break resistance and the weakening momentum leads to a price decline, watching these support levels is critical. A slip below $1,749 would increase the likelihood of further downside. The next important level to monitor for a potential bounce or further breakdown is $1,689. Losing this level could signal a more significant correction. Putting it All Together: What Does This Mean for Your ETH Price Prediction? The combination of weakening momentum indicators (ADX and DMI) and the struggle to break key resistance at $1,828 paints a cautious picture for the immediate future of the Ethereum rally . While the recent gains are positive, the technical setup suggests that the path forward might be challenging. Challenges: The primary challenge is that the buying pressure seems to be decreasing while selling pressure is increasing. This makes a sustained push above resistance difficult and increases the risk of a price drop. Potential Benefits (if resistance breaks): Despite the current headwinds, a decisive breakout above $1,828 remains a possibility. If this happens, the potential upside towards $2,320 is significant, offering substantial gains for holders. Actionable Insights: Monitor Closely: Keep a close eye on both the $1,828 resistance and the $1,749 / $1,689 support levels. Price action around these points will be highly telling. Watch the Indicators: Observe if the ADX starts to turn back up (indicating trend strength returning) or if the +DI crosses back above the -DI (indicating bullish dominance returning). Conversely, watch for the -DI crossing above the +DI, which would be a bearish signal. Risk Management: Given the uncertainty, consider your risk exposure. This might involve setting stop-losses below key support levels or taking partial profits if you’ve benefited from the recent rally. Don’t Panic: Technical indicators provide probabilities, not certainties. The market is dynamic, and sentiment can change quickly. This crypto market analysis suggests that May could indeed be a critical month for Ethereum. Whether it breaks out to new local highs or pulls back to test lower support levels depends heavily on how these technical signals evolve and how price interacts with the crucial levels discussed. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Ethereum Ethereum’s recent performance has been encouraging, but the weakening signals from key momentum indicators like the ADX and DMI cannot be ignored. They serve as a warning that the current bullish momentum is decelerating. The price is currently navigating between crucial resistance at $1,828 and support at $1,749, with $1,689 below that. How Ethereum reacts at these levels, combined with the behavior of the technical indicators, will likely determine its next significant move. Investors and traders should remain vigilant, focusing on these key technical signposts to navigate the potential volatility ahead and refine their ETH price prediction .

In a recent X post , crypto analyst Edo Farina issued a stark warning to XRP holders, urging them to withdraw their holdings to cold storage in anticipation of a potential market-wide upheaval. His comments are igniting widespread conversation across the XRP community, especially given his assertion that banks and governments have already secured their XRP through escrow mechanisms. Not financial advice, but withdraw your $XRP to a cold wallet. When Tether collapses and the market crashes, tearing BTC apart, exchanges may freeze withdrawals. Banks and Governments already secured their XRP locked in escrow. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) April 27, 2025 Why Cold Storage Is Becoming Critical Farina’s message reflects growing anxiety over the future of centralized exchanges in a scenario where systemic risk events—like the collapse of Tether (USDT) —could severely destabilize crypto markets. If such a breakdown were to occur, it could lead to the kind of liquidity crisis that forces exchanges to freeze withdrawals, a practice not unheard of during volatile periods. In this context, Farina’s advice is clear: retain custody of your XRP before external factors take that choice away. His concerns echo sentiments from previous crises—such as the FTX collapse—when user funds became inaccessible in the blink of an eye. By highlighting the potential for a cascading failure that affects everything from Bitcoin’s stability to Tether’s solvency, Farina is drawing attention to a worst-case scenario that responsible investors must prepare for, even if it never materializes. Institutional Accumulation and XRP Escrow A key aspect of Farina’s statement is the claim that governments and financial institutions have already locked up large quantities of XRP in escrow. This assertion is not without precedent. Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP Ledger, routinely releases XRP from its programmatic escrow system , with the intent of maintaining market stability and transparency. A significant portion of these escrowed holdings has reportedly been earmarked for partnerships with banks, remittance services, and central banks exploring cross-border solutions. While exact details on institutional XRP escrow agreements are closely guarded, Ripple’s long-standing alliances with financial giants—such as Santander, SBI Holdings, and Bank of America—have led many to speculate that a quiet accumulation has been underway for years. If true, this underscores the importance of XRP as a strategic asset for governments and financial entities preparing for a digitally connected, tokenized financial infrastructure. What Happens If Tether Falls? Tether (USDT), the dominant stablecoin in the crypto market, plays a crucial role in facilitating liquidity and price stability. A collapse in its value or trust could send shockwaves across every trading pair, especially on centralized exchanges that rely on Tether for settlement. In this type of contagion event, exchanges would likely implement emergency measures, such as halting redemptions and freezing asset withdrawals, leaving users without access to their funds. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Farina’s call to move XRP to cold wallets—secure, offline storage solutions—stems from this fear. Cold wallets are immune to exchange lockouts, custodial failures, or internet outages, making them a preferred option for long-term holders seeking to preserve control over their assets regardless of market turbulence. The Bigger Picture: A Geopolitical Play? The idea that banks and governments are already locking in XRP suggests more than just investment hedging. It implies a strategic positioning for the next evolution in global finance, where XRP could serve as a bridge currency in an interconnected system of CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), tokenized real-world assets, and liquidity hubs. With Ripple already selected by several governments as a platform for CBDC pilot programs, and with more institutions exploring blockchain for cross-border settlements, XRP appears to be gaining traction as the infrastructure backbone for the coming financial paradigm. If this transformation accelerates, retail holders of XRP may find themselves holding an increasingly rare asset—assuming they’ve taken steps to secure it. Edo Farina’s warning is not an isolated cry of alarm, but rather a timely reminder of the importance of self-custody and strategic foresight in an unpredictable industry. As the regulatory climate tightens and financial institutions quietly deepen their blockchain integration, XRP holders are advised to think beyond short-term market moves and consider the long game. The question isn’t just whether XRP will survive market shocks. It’s whether everyday holders will still have access to it when the dust settles.

Understanding the collective mood of market participants, or `crypto market sentiment`, is crucial. One popular tool for gauging this sentiment is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. What is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Telling Us? As of April 30th, the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by Alternative, registered a reading of 56. This marked a four-point decrease from the previous day’s figure. Despite this dip, the index continues to reside within the ‘Greed’ territory, which spans from 55 to 74 on its scale. The index serves as a barometer for the emotional state of the crypto market. It operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear (Investors are very worried, potentially a buying opportunity for the brave) 25-49: Fear (Market is anxious, uncertainty prevails) 50-54: Neutral (Balance between fear and greed) 55-74: Greed (Market is optimistic, prices may be overvalued) 75-100: Extreme Greed (Euphoria sets in, potential for a market correction) A move towards ‘Fear’ often signals that investors are getting nervous and selling off assets, potentially driving prices down. Conversely, a move towards ‘Greed’ suggests increasing optimism, potentially leading to speculative buying and price surges. How is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t based on just one factor. It aggregates data from six different sources, each weighted to contribute to the final score. Understanding these components helps illuminate why the index moves the way it does: Volatility (25%): Measures the current `crypto volatility` compared to average levels over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum with average values. High buying volume in a positive market indicates greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts on platforms like Twitter, looking at specific hashtags, sentiment analysis, and how quickly interactions happen. High positive sentiment can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Polls users to get their sentiment (this component is currently paused by Alternative). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks the market cap share of Bitcoin relative to the total crypto market cap. Rising `Bitcoin dominance` can sometimes signal fear (investors moving to perceived ‘safer’ Bitcoin), while falling dominance can signal greed (investors speculating on altcoins). Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest, especially for terms related to price or volatility, can indicate fear or greed depending on the specific terms. What Does Remaining in the ‘Greed’ Zone Signify? Despite the four-point drop, the index staying firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone at 56 suggests that while there might be a slight cooling of enthusiasm compared to the previous day, the overall market sentiment remains positive. This indicates that investors are still feeling optimistic about price prospects, are likely holding positions, or even buying on dips. A reading of 56 is not extreme greed (which starts at 75), but it’s clearly above the neutral point (50-54). This moderate ‘Greed’ could reflect underlying confidence in the market’s direction, perhaps buoyed by specific `cryptocurrency news` or broader economic factors, even if daily fluctuations introduce minor fear. Actionable Insights: How to Use the Index? It’s vital to remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. It doesn’t tell you when to buy or sell, but rather gives you a snapshot of the prevailing mood. Here are some ways investors often consider using it: Contrarian Indicator: Some traders use the index as a contrarian signal, believing that ‘extreme fear’ can present buying opportunities (when others are panicking) and ‘extreme greed’ can signal a potential top (when the market is overheated). The current reading of 56 is not at either extreme, suggesting caution rather than a clear contrarian signal. Market Awareness: Simply being aware of the market’s general mood can help temper your own emotional responses. If the index is showing extreme greed, it might be a good time to question your own bullish biases and potential risks. If it shows extreme fear, it might be a moment to assess if the panic is justified or an overreaction. Contextual Tool: Use the index alongside other forms of analysis, such as technical indicators, fundamental analysis, and on-chain data. It provides emotional context to the price movements you are observing. The recent dip from 60 to 56, while keeping the index in ‘Greed’, could indicate that some of the factors contributing to the score, such as market momentum or perhaps a slight increase in volatility, have softened slightly. Monitoring these daily changes can provide nuanced insights into the market’s short-term emotional shifts. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a valuable, albeit simple, look into the collective psychology of the crypto market. Its current position at 56, within the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests continued optimism among participants, despite a minor recent decline. While not a crystal ball, understanding this index and its components – from `crypto volatility` and `Bitcoin dominance` to overall `crypto market sentiment` – is a useful addition to any crypto investor’s toolkit. It serves as a reminder that emotions play a significant role in market cycles, and staying informed about the prevailing mood, through indicators like this and reliable `cryptocurrency news`, can help you navigate the market more effectively.

Banks around the world will have to adopt cryptocurrency or go extinct in a decade, Trump predicted in an interview with CNBC’s Dan Murphy in Dubai on April 30. “The modern financial system is broken, it’s slow, it’s expensive,” the businessman said, adding that the existing banking system “favors the ultra-wealthy.” “It forced me into the crypto world,” he continued, adding: “And I’m telling you, if the banks don’t watch what’s coming, they’re going to be extinct in 10 years.” SWIFT is an “absolute disaster” While emphasizing the need for banks to closely monitor developments in the crypto industry, Trump highlighted the benefits of cryptocurrency’s underlying blockchain technology for the financial system. He slammed the existing cross-border transaction solutions like the global international messaging network SWIFT, which has often been criticized for its slow transactions. “There’s nothing that can be done on blockchain that can’t be done better than the way that the current financial institutions are working. SWIFT is an absolute disaster,” he stated. With the emergence of crypto, traditional payment tools like SWIFT are at risk of losing market share to decentralized alternatives, Trump said: “You can open up a DeFi [decentralized finance] app right now, you can open up any cryptocurrency app, and you can send money, wallet to wallet, instantaneously, without the expense, without the variability.” Banks pushing back, but the industry is bullish Trump’s warning comes amid many global banks still pushing back against cryptocurrency adoption, with the Bank of Italy slamming stablecoin growth and Bitcoin ( BTC ) investments. On the other hand, many industry executives are bullish on crypto adoption by banks already in 2025, amid governments like the US pushing a more crypto-friendly agenda. Trump’s new prediction comes in line with his previous bold forecasts on crypto. In December 2024, Eric Trump predicted that Bitcoin would inevitably hit $1 million per coin , while global governments and institutions would have to adopt the cryptocurrency to compete in the fast-growing market.

Announced Tuesday, the service will be available to Bunq users in the Netherlands, France, Spain, Ireland, Italy, and Belgium. The neobank is planning to roll out crypto trading in the European Economic Area (EEA), the US and the UK. Bunq Meets User Demand to Offer Simplified Crypto Trading Per the official announcement , the launch follows “user demand” for a simple, transparent, and trustworthy way to invest in crypto. The neobank surveyed European global citizens regarding their crypto investing needs. According to the research, 65% of those surveyed are looking for a single platform to manage their banking, savings, and crypto investments. Additionally, over half of the crypto-curious citizens feel that existing platforms don’t meet their needs. The fintech firm aims to fill the gap by providing a user-friendly and trustworthy solution. “Our users across the world have long waited for a simple, safe and straightforward way to invest in digital assets,” said Ali Niknam, founder and CEO of Bunq. “Now, everything they will ever need to save, spend and invest – including crypto – is on one platform.” Additionally, the crypto trading venture will be powered by crypto exchange giant Kraken, the exchange noted. The solution would combine the security of a fully licensed bank with Kraken’s expertise. Neobank Reported Strong User Growth in 2024 Bunq’s crypto offering arrives at a time when the bank announced a spike in its user base. The fintech reported more than 12.5 million users as of June 2024, up from nine million users a year earlier. Apart from crypto trading, Bunq offers a range of digital financial services such as debit cards, mortgages and current/savings accounts through its mobile app. The neobank has applied for a broker dealer license in the US.

Strong spot price momentum and ETF inflows support a potential $100,000 push. Bull flag pattern suggests a $108,300 target if BTC breaks the $95,000 resistance. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price has rebounded by 28% from its five-month low below $75,000 reached on April 9. However, its failure to break above the $95,000 resistance level decisively has sparked concerns that the latest recovery may trap bulls. BTC/USD daily price chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Bitcoin ETF flows provide a “more solid foundation” But another big crash may be averted as BTC price momentum is backed by elevated spot Bitcoin ETF inflows in recent days. This provides Bitcoin a “more solid foundation” to surge forward, according to market intelligence firm Glassnode. As Bitcoin edged above $95,000 , its 14-day price momentum indicator rose sharply from 58.7 to 82.1, as shown in the chart below. “This breakout pushed the momentum above the statistical high band, a rare occurrence that historically signals strong bullish momentum,” Glassnode said in its latest Weekly Market Pulse report. This indicator last crossed the statistical high band in November 2024, preceding a 61% rally in Bitcoin’s price to new all-time highs . Bitcoin price momentum indicator. Source: Glassnode Glassnode, however, warns that such high momentum also increases the likelihood of short-term cooling periods, explaining BTC’s current choppy price action . The onchain data provider added: “Sustained strength will require spot volume and demand to remain positive.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) metric, which tracks the difference between taker buyers and sellers, remains close to the statistical high band despite a modest pullback over the last few days. The high CVD metric suggests that the buy pressure is “still relatively strong,” Glassnode said, adding: “This persistent positive aggression supports the bullish momentum seen in spot markets, although the slight softening hints that some profit-taking activity may be emerging as the price extends into higher ranges.” Bitcoin spot CVD.

This signals a change in market sentiment favoring the upside, reducing the possibility of a major crash. Bitcoin bull flag hints at $108,000 Bitcoin technicals show it remains within a bull flag pattern, which puts it in a good position to break out if key support levels hold.

Perhaps it was etched in its core and reiterated throughout the numerous market cycles, but something about the promise of “redefining the existing banking system” and becoming the new standard for international value transfer really stuck with people. In this article, we will drift apart from traditional technical Ripple price analysis and will look at something far more trivial. How much money would you have if you invested $1000 in XRP back in 2018? After all, the most common regret for most people is not investing in certain cryptocurrencies back in the days, when everything was supposedly a lot cheaper. We won’t dive into how absurd this notion is and why simply buying a coin doesn’t mean you will make money, even if it goes 100x in 8 years. XRP’s Price in 2018 For the sake of this particular article, we will take a few different price points: Average XRP price in 2018 Highest XRP price in 2018 Lowest XRP price in 2018 And in case you are wondering why did we choose 2018, well, it’s because that’s the year cryptocurrencies broke into the mainstream. So, data from CoinLore shows that the average price for XRP in 2018 was $0.66. Currently, the coin is trading at $2.22, meaning that your $1000 invested in 2018 would currently be $3360, representing a profit of around $2360. Moving forward, the highest XRP price in 2018, which is also the current all-time high, was $3.83, meaning that you would be sitting on a loss of around 42%. Your $1000 would now be $580. And last, but not least, what if you timed the absolute bottom in 2018? Well, that was around $0.24. Your $1000 would be abou $9250, representing gains upwards of $8,000. XRP’s price is up by 825% since then.

According to a shareholder letter dated April 29, CEO Devin Nunes outlined a vision where this utility token could be used initially to pay for Truth+ subscriptions, with later plans to expand its use across other Trump Media platforms, including Truth Social and the financial services branch Truth.Fi. Truth+ May Soon Accept Crypto for Subscriptions Nunes stated the crypto component would also serve as part of a broader rewards ecosystem that spans the company’s digital offerings. While details on timelines remain scarce, this signals the most serious crypto push yet from Trump Media, after months of hints and groundwork. The company previously filed a trademark in November with the US Patent and Trademark Office, covering digital wallet functionalities, crypto asset trading, and payment services. Truth+ launched last October, billing itself as a subscription platform for politically conservative audiences, and the proposed token could soon become a gateway for users to interact with the platform more seamlessly—especially in an era where digital payments are gaining ground. Crypto Partnerships and Financial Ambitions Trump Media’s growing crypto footprint also includes strategic partnerships. The firm recently signed a binding agreement with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) featuring crypto and “Made in America” stocks—these are set to roll out on the Truth.Fi platform. Moreover, the company has earmarked up to $250 million in cash reserves for investment into various financial products, including Bitcoin, altcoins, and crypto-related securities. These assets would reportedly be held under the custody of asset management giant Charles Schwab. However, Trump’s involvement in multiple crypto ventures has stirred ethical concerns, especially following his return to the White House. Although he transferred his 59% stake in TMTG to a trust last December, critics argue that indirect benefits or influence could still exist. His association with World Liberty Financial, where he is dubbed “Chief Crypto Advocate,” and his launch of the memecoin “Official Trump (TRUMP)” just days before taking office, have drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers worried about potential conflicts of interest.

Bitcoin Demand Momentum Continues To Be In Negative Zone According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by analyst Crazzyblockk, Bitcoin’s 30-day Demand Momentum is still firmly in negative territory. Currently, the 30-day Demand Momentum stands at around -483,860 BTC, while the 30-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the same metric is hovering near -310,700 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Clear This Critical Cost Basis Level For Continued Upside, Analyst Says To clarify, the 30-day Demand Momentum is calculated by subtracting the 30-day Long-Term Holder (LTH) Supply from the 30-day Short-Term Holder (STH) Supply. This metric effectively measures the net shift in active demand for BTC. A rise in short-term holder supply relative to long-term holders implies that market participants are increasingly opting to speculate rather than hold Bitcoin for the long haul. Trading in the negative zone suggests waning demand from short-term investors. This could be attributed to profit-taking – especially after BTC’s recent 10% rally over the past seven days – or lingering market uncertainty amid global economic concerns, including renewed trade tariff tensions. Furthermore, the market is experiencing a dynamic where long-term holders are absorbing fewer BTC than what short-term holders are distributing. According to Crazzyblockk, such behavior is commonly observed during late-cycle distribution phases or macro-level consolidation periods. It is worth noting that Bitcoin has previously experienced similar deep negative divergences in Demand Momentum, specifically during mid-2021 and the second quarter of 2022. In both instances, these divergences were followed by sharp price pullbacks. On an optimistic note, the ensuing market recovery on both the instances coincided with market bottoms. They also marked the resumption of sustainable bullish momentum in the following months. If Bitcoin can reverse this negative demand trend and push the metric back into positive territory, it could signal a strong resurgence in investor conviction. A return to the “green zone” would likely mark a renewed uptrend, potentially pushing BTC to a new all-time high (ATH) in the near term. Positive Signs Emerging For BTC While Demand Momentum remains weak, other market signals suggest that Bitcoin could be nearing a trend reversal. For example, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand – a separate on-chain metric – has recently shown a sharp rebound, hinting at a possible return of buying pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surpasses Realized Price Of Recent Buyers — Rally Incoming Or Double Top? Additionally, BTC exchange reserves continue to decline rapidly. According to recent data, Bitcoin just recorded its highest exchange withdrawal volume in two years. This ongoing depletion of exchange-held BTC could lead to a supply squeeze, further supporting bullish price action. Technical indicators also point toward the possibility of BTC testing its current ATH of $108,786. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $94,773, up 0.3% over the past 24 hours.

43978305,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153999,1746000045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Meta AI’s Bold Challenge to OpenAI Unveiled at LlamaCon,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-ai-challenge-openai/,"In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, where competition is fierce, Meta recently made a significant move that has the industry buzzing. At its inaugural developer conference, LlamaCon , held at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, Meta laid bare its strategy to directly confront rivals, most notably OpenAI. This wasn’t just a showcase of new tech; it felt like a declaration of war in the AI space, heavily focused on promoting an open AI ecosystem . What Did Meta Unveil at LlamaCon? Meta used LlamaCon as a platform to launch two key products aimed squarely at expanding the reach of its open Llama models and, perhaps more importantly, undercutting the dominance of closed AI providers like OpenAI. The main announcements included: A Consumer-Facing Meta AI Chatbot App: Designed to go head-to-head with ChatGPT, this new app offers users a direct way to interact with Meta’s AI capabilities. Intriguingly, it includes a social feed where users can share their AI conversations, hinting at a potential social layer that could challenge OpenAI’s rumored social network ambitions. The app also promises personalized responses based on a user’s activity across Meta’s various platforms. A Developer-Facing API for Llama Models: This new API makes it significantly easier for developers to access and utilize Llama models in the cloud. Meta claims developers can now connect to Llama models with just a single line of code, eliminating the need to rely on third-party cloud providers. This move directly challenges OpenAI’s successful API business by offering a simpler, more integrated solution for developers building AI applications. Meta’s Core Strategy: Open vs. Closed AI While expanding Llama adoption is a stated goal, the underlying motive appears to be Meta’s deep-seated rivalry with OpenAI. Meta’s vision is to foster a thriving open AI ecosystem where models and tools are freely available, contrasting sharply with OpenAI’s model of gating its advanced models behind proprietary services. This isn’t a new stance for Meta; court filings have previously revealed Meta executives’ focus on surpassing OpenAI’s models, such as GPT-4. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been vocal about this distinction. In a letter from July 2024, he explicitly stated that “selling access to AI models isn’t [Meta’s] business model,” positioning Meta as an advocate for open access against companies like OpenAI. At LlamaCon, Zuckerberg reinforced this, viewing any lab that makes its models openly available – citing examples like DeepSeek and Alibaba’s Qwen – as allies in the fight against closed model providers. Zuckerberg highlighted the strength of the open-source approach, explaining, “Part of the value around open source is that you can mix and match. So if another model, like DeepSeek, is better — or if Qwen is better at something — then, as developers, you have the ability to take the best parts of the intelligence from different models and produce exactly what you need.” He believes this collaborative, mix-and-match capability makes open source an “unstoppable force” that will eventually surpass closed-source models in quality. Addressing the OpenAI Competition Directly Every aspect of the LlamaCon announcements seemed calibrated to address the OpenAI competition . The consumer chatbot takes on ChatGPT, the API targets OpenAI’s developer platform, and the overall messaging champions the open philosophy as a direct counterpoint to OpenAI’s closed approach. This strategy suggests Meta is willing to prioritize weakening its rival and strengthening the open ecosystem, even if it means not always leading with the most cutting-edge individual model. For instance, some AI researchers hoped Meta would release a competitive reasoning model like OpenAI’s o3-mini at the event, but this did not happen. Beyond the competitive aspect, Meta’s strong push for open Llama models might also be influenced by regulatory considerations. The EU AI Act offers certain advantages and a lighter regulatory touch for companies distributing “free and open source” AI systems. While there’s debate about whether Llama truly meets all the criteria for “open source,” Meta consistently uses this label, potentially aiming to position itself favorably under future regulations. In conclusion, LlamaCon was more than just a product launch event for Meta. It was a strategic maneuver designed to bolster its open AI ecosystem , challenge OpenAI’s dominance across consumer and developer fronts, and potentially gain regulatory advantages. Meta appears committed to this path, believing that empowering the open community is the key to long-term success and a powerful way to limit the growth of its main competitor.

Following the success of its Binance Labs-incubated (now Yzi Labs), self-custodial crypto wallet with 3.5 illion users, Grindery has turned its sights on building the permissionless payments layer for AI agents. The team behind the popular smart wallet is proud to reveal its latest product, Aventino , a developer-focused infrastructure layer that provides smart wallets for AI agents. With Aventino, Grindery is bringing financial autonomy to AI agents. I. Aventino provides the tools to build an ecosystem where AI agents can operate independently — owning wallets, making payments, interacting with blockchain protocols, and establishing their own tokenized communities across platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, XMT and the open web. Aventino is a permissionless smart wallet infrastructure that uses Ethereum account abstraction protocol ERC4337. The platform lets developers: Build an AI agent on any LLM, use any framework, and distribute on any client and/or device. Enable these agents to pay and get paid, interact with protocols and issue their own tokens (allowing for tokenized agents). Build communities around their agents, enabling new forms of governance, and growth. “We believe the future of AI requires financial autonomy — not just intelligence of agents.” said Tim Delhaes, Grindery’s CEO and co-founder, adding: “Aventino empowers developers to build platform-agnostic agents that can transact, govern, and evolve on their own. Just like mobile apps created a layer between users and the internet, agentic AI will create a new layer between users and the AI models that power their digital lives. And it will be powered by crypto.” Backed by Binance Labs (now YZi Labs) Grindery’s journey began in 2022 in Binance Labs’ incubation program, building what was once dubbed the “Zapier for Web3.” After 3.5 million users registered on its Telegram smart wallet, Grindery saw the opportunity to leverage the infrastructure it has built for its consumer application to expand into a much bigger market: empowering AI agents as autonomous economic actors. Aventino’s core capabilities With the launch of Aventino, developers will be able to build fully autonomous, highly customized AI agents that are interoperable, decentralized, and monetizable — without being locked into closed ecosystems. The platform’s core features include: Self-custodial wallets for AI agents – Built on ERC-4337 account abstraction, enabling agents to interact natively with DeFi and web3 protocols. Creator-centric stack – Tech-agnostic and platform-agnostic tools to publish on Telegram, WhatsApp, web, and decentralized clients like XMTP. Agent tokenization & monetization – Optional token issuance for agents to support governance, liquidity, and community co-ownership. Turnkey monetization – Agents can accept payments via traditional fiat methods like Apple Pay and Google Pay, as well as in crypto. “AI agents should be free to evolve, interact, and earn,” added Delhaes. “With Aventino, we’re building the rails for that vision — and enabling a future where anyone can build AI agents with real-world utility and governance, powered by crypto.” GX is the currency of AI Last month, Grindery launched its universal gas token, GX, which is now trading on major CEXs Kucoin, MEXC, and Gate.io, as well as DEXs Uniswap and STON.fi, and DeFi aggregator LI.FI.

Following the success of its Binance Labs-incubated (now Yzi Labs), self-custodial crypto wallet with 3.5 illion users, Grindery has turned its sights on building the permissionless payments layer for AI agents. The team behind the popular smart wallet is proud to reveal its latest product, Aventino , a developer-focused infrastructure layer that provides smart wallets for AI agents. With Aventino, Grindery is bringing financial autonomy to AI agents. I. Aventino provides the tools to build an ecosystem where AI agents can operate independently — owning wallets, making payments, interacting with blockchain protocols, and establishing their own tokenized communities across platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, XMT and the open web. Aventino is a permissionless smart wallet infrastructure that uses Ethereum account abstraction protocol ERC4337. The platform lets developers: Build an AI agent on any LLM, use any framework, and distribute on any client and/or device. Enable these agents to pay and get paid, interact with protocols and issue their own tokens (allowing for tokenized agents). Build communities around their agents, enabling new forms of governance, and growth. “We believe the future of AI requires financial autonomy — not just intelligence of agents.” said Tim Delhaes, Grindery’s CEO and co-founder, adding: “Aventino empowers developers to build platform-agnostic agents that can transact, govern, and evolve on their own. Just like mobile apps created a layer between users and the internet, agentic AI will create a new layer between users and the AI models that power their digital lives. And it will be powered by crypto.” Backed by Binance Labs (now YZi Labs) Grindery’s journey began in 2022 in Binance Labs’ incubation program, building what was once dubbed the “Zapier for Web3.” After 3.5 million users registered on its Telegram smart wallet, Grindery saw the opportunity to leverage the infrastructure it has built for its consumer application to expand into a much bigger market: empowering AI agents as autonomous economic actors. Aventino’s core capabilities With the launch of Aventino, developers will be able to build fully autonomous, highly customized AI agents that are interoperable, decentralized, and monetizable — without being locked into closed ecosystems. The platform’s core features include: Self-custodial wallets for AI agents – Built on ERC-4337 account abstraction, enabling agents to interact natively with DeFi and web3 protocols. Creator-centric stack – Tech-agnostic and platform-agnostic tools to publish on Telegram, WhatsApp, web, and decentralized clients like XMTP. Agent tokenization & monetization – Optional token issuance for agents to support governance, liquidity, and community co-ownership. Turnkey monetization – Agents can accept payments via traditional fiat methods like Apple Pay and Google Pay, as well as in crypto. “AI agents should be free to evolve, interact, and earn,” added Delhaes. “With Aventino, we’re building the rails for that vision — and enabling a future where anyone can build AI agents with real-world utility and governance, powered by crypto.” GX is the currency of AI Last month, Grindery launched its universal gas token, GX, which is now trading on major CEXs Kucoin, MEXC, and Gate.io, as well as DEXs Uniswap and STON.fi, and DeFi aggregator LI.FI.

Grayscale, which manages $8.1 billion in assets, met with the SEC's Cryptocurrency Task Force on April 21 to discuss amendments to its 19b-4 Form filings for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH). The company emphasized the need for the SEC to become comfortable with issuer solutions addressing challenges such as the mismatch between the exchange-traded product settlement cycle and the time required to transfer staked ETH. Industry leaders, including Jake from BitGo and executives from BlackRock, VanEck, and CME Group, have discussed integrating staking into ETF structures at events like the Staking Summit in Dubai and TOKEN2049 in Abu Dhabi. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck expressed optimism about the future of Ethereum staking within ETFs and mentioned hopes for a Solana ETF approval. He also noted that traditional investor adoption of crypto remains in early stages, signaling potential growth in institutional investment in the sector.

While technical signals flash indecision, the broader market is split between bullish momentum coming from India’s $10 million crypto push and the drag from continued ETF delays in the U.S. The $95.6K ceiling is now the battleground, and a breakout — or breakdown — could set the tone for the next big move. India’s Crypto Boom Fuels Bitcoin Optimism In a contrasting bright spot, India is emerging as a powerhouse for Web3 development. Bitget and Avalanche are investing $10 million to grow India’s crypto talent pipeline through events, grants, and scholarships — with a focus on Delhi and Bangalore. We’re teaming up with @avax to fuel India’s next wave of Web3 adoption and innovation! At #Bitget , we believe knowledge unlocks blockchain’s true potential — and we’re investing in the builders shaping the future.

While Dogecoin and SHIB draw headlines, BTC and ETH remain dominant holdings in India’s maturing investor base. Trump Token Buzz, ETF Delays Stir Uncertainty On the U.S. front, Trump’s Truth Social is exploring its own crypto token to support subscriptions and digital services. While the news hasn’t moved DJT stock much, it reflects rising mainstream interest in blockchain solutions. Trump Media is considering launching a utility token. The digital token will be used for Truth+ subscriptions and later for other products across the “Truth ecosphere.” Another token no one asked for. pic.twitter.com/vMNUI88TZF — TFTC (@TFTC21) April 29, 2025 Meanwhile, the SEC has again delayed decisions on Dogecoin and XRP ETFs proposed by Bitwise and Franklin Templeton — pushing them to June. This follows over 70 pending crypto ETF proposals submitted in 2025. Just in: The @SECGov has delayed decisions on the following ETFs: $DOGE – June 15 $XRP – June 17 pic.twitter.com/dccFXYYFUv — Rug Radio (@RugRadio) April 29, 2025 Key Highlights: Trump token may boost mainstream crypto appeal ETF delays favor BTC over altcoins Political pressure on regulators is rising These developments reinforce BTC’s positioning as the safest bet for institutional inflows, especially as uncertainty swirls around altcoin regulation. Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook – Trade Setup Below $95K The BTC/USD is showing signs of exhaustion just beneath the $95,643 resistance zone. Price action has repeatedly tested this level but failed to break through, forming a potential double-top pattern. The 50 EMA ($94,698) is now acting as near-term resistance, while the ascending trendline from April 24 continues to offer support. MACD momentum is flattening, signaling indecision. For traders: this is a classic range-trading scenario. If BTC fails to reclaim $95,643 and dips toward $93,760, traders could look to buy near the trendline with a stop below $93,000. Alternatively, a clean breakout above $95,643 on strong volume opens the door to $96,850. Until then, expect choppy sideways action. Trade Idea: Buy: Near $93,760 trendline support Target: $95,600–$96,850 Stop-Loss: Below $93,000 This setup balances risk and reward in a consolidating but bullish structure. Final Take Bitcoin remains stuck under the $95.6K ceiling, forming a potential triple top—but India’s $10M Web3 initiative and rising global engagement provide a longer-term bullish backdrop. While ETF delays weigh on sentiment, they also underscore Bitcoin’s dominance as the institutional favorite. Watch the $95,643 breakout — it could decide the next leg up. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5M Milestone as 80% Yield Fuels Staking Surge Investor interest in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) remains strong, with $5.1 million raised out of a $5.84 million target. The token is now priced at $0.002485 as the presale rapidly approaches its next price increase. BTCBULL stands apart from typical meme tokens by offering utility-driven staking rewards. Investors can earn an estimated 80% annual yield while retaining full liquidity—unstaking is available anytime with no penalties. High-Yield Staking with Flexible Access BTCBULL continues to set itself apart from typical meme assets by focusing on sustainable utility. The project’s staking program offers an estimated 81% annual yield, complemented by Bitcoin-backed distribution rewards. Crucially, users retain full liquidity with the ability to unstake anytime—no mandatory lockup periods or penalties. Latest Staking Snapshot: Tokens Staked : 1,304,753,147 BTCBULL Annual Yield : 80% APY Unstaking: Available at any time This flexible structure appeals to both yield hunters and investors seeking upside potential without giving up liquidity. BTCBULL ’s flexible, high-yield model offers an attractive entry point for investors seeking strong returns and liquidity as crypto market momentum builds.

According to Seyffart, the June deadline is not expected to be the final determination point. He stated that most crypto-related ETPs, including the Franklin XRP Trust, will likely receive final decisions in the fourth quarter of 2025. He identified mid-October, around October 18, as a likely final deadline for the SEC’s ruling on the XRP ETF. Some more detail after speaking with ETF guru @JSeyff just now: These dates are all intermediate and we will likely see final decisions on a lot of the crypto ETPs in Q4. For the $XRP spot ETF, James is eyeing mid-October, around the 18th, as a final decision deadline.

Increased engagement could indicate a more accelerated path to resolution, though the agency has historically taken the full review period in prior cryptocurrency ETF cases. Terrett’s tweet reflected this view, clarifying that the timeline remains flexible depending on regulatory developments. XRP ETF Decision Part of Broader Regulatory Outlook Terrett’s report connects the XRP ETF decision to broader trends in the SEC’s handling of digital asset products. After approving several spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in 2024, the Commission has received numerous filings for other cryptocurrency-based ETFs . The Franklin XRP Trust is among the most closely watched applications. According to Seyffart, final decisions on multiple crypto ETPs may converge in the fourth quarter, marking a key phase in the SEC’s evolving stance on digital assets in traditional financial products.

The private meeting, held at the White House’s Eisenhower building, followed major market unrest sparked by Trump’s aggressive new tariffs. Many attendees described Miran’s responses as unclear and unconvincing , with some saying he seemed unprepared for the deep, technical questions posed by experienced hedge fund managers. According to one participant, ""the talking points fell apart quickly."" Representatives from big financial players such as Citadel, BlackRock, PGIM, and Citigroup attended the event, which aligned with the IMF’s spring gathering. Although some were more optimistic about the administration’s tax and deregulation strategies, most left the session unconvinced about its trade direction . Trump’s tariff announcement on April 2 shook markets, sending bond prices down and pushing 10-year Treasury yields to 4.59% before they eased to 4.17% after a 90-day pause on the tariffs. Investors remain wary, despite Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later suggesting a US-China deal was near, which helped calm equities. Miran repeated the administration’s stance that tariffs target other countries more than US consumers , while admitting they weren’t primarily designed to raise money, though extra revenue might result. His past proposals—including weakening the dollar and asking foreign countries to fund US defense in exchange for protection—have also unsettled investors. He has since appeared to distance himself from these earlier views, according to sources close to the situation. One insider described his current position as a ""full-scale retreat.""",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-04-30 08:09:06
43978641,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154000,1746000657,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Microsoft AI Coding: Satya Nadella Reveals Transformative 30% AI Code Generation,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/microsoft-ai-coding-report/,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, where innovation is key, news from industry leaders often provides significant insights. For those following the intersection of technology and digital assets, understanding shifts at major tech companies is crucial. A recent revelation from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella regarding the role of AI in the company’s software development highlights the growing importance of AI code generation across the tech sector. What Did Satya Nadella Reveal About Microsoft AI Coding? During a fireside chat with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Meta’s LlamaCon conference, Microsoft’s head, Satya Nadella, shared a striking figure: between 20% and 30% of the code currently residing within Microsoft’s internal code repositories was written by software, essentially meaning it was AI-generated. This statement came in response to a direct question from Zuckerberg about the extent of AI’s contribution to Microsoft’s codebase today. The Microsoft CEO also touched upon the varying success rates of AI code generation across different programming languages. He noted that the company has observed more significant progress and adoption in languages like Python, which is widely used in data science and AI development, compared to more complex or system-level languages such as C++. Interestingly, when Nadella posed the same question back to Mark Zuckerberg, the Meta CEO admitted he did not have a clear figure for the percentage of Meta’s code generated by AI. This suggests that while AI assistance in coding is widespread, the methods for quantifying its direct contribution can vary or may not be uniformly tracked across all tech giants. Comparing Notes: Microsoft vs. Google on Generative AI Coding The conversation at LlamaCon wasn’t the first instance of a major tech CEO providing figures on AI-generated code. Just the week prior, during Google’s earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai mentioned that AI was generating more than 30% of Google’s code. While these figures from two of the world’s largest software companies appear similar, it’s important to consider them with caution. The exact methodologies used by Microsoft and Google to measure what constitutes ‘AI-generated’ code versus human-written code assisted by AI tools remain somewhat opaque. Factors like whether they count code suggested by AI and accepted by a human, or only entirely AI-generated blocks, could significantly impact the reported percentages. Therefore, while the numbers indicate a clear trend towards greater AI involvement, direct comparisons should be made carefully. The Future of Coding: How Much Will Be AI-Generated? Looking ahead, some predictions are even more ambitious. Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott has previously voiced his expectation that a staggering 95% of all code could be AI-generated by 2030. While this might seem like a distant prospect, the current figures reported by Nadella and Pichai demonstrate that the trajectory towards significant AI assistance in software development is already well underway. This rapid integration of AI into the development workflow raises important questions about the future of coding and the role of human developers. It suggests a shift where developers may spend less time on writing boilerplate code or debugging minor errors and more time on higher-level tasks such as system architecture, design, code review, and ensuring the overall quality and security of AI-generated components. Benefits and Challenges of AI Code Generation The increased adoption of Generative AI coding tools brings a mix of benefits and challenges: Benefits: Increased Productivity: AI can quickly generate code snippets, complete functions, or even entire components, significantly speeding up the development process. Reduced Repetitive Tasks: Developers can offload writing boilerplate code, unit tests, or simple scripts to AI, freeing up time for more complex problems. Improved Code Quality (Potentially): AI trained on vast datasets can suggest best practices and identify potential errors or security vulnerabilities early on. Lower Barrier to Entry: AI tools can help new developers understand concepts and write functional code more quickly. Challenges: Accuracy and Reliability: AI-generated code is not always perfect and can contain bugs, logical errors, or inefficiencies that require human review and correction. Security Risks: Poorly designed AI models or insufficient oversight can lead to the introduction of security vulnerabilities into the codebase. Need for Human Oversight: AI tools are assistants, not replacements. Developers must still understand the code generated, review it thoroughly, and ensure it meets requirements. Intellectual Property Concerns: Questions arise about the ownership and licensing of code generated by AI models trained on public data. Potential Job Displacement: While the role is likely to evolve rather than disappear, concerns exist about the impact on developer jobs focused on more routine coding tasks. The figures shared by Satya Nadella AI insights, alongside those from other tech leaders, underscore a pivotal moment in software development. AI is no longer just a tool for building applications; it is becoming an active participant in writing the applications themselves. While the exact percentage might be debated and measurement methods refined, the trend is undeniable: AI is poised to reshape the coding landscape fundamentally. This shift means developers will increasingly need to collaborate with AI tools, leveraging their strengths while mitigating their weaknesses. The focus will likely move towards prompt engineering for AI, understanding AI model limitations, and critically reviewing and integrating AI-generated code into larger systems. For companies, it necessitates investing in AI tools, training developers, and establishing robust processes for incorporating AI into the software development lifecycle. In conclusion, Satya Nadella’s report on Microsoft’s AI-generated code percentage is a significant data point confirming the rapid integration of AI into the core processes of major tech companies. It signals a transformative period for software development, promising increased efficiency but also presenting new challenges that the industry must navigate to fully realize the potential of AI code generation.

Alpaca Finance, which claims to be “the largest lending protocol that allows leveraged yield farming on BNB Chain and Fantom,” jumped from $0.181 to $0.950, up 422% in less than eight hours. While the huge leap experienced by ALPACA surprised everyone, the price suddenly dropped by 92% yesterday. Many cryptocurrency experts and investors believe that the 422% rally was mainly due to Binance’s upcoming delist event on May 2. This rise caught investors who were expecting a crash with the delist announcement off guard. Investors who opened short positions were squeezed when prices rose and had to buy back despite the losses; this fed the bullish cycle. Additionally, the Alpaca Finance team has cancelled plans to issue more ALPACA tokens following backlash from the community and announced that the 214th weekly buyback and burn has been completed, removing 188,888 ALPACA (approximately $41,500) from circulation. This rally also liquidated short positions. According to Coinglass data, ALPACA futures liquidation volume surpassed Bitcoin. ALPACA perpetual futures recorded $46.64 million in liquidation volume over the last 24 hours, surpassing the $43.32 million volume in Bitcoin (BTC). In the last hour, ALPACA liquidations reached $5.6 million, while BTC liquidations totaled $2.39 million. The largest liquidation occurred on Bybit in the ALPACA/USDT pair. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What's Happening to the Altcoin That Binance Delisted? First Dump Then Pump!

However, the narrative has changed, and the altcoin is now struggling with significant downward pressure. After hitting the $7.624 high, BERA has lost over 50% to hover near $3.60 at press time. While profit-booking contributed to the notable slide, increasing liquidity exodus has weighed on BERA’s momentum. With the significant shift in sentiment and magnifying selling pressure, the question remains: what is next for BERA and its price actions? Berachain’s quick turnaround Berachain thrived three months ago, leading recoveries in the altcoin space. The platform recorded a staggering 685 million in liquidity inflows, eclipsing most of its rivals. Amplified interest in BERA’s ecosystem and speculations about its future price potential catalyzed the bullish tendencies. Also, optimistic ecosystem developments, including the launch of the proof-of-liquidity (PoL) system fueled trader and investor excitement. Fast forward to today, the narrative is much different. The liquidity that kept Berachain afloat is now drying up. Traders have increasingly exited their positions, leading to swift reversals in price while dampening sentiments. Over $43 million offloaded in a week Numbers don’t lie. Traders offloaded BERA tokens worth $40 million in the past week ( Artemis data ). The trend persisted as they sold $3.4 million worth of assets in the past 24 hours, confirming magnified selling momentum. The massive outflows have sparked worries among holders and enthusiasts. This is different from profit-taking, it highlights funds exiting the BERA platform entirely. Such trends can severely damage the altcoin’s near-term recovery potential. Notably, dried liquidity translates to fewer buyers, higher volatility, and thinner order books. These narratives challenge BERA’s rebound possibilities in the short term. Even new buyers might not be enough to rescue Berachain from its struggles. The project requires massive inflows and revived investor sentiments to secure grounds before contemplating new surges. Notably, the altcoin experiences a notable shift in investor sentiments as even long-term participants start to reduce their holdings. Dwindled interest among loyal holders confirms a lack of conviction in BERA’s near-term bounce-backs. The altcoin may need massive catalysts to break out. BERA price outlook The alt trades at $3.60, down over 5% within the past 24 hours. Chart by Coinmarketcap It remained range-bound in the previous week and down 47% on the monthly chart. The declining trading volume signals more pain for BERA amid dwindled investor interest. Thus, the alt remains poised for extended declines unless liquidity returns and large-scale holders stop dumping. For now, Berachain will likely consolidate to rebuild momentum before initiating a solid recovery. Meanwhile, crypto is known for its unpredictability. Massive fundamental developments, including protocol upgrades, strategic collaborations, and broad-based rallies, could stabilize BERA and revive investor enthusiasm.

At the heart of this shift is an eight-day inflow streak that saw U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs collectively absorb $3.9 billion into their holdings, according to FarSide data. Institutional Juggernaut vs. Retail Retreat According to insight from market intelligence platform Santiment, this sustained capital injection reflects a newfound investor confidence, emerging just as fears around global tariff uncertainty and geopolitical tension are starting to ease. “Some traders may feel more relaxed now that the fear around new tariffs has calmed down. Others may be trying to ride the wave of crypto’s recent bounce back.” wrote Santiment analyst BrianQ. One standout from the recent pattern is BlackRock’s IBIT. As stated in the report, liquidity, brand trust, and media saturation have converged to make it the preferred vehicle for institutions looking to gain BTC exposure. On April 29 alone, it added 2,273 BTC worth nearly $217 million, pushing its total holdings to 601,209 BTC. It marked a symbolic and logistical milestone, cementing BlackRock’s position as the largest institutional Bitcoin holder, with the second-largest, Fidelity, at just under 200,000 BTC. Still, despite the flood of institutional capital, Santiment’s report revealed a concerning trend: Bitcoin’s price is rising even though trading volumes are dropping, a classic bearish divergence that often foreshadows pullbacks. This anomaly is particularly striking given Bitcoin’s surge to $95,066. Usually, such rallies are accompanied by swelling volumes, signaling widespread conviction. Instead, observers have noted that a narrow cohort of deep-pocketed investors has propped up the market, primarily ETF issuers and corporations like Strategy , while retailers remained sidelined. Even though the ETF inflows mechanically increase demand since issuers must buy BTC to back shares, the fading volume suggests BTC’s recent rally lacks organic momentum. “There’s a bit of a bearish divergence forming due to prices rising, but volume moving the opposite direction,” explained BrianQ. “This pattern usually suggests a rally might be getting weaker, since it’s not being supported by strong activity from traders.” BTC’s Steady Climb Nonetheless, Bitcoin is currently holding firm around $95,000 following a decisive breakout earlier in the month. Over the past 24 hours, it traded within a narrow band between $93,881 and $95,443, per data from CoinGecko. On the weekly scale, the flagship cryptocurrency gained a modest 1.6%, which was enough to outpace the broader crypto market’s 1.3% rise in that period. Additionally, its 14-day and 30-day gains sit at 13.7% and 16.1% respectively, while remaining up more than 50% year-on-year.

That’s the promise of decentralized finance (DeFi) making inroads into real-world applications. A significant step towards this future was recently announced, focusing specifically on DeFi student loans . What’s Happening with DeFi Student Loans? The big news making waves in the Web3 and education sectors is the substantial liquidity injection into Pencil Finance. Animoca Brands, a major player known for its blockchain gaming investments, and Open Campus, a Web3 protocol focused on education, have jointly committed $10 million to Pencil Finance. This funding isn’t just an investment; it’s specifically earmarked to provide liquidity that will serve as collateral on the Pencil Finance platform. The goal? To facilitate decentralized student loans. Pencil Finance is building its protocol on the EDU Chain, which is naturally aligned with educational initiatives, given Open Campus’s involvement in its development. This strategic alignment aims to create a robust ecosystem where education funding can be accessed and managed on the blockchain. How Do RWA Crypto and Student Loans Connect? At the heart of Pencil Finance’s approach is the concept of Real-World Assets (RWA). In this context, the ‘real-world asset’ is essentially the future earning potential or creditworthiness associated with a student loan. Tokenizing or representing these traditional financial instruments on the blockchain is what RWA crypto is all about. Here’s a simplified breakdown: Traditional Student Loans: Issued by banks or government entities, often involves complex application processes, credit checks, and fixed or variable interest rates tied to traditional financial markets. DeFi Student Loans (via RWA): Aims to tokenize the student’s loan agreement or future income share as an RWA. This token can then be used within a DeFi protocol like Pencil Finance. The $10 million provided by Animoca Brands and Open Campus acts as the initial pool of collateral. This allows borrowers (students) to potentially access funds against their tokenized RWA, while lenders (liquidity providers) earn yield from the interest paid on the loans. This bridges the gap between traditional finance (student loans) and decentralized finance (blockchain lending protocols). Why Are Animoca Brands and Open Campus Involved? This collaboration might seem unexpected at first glance, especially with Animoca Brands’ strong ties to gaming. However, Animoca Brands has a broad investment thesis focused on building the open metaverse and Web3 ecosystem. Education is a fundamental pillar of society and a critical area for Web3 adoption and innovation. Investing in platforms that tokenize real-world value, like student loans as RWA, aligns with their vision of expanding the utility and reach of blockchain technology beyond just collectibles and games. Open Campus ‘s involvement is perhaps more intuitive. As a Web3 education protocol, their mission is to empower educators and students globally. Facilitating access to education through innovative funding mechanisms like decentralized loans on the EDU Chain is directly in line with their core objectives. They are not just investors; they are actively building the infrastructure (EDU Chain) and fostering the ecosystem where protocols like Pencil Finance can thrive. Their joint investment signals strong confidence in Pencil Finance’s ability to execute on the complex task of bringing real-world student loans onto the blockchain in a secure and scalable way. What are the Benefits and Challenges of This Model? Bringing student loans into the RWA crypto and DeFi space offers exciting possibilities, but it’s not without its hurdles. Potential Benefits: Increased Accessibility: Potentially provides funding options to students in regions or circumstances where traditional financing is difficult to obtain. Lower Costs: Decentralized protocols can sometimes offer more competitive interest rates by cutting out traditional intermediaries. Transparency: Transactions and loan terms recorded on the blockchain can offer greater transparency. Innovation: Opens the door for new models of education financing, such as income-share agreements tokenized as RWA. Potential Challenges: Regulatory Uncertainty: The legal and regulatory framework for RWA, especially financial instruments like loans, is still evolving globally. Credit Risk Management: Assessing and managing the credit risk of borrowers in a decentralized, often pseudonymous environment is complex. Enforceability: Enforcing loan agreements based on tokenized RWA can be challenging without clear legal frameworks connecting the digital asset to the real-world liability. User Adoption & Education: Students and lenders need to understand how these new systems work, which requires significant education and user-friendly interfaces. How Does Blockchain Education Play a Role? The success of initiatives like Pencil Finance is intrinsically linked to the broader adoption and understanding of Blockchain education . For students to feel comfortable using a DeFi protocol for something as critical as their education funding, they need to trust the underlying technology and understand the process. Open Campus, being a key investor and the force behind the EDU Chain, is well-positioned to integrate education about decentralized finance, RWA, and blockchain technology into its ecosystem. This symbiotic relationship means that as more students learn about and engage with blockchain through platforms like Open Campus, the potential user base for DeFi applications like Pencil Finance grows. Conversely, successful RWA projects like this demonstrate tangible, real-world benefits of blockchain, further driving interest in learning about it. Looking Ahead: The Future of Education Finance? The $10 million liquidity injection from Animoca Brands and Open Campus is more than just a funding round for Pencil Finance; it’s a significant validation of the potential for DeFi and RWA to disrupt traditional financial sectors, starting with education. While challenges remain, particularly in regulatory clarity and risk management, the commitment from established Web3 entities like Animoca Brands and Open Campus provides crucial momentum. This development could pave the way for more innovative funding solutions for students worldwide, making education more accessible and aligning financial incentives in novel ways through blockchain technology. It’s a compelling example of how Web3 is moving beyond speculative assets to build practical applications that address real-world needs.

He referred to SWIFT, the global international messaging network for financial transactions, and called it “an absolute disaster.” “And I’m telling you, if the banks don’t watch what’s coming, they’re going to be extinct in 10 years.” ~ Eric Trump, the Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization. The President’s son noted that the banks weaponized against the people “that don’t have zeros on their balance sheet.” He also said he was forced into the crypto world because banks weaponized against people “who wore that red hat that said Make America Great Again.” During an interview in Dubai, while discussing the United Arab Emirates’ development as a crypto hub, Donald Trump ’s second son said that the traditional banking system was “antiquated,” describing it as slow and inefficient. He has made frequent visits to the UAE in recent years as the country and wider Gulf region become a global hub for digital currencies. Eric Trump’s remarks come ahead of the President’s planned visit to the Gulf region from May 13 to 16, where he is expected to stop in the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar. Trump’s Organization and the White House administration have lauded their relationships with Arab Gulf leaders, praising what they see as key growth markets with pro-business policies. Trump’s family champions digital assets Eric Trump’s remarks come as the banking sector attempts to navigate the growing crypto ecosystem, which is decentralizing finance and eliminating the need for traditional financial intermediaries. DeFi platforms allow peer-to-peer transactions with competitive or zero transaction processing and account fees, which have been a source of revenue for traditional banks. Trump’s second son noted that anyone can open a cryptocurrency DeFi app and instantaneously send money, wallet to wallet, without the expense and variability of banks. Financial institutions like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs have established blockchain networks and digital asset trading desks in response to the growing popularity of crypto. In December, an American businessman predicted that Bitcoin would reach $1 million while attending the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in Abu Dhabi. The President’s tariffs on countries worldwide have also stoked the crypto markets and caused high volatility amid a sell-off of risk assets. BTC was exchanging hands at $95,357 late Tuesday. Donald Trump’s administration vowed to champion crypto , and the President signed an executive order on March 6 to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve and a U.S. digital asset stockpile . He also declared that if crypto was going to define the future, “I want it to be mined, minted, and made in the U.S.” The President and his wife, Melania, have also launched their own meme coins, TRUMP and MELANIA, which have fueled concerns from ethics experts about potential conflicts of interest. The Trump family also launched the crypto platform World Liberty Financial, which was co-founded with real estate billionaire and current White House Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. Eric Trump and his older brother, Donald Trump Jr., recently revealed plans to establish a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin through World Liberty Financial. In March, they also launched a new Bitcoin mining company called American Bitcoin, co-founded with Hut 8 CEO Asher Genoot. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Experts Predict Major Surge Ahead of Consensus 2025,https://coinpedia.org/news/pi-network-poised-for-breakout-experts-predict-major-surge-ahead-of-consensus-2025/,"The post Pi Network Poised for Breakout? Experts Predict Major Surge Ahead of Consensus 2025 appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Something big might be coming for Pi Network. After staying quiet for a while, the $PI coin is starting to move again, and people are getting excited. Some experts say it could even reach $5 very soon, just before the Consensus 2025 event, where Pi’s founder will speak. With new activity and bold predictions, many are wondering: Is this the breakout everyone’s been waiting for? Pi Network Saw Strong Bounce from Support After trading between $0.67 and $0.54 for about a month, the Pi Network coin had been relatively quiet. It has been struggling to break above the strong resistance at $0.64. However, things are starting to look interesting again, as $PI recently bounced sharply from the $0.50 support level. According to Pseudonym Pro Trader Edge , this move was backed by strong buying volume, which shows growing confidence among investors. But the real battle lies at $0.65, what he called the “Point of Control,” a key price where the most trading activity has happened since Pi’s launch. If PI breaks and holds above this level, experts believe it could trigger a stronger uptrend. Next Stops: $0.85, $1.23, and Beyond? If momentum builds above $0.65, technical targets suggest a climb toward $0.85, $1.23, and possibly even $1.55 in the short term. These targets are based on historical volume data and past market behavior. Timeline for $5 Pi Coin Surge In addition to the technical targets, some experts are predicting a much bigger target for PI. Crypto analyst Dr. Altcoin claims that PI could shoot up to $5, not by year-end, but as early as May, just ahead of the Consensus 2025 conference, where Pi’s founder is set to speak. Dr. Altcoin believes several catalysts are aligning, like rapid KYB approvals, the launch of Pi dApps, and rising investor interest. And one of the biggest points he made is that the Pi core team has reportedly bought 48 million PI coins. This shows they are confident in the project and are trying to keep the price stable Why is $5 Target Possible? Dr. Altcoin believes that a combination of low gas fees, strong security measures, regulatory compliance, and a growing ecosystem could create the perfect storm for a Pi price rally. As more investors and users join the network, and with the core team’s backing, the price of PI could experience a dramatic increase, possibly reaching the $5 mark by May 2025. As of now, Pi coin price is trading around the $0.57 reflecting a drop of 3.4% in the last 24 hours & a drop of 14% in the last 7 days.",News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-30 09:28:02

Historical data shows Bitcoin finishes May in the green 67% of the time with a 7.9% average return. Analysts warn the upcoming FOMC meeting and macro trends could add volatility to May’s BTC action. April 2025 has officially wrapped up, and it turned out to be another impressive month for Bitcoin. The world’s largest cryptocurrency posted a +14.53% gain for the month, marking its strongest April performance since 2021 and a solid 29.29% increase compared to last year. While strong, the rally still trails past April breakouts like those seen in 2013, 2017, and 2020. Many believe that recent news about Trump’s proposed tariffs played a role in fueling some of April’s surge. Now, as the market enters May, investors are asking the big question: Can Bitcoin keep this bullish run going? April 2025 just sealed its place as another stellar month for #Bitcoin , closing with a +14.53% return, the strongest April since 2021 and a solid 29.29% gain over last year.

This is part of a broader compliance sweep that already led to multiple enforcement actions and denied renewals. Meanwhile, the Bank of Italy flagged digital assets, particularly Bitcoin and dollar-pegged stablecoins, as potential risks to financial stability due to their growing integration with traditional finance and corporate balance sheets. In contrast to these more cautious stances, India is becoming a magnet for Web3 development. Crypto exchange Bitget and Avalanche announced a $10 million initiative to support blockchain innovation in India, where crypto adoption is booming among young investors. Overall, these latest developments shed some light on the very diverging global attitudes toward crypto, regulation, as well as innovation. AUSTRAC Targets Inactive Crypto Firms Australia’s financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, recently warned dormant cryptocurrency exchanges to either resume their operations or voluntarily deregister. This is part of the country’s crackdown that is aimed at curbing criminal misuse of inactive platforms. On April 29, AUSTRAC revealed that out of the 427 crypto exchanges currently registered, a big number are suspected to be inactive and at risk of being exploited by scammers. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas urged that firms must keep their registration details current and active, and warned that those failing to do so will be delisted under a “use it or lose it” directive. Announcement from AUSTRAC To offer crypto-related services like cash-to-crypto conversions or operate crypto ATMs in Australia, businesses must register with AUSTRAC, which oversees compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws. Since 2019, ten crypto businesses had their registration revoked for inactivity or non-compliance, including the local subsidiary of collapsed crypto firm FTX, which was deregistered in June of 2024. As part of its renewed efforts to boost transparency, AUSTRAC plans to publish a public list of registered exchanges to help Australians identify legitimate platforms and avoid scams. The agency’s broader compliance sweep already led to enforcement actions against 13 remittance and crypto service providers earlier this year, while over 50 others are still under investigation. Additionally, six providers were denied registration renewals because of serious criminal allegations against key personnel. Despite these enforcement actions, Australia is still in the process of formalizing comprehensive crypto regulation. The government began consultations in August of 2022 to develop a regulatory framework. In March 2025, ahead of the federal election, the government proposed regulating crypto exchanges under existing financial services laws. Bank of Italy Flags Crypto as Financial Risk Other countries are also tightening their leash on the crypto industry. The Bank of Italy identified Bitcoin and other digital assets as emerging risks to investors and financial stability in its latest Financial Stability Report that was published in April of 2025. The central bank pointed out the growing integration of cryptocurrencies with the broader financial system, noticed that the rapid rise in Bitcoin’s value and the volatility of digital assets could have spillover effects beyond the crypto sector. The report warned that increasing connections between the crypto ecosystem, traditional finance, and the real economy pose systemic threats. Part of the Bank of Italy’s Financial Stability Report A lot of attention was given to non-financial companies holding Bitcoin on their balance sheets, and the Bank of Italy is especially concerned over the exposure these firms face due to crypto’s inherent price swings. It explained that some companies may be motivated by the perception that Bitcoin can elevate their share prices. This is a strategy that was popularized by MicroStrategy in 2020 and was since been adopted by other companies like Metaplanet, Semler Scientific, and GameStop. The report also flagged risks associated with stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the US dollar. It warned that if these digital assets become deeply embedded in the financial system, reliance on US government bonds to maintain their pegs could introduce new vulnerabilities. A disruption in either the stablecoins or their underlying reserves could create ripple effects across global markets. A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that is designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to a reserve asset like the US dollar, euro, or gold. It combines the benefits of digital assets— fast, bolikerderless transactions—with the price stability of traditional currencies. The central bank’s concerns are very similar to recent comments by Italy’s economy and finance minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti. He warned people that the influence of dollar-based stablecoins may be more threatening to Europe’s economic sovereignty than the tariffs that were imposed by the United States. Giorgetti believes it is crucial to strengthen the euro’s global role and accelerate development of the Digital Euro as a means to counter foreign digital dominance. Avalanche and Bitget Partner to Back Web3 Growth in India While some countries are keeping a very watchful eye on the crypto industry, others are broadening their horizons to welcome new crypto partnerships. Crypto exchange Bitget recently partnered with Avalanche to launch a $10 million initiative that is aimed at supporting Web3 development in India, one of the world’s fastest-growing crypto and tech markets. The collaboration will fund mini-grants, scholarships, hackathons, and educational workshops, and will initially focus on Delhi and Bangalore. These two cities are at the forefront of India’s digital innovation. Delhi is the most populous city, and Bangalore, often dubbed India’s “Silicon Valley,” has seen large increases in crypto engagement. India’s appetite for digital assets surged over the past two years, with data from local exchange CoinSwitch showing that investment in cryptocurrencies accelerated a lot in 2024. Delhi led the country with 20.1% of activity, followed by Bengaluru at 9.6% and Mumbai at 6.5%. The majority of Indian crypto investors are between the ages of 18 and 35. While Bitcoin and Ethereum remain widely traded, Dogecoin (DOGE) was the most invested asset in 2024, with Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE) also gaining popularity. India’s top coins (Source: CoinSwitch ) The partnership is made at a time when global crypto exchanges are eyeing India for expansion. In early 2025, Bybit resumed operations after registering with local authorities, and Coinbase began negotiations with regulators to reenter the market. These moves all prove India’s rising importance as a hub for digital finance and innovation. India is also engaged in broader strategic negotiations with the United States, including a potential bilateral trade agreement aimed at avoiding new tariffs under President Donald Trump’s administration. As part of these talks, India is seeking access to key technologies and exports. According to Web3 venture capital firm Hashed Emergent , India already accounts for 12% of the global Web3 developer base and contributed 17% of all new crypto developers in 2024. All of this proves its role as a major force in the evolution of blockchain technology.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|SHIB,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-30 09:30:00

XRP’s ongoing legal victories and institutional adoption could drive it toward the $5 mark, while Sui continues to build momentum with its high-speed blockchain features. However, Mutuum Finance, currently priced at just $0.025, is the underdog with a 9,730% growth forecast that could far outshine the others. Mutuum Finance has raised more than $7.2 million in its ongoing presale. Over 9100 investors have already joined before the token’s next phase which is set to usher in a 20% price increase. Investors who buy in the current round can anticipate up to 140% ROI when the token’s projected launch price of $0.06 is hit. MUTM may be the best buy for investors looking for explosive gains in the coming months, with a unique DeFi model and whale accumulation fueling its rise, Mutuum Finance: A Rising Giant in the DeFi Ecosystem Mutuum Finance transforms decentralized lending by using its dual borrowing system for market combination purposes. Over 9100 participants have combined their financial support to fund the project development raising over $7.1 million so far. Phase 4 users joining Mutuum Finance today can maximize their token value because the price will move from 0.025 and rise to 0.03 during Phase 5. Mutuum Finance is set to launch at $0.06 and increase to $6 or above during the course of this year because it provides market-demanding DeFi elements in its advanced lending system. MUTM gains force from its value-driven innovative framework which establishes it as a strong yet underprovided token in the market. The project now displays in real-time which MUTM holders have reached the top 50 positions in their newly unveiled leaderboard. The platform will provide bonus tokens to users who stay in the top 50 ranking system. The investing interest in utility-based DeFi projects continues rising while older investors openly endorse MUTM’s trustworthy value proposition. Reinventing Lending with a Dual-Model Strategy Mutuum Finance combines Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) features to form its core lending innovation. Users at P2C can generate passive earnings by providing USDT to liquidity pools that use smart contracts for governance. Through its P2P system users can conduct direct asset transactions without middlemen and this allows them complete ownership control. A fully integrated P2P with P2C system generates flexible cost-effective financial opportunities for every user involved. Accelerating Growth Through Community Incentives The adoption of Mutuum Finance increases through various reward-based initiatives launched by the platform. The project will distribute $100,000 worth of prize funds which will amount to $10,000 for each of the ten contestants through MUTM token rewards. Mutuum Finance also implements a system that pays users who successfully obtain new platform users. Early adopters benefit from select advantages including early access to community announcements within the ecosystem. While XRP and Sui both show promise in their respective markets, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on track to outpace them in terms of growth potential this May. With over $7.2 million raised and more than 9,100 investors already on board, MUTM is set for a 140% ROI when the token reaches its projected $0.06 launch price. As the DeFi space continues to evolve, Mutuum Finance’s dual-lending system and community-driven incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway, make it a standout choice for those seeking explosive gains.

Active Address Trend May Suggest So,https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-demand-returning-active-address-trend/,"On-chain data shows the Bitcoin network is currently noting an uptick in Daily Active Addresses. Here’s what this could mean for BTC’s price. Bitcoin Active Addresses Just Crossed The 800,000 Mark In a new post on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock has discussed about the latest trend in the Daily Active Addresses of Bitcoin. The “Daily Active Addresses” here is an on-chain indicator that keeps track of the total number of BTC addresses that are becoming involved in some kind of transaction activity on the network every day. When the value of this metric rises, it means the number of users becoming active on the blockchain is going up. Such a trend can be a sign that the interest in the cryptocurrency is on the rise. Related Reading: Dogecoin Could Rally To $0.74 ATH If Price Closes Month Above This Level, Analyst Says On the other hand, the indicator going down implies investors may be shifting their attention elsewhere as not many of them are coming online to make moves on the network. Now, here is the chart shared by the analytics firm that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses over the past decade: As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Daily Active Addresses has witnessed a jump recently, suggesting user activity has grown on the network. This uplift in the indicator has come after the cryptocurrency has witnessed a price rally. Historically, the blockchain has tended to become active during volatile periods, as investors usually come online to reposition themselves in such phases. As such, the latest spike in the Daily Active Addresses may not be too surprising. Generally, rallies only end up being sustainable when they can attract user attention, as it’s the increased chain activity that can provide the fuel such a move needs to keep going. Price surges that are unable to induce an increase in the metric usually fizzle out before long. Given that the Daily Active Addresses has jumped recently, the current recovery rally may at least be in the clear in terms of this, if the activity spike indeed corresponds to demand from the investors. Related Reading: Why Has Bitcoin Rally Stalled? On-Chain Data Provides Hints That said, while there has indeed been renewed activity on the Bitcoin network recently, the indicator’s current value of about 800,000 is still not too high when compared to the past. Last year, the Daily Active Addresses managed to hit a high of 900,000. This value was still notably lower than the 1.2 million high that the blockchain saw during the past two bull markets.

43981016,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154010,1746005438,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin ETF Inflows Surge: US Spot Funds See Eighth Straight Day of Gains,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-etf-inflows-surge/,"The world of cryptocurrency investment is buzzing once again, and for good reason! US spot Bitcoin ETF products are continuing their impressive run, demonstrating sustained investor interest in gaining exposure to Bitcoin through traditional financial instruments. This consistent positive trend is a key indicator for many market watchers. Understanding the US Spot Bitcoin ETF Landscape For those new to the scene, a US spot Bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that directly holds Bitcoin as its underlying asset. This allows investors to buy shares in the fund, which track the price of Bitcoin, without having to deal with the complexities of buying, storing, and securing the actual cryptocurrency. Since their launch in January 2024, these funds have become a significant gateway for both retail and institutional capital into the Bitcoin market. Their performance and flow data are closely watched metrics, often seen as a barometer for mainstream adoption and sentiment towards Bitcoin. Positive inflows indicate that more money is entering these funds than leaving, signaling strong buying pressure from ETF investors. Decoding the Bitcoin ETF Inflows: Who’s Leading the Charge? The latest data paints a clear picture of continued momentum. On April 29th, US spot Bitcoin ETFs saw a combined net inflow of $173 million. What makes this particularly noteworthy is that it marks the eighth consecutive day of Bitcoin ETF inflows . This streak highlights persistent demand following periods of volatility. However, the story isn’t uniform across all funds. The vast majority of the day’s positive movement was driven by a single player: BlackRock IBIT . BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) alone attracted a substantial $216.95 million in inflows. This demonstrates the significant market share and investor confidence that BlackRock’s offering has quickly garnered since its inception. While IBIT soared, some other funds experienced minor outflows: Bitwise’s BITB saw withdrawals totaling $24.39 million. ARK Invest’s ARKB recorded a $13.32 million outflow. Fidelity’s FBTC also saw $6.24 million in outflows. Other funds in the US spot Bitcoin ETF category reported no change in their holdings for the day. This mixed bag, dominated by BlackRock’s strength, is typical in a competitive ETF market, but the overall net positive flow underscores the underlying bullish sentiment. What Do These Crypto ETFs Inflows Signify? The consistent inflow into these Crypto ETFs is more than just a number; it’s a signal. It suggests: Sustained Institutional and Retail Interest: Eight consecutive days of inflows indicate that despite price fluctuations, both larger institutions and individual investors continue to see Bitcoin as a valuable addition to their portfolios, utilizing the accessible ETF structure. BlackRock’s Dominance: IBIT’s leading position reinforces BlackRock’s significant influence in the financial world and its ability to attract massive capital flows into its products, including its Bitcoin offering. Potential for Price Support: Consistent buying pressure from ETFs can act as a floor for Bitcoin’s price, absorbing selling pressure and potentially contributing to upward price movements over time. Maturing Market Infrastructure: The smooth operation and increasing adoption of these funds highlight the maturing infrastructure around Bitcoin investment in traditional finance. While outflows from some funds are normal market dynamics (investors rebalancing or taking profits), the consistent net positive inflow across the category is the key takeaway. Making Sense of Bitcoin Investment Trends For anyone observing the cryptocurrency market, paying attention to Bitcoin investment vehicles like these spot ETFs is crucial. They provide valuable insights into how traditional finance is interacting with the digital asset space. The strong performance of IBIT, alongside the overall positive trend, suggests that the initial excitement around these products has not waned and that capital continues to flow into Bitcoin via these regulated pathways. This doesn’t mean the market is without risks or volatility, but the consistent inflows are a powerful indicator of growing confidence and adoption among a broader base of investors who prefer the ETF structure over direct crypto ownership. Conclusion: The Path Ahead The streak of positive inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs, particularly the robust performance of BlackRock’s IBIT, underscores a significant trend: traditional finance is increasingly embracing Bitcoin. The $173 million net inflow on April 29th, marking the eighth straight positive day, highlights sustained investor appetite. While individual fund flows vary, the overall picture is one of growing adoption and capital allocation towards Bitcoin through these regulated and accessible investment products. This ongoing trend remains a critical factor to watch for anyone interested in the future trajectory of Bitcoin and the broader crypto market.

The altcoins have also been quite sluggish lately, with minor losses dominating the chart on a daily scale. BTC Stalls at $95K The primary cryptocurrency managed to break through its previous consolidation phase at the beginning of last week, when it pumped above $86,000, which served as the upper boundary of that channel. In the following days, the asset flew past $90,000 for the first time in over six weeks and skyrocketed to just shy of $96,000 last Friday. This became its highest price tag in two months. Although it failed to breach that level and retraced slightly during the weekend, it remained high above the $90,000 support. The only brief slip came on Monday when BTC dropped to $93,000 but quickly recovered the losses. The bulls went on the offensive but were stopped on a couple of occasions ahead of $96,000 despite the substantial inflows into the BTC ETFs. As such, bitcoin continues to trade sideways at around $95,000, currently sitting just inches below it. Its market capitalization has stalled at $1.880 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is well above 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView Alts Slightly in the Red Most altcoins have lost some traction over the past 24 hours. LINK, AVAX, and XRP lead the adverse trend from the larger caps, with losses of up to 3.5% in the case of Chainlink. ETH, DOGE, ADA, SUI, SHIB, HBAR, and BCH are also in the red, albeit in a slightly less painful manner. The biggest losers from the top 100 alts include yesterday’s top performer, VIRTUAL , as well as TAO and TRUMP. The meme coin related to the US president has faced a lot of controversy as of late, including reports that the team behind it had started disposing of its holdings amid the price rally. The total crypto market cap has declined slightly by around $15 billion since yesterday to $3.065 trillion on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Among the names generating notable traction are Bitcoin Pepe (BPEP), Dogwifhat (WIF), and TRUMP—each riding a wave of speculative interest and community momentum. Bitcoin Pepe gains visibility as the first meme-centric Layer 2 on Bitcoin, it is drawing significant capital inflows through its ongoing presale, which continues to accelerate amid heightened market enthusiasm. Dogwifhat (WIF) Dogwifhat (WIF), a meme coin on the Solana blockchain, has rebounded sharply, surging over 100% from its April 7 low of $0.30 to trade at $0.61. This recovery positions the token above its 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $0.53, indicating a bullish structure amid improving sentiment across the broader crypto market. Traders are now watching for a break above the 100-day EMA at $0.78 to confirm continued upward momentum. A successful breach could open the path toward the $1.00 psychological barrier, with the 200-day EMA at $1.26 marking a longer-term resistance target. WIF also appears poised to post its first positive monthly return, reversing the negative trend seen in the first quarter. As per CryptoRank, April has delivered a 47% gain so far, compared to steep losses of -38.7%, -45%, and -33.1% in January, February, and March, respectively. A strong close this month could set the stage for a broader Q2 rebound. TRUMP The Official Trump meme coin has rallied 95% from its April 7 low of $7.14, reaching $13.00 after briefly touching $16.44 over the weekend. However, its inability to stay above the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of $15.10 signals weakening bullish momentum. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has pulled back to 64.77 from an overbought peak of 75, reinforcing signs of increasing bearish pressure. Despite this, TRUMP remains above the 50-day EMA of $11.73, which continues to trend upward, suggesting a potential for renewed upside. A consolidation around the $14.00 level could offer bulls a base to regroup and build toward another breakout. On-chain data from Santiment indicates a notable uptick in activity, driven in part by investor rotation into higher-risk meme assets. Fueling the surge is the announcement of an exclusive dinner event at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C., on May 22 for the token’s top 220 holders. The top 25 holders are also invited to a VIP reception and White House tour, with President Trump reportedly expected to attend, further stoking market interest. Bitcoin Pepe Bitcoin Pepe’s presale is seeing sustained momentum, with over $7.3 million raised so far as investors continue to pile into the offering. The 30-stage structure, featuring approximately 5% price increases per round, has created a clear incentive for early participation, driving demand and accelerating the pace at which each stage is closing. From an initial price of $0.021, the token has already reached $0.031 by stage 9, delivering over 40% gains to early backers. The upcoming stage will push the price to $0.0326. Speculation around a potential exchange listing in the second quarter of 2025 is also adding to bullish sentiment, with many viewing it as a possible trigger for further upside.

In an analysis published on Apr. 29 by CryptoQuant contributor Darkfost, the “supply in profit” metric, which tracks the percentage of Bitcoin ( BTC ) holders currently above their cost basis, has climbed back above 85%. This marks a strong recovery from a recent dip to 75%, a level often seen as a key support zone in past market cycles. “Having a large portion of supply in profit is not a bad thing,” Darkfost wrote. “It tends to support bullish trends — until it reaches euphoric levels.” According to past data, when this metric crosses the 90% mark, markets often enter a euphoric phase followed by short- to mid-term corrections.

Technical indicators provide mixed signals. At 66, the relative strength index is approaching overbought. Though indicators like the Stochastic RSI point to potential trend fatigue, momentum, and moving average convergence/divergence readings are still bullish. Bitcoin price analysis. Credit: crypto. news If buyers regain their strength, a breakout above $98,000 might lead to Bitcoin retesting the $100,000 level. On the downside, a decline toward the $85,000–$87,000 range could be triggered by a break below $89,000. Beyond the charts, institutional interest appears to be a major driver of the recent rally. According to data from SoSoValue, U.S. spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded $764 in net inflows over the past week. Corporate buyers are also stepping up. MicroStrategy recently purchased 15,355 BTC for $1.4 billion, increasing its total holdings to over 553,000 BTC. More institutional demand is expected in the near future. Cantor Fitzgerald, SoftBank, Bitfinex, and Tether have announced plans to launch 21 Capital, a $3.6 billion Bitcoin investment venture. Bitcoin’s next move may depend on whether this wave of institutional demand can carry it through resistance amid fears of profit taking among retail holders.

The latest news making waves comes from Japan, where a well-known Japanese fashion brand , ANAP, has significantly increased its exposure to the leading cryptocurrency. This move by ANAP to boost its ANAP Bitcoin holdings is more than just a financial transaction; it signals a growing trend we’re seeing globally. ANAP Bitcoin: A Significant Increase in Holdings According to an announcement shared by Bitcoin Magazine on X, ANAP Holdings, the parent company overseeing the popular Japanese fashion brand ANAP, has made a notable addition to its balance sheet. The company recently acquired 35 Bitcoin (BTC), a purchase valued at approximately $3.3 million at the time of the announcement. This isn’t ANAP’s first foray into the crypto space, but it certainly represents a substantial increase. With this latest acquisition, ANAP’s total ANAP holdings of Bitcoin have risen to approximately 51.6 BTC. While perhaps not on the scale of tech giants like MicroStrategy, this move by a fashion company highlights the diversifying profile of corporations looking to integrate digital assets into their financial strategies. Understanding Corporate Bitcoin Adoption Why are companies like ANAP, a Japanese fashion brand , venturing into the volatile world of cryptocurrencies? This phenomenon, often referred to as corporate Bitcoin adoption , is driven by several factors: Inflation Hedge: Many corporations view Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, preserving purchasing power over the long term. Store of Value: Bitcoin’s decentralized nature and finite supply (capped at 21 million coins) position it as a digital store of value, analogous to digital gold. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin to a corporate treasury can provide diversification away from traditional assets like cash and bonds. Innovation & Signaling: Holding crypto can signal a company’s forward-thinking approach and appeal to a younger, tech-savvy customer base interested in Web3 and digital assets. The trend of corporate Bitcoin adoption gained significant momentum in recent years, spurred by pioneering companies openly adding BTC to their balance sheets. ANAP’s decision reinforces that this isn’t a fleeting trend but a strategic consideration for a growing number of businesses across various sectors. Building a Bitcoin Corporate Treasury For companies considering holding Bitcoin, the process of establishing a Bitcoin corporate treasury involves several key steps and considerations: Strategy Definition: Clearly define the purpose of holding Bitcoin (e.g., long-term investment, hedge). Risk Assessment: Understand and mitigate risks associated with price volatility, regulatory changes, and security. Custody Solutions: Choose secure and reliable methods for storing the Bitcoin, such as cold storage or trusted institutional custodians. Accounting & Reporting: Navigate the accounting treatment for digital assets, which can vary by jurisdiction. Regulatory Compliance: Ensure compliance with relevant financial regulations in the company’s operating regions. ANAP’s move suggests they have navigated these considerations to build their Bitcoin corporate treasury . Their decision to increase their ANAP holdings indicates confidence in their strategy and the asset itself, despite market fluctuations. What Does This Mean for ANAP and the Market? For ANAP, increasing its ANAP Bitcoin holdings could potentially offer upside if Bitcoin’s value appreciates. It also positions the Japanese fashion brand as an innovative player in a competitive market, potentially resonating with customers who are also involved in the crypto space. For the broader market, this news serves as another data point illustrating the continued, albeit sometimes gradual, integration of Bitcoin into mainstream corporate finance. While 51.6 BTC might seem small compared to the treasuries of tech giants, every company, regardless of size or industry, that adds Bitcoin contributes to its legitimacy and adoption curve. Challenges remain, primarily the inherent volatility of Bitcoin. However, companies engaging in corporate Bitcoin adoption typically view it as a long-term strategic asset rather than a short-term trade. In Conclusion: ANAP’s Step Forward The decision by the Japanese fashion brand ANAP to significantly increase its ANAP Bitcoin holdings is a clear indicator of the broadening appeal of digital assets beyond the tech sector. By adding 35 BTC and bringing their total to over 51 BTC, ANAP is actively participating in the growing trend of companies building a Bitcoin corporate treasury . This strategic move highlights Bitcoin’s increasing role as a perceived store of value and a valid asset class for corporate balance sheets, reinforcing the narrative of increasing corporate Bitcoin adoption worldwide.

On April 29, tech analyst Jacob Canfield posted a warning on X , sharing a scam letter that had arrived at his home. Disguised as official correspondence from Ledger, the letter instructed him to perform a “critical security update” by scanning a QR code and entering his 24-word recovery phrase. Ledger Scam Letter Mimics Official Mail With Logo and Reference Number The professionally designed letter included Ledger’s logo, a return address, and a reference number to lend credibility. It warned that failure to complete the “validation” could result in restricted access to the user’s funds—an intimidation tactic meant to spur action. Ledger responded directly to Canfield’s post, confirming the letter was fraudulent and part of a phishing attempt. “Ledger will never ask for your 24-word recovery phrase,” the company reiterated, advising users not to trust unsolicited messages or individuals claiming to be Ledger representatives. Seed phrases, often 12 to 24 words long, are the most sensitive component of a crypto wallet. Anyone who gains access to them can take full control of a user’s assets. Some community members suspect the scam stems from Ledger’s infamous 2020 data breach, when the personal information of over 270,000 customers—including names, emails, and home addresses—was leaked online. You are correct, this is a scam. We appreciate your efforts to warn others. Please stay vigilant against phishing attempts. Scammers impersonating Ledger and Ledger representatives are unfortunately common. While we actively report and block scammers, we can't control what… — Ledger (@Ledger) April 29, 2025 That incident was followed by numerous phishing campaigns, including one in which tampered Ledger devices were mailed to victims to install malware. The recent mail scam appears to be another tactic targeting those affected by the breach, showing how long the consequences of data leaks can linger in the crypto world. Phishing Scam Targets Coinbase, Gemini Users In March, several crypto users flagged sophisticated phishing scam emails , which targeted Coinbase and Gemini users with legit-looking fraudulent emails. The mass email reportedly arrived in various user inboxes on Saturday. The scam mail pointed to a class action lawsuit against Coinbase for allegedly involving in unregistered securities, adding that the court has mandated users to convert their assets into self-custody wallets. Further, the mail also stressed that the deadline to transfer user assets to a self-custodial wallet is April 1st, 2025. As reported, in the first three months of 2025, the crypto ecosystem lost a whopping $1,635,933,800 across 39 incidents, according to the blockchain security platform Immunefi . The report claimed, “Q1 2025 marks the worst quarter for hacks in the history of the crypto ecosystem.” Most of that was the result of only two hacks of two centralized exchanges. Phemex suffered a $69.1 million loss in January, while Bybit lost $1.46 billion in February. Subsequently, the total number of losses in the first quarter marks a 4.7x increase compared to Q1 2024 . At that time, hackers and fraudsters stole $348,251,217. Notably, experts assume that the infamous North Korean Lazarus Group is behind the two largest attacks. They stole $1.52 billion, which is 94% of total losses.

Trump was asked directly if any referrals were sent from DOGE’s investigations, and he said, “Of course there have been.” He didn’t name anyone. No offices. No departments. Just said the referrals exist. And he didn’t say it once. He repeated it many times, sticking to the same words each time he was pushed — classic Trump. No more details. No breakdowns. But that confirmation puts DOGE deeper into the middle of this administration’s crackdown on bloated government systems. The Department of Government Efficiency has been wrecking through federal programs. Since January 20, over 200,000 federal workers have been fired. Whole agencies got torn down or stripped to skeletons. Legal fights broke out as soon as the firings began, with multiple challenges already in motion. DOGE cuts through agencies while Elon steps back Musk, whose title is “special government employee,” has been running DOGE from the inside. That role, however, ends in May—130 days after it started. Musk told reporters he won’t continue in the same role full-time, but he still plans to help Trump overhaul departments from the outside. The fact that Musk is stepping down makes the future of DOGE unclear. Without its loudest enforcer, no one knows who’s calling the shots. But people close to Trump say the cost-cutting won’t stop. The mission stays on track whether Musk stays or not. What happens to its leadership next is still undecided. The entire campaign has pissed off critics, who say the cuts are reckless and cruel. They argue DOGE has endangered key sectors like emergency services and foreign aid. But Trump and Musk say this is what it takes to wipe out corruption, overspending, and useless programs. DOGE, which has been updating its progress on its official website, claims it has saved $160 billion for U.S. taxpayers. That site, though, has been full of errors. Numbers posted keep getting edited, retracted, or corrected. The goal? Save $2 trillion. So far, they’re nowhere near that number. U.S. Treasury borrowing drops under DOGE’s knife A new report reposted Tuesday by DOGE’s X account (formerly Twitter) used data from the U.S. Treasury Department to show that the federal government’s borrowing needs had dropped. Specifically, for the second quarter of 2025, borrowing needs came in $53 billion below what was expected back in February. The change was directly linked to DOGE’s work cutting down operating costs across agencies. The Treasury, in its Q2 and Q3 calendar update, added a note confirming that “the current quarter borrowing estimate is $53 billion lower than announced in February.” That’s not a small drop. It’s connected to DOGE’s slashes in budget lines and personnel. And while it’s not solving everything, it’s clearly slowing down the rate of government borrowing—at least for now. The Treasury said tax receipts are “slightly above prior-year levels,” and spending is hanging near the bottom end of the historical range. The full statement added: “Fiscal flows year-to-date are coming in better than expected (thank you, DOGE). Gross receipts are tracking slightly above prior-year levels (adjusted for CBO forecasts for 2025), while outlays are closer to the bottom of the historical range, although sadly nowhere near enough to make a notable impression over the long term.” So DOGE is saving money, just not fast enough to fix everything.

The company stated that XRP broke the long-standing downtrend, broke through important resistance levels, and a positive atmosphere was formed in the market again. According to MakroVision’s analysis, XRP has broken out of its months-long red downtrend with a powerful force. The successful backtest following this breakout supports the stability of the structure. At the same time, the breakout of the last low high created earlier is considered the first serious bullish signal. The analysis emphasized that the $2.48 level is a critical resistance point for XRP. This level also coincides with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level and the next lower high. If this area is broken upwards, the $2.65 level and the “Golden Pocket” target determined by the general market structure may come to the fore.

It was stated that in a possible pullback, the $ 2.03 level should be protected, otherwise the technical structure may deteriorate. MakroVision analysts concluded their assessment as follows: “XRP is showing clear signs of a trend reversal. However, the $2.48 level must be breached for the upside to continue. This area is key for the market to regain strong upward momentum.” XRP technical outlook chart shared by MakroVision. *This is not investment advice.

For millions of adopters, Bitcoin ( BTC ) represents freedom from capital controls, centralized intermediaries, and central bank debasement. But for institutions, holding Bitcoin isn’t free. In fact, it comes with persistent, measurable costs that accumulate quietly and erode value over time. This is Bitcoin’s “silent tax”—the negative carry that stems from fees, insurance costs, accounting friction, and opportunity cost. You might also like: US Bitcoin reserves a win-win for inflation and solidifying Bitcoin’s value | Opinion For an individual investor with conviction and a long time horizon, this drag might be avoidable or tolerable. But for institutions managing large portfolios, reliant on secure third parties and bound by fiduciary mandates, the silent tax is becoming harder to ignore. Holding comes at a cost Unlike retail users, institutions often can’t self-custody Bitcoin on a hardware wallet. They rely on regulated custodians for compliance, auditability, and security. BitGo, Copper, Hex Trust, Coinbase Prime, and Fidelity Digital Assets are among the top players in this space—and they don’t offer their services for free. Custody fees generally range from 0.35% to 0.50% per year, charged on assets under custody. For large clients, this adds up quickly. A $100 million Bitcoin position costs between $350,000 and $500,000 annually—just to sit in cold storage. Some custodians also charge onboarding and transaction fees, pushing effective costs even higher. Insurance adds another layer. While major custodians offer policies, these limits are often well below what large institutions need. Some clients negotiate additional coverage or self-insure, either of which increases cost. And then there are audit expenses: public companies and funds must routinely verify their crypto holdings through specialized crypto audits. These aren’t cheap, often requiring six-figure engagements with Big Four firms. Taken together, these are the core components of Bitcoin’s negative carry for institutions: unavoidable holding costs with no offsetting income. Even in the absence of volatility or price movement, the position slowly bleeds—a structural headwind built into the act of holding. But beyond the explicit costs, there’s also a strategic constraint that further compounds the burden. The structural headwind of negative carry One of Bitcoin’s most important institutional use cases—beyond simply being held for long-term appreciation—is its role as collateral. Bitcoin can be posted to borrow dollars, stablecoins, or other crypto assets, enabling holders to unlock liquidity without selling their position. This function is especially valuable to capital-intensive businesses like miners or trading firms, and increasingly to treasury managers seeking more flexible balance sheet tools. But the effectiveness of Bitcoin as collateral depends on its stability and availability. If negative carry erodes the principal of Bitcoin, the amount of usable collateral shrinks. In that scenario, holders not only suffer paper losses but also see their borrowing power diminish in real terms. This challenge is amplified by the fact that the primary way to offset Bitcoin’s negative carry, through yield generation, often removes Bitcoin from being usable as collateral. If an institution lends out its Bitcoin to earn interest, those assets are typically locked up and no longer available to be posted against loans. In effect, there’s a trade-off: you can use your Bitcoin to generate income, or you can use it to unlock liquidity. This binary choice creates real friction for institutions trying to maximize capital efficiency. The Bitcoin that’s out earning yield via lending isn’t available for borrowing or operational flexibility. And the Bitcoin kept liquid for collateral sits idle, accumulating holding costs with no offsetting return. Why this matters now In the early 2020s, with rates near zero and inflation concerns mounting, Bitcoin’s narrative as an inflation hedge made the silent tax easy to overlook. But with a shift to higher interest rates, renewed competition from yield-bearing assets, and stricter regulatory scrutiny, institutions now face a harder calculus. Custody fees are no longer negligible. Inflation-adjusted opportunity cost is real. And internal stakeholders—from risk committees to CFOs—may soon start asking what Bitcoin is doing on the balance sheet beyond just sitting there. Breaking the trade-off The current trade-offs facing institutional Bitcoin holders are significant, but they may not be permanent. As infrastructure evolves, new approaches are beginning to offer a path forward—solutions that could reduce or even eliminate the need to choose between yield and utility. Across other blockchain ecosystems, native yield is often earned by helping to secure the network through staking. Bitcoin, by design, doesn’t offer that functionality to holders — its proof-of-work system rewards miners, not those holding BTC. But recent developments point to a new possibility: enabling Bitcoin to support external proof-of-stake chains, earning yield in the process. This model, often referred to as Bitcoin staking, allows BTC to be delegated to secure other networks—without giving up custody or taking on new trust assumptions. As these approaches continue to mature, the institutional viability of Bitcoin is sure to grow. For institutions that have long had to choose between capital efficiency and alignment with Bitcoin’s design, that shift could be significant—and long overdue.

Investors and enthusiasts are eagerly watching for regulatory clarity, particularly from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). What’s the Latest on Altcoin ETF Decisions? According to recent analysis, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is likely to issue rulings on the majority of pending Altcoin ETF applications around or shortly after October. This timeline comes from Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart , a respected voice in the financial markets and crypto space. Seyffart noted that delays in these applications were largely anticipated. He pointed out that the final regulatory deadlines for many of the applications currently under review fall specifically in or after October. While this provides a potential timeframe, he also cautioned that further extensions by the SEC remain a distinct possibility, a common practice in complex financial product reviews. This update follows the SEC’s decision on April 29th to delay decisions on several other crypto ETF applications, reinforcing the regulator’s cautious approach to the burgeoning digital asset market. Why Are Altcoin ETFs a Big Deal? The potential approval of an Altcoin ETF is seen by many as a critical step towards mainstream adoption and institutional investment in the broader cryptocurrency market. Just as the approval of Bitcoin ETFs earlier in the year opened doors for traditional investors, altcoin-specific ETFs could provide easier, regulated access to a wider range of digital assets without requiring direct ownership or management of private keys. Benefits could include: Increased Accessibility: Investors can gain exposure through traditional brokerage accounts. Enhanced Liquidity: ETFs can increase trading volume and potentially reduce volatility for the underlying assets. Regulatory Clarity: An approved ETF signifies a level of regulatory acceptance for the specific altcoin. Institutional Flow: Opens avenues for large financial institutions to invest more easily. Understanding SEC Crypto Regulation The landscape of SEC Crypto Regulation is complex and continuously developing. The SEC’s primary mandate is to protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. When it comes to cryptocurrencies, the SEC often grapples with determining whether a specific digital asset constitutes a ‘security’ under U.S. law. This determination is crucial, as securities are subject to stringent regulatory requirements. The SEC reviews ETF applications rigorously, considering factors such as: The maturity and regulation of the underlying market (e.g., the spot market for the altcoin). The potential for market manipulation. Custody arrangements for the underlying assets. Investor protection mechanisms. The caution shown by the SEC, including the recent delays and the anticipated timeline extending to October, underscores their thorough approach to ensuring these products meet regulatory standards. The Path to Crypto ETF Approval: Lessons Learned? The journey towards Crypto ETF Approval has been long, particularly for Bitcoin. After years of applications and rejections, spot Bitcoin ETFs were finally approved in January 2024. This landmark decision set a precedent and fueled optimism for other crypto assets, including Ethereum and various altcoins. While the Bitcoin ETF approval provides a potential roadmap, altcoins present unique challenges. Each altcoin has different characteristics, use cases, and underlying market structures. The SEC must evaluate each application based on its specific merits and the regulatory implications of the particular digital asset involved. Key factors influencing Crypto ETF Approval often include: Evidence of a regulated and surveilled market for the underlying asset. Sufficient market size and liquidity. Clear custody solutions that meet SEC standards. The ongoing delays suggest the SEC is taking its time to ensure these conditions are met for the diverse range of altcoins seeking ETF status. Who is James Seyffart and Why Listen to Him? James Seyffart is a prominent ETF research analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. He is widely followed for his insights into the ETF market, including the complex world of cryptocurrency-related funds. His analysis is based on tracking regulatory filings, market dynamics, and communication from regulators and issuers. Seyffart’s commentary on the expected October Deadline for most altcoin ETF decisions carries weight because he specializes in this specific area and has a track record of accurate analysis regarding ETF timelines and regulatory processes. Diving Deeper: The 72 Pending Applications The mention of 72 pending Altcoin ETF applications highlights the significant interest from financial firms in bringing these products to market. While the exact list of altcoins isn’t publicly detailed for all 72, they likely cover a wide spectrum, potentially including single-asset ETFs for larger altcoins (like Solana, Cardano, Ripple if its legal status is clarified, etc.) or even potential basket ETFs that track an index of multiple altcoins. The sheer volume of applications underscores the market’s anticipation and the potential scale of investment flow if even a fraction of these receive Crypto ETF Approval . However, it also presents a considerable workload for the SEC staff reviewing them. What Could Happen by the October Deadline? As the October Deadline approaches, several outcomes are possible for each of the pending applications: Approval: The SEC could approve one or more applications, deeming them ready for market. Disapproval: Applications could be rejected if they do not meet regulatory requirements. Further Delay: The SEC has the authority to extend the review period again, pushing the decision date further into the future. Given the complexity and the SEC’s historical approach, a mix of these outcomes is plausible. Approvals might come incrementally, starting with altcoins deemed less risky or having clearer regulatory standing. Actionable Insights for Investors With the potential for significant regulatory news around the October Deadline , what should investors consider? Stay Informed: Follow reliable news sources and analysts like James Seyffart for updates on the SEC’s actions. Research the Underlying Assets: Understand the technology, use case, and market dynamics of any altcoin potentially included in an ETF. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Cryptocurrency markets, including altcoins, are highly volatile. ETFs can mitigate some technical risks but not market price risk. Consider Diversification: Don’t place all your bets on a single altcoin or the expectation of an ETF approval. Understand the Product: If an Altcoin ETF is approved, read the prospectus carefully to understand its structure, fees, and holdings. The Road Ahead for Altcoin ETFs and SEC Crypto Regulation The coming months, particularly leading up to and through the October Deadline , will be pivotal for the future of Altcoin ETF products and the broader direction of SEC Crypto Regulation . The decisions made by the SEC will not only impact the specific altcoins involved but will also set precedents for how other digital assets are treated under U.S. securities law. While optimism exists following the Bitcoin ETF approvals, the regulatory path for altcoins is expected to be more nuanced due to the variety and complexity of these assets. The market will be closely watching whether the SEC opts for broad approvals, selective ones, or continues with a cautious, drawn-out process. Summary: October Marks a Crucial Juncture The analysis from Bloomberg’s James Seyffart provides a clear, albeit potentially flexible, timeline for significant regulatory action regarding Altcoin ETF applications. With a large number of filings pending, the period around the October Deadline is set to be a crucial juncture for the cryptocurrency market. Decisions from the SEC on these products will have far-reaching implications for institutional adoption, market structure, and the future trajectory of SEC Crypto Regulation , ultimately shaping how investors can access digital assets through traditional financial vehicles.

The data came from Eurostat on Wednesday, showing stronger-than-expected output even as the region deals with pressure from U.S. trade tariffs and sluggish consumer confidence. Most economists, polled by Reuters, had predicted just 0.2% growth for the quarter. That would’ve matched the revised figure from the final quarter of 2024. But instead, smaller countries in the bloc outpaced the usual powerhouses, dragging up the numbers while bigger economies like Germany and France barely moved. Southern economies do the heavy lifting Germany, which leads the Eurozone in size, posted a 0.2% bump in GDP for Q1. The number was released Wednesday by the German federal statistics office and was adjusted for price, season, and calendar differences. The office said the growth came from a rise in consumer spending and capital formation, meaning households bought more and businesses invested more than they did late last year. Source: Eurostat That growth followed a 0.2% drop in Q4 of 2024, meaning Germany managed to avoid a technical recession — defined by two straight quarters of economic decline. But it wasn’t much of a rebound. The country has been stuck in a stop-start loop for over a year. Every three months, it’s either crawling forward or sliding back. Other sectors in Germany are still struggling. Auto manufacturing is under pressure from competition with China. Housebuilding, infrastructure, and public investment remain weak due to high costs and bureaucratic delays. All this while the country’s most important trading partner, the United States, keeps slapping new tariffs on exports. As part of the European Union, Germany faces a 20% blanket tariff on goods headed to the U.S. The rate was temporarily lowered to 10% to allow time for negotiations, but that pause expires in July. The country is also hit by specific duties on steel, aluminum, and cars. And now that Donald Trump is back in the White House, there’s even more tension. Last week, Economy Minister Robert Habeck said Germany now expects no economic growth at all in 2025 and blamed Trump’s tariff policies for the downgrade. Outside of Germany, the Eurozone’s better numbers came from smaller countries. Spain and Lithuania each posted 0.6% growth. Italy moved up by 0.3%. But Ireland went full beast mode, jumping 3.2% in just three months. That kind of leap isn’t new for Ireland — its economy is stacked with big multinationals, which makes its numbers more volatile than most others in the bloc. France barely added anything, with 0.1% growth in Q1. It still counts as growth, but it’s clear that the southern and smaller countries carried the bloc this quarter. Tariffs hit sentiment as ECB tries to stay on course The European Central Bank has spent most of the past two years cutting rates to keep the Eurozone economy from stalling out completely. Earlier this month, the ECB cut its deposit facility rate — its key policy rate — to 2.25%, down from 4% in mid-2023. The move was meant to spark more borrowing and spending across the region. Back in March, the ECB said it expected Eurozone GDP to grow by 0.9% in 2025. That was a step down from its January forecast. New projections are coming in June, and the central bank has said these next numbers will be critical in deciding what to do with interest rates next. But rate cuts aren’t a silver bullet. Christine Lagarde, the ECB president, said the region’s disinflation process is “so much on track that we are nearing completion,” but warned that shocks like tariffs from the U.S. could “dampen” growth again. At the International Monetary Fund and World Bank Spring Meetings, officials from both the ECB and other global institutions said Trump’s trade policy is one of the biggest threats to growth in Europe. Right now, the European Union is waiting before launching any retaliatory tariffs of its own. The bloc is holding fire until talks with the U.S. either succeed or collapse in July.

Recently, Alpaca Finance’s ALPACA token stole the spotlight. In less than eight hours, its price skyrocketed by 422%, surprising many investors. This surge comes as the broader crypto market turns green and Bitcoin hovers around $95K. With Bitcoin performing strongly, short-term profit traders are now eyeing low-cap assets like ALPACA, which have become attractive opportunities for quick gains. $ALPACA : The only asset that sends you to therapy… then pays for it – $0.03 → $0.34 → $0.06 → $0.95 all in just 6 days. – Over $5B in trading volume on a token with just a $126M market cap.​ Binance will delist it on 2nd May. pic.twitter.com/6FFyrDkQIx — Kapoor Kshitiz (@kshitizkapoor_) April 30, 2025 A Sudden Drop and a Big Bounce It all started when Binance announced it would delist ALPACA along with three other tokens. Following the news, ALPACA crashed by over 90%, falling as low as $0.18. Traders panicked, thinking the project might be done for. However, the coin quickly bounced back dramatically, jumping to nearly $0.95, a 422% gain in less than a day. The Short Squeeze Effect One big reason for this crazy rally was a short squeeze. After the delisting news, many traders placed bets that the price would fall. But when it started rising instead, those traders had to buy back the token quickly to avoid losses. This pushed the price up even more. Delisting Triggers Frenzy While a delisting usually signals the end for many altcoins, in ALPACA’s case, it ignited a speculative frenzy. Traders rushed in, hoping to catch a quick rebound before Binance officially removes the token on May 2. The result was a tug-of-war between buyers and sellers that pushed prices to extreme levels. Timeline of Chaos After Binance’s initial delisting plans were announced on April 24, ALPACA’s price became extremely volatile. It first dropped 52%, then jumped 171% on the same day. The next few days saw similar moves, a 245% spike, followed by another surge that nearly doubled the price again. But from April 27 to 29, the token trended down until a surprise move from Binance adjusting its funding rate limit to ±4% set the stage for today’s explosive rally. Though the future of ALPACA is still unclear. While the token saw a sharp rise, it was largely driven by speculation and short-term trading activity. With Binance delisting the token on May 2, ALPACA holders now face an uncertain road ahead.",News|Altcoins|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-30 09:55:36

Both are climbing back to highs as the U.S. economy falters. Can this continue? U.S. stock market continues to rally It might be said that the S&P 500, the premier indicator of market sentiment in the United States, could just be towards the end of a relief rally that had to happen, given the huge fall that wiped off 1,300 points from the index from mid-February through to early April this year. Rate cuts, which could really help to stimulate the economy, still do not appear to be on the table, despite President Trump pressuring Fed Chairman Powell to start making them. The market is backing Powell’s obduracy over Trump’s powers of persuasion, as the CME Fedwatch Tool currently forecasts a 92.3% chance that rates will remain as they are. Forward-looking market could propel S&P 500 back to 6000 points Source: TradingView A W pattern in the S&P chart is still playing out. If it continues to do so, the measured move would put the index back above 6,000 points, and not that far from a potential reentry back into the ascending channel. Current news certainly does not forecast such an occurrence, but it must be remembered that markets are forward-looking, and that future interest rate cuts, and positive trade deals may start to happen over the coming weeks and months, and therefore the market is beginning to price this in. Bullish ascending triangle for $BTC in short-term time frame Source: TradingView Looking at $BTC in the short-term time frame it can be seen that the price action is forming an ascending triangle pattern. If this is indeed the case, this is very bullish. The majority of these patterns will end with the price forcing its way out of the triangle to the upside. The measured move for this triangle could take the price to $99,000. Wedge breakout to $99,000 Source: TradingView Moving out into the daily time frame it can be seen that the price action, since surging out of the previous bull flag, became a descending wedge. Like the bull flag, this is a continuation pattern. Therefore, the breakout to the upside was to be expected. It can be noted that the price action over the last few days has been to attempt to consolidate above the $94,300 resistance. If this can be achieved, the next big target is at $99,000. Current resistance has huge importance Source: TradingView Zooming right out into the weekly time frame one should note the huge importance of the current resistance level. If this can be surpassed, the price could begin to accelerate, although there is still a range of resistance to break through that stretches up to the $99,000 level. The previous huge surge that took the price out of the bull flag was unencumbered by any resistance, so perhaps the real acceleration this time may not take place until the price gets above the last main resistance level at $104,000. At the bottom of the chart, the RSI is showing that the indicator has crossed upwards. This also bodes well for upside price action.

Terminal 3, a promising Web3 startup based in Hong Kong, has just announced a significant milestone: securing $8 million in seed funding. This capital injection is set to fuel their ambitious plans in the crucial areas of data privacy and decentralized identity , particularly targeting the enterprise sector. Let’s dive into what this means for Terminal 3 and the broader Web3 landscape. Terminal 3 Funding: What Happened? According to a recent press release, the Terminal 3 funding round saw strong support from notable investors. The $8 million seed round was co-led by Illuminate Financial, a venture capital firm with a focus on fintech and enterprise software, and CMCC Titan Fund, known for its investments in blockchain and Web3 projects. This co-leadership signals confidence from both traditional finance/enterprise tech and native Web3 investment circles. Additional participation came from a diverse group of investors, including: Animoca Brands: A major player in blockchain gaming and the metaverse. Progression Fund IDG Blockchain Cherubic Ventures The participation of such varied investors highlights the potential seen in Terminal 3’s approach, bridging core Web3 technology with real-world enterprise needs. Powering the Future: Data Privacy and Decentralized Identity So, what exactly will Terminal 3 do with this $8 million? The company has outlined two primary areas for fund allocation: 1. Developing a Data Privacy and Security Protocol: In an era of increasing data breaches and growing concerns over personal information, building robust mechanisms for data privacy is paramount. Terminal 3 aims to create a protocol that likely leverages blockchain or distributed ledger technology to give users greater control over their data and ensure secure interactions. This focus on data privacy Web3 solutions is critical for fostering trust and enabling compliant applications. 2. Driving Adoption of Decentralized Identity and Credentials: This is a core focus. Terminal 3 has developed a platform centered around decentralized identity . Unlike traditional identity systems where a central authority (like a government or a company) controls your identity data, decentralized identity puts the user in control. They can store their credentials securely and selectively share only the necessary information when required, often verified cryptographically. Why Enterprise Web3 Solutions Need Decentralized Identity The push to drive adoption among enterprises is particularly noteworthy. While Web3 is often associated with cryptocurrency or NFTs, its underlying technology offers significant advantages for businesses. Enterprise Web3 solutions can provide enhanced security, transparency, and efficiency. However, integrating these solutions requires a reliable and privacy-preserving way to manage identities and verify credentials. Decentralized identity offers enterprises several compelling benefits: Enhanced Security: Reduces the risk of large-scale data breaches by not centralizing sensitive identity information. Improved Compliance: Helps meet stringent data protection regulations by giving users control and providing auditable trails. Streamlined Onboarding: Simplifies identity verification processes while maintaining privacy. Increased Trust: Builds stronger relationships with customers by empowering them with control over their data. Terminal 3’s platform aims to provide the tools and infrastructure necessary for businesses to leverage these benefits effectively. Navigating the Path Ahead While the funding is a major boost, the path to widespread enterprise adoption of Web3 technologies like decentralized identity isn’t without its challenges. Educating potential clients, ensuring interoperability with existing systems, and navigating evolving regulations will be key hurdles for Terminal 3. However, the significant seed funding provides the runway needed to tackle these challenges head-on and build out their technology and go-to-market strategies. The Future of Identity and Data in Web3 Terminal 3’s successful Web3 startup funding round underscores the growing recognition of decentralized identity and data privacy as foundational layers for the next phase of the internet. As more interactions move online and users demand greater control over their digital lives, solutions like those offered by Terminal 3 become increasingly vital. Their focus on the enterprise market positions them to potentially unlock significant real-world use cases for Web3 technology beyond speculative assets. The $8 million investment is more than just capital; it’s a vote of confidence from experienced investors in Terminal 3’s vision and their ability to execute on building the infrastructure for a more private and secure digital future powered by Web3.

Trump’s Dubai Project Merges Crypto And Real Estate The upcoming Trump Tower in Dubai will accept Bitcoin and other unspecified cryptoassets for real estate purchases. This $1 billion project is under development in collaboration with the London-listed Dar Global. It marks the Trump Organization’s latest venture into Dubai’s red-hot property market and institutional adoption of digital asset payments in high-end real estate. Speaking to The National in the UAE, Eric Trump, the U.S. president’s son, lauded Dubai as having become “a destination for the entire world.” “It’s become such a safe haven for so many people, so many countries, so many people want to put money here,” he raved. “So many people want to invest here, from all over the world, all over Europe, the Asian continent, all over Africa. Dubai has really become the epicentre.” The Trump International Hotel and Tower, announced earlier this year, will feature a branded hotel, deluxe residences, a private clubhouse, and the world’s highest pool. Notably, the project is expected to be completed in roughly five years. It will be located at the entrance of Downtown Dubai on Sheikh Zayed Road. Prices for apartments range from $1 million to $1.3 million for three- and four-bedroom units, and two ultra-luxury penthouses are anticipated to cost $20.4 million each. The Trump Family’s Ever-Increasing Involvement In Crypto The unveiling of new Trump family-related crypto endeavors shows no signs of slowing down. In recent months, the United States president, through companies he’s directly connected to, not only closed a deal with crypto exchange Crypto.com to introduce “Made in America” exchange-traded funds (ETFs), but also various members of his family are ambassadors and backers of the DeFi project World Liberty Financial. The billionaire president also launched his own Solana-based meme coin, TRUMP. The memecoin experienced a significant surge in price and volume recently after the team behind it announced that high-tier holders would have a chance to attend an exclusive dinner with President Trump. Despite the recent spike, the Trump token is still down over 80% from its all-time high above $73, which it saw shortly after launch.",Cryptocurrency|News|Donald Trump|dubai,EN,0,0,BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-30 10:03:35

On April 30 at Token2049 in Dubai, founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital, Dan Morehead explained how the global trade system is now being disrupted. He compared the macroeconomic phenomenon to the shaking of a snow globe, meaning that traditional investments like stocks and bonds are no longer holding up amidst the economic uncertainty. Though no direct quotes were permissible at the event, crypto.news attended and can confirm that participants discussed the role of crypto in navigating today’s increasingly complex macro environment. Moreover, as Morehead pointed out, the contradiction of having high bond yields at the same time as high stock prices, suggests uncertainty in the market. Currently, as of April 30, U.S. 10-year treasury notes have a bond yield of 4.18%, while U.S. 30-year treasury bond yields stand at 4.71%. Adding to that, Morehead said he views crypto as the safest bet amidst all the economic uncertainty happening in the world. This is mainly because crypto is largely disconnected from the traditional financial markets. He believes there is an emerging separation between crypto and the more traditional assets like stocks and real estate. Historically, when traditional assets plummet, investors would flock to safe haven assets such as gold or cryptocurrency. Over the weekend , crypto assets soared, breaking the $3 trillion threshold in market cap amidst rising U.S. bond yields and public debt servicing. You might also like: Brock Pierce and Charles Hoskinson talk where crypto is headed in the future after 2025 Founder and CEO of Ex Uno Plures , Zoltan Pozsar echoes Morehead’s sentiment. He stated that even with the Trump Administration’s emphasis on strengthening the dollar’s position as the world’s reserve currency, it is ultimately just the invoice used to purchase other assets. Even when traders purchase gold or cryptocurrency, the assets are mostly valued in dollars. Therefore, he argued the world is moving toward a more balanced and constrained framework. This framework might involve assets like gold, Bitcoin ( BTC ), and even changes in how the U.S. handles its fiscal policies Ultimately, the focus is shifting from how much surplus one earns to how that surplus is stored and used, with more alternative assets like crypto now being considered legitimate and even supported by governments. Co-Founder and CEO of Real Vision, Raoul Pal said the traditional financial system has always benefited the elite, because printed money became a scarce asset. What makes crypto a game-changer is how it essentially democratizes investments because of its fractional nature that enables everyone to get involved, even the unbanked population.

Cboe Global Markets, a major player in derivatives and securities exchanges, has officially launched cash-settled Cboe FTSE Bitcoin Index futures (XBTF) on its Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE). This move is a significant development for the burgeoning institutional crypto space, offering a new, regulated pathway for professional investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without the complexities of holding the underlying asset. What Are CBOE Bitcoin Futures (XBTF)? Let’s break down exactly what these new CBOE Bitcoin futures are all about. Announced via a press release on PR Newswire, these aren’t just any crypto futures. They are specifically designed to track the FTSE Bitcoin Reduced Value Index. Think of this index as a benchmark that reflects the price of Bitcoin, providing the basis for the futures contract’s value. Here are a few key points about XBTF: Based On: The FTSE Bitcoin Reduced Value Index. This index is designed to provide a reliable reference price for Bitcoin. Exchange: Traded on the Cboe Futures Exchange (CFE). This brings them into a regulated and familiar environment for traditional finance participants. Settlement: Crucially, these are cash-settled Bitcoin futures . This means that at expiration, no actual Bitcoin changes hands. Instead, the difference between the contract price and the index value at settlement is paid out in cash. Symbol: XBTF. Easy to identify on the CFE platform. This launch marks Cboe’s return to the Bitcoin futures market. They were one of the first major U.S. exchanges to offer Bitcoin futures back in late 2017, though they later discontinued the offering. Their return with a FTSE-based, cash-settled product signals a refined approach, potentially targeting specific institutional needs and regulatory considerations. Why Is Cash Settlement Important for Bitcoin Derivatives? The fact that these are cash-settled Bitcoin futures is a major selling point, particularly for large institutions. Unlike physically-settled futures, where you’d potentially receive or have to deliver actual Bitcoin, cash settlement simplifies the process significantly. Consider the challenges institutions face when dealing with physical Bitcoin: Custody: Securely storing Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure (cold storage, multi-sig wallets, etc.). This adds operational complexity and risk. Regulatory Hurdles: Handling the physical asset can sometimes introduce additional regulatory requirements or uncertainties depending on the jurisdiction and institution type. Operational Overhead: Managing wallets, transactions, and potential forks or airdrops adds administrative burden. With cash settlement, these issues are bypassed entirely. Institutions can trade the price movements of Bitcoin like any other financial derivative – think stock index futures or commodity futures – without ever touching the underlying cryptocurrency. This familiarity and reduced operational risk make cash-settled products often more appealing to traditional financial players looking to dip their toes into Bitcoin derivatives . How Does This Impact Institutional Crypto Adoption? The availability of regulated, cash-settled products like the XBTF futures on the CFE is a significant step forward for institutional crypto adoption. Why? Because it provides a bridge between the traditional financial world and the volatile, complex crypto market. Here’s how this contributes to broader institutional engagement: 1. Regulated Access: Trading on a well-established exchange like CFE provides a level of regulatory oversight and structure that many institutions require before participating in a market. 2. Familiar Structure: Futures contracts are a standard tool in the institutional finance playbook. Offering Bitcoin exposure via this familiar format lowers the barrier to entry compared to navigating spot crypto exchanges. 3. Hedging Opportunities: Institutions holding Bitcoin or involved in crypto-related businesses can use these futures to hedge their price risk, protecting themselves against adverse market movements. 4. Price Discovery: Regulated futures markets contribute to more robust and transparent price discovery for Bitcoin, potentially attracting more sophisticated trading strategies. While other platforms, like CME, also offer Bitcoin futures, Cboe’s return adds more liquidity and choice to the regulated U.S. market for Bitcoin derivatives . This increased competition and availability of diverse products are generally positive for market maturity and attracting more capital. Benefits and Challenges of Trading Cash-Settled Bitcoin Derivatives Let’s look at the pros and cons of trading cash-settled Bitcoin futures like those launched by Cboe on the CFE . Benefits: Simplicity: No need to manage Bitcoin wallets or custody. Accessibility: Traded on traditional, regulated exchanges familiar to institutions. Hedging: Effective tool for managing Bitcoin price risk. Leverage: Futures contracts typically allow for leveraged trading, amplifying potential gains (and losses). Shorting: Easily bet on a falling Bitcoin price. Challenges: No Direct Price Impact: Because no physical Bitcoin is traded, cash-settled futures don’t directly influence the supply/demand dynamics of the spot market in the same way physically-settled products might. Basis Risk: The futures price might not perfectly track the spot price due to various market factors (this difference is called the basis). Leverage Risk: While leverage can amplify gains, it also significantly increases the risk of substantial losses. Expiration: Contracts have expiration dates, requiring rolling positions or settling. Market Volatility: Bitcoin’s inherent volatility means futures trading carries significant risk. Despite the challenges, the benefits, particularly the regulatory clarity and operational simplicity of cash-settled Bitcoin futures , make them highly attractive for the continued growth of institutional crypto engagement. What’s Next for CBOE and Bitcoin Derivatives? Cboe’s re-entry into the Bitcoin derivatives market via the CFE with the XBTF futures is a strategic move. It positions them to capitalize on the growing institutional interest in crypto. This launch could pave the way for additional crypto-related products on Cboe’s platforms, potentially including options or futures based on other cryptocurrencies or crypto indices. The landscape for institutional crypto is constantly evolving. As more regulated products become available on established exchanges, we can expect to see increased participation from hedge funds, asset managers, and other large financial entities. This trend is crucial for the long-term maturity and stability of the cryptocurrency market.

However, not everyone is celebrating. Financial educator and Rich Dad Poor Dad author Robert Kiyosaki has sounded the alarm on a potential economic collapse that could even crash Bitcoin to as low as $300. FEAR of UNPLOYMENT spreads like a virus across the world. Obviously, this fear is not good for the global economy. As warned in an earlier book, Rich Dads Prophecy, the biggest market crash, a crash that is leading to the recession we are in…. and possible New Great… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) April 30, 2025 Why Kiyosaki Is Bearish ? In an x-post, Kiyosaki points to rising fears of global unemployment and economic instability, which he believes are symptoms of a much larger financial crisis. He refers back to his earlier book, Rich Dad’s Prophecy, in which he predicted a massive market crash leading to what he now calls a “New Great Depression.” While he hopes to be wrong, he warns that people should be ready for the worst. According to Kiyosaki, crashes are not just disasters — they can be golden opportunities. Drawing from his experience during the 2008 financial meltdown, he explains that real assets like Bitcoin and gold often become available at bargain prices during times of panic. If Bitcoin were to crash to $300, he says investors would face just two choices: “cry or celebrate.” Analyst Counter’s His Views One Crypto analyst, Tommy.T, responded to Kiyosaki’s crash warning by saying the panic is manufactured to fuel centralized control. He believes those who prepared with Bitcoin and real assets aren’t panicking—they’re building. Tommy sees this collapse as a hidden opportunity, calling it the greatest wealth transfer. While the world fears unemployment, he’s focused on creating unstoppable income streams, crediting Kiyosaki’s early warning as the spark. Prepare, Don’t Panic Rather than fear a potential crash, Kiyosaki encourages people to be prepared. He stresses that readiness is more important than reacting emotionally when markets tumble. Despite his warnings, Kiyosaki still believes in Bitcoin’s long-term potential. Earlier this month, he predicted that BTC could soar to $1 million by 2035, alongside huge gains in gold and silver. He even suggested that buying a fraction of Bitcoin today could be enough to build future wealth. So while Bitcoin may be booming now, Kiyosaki’s message is clear, stay alert and be ready for anything.",News|Bitcoin,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-30 10:12:06

Speaking at the ongoing Token2049 conference in Dubai, BitMEX co-founder Arthur Hayes doubled down on his audacious prediction that Bitcoin will hit $1 million by 2028. A Bold Prediction The Maelstrom CIO declared to a packed audience, “It’s time to go long everything,” urging them to pile into the flagship cryptocurrency as well as other stablecoins and traditional markets alike. For him, this isn’t just an investment thesis; it’s a macroeconomic inevitability. His optimism is based on a cocktail of monetary policy shifts and economic instability in the United States. The crypto investor sees a likely return to money printing by the Federal Reserve spurred by fiscal deficits, tariff-fueled turmoil, and deteriorating bond markets that could dramatically inflate BTC’s value. He compared current market conditions to the third quarter of 2022, a period that had been rife with fear. Back then, headlines were dominated by aggressive Fed rate hikes and cascading failures in the crypto sector, including the fall of FTX. However, the government’s stealthy injection of $2.5 trillion into the repo market helped keep risk assets, including crypto, alive. Hayes sees a familiar pattern unfolding now, especially with President Donald Trump’s recent push for sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. The move initially triggered economic shockwaves that sent markets into freefall before a three-month pause offered some relief. In the analyst’s view, Trump’s America First strategy will similarly unleash a liquidity storm. His sentiments are reinforced by concerns that the U.S. central bank, despite its hawkish stance, will be forced to support Treasury markets indirectly, by either halting quantitative tightening or reducing bank reserve requirements. “The Fed and banking system must step up to ensure a well-functioning Treasury market, which means Brrrr,” he quipped in a recent X post referencing the viral meme synonymous with rampant money printing. Should these forecasts materialize, Hayes expects Bitcoin to respond as it has before, with a parabolic rally . Bitcoin’s Steady Climb with Room to Run While the former BitMEX CEO’s vision is providing the narrative fuel, BTC’s recent price action has offered the kindling. At the time of writing, BTC was trading at $94,569, a slight 0.4% drop over the past 24 hours. Over the last seven days, the uptick has also been quite small at about 1%. However, the broader uptrend is more visible across longer time frames, with the cryptocurrency rising 13.0% in the past two weeks and 15.4% over the last month. On a year-to-year basis, Bitcoin has gained 49.2%, signaling long-term bullish momentum even against macro headwinds.

On April 30, founder and CEO of Ex Uno Plures, Zoltan Pozsar commented on the trade war between China and the U.S. as both countries levy tariffs against the other in an attempt to tip the global trade system in their favor. According to Pozsar in a closed door panel, China is currently in a precarious position; similar to that of the U.S. during the Great Depression. The economist explained how China’s economy is heavily dependent on revenue generated from exports in order to service its large debt which keeps piling up. Trump’s tariffs hit China where its most vulnerable as it restricts its exports. Pozsar believes the tariffs will hurt China more than Western consumers because when faced with rising prices, consumers will just end up buying fewer goods to save money. On the other hand, China’s options for dealing with this economic pressure, such as stimulating domestic consumption, clash with the Communist Party’s ideological framework, making the crisis difficult to manage. Nevertheless, Pozsar concluded that both countries have been switching strategies. On one hand, he observed that the U.S. has begun to act more like China in the way it has been shifting towards using stimulus to fund industrial projects, while China has been gradually shifting towards a more Western model of testing direct-to-consumer monetary easing. You might also like: U.S.-China escalation ‘worst case scenario’ for risk assets and crypto: Nansen Meanwhile, he stated Europe has been mismanaging its strategy by spending more funds on keeping the central banks running. Altogether, this realignment of global trade strategies makes the case for crypto all the more compelling, especially Bitcoin ( BTC ). The strategic Bitcoin gap With the U.S. already in possession of around 1% of the world’s Bitcoin supply, founder and managing partner at Pantera Capital, Dan Morehead, said the rational step would be for the U.S. to keep growing its Bitcoin reserves, much like how it has long held gold as a reserve asset. After the U.S. landmark move of establishing a national BTC reserve, Morehead predicts the emergence of a strategic Bitcoin gap, where other countries will compete to build their own national Bitcoin reserve. This, he believes, will be especially true for nations aligned with or threatened by the U.S.-led financial system. Even countries like China, that remain anti-crypto despite holding $18 trillion worth of seized BTC, could be swayed into adopting a Bitcoin reserve if it meant getting the upper hand over the U.S. Earlier this month, VanEck’s recent report revealed that China and Russia have been settling select energy transactions using Bitcoin in an effort to shift away from the U.S. dollar-dominated financial system.

States Two More Important Events,https://timestabloid.com/legal-expert-to-xrp-holders-what-is-the-hurry-states-two-more-important-events/,"While optimism continues to surge around XRP’s legal trajectory and market potential, prominent legal analyst Bill Morgan is urging the crypto community to exercise caution. In a recent post on X, Morgan questioned the rush toward celebration, highlighting two critical steps that still need to occur before Ripple’s legal saga with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can be truly over. What is the hurry? The SEC commissioners have not even voted yet to end the appeal against Ripple, nor have the parties applied to Judge Torres to change the final orders in accordance with the terms of settlement they have told the public has been reached. https://t.co/MhCjMjyFtl — bill morgan (@Belisarius2020) April 29, 2025 The Premature Victory Lap? Morgan’s comments come as sentiment grows that Ripple and the SEC have already settled . This narrative gained momentum following public statements from Ripple executives and media commentary suggesting a settlement has been reached. However, Morgan points out that two major legal actions are still pending, which are essential before the case can be fully concluded in the eyes of the law. Firstly, he emphasizes that the SEC commissioners have not formally voted to end the appeal process . Without this internal approval, the legal conflict technically remains active, regardless of what may be discussed behind closed doors. Secondly, Morgan notes that no formal application has been submitted to Judge Analisa Torres, the presiding judge in the case, to revise the final court orders in alignment with the alleged settlement terms. A Settlement Without Closure? The belief that a settlement has been reached has sparked speculation that Ripple will come out unaffected from its high-profile regulatory battle. However, legal experts like Morgan stress that settlements are not finalized until codified by the court. Judge Torres’ landmark 2023 ruling, which found that XRP is not a security when sold to retail investors, still stands as a defining precedent. However, any changes to her ruling require formal procedures to become legally binding. The current judgment stays in place until a formal filing is submitted, and claims of victory may prematurely influence individual and institutional investors. As a former litigator with extensive experience in financial and commercial law, Morgan’s insights are grounded in a deep understanding of the procedural nuances of federal litigation. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ripple’s Path Forward Still Hinges on Legal Finality Despite Ripple’s expanding global footprint and XRP’s integration into payment systems across the UK, Asia, and South America, the lack of regulatory finality in the U.S. continues to impact broader institutional adoption. Without the conclusion of the SEC appeal and an update to the final court order, Ripple remains entangled in legal ambiguity, especially in its home market. The stakes are high: the final disposition of this case could pave the way for the approval of XRP-based financial products, such as ETFs or payment hubs, which depend on unambiguous regulatory clarity. Stakeholders are awaiting official closure of the case, rather than just speculation about its resolution.. Bill Morgan’s call for restraint is a timely reminder that the legal system moves deliberately and by formal process, not by public sentiment or speculation. Until the SEC commissioners vote to withdraw their appeal and the court formally updates its final judgment, the XRP case remains open. As Morgan put it, “What is the hurry?” The future of XRP may be bright, but due process must run its course before the community can truly turn the page on this historic legal battle.

In Ethiopia, mining firm Phoenix Group has expanded its capacity to 132 megawatts powered by clean energy, marking a significant milestone for sustainable crypto operations in Africa. Meanwhile, Peter Chung of Presto has reiterated his prediction that Bitcoin could hit $210,000 by the end of 2025, pointing to institutional adoption and expanding liquidity as key drivers behind his outlook. Phoenix Group Expands Bitcoin Mining Capacity in Ethiopia to 132 MW, Strengthening Its Global Footprint Bitcoin mining firm Phoenix Group has announced a major capacity expansion in Ethiopia, adding 52 megawatts (MW) to its operations in the country. This development brings the company’s total mining capacity in Ethiopia to 132 MW, and pushes its global capacity beyond 500 MW. In a press release dated April 29, Phoenix Group's co-founder and CEO Munaf Ali emphasized the strategic importance of the expansion. “Initiatives like our latest expansion in Ethiopia are pivotal steps, not only creating significant value today but also solidifying our position,” he said. Ali also reiterated the firm’s strategy of targeting prime locations with abundant, low-cost energy, aligning with Phoenix’s broader vision of sustainable, high-efficiency mining operations. The latest expansion follows a power allocation agreement Phoenix secured in January 2025, giving the company rights to draw up to 80 MW of power in Ethiopia. At the time, the company noted that its new mining facility would go live in the second quarter of 2025 — a timeline the company is now well on track to meet. The new 52 MW site is being rolled out in two stages. The first phase, currently underway, utilizes 20 MW to power 5,300 air-cooled mining machines with an estimated hashrate of 1.2 exahashes per second (EH/s). The second phase, expected to be completed by the end of Q2 2025, will bring the site to full capacity using water-cooling technology, boosting its total hashrate to 2.4 EH/s. To put that in perspective, a single exahash represents one quintillion (10^18) hashes per second, a unit used to measure the computing power of a blockchain network — especially relevant to Bitcoin mining operations, where computational efficiency is key. Focus on Sustainability The expansion isn’t just about raw power; it’s also a statement on sustainability. Reza Nedjatian, CEO of Phoenix’s subsidiary focusing on mining, artificial intelligence, and data centers, stressed the use of hydropower to run their Ethiopian operations. “With 132 MW now running on clean hydropower, we’re proud to set a new benchmark for sustainable mining in Africa and deliver large-scale operations in energy-rich regions,” said Nedjatian. This positions Phoenix Group at the forefront of eco-conscious crypto mining, especially in a global context where regulatory scrutiny and environmental concerns are increasing. Phoenix Group has been expanding aggressively across both infrastructure and investment dimensions. After its high-profile IPO on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange in late 2023, which saw 33x oversubscription for its $371 million public offering, the company’s stock quickly gained traction — rising by 50% shortly after its debut. As of April 2025, the firm’s shares are trading around $7.94, a strong signal of investor confidence. In early 2024, Phoenix made headlines with a massive $187 million Bitcoin mining equipment acquisition, further consolidating its status as a heavyweight in the mining sector. But its ambitions go beyond just mining. In partnership with Tether, the world's largest stablecoin issuer, and Green Acorn Investments, Phoenix has also ventured into the stablecoin arena. The collaboration aims to launch a new stablecoin pegged to the United Arab Emirates dirham, reflecting Phoenix Group’s growing influence across the digital asset ecosystem. Ethiopia's Role in the Crypto Mining Map Ethiopia is emerging as a strategic hub for Bitcoin mining , thanks to its untapped hydropower resources and favorable geography. With Phoenix Group setting up large-scale facilities powered by clean energy, the country could attract more institutional mining operations, especially as global regulators and investors place increasing importance on sustainability and renewable energy sourcing. In contrast, crypto mining proposals have faced resistance in other regions. Just last week, a city in Arkansas, USA, rejected a crypto mining proposal after facing local community backlash over environmental and noise concerns. Peter Chung Reiterates $210K Bitcoin Target by End of 2025 Amid Growing Institutional Demand In related news, Bitcoin (BTC) could more than double from current levels to reach $210,000 by the end of 2025, according to Peter Chung, head of research at quantitative trading firm Presto. In an April 28 interview with CNBC , Chung reinforced his bullish forecast, citing rising institutional adoption and global liquidity expansion as the primary drivers. Despite a turbulent macroeconomic environment this year, Chung characterized Bitcoin’s recent pullback from its March highs as a “healthy correction”, rather than a bearish signal. “In hindsight, I think it was actually a healthy correction which has paved the way for the further re-rating of Bitcoin as a mainstream asset,” he explained. Bitcoin's Dual Identity: Risk Asset and Digital Gold Chung also highlighted Bitcoin’s evolving narrative as both a “risk-on” asset and “digital gold.” He noted that Bitcoin typically trades like a high-beta tech stock, reacting to investor risk appetite and user adoption trends. But during episodes of systemic instability—such as the 2022 Russia-Ukraine conflict or the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse—Bitcoin has behaved more like a safe-haven asset. “These moments are rare,” Chung said, “and only happened when the market has doubts about the stability of the US dollar-dominated financial system.” Although Bitcoin has underperformed gold during recent market stress, Chung believes it has room to “catch up” and may outperform traditional safe-haven assets by year-end. Chung’s renewed confidence aligns with broader market trends showing an increase in institutional Bitcoin interest. Bitwise CEO Hunter Horsley noted in a recent X post that Bitcoin’s recent surge to $94,000 occurred with minimal retail involvement, as Google search volume for “Bitcoin” remains low compared to previous bull markets. “The types of investors buying Bitcoin is expanding,” Horsley said, citing institutional allocators, financial advisers, corporations, and nation-states as key players driving the current rally. Data from BitcoinTreasuries.NET supports this shift, indicating that corporate Bitcoin treasuries now hold nearly $65 billion worth of BTC. Corporate BTC holdings (Source: BitcoinTreasuries ) Adding further weight to Chung’s outlook, analysts from Standard Chartered and Intellectia AI recently projected that ETF inflows and macro hedging strategies could push Bitcoin to double in price this year. In just the past week alone, Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs saw over $3.2 billion in inflows, according to Bloomberg. Ethereum Outlook Still Bullish Chung also maintained Presto’s positive stance on Ethereum (ETH), reaffirming their valuation model based on the ETH-to-BTC ratio. This comes amid ongoing Ethereum network upgrades and continued adoption of its Layer-2 scaling solutions. Peter Chung’s renewed $210K forecast reflects rising conviction among institutional players that Bitcoin is evolving beyond speculative territory and toward mainstream financial integration. While retail investors remain relatively sidelined, the influx of professional capital, combined with macroeconomic uncertainty, could be laying the groundwork for a new leg up in Bitcoin’s historic run. With more corporate treasuries, advisory firms, and sovereign entities entering the crypto arena, the coming months may offer a clearer view on whether Bitcoin can fulfill its dual promise as both a growth vehicle and a digital store of value.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|ETH|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-30 11:30:00

Recently, the crypto community’s attention was drawn to a significant movement involving one of the most prominent decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens: Uniswap’s native token, UNI. A large-scale transfer by an early UNI investor has sparked considerable discussion and speculation across social media and trading desks. This isn’t just any small transaction; we’re talking about a whopping $47 million worth of Uniswap UNI tokens making a significant journey. Let’s dive deep into the details of this intriguing event and explore what it could potentially signify for the market. The news broke courtesy of observant on-chain data analysts, who meticulously track movements on public blockchains. According to a report by prominent analyst @EmberCN on X (formerly Twitter), an address identified as belonging to an early participant in the Uniswap ecosystem made a massive transfer. This address was one of the recipients of the initial Uniswap UNI token distribution, receiving a substantial allocation back in September 2020. Fast forward to today, and this early recipient decided to move their entire holding. The transfer involved a staggering 9 million UNI tokens. At the time the transaction was executed, roughly an hour before the initial reports surfaced, the value of these tokens was estimated to be around $47.07 million. The destination of this colossal amount of UNI? Coinbase Prime . What Does This Early UNI Investor Move Signify? When a significant amount of cryptocurrency, particularly from an early holder, moves to a major exchange platform like Coinbase Prime , it often triggers speculation. For many in the market, such a move is interpreted as a precursor to potential selling pressure. Why else would someone move such a large holding to an institutional trading platform unless they intended to offload some or all of it? However, interpreting on-chain data is rarely black and white. While selling is a primary reason for moving assets to an exchange, especially for a large crypto whale , it’s not the only possibility. Let’s consider some potential scenarios: Preparation for Selling: This is the most common assumption. Moving funds to an exchange makes them readily available for trading. Given the size, this could be an over-the-counter (OTC) deal facilitated by Coinbase Prime, or it could be intended for sale on the open market. Custody: Coinbase Prime offers robust custody solutions for institutions and high-net-worth individuals. The investor might be seeking professional, secure storage for their significant asset. Staking or Lending Services: While less common directly on Prime compared to retail platforms, institutional services might include access to staking or lending protocols facilitated through the platform. Diversification or Rebalancing: The investor might be preparing to rebalance their portfolio, potentially selling UNI to acquire other assets, either crypto or traditional. Strategic Positioning: The investor might anticipate market volatility and want their funds on an accessible platform to react quickly. Without direct confirmation from the investor, we can only analyze the possibilities based on the action taken. The move to Coinbase Prime , an platform designed for institutional and high-volume traders, does lean towards a strategic financial decision, likely involving potential liquidity. Understanding the Source: Who Are These Early Uniswap UNI Investors? To fully appreciate the significance of this transfer, it helps to understand where this 9 million UNI came from. In September 2020, Uniswap conducted a massive airdrop of its governance token, UNI. This was a groundbreaking event in the DeFi space, distributing 15% of the total UNI supply (150 million tokens) to historical users of the protocol. Anyone who had used Uniswap prior to September 1, 2020, was eligible to claim 400 UNI per address. Additionally, liquidity providers (LPs) who had contributed to specific pools received larger allocations based on their contribution and duration. This particular investor, receiving 9 million UNI, was clearly not just a casual user but likely a very early and significant liquidity provider on the platform. Their early commitment to providing liquidity was rewarded handsomely, especially considering UNI’s price appreciation since the airdrop. These early recipients hold a significant portion of the circulating supply and their movements are closely watched by the market. They are, in essence, some of the original ‘whales’ of the Uniswap ecosystem. The Role of Coinbase Prime in This Transfer The choice of destination, Coinbase Prime , is also telling. This isn’t the standard Coinbase retail platform. Coinbase Prime is tailored for institutional investors, hedge funds, corporations, and high-net-worth individuals. It offers a suite of services including advanced trading tools, OTC desks, sophisticated custody solutions, and prime brokerage services. Moving $47 million in UNI to such a platform suggests the investor is operating at a level requiring institutional-grade infrastructure. It reinforces the idea that this is a calculated financial maneuver rather than a simple retail transaction. The platform’s features would facilitate large block trades that wouldn’t disrupt the public market as much as a large sell order on a retail exchange, or it could be for secure, long-term storage under professional management. Tracking the Giants: The Importance of On-Chain Data This event highlights the power and transparency offered by on-chain data analysis. Unlike traditional markets where large institutional moves are often opaque, blockchain technology allows anyone with the right tools and knowledge to track the flow of assets. Analysts like @EmberCN monitor wallets associated with exchanges, known whales, and early token distributions to gain insights into potential market movements. Tracking crypto whale movements provides valuable, albeit sometimes speculative, information. While correlation doesn’t always equal causation, observing where large amounts of tokens are moving can help market participants anticipate potential supply shifts and understand the sentiment of major holders. A large inflow to exchanges is often seen as bearish, while large outflows to cold storage or DeFi protocols might be interpreted as bullish or neutral. The Potential Market Impact of a Large Crypto Whale Move A transfer of 9 million UNI, valued at over $47 million, is significant enough to potentially impact the market, especially if the intention is to sell. While UNI is a large-cap token with considerable trading volume, absorbing a $47 million sell order requires substantial demand. If this investor decides to sell on the open market, even gradually, it could increase selling pressure and potentially lead to a price decrease for Uniswap UNI . However, if the tokens are moved for OTC execution, custody, or other reasons, the immediate impact on the public price might be minimal. The market reaction isn’t solely based on the actual selling but also on the news of the transfer itself. The mere fact that an early UNI investor has moved such a large sum to Coinbase Prime can create fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) among other holders, potentially leading to preemptive selling and increased volatility. It’s crucial for investors to understand that while on-chain data provides transparency, the motivations behind whale movements are not always clear. Panic selling based solely on a transfer could be detrimental if the tokens are not actually sold on the open market. What Can We Learn From This UNI Investor Action? This event serves as a valuable case study for anyone interested in the crypto market: Transparency is Key: On-chain data provides unparalleled transparency into market movements by major players. Whales Matter: The actions of large holders ( crypto whale s) can influence market sentiment and price action. Context is Crucial: A transfer to an exchange doesn’t automatically mean a sell-off. Consider the destination (like Coinbase Prime ) and other potential reasons. Stay Informed: Following reputable on-chain data analysts can provide early insights into significant movements. Don’t Panic: While monitoring whale activity is important, make investment decisions based on a broader analysis of the market and the project ( Uniswap UNI ) itself, not just a single transaction. The early UNI investor who received their tokens back in 2020 has held onto them through significant market cycles. Their decision to move them now, regardless of the reason, marks a notable event in the history of that particular allocation. It underscores the substantial wealth generated for early participants in successful DeFi protocols like Uniswap. As the market continues to mature, the tools and techniques for analyzing on-chain data will become increasingly sophisticated. Understanding how to interpret these movements, especially those by large holders of assets like Uniswap UNI , is becoming an essential skill for navigating the volatile world of cryptocurrency. Whether this $47 million move leads to significant selling pressure or is merely a strategic shift in custody or asset management remains to be seen. The market will be watching closely to see if these tokens start moving off Coinbase Prime or if large sell orders appear. For now, it serves as a stark reminder of the power of early adoption and the continued influence of large holders in the crypto ecosystem.

In a Telegram post dated April 30, the Broxus team said that TON Factory is designed to empower developers with modular components, integration tools, and dedicated support to build and scale their projects more efficiently. “For OGs already building on TON, TON Factory helps you scale further,” the announcement noted. The initiative is supported by a team of more than 150 engineers, all with experience delivering production-ready infrastructure within the TON ecosystem. A Broxus spokesperson said TON Factory is especially geared toward developers building layer-2 solutions and app chains using the TON Virtual Machine (TVM), ensuring seamless connectivity with the broader TON network. “Any TON DApp looking to enhance performance while staying closely integrated with the TON blockchain can benefit from this platform,” the representative said. Broxus powers TON Factory with its proprietary tech The underlying architecture uses Broxus’ Tycho protocol, which integrates the TVM with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) consensus mechanism. This hybrid design is intended to achieve near-instant finality and high throughput, reportedly handling up to 35,000 transactions per second (TPS), a benchmark that could position TON Factory as a serious competitor to other layer-1 and layer-2 scaling solutions. According to the firm, TON Factory also supports custom TVM chain deployments and offers tailored scaling solutions, helping ambitious teams drive the ecosystem forward. Broxus is a long-standing developer in the TON space, known for creating vital DeFi tools such as FlatQube (a decentralized exchange), Octus Bridge (a cross-chain bridge), and Ever Wallet. Venture giants pour $400M into TON as ecosystem matures beyond messaging Interest in the TON blockchain continues to grow. In March 2025, the TON Foundation announced over $400 million in venture capital investments into the ecosystem. Prominent investors included Sequoia Capital, Ribbit, Benchmark, Draper Associates, Kingsway, Vy Capital, Libertus Capital, CoinFund, SkyBridge, Hypersphere, and Karatage, all of whom purchased Toncoin as part of the investment round. At the time of writing, Toncoin (TON)—the native token of The Open Network—is trading at $3.22, down about 1% over the past 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. TON, originally developed by Telegram’s founders, now operates as an independent decentralized network. It supports the creation of mini apps and other blockchain-based services integrated within the Telegram ecosystem. TON blockchain serves as the sole blockchain infrastructure in Telegram’s ecosystem Before the launch of TON Factory, Telegram had made an announcement that as part of an exclusivity agreement, TON would serve as the messaging app’s ecosystem’s only blockchain infrastructure. Based on the statement, Telegram committed to making TON the only blockchain technology provider for Telegram. A separate statement on TON’s blog said that Telegram users would become the primary beneficiaries of that standardization, as it would provide them with a predictable, stable experience and strengthened protection against fraud. Additionally, the new agreement mandated that all games and Telegram mini apps that included cryptocurrency features migrate to the TON blockchain. “TON will now be the only blockchain infrastructure used by all Telegram mini-apps,” TON said on X. In addition, as they marked their beginning, it was recommended that all mini-apps that did not use TON migrate by February 21, 2025. Furthermore, TON Connect had become the sole wallet integration protocol for all Telegram mini apps, excluding bridging scenarios, according to TON Foundation president Manuel Stotz.

However, a chorus of voices from industry leaders is now sounding a critical alarm: the UK fintech and crypto industries face the genuine risk of falling behind international competitors. Is the nation losing its edge in the race for digital finance dominance? Why is UK Fintech and Crypto Innovation Under Threat? According to a recent report by CNBC, several prominent figures in the UK’s financial technology and cryptocurrency space are expressing significant concerns. The core issues seem to revolve around regulatory approaches and a perceived lack of urgency compared to other jurisdictions actively embracing digital assets. Jaidev Janardana, the CEO of digital bank Zopa, pointed to what he sees as an excessive focus on safety within the regulatory framework. While safety is undeniably crucial in finance, Janardana suggests that the current approach is stifling the very growth and innovation needed to keep the UK competitive. It’s a delicate balance, and getting it wrong can have significant consequences for the sector’s dynamism. This sentiment is echoed across the industry. The feeling is that while the UK grapples with defining its stance, other regions are moving forward, creating environments more conducive to rapid development and adoption of new technologies like cryptocurrencies. The Crypto Landscape: Navigating UK Regulation One of the most significant hurdles highlighted by industry leaders is the lack of clear and decisive UK regulation specifically for cryptocurrencies and related activities. This regulatory uncertainty creates a challenging environment for businesses looking to invest, build, and operate within the UK. Mark Fairless, CEO of payments infrastructure firm ClearBank, provided a concrete example of this impact. He stated that the unclear regulatory landscape has effectively stalled his company’s plans for stablecoins. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like fiat currencies, are seen by many as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the digital asset world. Delays in developing and launching such products due to regulatory ambiguity mean the UK could miss out on being a leader in this crucial area. The absence of a tailored, comprehensive framework for digital assets forces companies to operate in a grey area or delay projects altogether. This contrasts sharply with jurisdictions that are actively working on or have already implemented clearer rules, attracting businesses and talent. Missing Out: Opportunities in Crypto Innovation The global digital asset space is evolving at breakneck speed, presenting vast opportunities for crypto innovation . From decentralized finance (DeFi) and NFTs to tokenization of real-world assets and new payment systems, the potential for growth and economic contribution is immense. Cassie Craddock, Ripple’s Europe Managing Director, specifically noted that other regions are actively seizing these opportunities. This suggests a perception that jurisdictions in Europe, Asia, or even parts of the Americas are creating more favorable conditions for crypto businesses to thrive. What kind of opportunities are at stake? Consider: Job Creation: A thriving crypto sector requires developers, compliance officers, marketers, legal experts, and more. Investment: Companies looking to build in crypto bring capital investment and attract venture funding. Technological Advancement: Being at the forefront means contributing to and benefiting from cutting-edge distributed ledger technology. Financial Inclusion: Crypto can offer new ways for underserved populations to access financial services. Global Competitiveness: Maintaining a leading position in financial services requires embracing the future of finance. If the UK is perceived as hesitant or difficult to navigate from a regulatory standpoint, these opportunities, and the associated economic benefits, may flow elsewhere. What Are the Challenges Facing UK Crypto? Beyond the regulatory fog and perceived risk aversion, the fintech challenges facing the UK crypto sector are multi-faceted. They include: Regulatory Fragmentation: While some efforts are being made, a lack of a single, cohesive strategy for digital assets can confuse businesses. Skills Gap: As with many tech sectors, finding talent with specific blockchain and crypto expertise can be difficult. Banking Relationships: Crypto firms often struggle to access traditional banking services, hindering their operations. Public Perception: Negative headlines and scams can contribute to public and institutional skepticism, making adoption harder. International Competition: Other countries are actively vying to become crypto hubs, offering incentives and clearer rules. These challenges collectively create an environment where starting or scaling a crypto business in the UK can feel significantly more arduous than in competing nations. Charting a Course Forward: Actionable Insights for UK Fintech and Crypto Industry leaders aren’t just highlighting problems; they are implicitly, and often explicitly, calling for action. To avoid falling behind, the UK needs to: Develop Clear, Proportionate Regulation: Move beyond uncertainty to establish a tailored framework for crypto that balances innovation with necessary consumer protection and financial stability. This doesn’t mean a free-for-all, but rules that are fit for purpose for digital assets. Foster a Culture of Innovation: Encourage collaboration between regulators, government, and industry to understand new technologies and their potential. Provide Government Support: Consider initiatives like sandboxes, grants, or task forces specifically aimed at supporting the growth of the digital asset sector. Improve Dialogue: Enhance communication channels between regulators and the industry to ensure rules are practical and well-understood. Learn from Others: Study the approaches taken by jurisdictions that are successfully attracting crypto businesses and adapt best practices. Addressing these points is crucial for the UK to maintain its status as a leading financial centre in the digital age. The time for decisive action is now, before the gap between the UK and more agile nations becomes too wide to bridge. Summary: The warnings from UK fintech and crypto leaders are stark and clear: the nation’s position as a global financial leader is at risk. Concerns over stifling safety-focused regulation and persistent regulatory uncertainty for crypto are causing businesses to hesitate and look elsewhere. As other regions actively court crypto innovation , the UK faces the potential consequence of missing out on significant economic opportunities and falling behind in the global digital finance race. Addressing these fintech challenges through clearer UK regulation and a renewed focus on fostering innovation is essential to secure the future of UK fintech and crypto.

43984878,https://crypto.news/?p=14374591,1746013364,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/43984878.jpeg,"Interview with Aztec Labs CEO: ZKPs, privacy pools, and why Ethereum needs privacy to scale",https://crypto.news/interview-with-aztec-labs-ceo-zkps-privacy-pools-and-why-ethereum-needs-privacy-to-scale/,"Aztec Labs chief executive officer Zac Williamson explains why bringing privacy to Ethereum is more than a technical upgrade but a necessity. Zac Williamson is the co-founder and CEO of Aztec Labs, a layer-2 network focused on bringing privacy to Ethereum ( ETH ). Before crypto, he earned a PhD in particle physics from Oxford and worked at CERN. In the blockchain world, he’s best known as a co-inventor of PLONK, one of the most widely used zero-knowledge proof systems today. In a recent conversation with crypto.news, Zac explains why privacy isn’t just a nice-to-have but a core part of what Ethereum needs to grow. He talks about what legitimate privacy in blockchain really means, how privacy pools can offer both privacy and compliance, and why private layer-2s could make it easier to bring real-world assets on-chain. CN: How do you define privacy in a blockchain context? Is it about anonymity, selective disclosure, or something else entirely? When I talk about privacy in blockchain, I break it down into three core pillars. First, there’s user privacy, which means hiding the identities of both the sender and the receiver. Then you have data privacy, which is about keeping transaction amounts confidential. And finally, there’s code privacy, where even the logic being executed on-chain is hidden. To me, achieving all three is the holy grail of blockchain privacy. That’s the level we should be aiming for if we’re serious about building truly private systems. And I guess, more generally, privacy in a blockchain context is the ability to leverage information asymmetries on-chain. As in, I can perform a transaction where I know something you don’t know. And this is foundationally important for a lot of basic types of interactions in our daily lives. For example, when you vote in elections, that’s an information asymmetry. I know how I voted, you don’t know how I voted. CN: What are the biggest misconceptions about privacy in crypto that you wish the broader ecosystem understood better? ZW : The biggest misconceptions about privacy and crypto, I think, are that: a) It’s just about tokens and private token transfers, and; b) It’s currently viewed as this completely separate sphere from the rest of crypto, like you have DeFi, NFTs, and then privacy, etc. Well, both of these are wrong, and they’re a function of the technological immaturity of privacy solutions so far. Privacy is not a separate little sphere of crypto, and I think that in the future, all crypto will be private. If we want crypto to break out of its bubble and interact with the real world systems and more than just technological early adopters, or even compete on a level playing field with web2 and TradFi, we need to provide the same kind of privacy benefits that users normally expect. With the technology we’re trying to build at Aztec and others in the ecosystem, we have this concept of composable privacy, where just like in an Ethereum smart contract, you get to define the rules and the logic around how you like your transactions. You can code up your own digital assets, but unlike in transparent blockchains, you have private data as a first class primitive. You can hide who the message and recipients are. You can perform compliance checks on people that require knowledge of sensitive information and ensure that information stays encrypted and nobody sees it, things like that. CN: Do you think there’s a moral imperative for public blockchains to offer private options, especially in authoritarian contexts? If so, how should the Ethereum community define “legitimate privacy”? ZW: Well, the main thing about blockchains, one of its core values, is that they’re neutral and permissionless. Anybody can transact on a blockchain and code up their own digital assets. And so, I don’t think it’s really my place to determine what is and isn’t a moral imperative on a blockchain. There’s a space for both public and private blockchains. However, private blockchains are going to be more valuable and useful. But it’s important to define legitimate privacy, and I think it’s actually quite simple. As a user, I should have confidence that I’m not enabling bad actors, and because of my participation, I’m not making life easier for criminals and bad actors to use the network for nefarious acts. To give an example, when you use Tornado Cash, you’re helping bad actors, because you’re increasing the size of the anonymity set that the bad actors can hide in. If you’re using privacy pools, you’re not. CN: And how does censorship resistance fit into this context? ZW: The network itself should be censorship-resistant. No one should be able to censor transactions at the protocol level. However, if I’m programming a smart contract on that network, I should have the freedom to define what constitutes a legitimate transaction within that contract. Privacy is a fundamental human right, and I believe people should have the ability to present themselves privately on-chain. That said, I don’t believe users are entitled to interact with any application however they choose, especially if their actions go against the intentions of the developers or the rules coded into the smart contract. CN: What’s your take on the Privacy Pools model, which has enjoyed support from Vitalik Buterin, as a middle ground between full anonymity and full transparency? ZW: I think Privacy Pools is a good first step — one of many. When it was being developed, it had to work within really fierce technological constraints. The idea was, how do we create private transaction tech that can work on Ethereum today? And that means the ZK tech they’re using is relatively primitive, which limits what you can do with it. So yeah, I think it’s a good starting point, but definitely not the end goal. What we’re chasing at Aztec is full programmability. I’ll give an example of what I mean. There’s a company in our ecosystem called ZKPassport. Basically, modern phones have NFC scanners, and modern passports have NFC chips that can sign digital signatures. ZKPassport built an app where you can tap your passport to your phone and get a ZKP that shows you have a valid passport. You can choose what information you want to disclose — your nationality, your date of birth, your name, whatever you decide. You could use that tech for, say, a DeFi application that only citizens of a certain country can access. Instead of someone manually checking passports, the proof happens automatically with digital signatures and ZKPs. It’s permissionless, it’s privacy-preserving, and it ensures strong compliance. Honestly, that’s a lot more powerful in many ways than what Privacy Pools currently offer. And once you have full programmability in privacy networks, you can build an almost infinite variety of things on top of it. You might also like: Interview with Alchemy’s Will Hennessy: Pectra’s EIP-7702, why newbies should wait and what blockchain devs should do CN: Are there any design patterns or UX breakthroughs you think will be key to mainstreaming private transactions? ZW: Yeah, totally. PLONK is one of the enabling design patterns for UX breakthroughs, I guess. But there are a lot of breakthroughs needed to make private transactions mainstream. The complexity of a private transaction is way higher than a transparent one, because you can’t just broadcast sensitive information to the blockchain. You have to construct everything privately on the client side. And so the real question becomes: who pays for that complexity? Right now, in 2025, the answer is — the application developer pays, and the user pays. The app developer has a much harder time creating a usable application, and the user is going to have a harder time too. They’ll have to wait longer for proofs to be constructed, and the apps they use might struggle to integrate with the wider web3 ecosystem because they’re operating under different privacy standards. Within Aztec, my general operating principle has been: okay, complexity in private transactions is much higher — who pays? And my answer is: the cryptography researchers pay, by creating better ZK tech. That’s what we did back in 2019 when we created the first practical universal ZK-SNARK. Since then, it’s been iterated on a lot. The version of PLONK we’re using today is about 250 times faster than what we had in 2019. That allows much more performant applications. Then, you have language designers and tooling engineers. Their job is to create a programming language that can efficiently turn programs into zero-knowledge proofs — a language where writing private smart contracts is intuitive and simple. That’s what we’ve been doing with Noir, our programming language. It lets you build efficient private apps without needing to be a cryptographer. Finally, the protocol engineers and blockchain designers have to handle complexity by building chains that have private state semantics baked in from the start, meaning the blockchain understands what’s public, what’s private, that a transaction sender can be anonymous, and so on. That takes an enormous amount of work. And beyond all that, you need a massive amount of tooling so that developers can build compelling private applications without having to understand deep, sophisticated cryptography. We’re about to launch our testnets, and we’re very confident that the complexity of developing compelling private apps has dropped by orders of magnitude because of what we’ve built. CN: Do you believe Ethereum should be a fully private base layer eventually, or is privacy better served at the edges with apps or layer-2s like Aztec? ZW: Privacy comes with a lot more complexity, and I think it’s appropriate for that to be handled by L2s or specialized L1s. It comes with trade-offs. If Ethereum had been private by default, it probably wouldn’t have launched yet. It would be harder to develop, and there would be more security risks. I do think L1s are going to incorporate more and more privacy tech over time. Building composable privacy requires re-architecting the blockchain model from the ground up. For existing L1s, I think that’s too much of an ask, because it would inevitably break backwards compatibility with their current ecosystems. So yeah, for now at least, I think privacy should very much stay in the domain of L2s and the apps built on top. CN: Are ZKPs alone enough for privacy, or do we also need network-layer protections like mixnets or private mempools? ZW: Yeah, we need all of it. We need good infrastructure, we need private mempools. The whole point is to have an end-to-end encrypted blockchain. If I’m doing a very sensitive transaction, like something significant in the real world, nobody should be able to see what I’m doing, apart from whatever app I’m interacting with. The only entities that should know what I’m doing are the ones needed for the app to function. For example, if I’m paying my mortgage, there shouldn’t be anyone snooping on that. If I’m interacting with a DAO and I live in a country where that kind of work might be disapproved of, I should still be able to do that safely. I think privacy is a human right, and to really fulfill that, it’s not just blockchain-level privacy. We need full network-layer protections too. CN: Is the fragmentation of ZK tooling (PLONK, STARKs, SNARKs) a strength or a bottleneck for ecosystem maturity? Very much a strength. Right now, ZK tech is still in its relatively early stage. There’s a lot of diversity in technologies and proving systems because it’s not clear yet what’s going to be the best long-term solution. Research is evolving every six months in this space. Every technology solution comes with trade-offs. Some trade-offs will be appropriate for certain applications and not for others. What we need is experimentation. We need a diversity of ideas where multiple pathways are tried out, tested, and either succeed or are destroyed. I’ll give a minor example of how early standardization can kill a network: France’s Minitel. France basically had a version of the internet decades before anyone else, in the 1980s, because the French government built a proto-information network. People could access things like train tickets, university exam results — all kinds of services. But they chose terrible architecture. It was highly centralized. Unlike today’s internet, where anyone can build a website, with Minitel you had to petition the government to run an app. So they were ahead of the curve for a few years, but then they stagnated massively because they standardized on the wrong architecture. Right now, it’s way too early to standardize on anything in ZK. We need far more experimentation and research to figure out what’s really going to stand the test of time. CN: So, another emerging privacy technology is fully homomorphic encryption. Where are we currently with FHE? Do you see a possibility of having the first fully fledged FHE applications in the market soon? ZN : It’s extremely valuable, but it needs a few more years in the oven. I’d suggest you listen to people who are experts in FHE and don’t stand to benefit financially from the FHE hype to get a better understanding. It’s too early! The amount of computation overhead you need to do things in FHE is just so heavy. Which means that, yes, I think it will be good for production soon, but only for extremely limited use cases. I think the state of FHE today is very similar to the state of ZK in 2010.

Vanar Chain is launching Neutron, an AI-native blockchain layer with data compression ratios of up to 500:1, which can reduce a standard 25 megabyte file to just 50 kilobytes, transforming it into a “Neutron Seed” that can be stored on the blockchain ledger. The new blockchain compression layer aims to solve the industry’s data storage issue, with traditional blockchains lacking the capacity to store data, only to reference it. This design introduces potential single points of failure. Vanar's Neutron aims to solve this by enabling fully onchain, verifiable data storage. Neutron is a “world first” which “handles both physical file compression and semantic compression, meaning it compresses not just the file itself but the meaning inside it,” Jawad Ashraf, CEO of Vanar Chain, told Cointelegraph: “This unlocks entirely new possibilities: from simply storing a file fully on-chain without relying on third parties, to querying and verifying the actual information inside the file.” “It finally delivers on one of blockchain’s biggest promises: trustless, verifiable data, made truly accessible,” he added.

The Neutron launch follows several high-profile incidents highlighting risks in centralized infrastructure. On April 15, a major outage at Amazon Web Services (AWS ) disrupted operations at major centralized exchanges , including Binance, KuCoin and MEXC. Just days later, on April 24, over 20,000 CloneX NFTs created by RTFKT Studios temporarily disappeared due to what was believed to be a Cloudflare-related issue. Nike was hit by a class-action lawsuit of $5 million on April 25 after a group of RTFKT users led by Jagdeep Cheema claimed that they suffered “significant damages” as a result of Nike touting its sneaker-themed NFTs to gain investors before shuttering the platform. Related: Bitcoin treasury firms driving $200T hyperbitcoinization — Adam Back Onchain storage can address centralized vulnerabilities Vanar’s new blockchain storage solutions can address the centralization vulnerabilities of the industry, according to Vanar Chain’s CEO. “What happened with Nike’s NFTs and the AWS outage shows the risk: if the server fails, the asset effectively disappears,” Ashraf said, adding: “By embedding the data itself, or even the meaning of the data, into the blockchain, assets become truly trustless, permanent, and verifiable without depending on third parties. It’s a foundational shift from ‘hosted ownership’ to ‘real ownership.’” Neutron’s capabilities are designed to fortify numerous blockchain segments, including adding memory to AI agents, adding verifiable file attachments for decentralized finance applications, uploading original documents to tokenized real-world assets , or adding immutable governance records to decentralized autonomous organizations .

The United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has extended its timeline for ruling on Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot XRP exchange-traded fund ( ETF ). The new decision date has been set for June 17, 2025, for the application submitted by the Cboe BZX Exchange on March 13, 2025, as confirmed in a regulatory filing on April 29. According to the application, the Cboe BZX Exchange seeks to list and trade shares of the Franklin XRP Fund under the commodity-based trust shares category. The SEC’s delay was reportedly driven by the need for more time to review the proposed rule change, as permitted under Section 19(b)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The commission also emphasized the importance of considering public feedback and internal concerns before making a decision. SEC’s filing extending spot XRP ETF decision date. Source: SEC XRP spot ETF procedural delay With the more crypto -friendly SEC, it was widely anticipated that approving the XRP spot ETF would be straightforward, especially since the Ripple case is nearing a conclusion . However, Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg’s Chief ETF Analyst, noted that there is no need for alarm, as the delay is procedural. He pointed out that Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs experienced similar delays before approval. If the product is approved, the U.S. will become the second country to launch an XRP spot ETF, after Brazil. Notably, the Brazilian product, listed under the ticker XRPH11 on Brazil’s B3 stock exchange as the XRP HASH CI ETF, has so far had a strong start . Nevertheless, the product is yet to have a significant impact on XRP’s price due to the relatively small size of Brazil’s financial markets. Meanwhile, investors in the United States interested in gaining exposure to XRP have the option of a futures-based product , with the regulator approving the ProShares offering.

Have you been following the buzz around crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs)? If so, get ready for some potentially game-changing news. Recent insights from top Bloomberg analysts suggest that the likelihood of a Litecoin ETF and a Solana ETF receiving approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) this year is remarkably high – a staggering 90%! Why Are Bloomberg Analysts So Optimistic About a Crypto ETF? The cryptocurrency market is constantly evolving, and one of the most significant developments has been the push for regulatory approval of investment products like ETFs. These funds offer investors a more traditional, regulated way to gain exposure to digital assets without directly owning or managing them. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year marked a pivotal moment, opening the door for other cryptocurrencies. According to a recent post on X by Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas, citing estimates from fellow Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart, the outlook for various crypto-related ETFs is incredibly positive. Their analysis indicates a high probability of approval for several assets and categories within the next few months. Let’s break down the exciting predictions shared by these respected Bloomberg analysts: Crypto Baskets/Indexes: 90% approval odds this year. Litecoin (LTC): 90% approval odds this year. Solana (SOL): 90% approval odds this year. XRP (XRP): 85% approval odds this year. Dogecoin (DOGE): 80% approval odds this year. These figures represent a significant increase in confidence compared to previous estimates and signal a potential wave of new regulated crypto investment products hitting the market soon. What Makes a Litecoin ETF and Solana ETF So Likely? The high 90% approval odds assigned to both a Litecoin ETF and a Solana ETF are particularly noteworthy. While Bitcoin is the largest and most established cryptocurrency, Litecoin and Solana represent different facets of the crypto ecosystem. Litecoin (LTC): Often referred to as the ‘silver to Bitcoin’s gold,’ Litecoin is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies, created in 2011. It shares a similar underlying technology with Bitcoin but is designed for faster transaction confirmations and uses a different mining algorithm. Its long history, relative stability, and established market presence likely contribute to its high perceived approval odds. Regulators tend to be more comfortable with assets that have stood the test of time and have a clear, demonstrable use case (payments). Solana (SOL): In contrast, Solana is a much newer, high-performance blockchain known for its speed and scalability, designed to power decentralized applications (dApps) and handle a large volume of transactions. Its rapid growth, vibrant developer ecosystem, and increasing institutional interest make it a strong candidate. The success of its network and its position as a major player in areas like DeFi and NFTs likely bolster its case for an ETF. The fact that both a seasoned, established asset like LTC and a modern, high-throughput asset like SOL are given the same high odds suggests that the SEC might be considering a broader approach to approving ETFs for prominent cryptocurrencies beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum (which also has pending spot ETF applications). Are XRP and Dogecoin ETFs Far Behind? While the odds for XRP (85%) and Dogecoin (80%) are slightly lower than LTC and SOL, they are still remarkably high. This indicates that Bloomberg analysts see a strong possibility for ETFs tracking these assets as well. XRP (XRP): The regulatory status of XRP has been a major point of discussion due to legal challenges involving its issuer, Ripple Labs. However, recent court decisions have provided some clarity, particularly regarding programmatic sales on exchanges not being considered securities. This evolving legal landscape likely improves the chances for an XRP ETF, though the ongoing nature of the case might explain the slightly lower odds compared to LTC and SOL. Dogecoin (DOGE): Starting as a meme coin, Dogecoin has evolved into a major cryptocurrency with a large community and significant market capitalization. While its fundamentals differ significantly from assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, or Solana, its widespread recognition and adoption might be factors the SEC considers. The 80% odds suggest that even assets with unconventional origins could potentially see ETF approval if they meet certain market and regulatory criteria. What About Crypto Basket ETFs? The 90% approval odds for ETFs tied to crypto baskets or indexes are also highly significant. These ETFs would likely hold a diversified portfolio of various cryptocurrencies, offering investors exposure to the broader digital asset market rather than just a single asset. This approach could appeal to investors seeking diversification or those who are bullish on the overall crypto market but unsure which specific assets to pick. The high odds for basket ETFs might suggest that the SEC is comfortable with the idea of regulated products tracking multiple digital assets, provided the underlying index or basket is constructed in a way that meets regulatory standards for transparency and market integrity. Understanding the SEC Approval Process and Deadlines The path to getting a Crypto ETF approved by the SEC is rigorous. Issuers must file detailed applications outlining how the fund will operate, how the underlying assets will be valued and custodied, and how investor protection will be ensured. The SEC reviews these applications and can approve, deny, or delay them. Key deadlines play a crucial role in this process. According to the Bloomberg analysts’ chart: Crypto Basket/Index ETFs: Face a deadline in July. Litecoin (LTC), Solana (SOL), XRP (XRP), and Dogecoin (DOGE) ETFs: Face deadlines in October. These deadlines represent the final dates by which the SEC must make a decision on the current applications. While delays are always possible, the high approval odds assigned by Bloomberg analysts suggest they anticipate favorable decisions occurring by these dates. What Could High SEC Approval Odds Mean for Investors? The potential approval of a Litecoin ETF , a Solana ETF , and others could have several positive implications: Increased Accessibility: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making it easier for retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to these cryptocurrencies through familiar brokerage accounts. Greater Institutional Adoption: ETFs are a preferred investment vehicle for many large institutions, pension funds, and wealth managers. Approval could unlock significant institutional capital flows into LTC, SOL, XRP, and DOGE. Enhanced Legitimacy: SEC approval lends credibility to the underlying assets and the broader crypto market, potentially attracting more mainstream investors. Potential Price Impact: Increased demand from ETF inflows and broader market participation could have a positive impact on the prices of the underlying cryptocurrencies. Regulatory Clarity: The approval process itself, and the subsequent operation of regulated ETFs, can contribute to clearer regulatory guidelines for the crypto market. Are There Any Challenges or Risks? While the outlook is positive, it’s important to consider potential challenges: Regulatory Hurdles: Despite high odds, the SEC’s decision is not guaranteed. Unexpected regulatory concerns or delays could still occur. Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are inherently volatile. Even with ETF approval, the prices of LTC, SOL, XRP, and DOGE can experience significant swings. Competition: If multiple ETFs for the same asset are approved, there will be competition among issuers, which could impact fees and market dynamics. Market Reaction: While approval is generally seen as positive, the actual market reaction can sometimes be unpredictable, depending on how much the news is already priced in. What Should Investors Consider? For investors interested in the potential impact of these developments: Stay Informed: Keep track of SEC announcements and deadlines. Understand the Asset: Research Litecoin, Solana, XRP, and Dogecoin individually to understand their technology, use cases, and market dynamics beyond just the ETF potential. Assess Your Risk Tolerance: Even with regulated products, investing in cryptocurrencies carries risk. Ensure your investment strategy aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Consider Diversification: A crypto basket ETF, if approved, could offer a diversified approach compared to single-asset ETFs. Conclusion: A Bullish Signal for the Crypto Market? The high approval odds predicted by Bloomberg analysts for a Litecoin ETF , a Solana ETF , and others represent a strong bullish signal for the broader cryptocurrency market. Following the landmark Bitcoin ETF approvals, it appears the regulatory landscape in the U.S. is becoming increasingly favorable for bringing digital assets into traditional finance. While deadlines in July and October loom, the confidence expressed by experts like Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart suggests that 2024 could be the year we see a significant expansion in the range of regulated crypto investment products available to investors. This could unlock new capital, enhance market legitimacy, and further integrate cryptocurrencies into the global financial system.

Some entrepreneurs claim that due to the saturation of the UK market, strict regulatory policies, and the lack of funding, UK business owners take their businesses outside the country. Industry leaders argue that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has hindered the entry and growth of newcomers in the financial technology industry. In an interview with CNBC, some executives opined that the country’s fear of the unknown has become a hindrance to expansion. Zopa’s Chief Executive Jaidev Janardana said the UK was once the leading fintech market, but the pace has shifted. He said there are places like Singapore and Hong Kong that are more progressive. However, he cautioned that the UK cannot afford to lose focus as it is evident that on some fronts, it is ahead of the EU on issues to do with emissions. Unclear crypto regulations push firms to look elsewhere While the United Kingdom hosts some of the leading fintech companies globally, the state of crypto businesses indicates the uncertainty that hampers growth. Cassie Craddock, Ripple’s UK and European managing director, added that Britain fails to progress while global counterparts adopt friendly crypto policies. The U.S., under the presidency of Donald Trump, has reduced the actions taken to enforce trade policies. The EU’s Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation is already effective, and others, such as Singapore, UAE, and Hong Kong, remain active. Craddock pointed out that these are the factors generating the global momentum the UK has yet to gain. This intent to regulate stablecoins, staking, and crypto custody is clearly articulated by the UK Treasury in the draft legislation published on April 29, 2020. The proposal is part of the government’s “Plan for Change” and seeks to place digital asset companies under the FCA’s direct supervision. Keith Grose, the head of Coinbase UK, highlighted that one more emerging problem is that traditional banks are pulling out of the crypto industry. He said debanking has escalated to the point that organizations cannot even do basic transactions. He noted, “You can’t build the future of the financial system here if we don’t have that level playing field. I think the U.K. will get it right — but there is a risk if you get it wrong that you drive innovation to other markets,” An online survey of 83 firms in January of this year said half had been shut out or had accounts rejected by major banks. Grose stated that the UK needs to provide “intelligent” regulation to avoid detrimental effects. New regime expands FCA oversight and tightens compliance rules The draft Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Amendment) Order 2025 outlines new authorization requirements. All companies dealing with cryptoassets, providing custody services, issuing stablecoins, and staking services require a license. Notably, new terminology, “ qualifying cryptoassets,” has been created, and definitions of stablecoins differ from those of electronic money and tokenized deposits. The use of stablecoins for payments will not be regulated under the Payment Services Regulations in the UK. Still, the government suggests that new guidelines may be enacted as usage intensifies. Crypto ads will also be subjected to more scrutiny. The legislation also specifies that only firms that the FCA has authorized should be allowed to approve their financial promotions. It eliminates waivers that used to permit registered firms to market services that have not been fully authorized. However, such firms will be subject to the AML automatically, whereby they do not require registration but must adhere to the guidelines. The firms are required to notify the FCA when they begin or cease carrying out some or all of the activities within the new rules. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

It’s not just the size of the movement that’s causing ripples—it’s the timing, the mystery, and the increasing alignment of such activity with larger shifts in the global financial system. BREAKING Who is this mysterious whale? Just dropped 98.2 MILLION XRP in one go! Is this the beginning of something HUGE? Eyes on $XRP — something’s brewing……. pic.twitter.com/roii1vJJig — 𝕏aif | (@Xaif_Crypto) April 30, 2025 Whale Activity Raises Eyebrows—and Expectations Large-scale movements like this often precede key market developments. While whale transactions are not uncommon in the crypto space, a single deposit or transfer involving nearly 100 million XRP is significant. It implies either strategic positioning or a behind-the-scenes alignment that may be tied to broader market or regulatory events. Speculators are linking this to Ripple’s ongoing expansion, particularly in regions like Asia, South America, and the UK, where XRP adoption is accelerating through both central bank partnerships and retail integrations. Moreover, upcoming regulatory clarity in jurisdictions such as the U.S. and the U.K. could catalyze such movements as institutional actors position themselves ahead of compliance shifts. Is This a Prelude to Institutional Action? Some analysts are interpreting the transaction as a sign of accumulation or reallocation by institutional players, especially given the stealthy nature of the address and the absence of immediate exchange involvement. While it’s still unconfirmed whether this is linked to Ripple itself or a third-party investor, many believe it’s no coincidence that this happened as XRP narratives heat up again globally. The size and anonymity of the transfer have also led to comparisons with historical precedents, such as past movements by Ripple’s escrow system, ODL (On-Demand Liquidity) corridors, or strategic buys by large crypto-focused investment funds. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Setup: Volatility Meets Opportunity This comes at a time when XRP is showing increased technical momentum, with analysts such as EGRAG Crypto suggesting targets ranging from $17 to $55 in the long term. Meanwhile, Mastercard’s recent citation of Ripple as a central blockchain partner in South America and the continued rise of CBDC infrastructure powered by Ripple only add fuel to the speculation. With Chris Larsen scheduled to meet with new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins on May 2, regulatory resolution may be closer than ever. Such a shift could be the spark that ignites renewed institutional interest—possibly explaining why some whales are already taking positions. The Calm Before a Major XRP Storm? While the identity of the XRP whale remains undisclosed, the scale and context of the transaction point toward far more than routine trading. Whether it’s Ripple-related, an institutional vault shift, or a private buyer preparing for a surge, one thing is clear: this isn’t just noise—it’s a potential signal. Xaif’s timely alert to the community has not only triggered curiosity but also underscored the critical importance of on-chain vigilance in a fast-evolving market. As the macro landscape shifts, watching where the whales swim could provide valuable clues about the next phase of XRP’s journey. For XRP holders and crypto observers alike, this could very well be the beginning of something big. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/bitmex-founder-arthur-hayes-speaks-at-token2049-reiterates-2028-bitcoin-price-target-here-are-the-details/,"BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes reiterated his bold Bitcoin (BTC) price prediction of $1 million by 2028 during his keynote speech at Token2049 in Dubai, urging investors to “hold on long” amid growing global economic uncertainty. Arthur Hayes Reiterates $1 Million Bitcoin Prediction by 2028: “It’s Time to Stretch Everything Out” In a characteristically bullish speech, Hayes argued that both crypto and stocks are set to benefit from what he sees as inevitable quantitative easing in the US. Hayes, who argued that inflationary pressures and policy responses would increase asset prices, especially Bitcoin, said, “It’s time to hold everything long.” Hayes reiterated his long-standing thesis that the U.S. will have to adopt looser monetary policies, including a new round of quantitative easing or similar liquidity injections, to maintain economic stability. “This will push crypto prices higher,” he said, drawing parallels with late 2022, when concerns about rate hikes and a worsening macroeconomic outlook were ultimately met with a massive $2.5 trillion U.S. intervention via the repo market. He also highlighted how current market anxiety mirrors past cycles. In 2022, the crypto sector was still reeling from the collapse of firms like FTX, while broader markets were preparing for Fed tightening. Still, liquidity poured in. “History is a rhyme,” Hayes said. In the current cycle, Hayes pointed to President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff strategy as the latest destabilizing force. While markets initially reacted to higher tariffs on U.S. trading partners, a temporary 90-day pause provided some relief, Hayes believes the effects of the policy could pave the way for further liquidity injections. *This is not investment advice.

For the last five days, price action has stayed within a tight range, showing a slight bias toward mild declines. The market remains below its 200-day moving average, currently around $3.01 trillion. A clear global catalyst is likely needed for a breakout, which could open the path toward the $3.50 trillion level. Bitcoin is trading close to $94,500, keeping broader market participants focused on its next move. Extended consolidation periods often precede larger shifts, with the upcoming US labour market data on Friday expected to be the next key event. On the other hand, the early-stage project, CartelFi , continues to see strong demand. The project’s presale has already raised over $1.2 million. BTC eyes jump to $100K as ETF inflow remains strong Total net inflows across all US-listed Bitcoin ETFs topped $170 million on Tuesday, continuing the positive trend seen since last week. BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded the largest daily inflow among issuers, with $216.73 million added. This took the fund’s total historical net inflow to $42.39 billion. IBIT has remained the most active in recent sessions, underscoring BlackRock’s presence in the crypto ETF market and continued institutional interest. In contrast, Bitwise’s spot Bitcoin ETF (BITB) saw the highest net outflow for the day, with $24.39 million withdrawn. Despite this, BITB’s total historical net inflows stand at $2.05 billion. Currently, Bitcoin is trading around $95,000, rebounding from earlier 2025 market volatility that saw prices dip sharply before recovering in recent weeks. Analysts are eyeing the $100,000 mark as the next near-term milestone. CartelFi price to go up soon CartelFi’s presale is rapidly gaining momentum, having already raised over $1.2 million, with no signs of slowing down. The structured presale model, spread across 30 incremental stages with a 5% price hike at each phase, incentivizes early participation while creating sustained buying pressure. Currently priced at $0.0389, CartelFi’s token offers early investors immediate paper gains and the potential for much larger returns when it hits the public market. With another price increase set to occur within the next 20 hours, this presale is positioned to offer solid opportunities for those getting in early. The traction behind CartelFi is driven by its unique value proposition: transforming idle meme coin capital into productive, yield-generating assets. By seeking to unlock billions of dollars in dormant meme token value, CartelFi is aiming to reshape the narrative around meme coins. CartelFi’s “Yield Dorado” protocol comprises several integrated components aimed at maximizing yield generation while simultaneously applying deflationary pressure on the CARTFI token. With presale stages closing faster and capital inflows accelerating, CartelFi is quickly becoming one of the more notable early-stage offerings in a market that continues to look for ventures with strong potential.

The colossal blackout, which paralyzed most of the Iberian Peninsula this week, including Portugal, caused chaos and spurred demand for cash as paper money suddenly became the only means of payment that many businesses could accept. Spain restores banking and payment operations after blackout Electronic payments, including by bank cards at point-of-sale (POS) terminals, and automated teller machine (ATM) services are once again available to residents of Spain and Portugal, the two European countries hit by a massive power outage on Monday. Wholesale and retail payments are “functioning regularly,” the Bank of Spain announced on Tuesday. The brief update on the current state of the kingdom’s payment infrastructures and banking sector came after Spain restored power supply in full. The monetary authority highlighted the “full recovery in almost all major shopping centres” many of which lost access to electronic means of payment during the blackout, alongside other retailers and service providers in the region. Operations at credit institutions are “running normally,” the regulator added while admitting that glitches were still being reported at some bank branches and ATM locations. Banco de España also said it has normalized cash distribution from its branch offices. Iberpay, the private operator of Spain’s National Electronic Clearing System (SNCE), posted on its website that “the Spanish retail payment system, the Spanish cash distribution system, and the sectoral information services are all operating normally.” Spain’s power grid operator, Red Eléctrica, took to X earlier to inform consumers it has restored nearly 100% of electricity supply on the peninsula. All transmission substations are back in operation, the company said in another post. Actualizamos información⬇️11:15h. ✅Normalizado el funcionamiento del sistema eléctrico peninsular. ✅Tras superar la punta de demanda de la mañana a las 8.35 con 28.677MW, el pico nocturno se espera a las 21:10h con 31.200 MW. — Red Eléctrica (@RedElectricaREE) April 29, 2025 Nevertheless, the declared state of emergency remained in place in affected areas in both Spain and Portugal on Tuesday. “This has never happened before,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez stated in an address to the nation the previous evening. Sánchez indicated Madrid had no conclusive information on the causes of the blackout, but Red Eléctrica ruled out a cyberattack. According to its director, Eduardo Prieto, the crisis may have been triggered by “strong oscillation in the electrical network” throwing the system out of balance. Blackout highlights importance of cash after withdrawals and card payments went offline The power outage, the largest in the region’s history, left millions of people in Spain , Portugal and parts of Southern France with disrupted access to basic services. The sudden interruption in electric supply hit important infrastructure, including public transport systems and healthcare institutions. Spain’s economic losses are expected to reach 0.1% of GDP, or €1.6 billion euros ($1.82 billion), according to a Reuters report quoting Confederación Española de Organizaciones Empresariales (CEOE), the country’s main business lobby organization. Digital payment systems were particularly affected, leading to significantly limited options to pay with bank cards or through mobile apps. Bank branches were closed down and ATMs shut down, making withdrawals impossible in many cases. “Nunca llevo efectivo, pero después de lo que pasó, he venido a sacar cien euros para tenerlos en casa por si las moscas”.

Not all who wanted to buy water, food or batteries had the cash. In recent years, the government in Madrid has been trying to reduce cash usage as part of efforts to curb tax evasion. Since 2021, Spanish businesses are allowed to receive only up to €1,000 in cash per transaction. The threshold previously stood at €2,500, Politico noted in an article. According to the European Central Bank, cash is still quite popular in Spain, accounting for 57% of retail transactions while at the same time offline payments through bank cards and mobile applications are yet to reach 40%.

The price has since dropped to $0.6945 , reflecting a 2.50% decline within the day and positioning ADA for a volatile start to May. Despite some early upward movement, the overall session was dominated by selling pressure. This reflects uncertainty among traders and hesitation to push the price higher without stronger market support.

Trading volume has dropped 5% to $785.52 million, indicating that buyer enthusiasm is fading.

Libre, a platform focused on tokenization and backed by some heavy hitters in the financial industry, is making waves with its ambitious plan. They are preparing to tokenize a substantial $500 million worth of Telegram bonds, transforming them into digital assets on the TON blockchain. This move, reported by CoinDesk, signals growing institutional confidence in the power of blockchain technology for traditional assets. What is Libre Tokenization and Who’s Behind It? Libre isn’t just another crypto startup; it’s a tokenization platform built with institutional players in mind. Its credibility is significantly bolstered by the backing it receives from prominent financial firms. Names like Brevan Howard, a major hedge fund manager, Hamilton Lane, a global private markets investment firm, and Nomura’s Laser Digital, the digital asset arm of the Japanese financial giant, are all supporting Libre. This level of institutional endorsement is crucial, as it suggests that the platform is designed to meet the rigorous standards and compliance requirements expected by large financial entities. The core idea behind Libre Tokenization is to bring illiquid or complex traditional assets onto the blockchain. By representing assets as digital tokens, Libre aims to unlock new levels of efficiency, accessibility, and liquidity for investors. This isn’t just about putting assets on a ledger; it’s about creating a framework where these tokenized assets can be managed, traded, and settled more effectively than in traditional systems. Why Telegram Bonds and What is the Telegram Bonds Tokenization? The specific asset chosen for this large-scale tokenization initiative is $500 million worth of Telegram bonds. These are debt instruments issued by Telegram, the popular messaging app company, to raise capital. Bonds, in general, represent a loan made by an investor to a borrower (like a company or government). They are a fundamental part of traditional finance, often traded over-the-counter or on specific bond markets. The decision for Telegram Bonds Tokenization on the blockchain offers several potential advantages. Firstly, it can make these bonds more accessible to a wider range of investors, potentially including those who might have faced high barriers to entry in traditional bond markets. Secondly, tokenization can improve the liquidity of these assets. Traditional bonds can sometimes be difficult to trade quickly or in small denominations. Tokenization allows for fractional ownership and potentially easier peer-to-peer or exchange-based trading. Libre is creating a specific fund vehicle for this purpose, known as the Telegram Bond Fund (TBF). This structure likely simplifies the process for investors and provides a regulated wrapper around the underlying tokenized assets. Why the TON Blockchain for This Massive Move? Libre’s choice of the TON Blockchain (The Open Network) is particularly noteworthy. TON was originally developed by Telegram itself, although it is now maintained by the community. This inherent connection might play a role, but TON also possesses technical characteristics that make it suitable for large-scale applications and potentially institutional use cases. Key features of TON that could be attractive for tokenization include: Scalability: TON is designed to handle a large volume of transactions quickly and efficiently, which is essential for a platform dealing with significant asset values and potential trading activity. Speed and Low Costs: Faster transaction speeds and lower fees compared to some other blockchains can make the management and transfer of tokenized assets more economical. Robust Infrastructure: A mature and reliable blockchain network is critical for institutional participants who require high uptime and security. Ecosystem Potential: The growing TON ecosystem could potentially offer future synergies or applications for the tokenized bonds. Utilizing TON means that the digital representation of these $500 million in bonds will live on this specific distributed ledger, leveraging its features for transparency, immutability, and efficient transfer of ownership. The Growing Trend of Institutional Digital Assets This move by Libre to tokenize a significant value of Telegram bonds is a clear indicator of a broader trend: the increasing interest and adoption of Institutional Digital Assets . Major financial institutions are no longer just observing the crypto space; they are actively exploring and implementing ways to use blockchain technology for traditional asset classes like bonds, real estate, private equity, and more. Why the shift? Institutions are recognizing the potential benefits: Increased Efficiency: Streamlining processes like issuance, settlement, and custody. Reduced Costs: Cutting out intermediaries and automating processes. Improved Liquidity: Making previously illiquid assets tradable on digital markets. Enhanced Transparency: Providing a clear, auditable record of ownership and transactions. Wider Access: Potentially opening up investment opportunities to a broader investor base. The backing of Libre by firms like Brevan Howard and Hamilton Lane underscores that these are not fringe experiments but serious explorations into the future infrastructure of finance by established players. Understanding Asset Tokenization: More Than Just Crypto While often associated with cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, Asset Tokenization is a distinct concept with much broader implications. It refers to the process of issuing a digital token on a blockchain that represents ownership or rights to an underlying asset. Think of it like this: Traditional Asset: A physical piece of real estate, a share in a private company, or a bond certificate. Tokenization Process: Creating a digital token on a blockchain (like TON) that is legally tied to that specific asset. Tokenized Asset: The digital token itself, which can now be managed and transferred using blockchain technology. This process can apply to virtually any asset class. The token carries the information about the asset, its ownership, and any associated rights or obligations. The blockchain ensures the integrity and immutability of this information. In the case of the Telegram bonds, each token (or a set of tokens) will represent a specific value or fraction of the underlying bond, allowing for digital ownership and transfer on the TON network. What Does This Mean for Investors and the Market? The tokenization of $500 million in Telegram bonds by Libre on TON has several potential implications: For Libre: Establishes Libre as a significant player in the institutional tokenization space, validating its platform and strategy. For Telegram: Potentially makes their bonds more attractive to investors due to increased liquidity and accessibility. For TON Blockchain: Drives significant transaction volume and visibility to the network, showcasing its capability for large-scale financial applications. For Institutional Investors: Provides a new avenue to access and manage private debt assets in a potentially more efficient digital format. For the Broader Market: Serves as a strong case study for the successful tokenization of traditional assets, potentially paving the way for more similar initiatives across different asset classes and blockchains. While promising, it’s important to remember that this is still an evolving space. Regulatory clarity, market acceptance, and the development of robust trading infrastructure for these tokenized assets will be key to their long-term success. Summary: A Glimpse into the Future of Finance Libre’s plan to tokenize $500 million worth of Telegram bonds on the TON blockchain is more than just a news headline; it’s a tangible example of how traditional finance and blockchain technology are converging. Backed by major institutional names, this initiative highlights the growing confidence in asset tokenization as a means to enhance liquidity, efficiency, and accessibility for significant asset classes like corporate bonds. The choice of the TON blockchain underscores the network’s potential for handling large-scale institutional use cases. As projects like this move forward, they provide valuable insights into the practical application of blockchain beyond cryptocurrencies and offer a compelling glimpse into the future infrastructure of global finance, where institutional digital assets play a central role.

In the video attached to XRP Hall’s post, Rios clearly emphasized the functional role of XRP within the financial sector, distinguishing it from other digital assets that do not have direct applications. Rios explained that her decision to join Ripple was motivated by the clear purpose XRP serves in the financial ecosystem. She stated, “Crypto has been in the news time and time again, and I just want to share that I am on the board of Ripple. Ripple is XRP. And so when people ask me the question, why did you join the board of Ripple? I joined the board of Ripple because XRP serves a purpose.” She continued by elaborating on what differentiates XRP from other cryptocurrencies. According to Rios, XRP is not designed to act as a store of value without ties to real-world applications. She highlighted that XRP facilitates cross-border payments for legitimate financial institutions, providing a functional use case rather than existing solely for speculative purposes. Rosa Rios, Ripple Board Director and 43rd U.S. Treasurer, stated: ""I am on the board of Ripple. Ripple is #XRP .

Her emphasis on XRP’s use for efficient cross-border payments rather than as an unpegged store of value shows how Ripple’s strategy is anchored in real-world financial utility. This distinction is significant as it sets XRP apart from cryptocurrencies criticized for lacking a tangible economic function. Rios’s background as a former U.S. Treasurer gives her assessment additional credibility, particularly when highlighting XRP’s integration into legitimate financial institution operations. Her portrayal of XRP as a solution for reducing the time and cost of international transactions reinforces Ripple’s stated mission, adding authoritative support to XRP’s role within the evolving digital economy. Reports of Upcoming Collaboration with President Donald Trump While Rosa Rios’s video remarks focused exclusively on Ripple and XRP, XRP Hall noted in his tweet that Rios recently “mentioned twice her upcoming collaboration” with President Donald Trump. While no further information about the collaboration has been shared, Rosa Rios’s comments signal an important moment for Ripple and XRP supporters. Her direct association with a former U.S. President points to a level of visibility and potential influence that could have wider implications for Ripple’s strategic initiatives and the broader adoption and acceptance of digital assets within the traditional financial system.

43985638,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154065,1746015033,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Bitcoin Price Prediction: Arthur Hayes Foresees Astounding $1M by 2028,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bitcoin-price-arthur-hayes/,"Could Bitcoin really hit a staggering $1 million within the next few years? That’s the bold Bitcoin price prediction coming from none other than Arthur Hayes , the insightful co-founder of BitMEX. Speaking at Token2049 in Dubai, Hayes laid out a compelling case for why he believes this seemingly audacious target for Bitcoin 2028 is well within reach, primarily citing expectations of significant dollar liquidity injections by the U.S. government into the global economy. Why is Arthur Hayes Eyeing $1M for Bitcoin 2028? Arthur Hayes’s forecast isn’t just a random guess; it’s rooted in his analysis of macroeconomic trends and historical market reactions. His core argument hinges on the anticipated actions of U.S. policymakers regarding the supply of dollars in the financial system. More dollars flowing into the economy often translate to increased capital seeking returns, which can benefit risk assets like cryptocurrencies. Hayes drew a direct parallel to a critical period in recent financial history: The third quarter of 2022 was marked by central banks aggressively raising interest rates. Simultaneously, the crypto market faced severe stress, highlighted by the impending collapse of FTX. In response, the U.S. government initiated a substantial $2.5 trillion liquidity injection. According to Hayes, this massive influx of funds played a crucial role in stabilizing markets during that turbulent time. He posits that if a similar scenario unfolds again – perhaps triggered by economic slowdowns or banking sector stress – the U.S. is likely to respond with comparable or even larger liquidity measures. The Power of Dollar Liquidity: Hayes’ Key Insight What exactly is ‘dollar liquidity’, and why does Arthur Hayes believe it’s the primary catalyst for his Bitcoin price prediction ? Dollar liquidity refers to the availability of U.S. dollars in the global financial system. When liquidity is high (meaning there are lots of dollars available and easily accessible), investors tend to feel more confident and are more likely to deploy capital into riskier assets that offer potentially higher returns, such as stocks, commodities, and yes, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. Conversely, when liquidity tightens (dollars become scarcer or more expensive to borrow), investors often retreat to safer assets, leading to sell-offs in risk markets. Hayes’s view is that the long-term trend, despite temporary tightening cycles, is towards increasing dollar supply due to ongoing government spending and potential future economic stimulus needs. Hayes’s analysis suggests a potential playbook for investors: “If a similar scenario plays out [to Q3 2022],” Hayes stated, “both equities and cryptocurrencies warrant long positions.” This implies that periods of expected liquidity injections should be viewed as opportunities to accumulate assets like Bitcoin with a long-term horizon towards Bitcoin 2028 and beyond. Comparing 2022 and the Road to Bitcoin 2028 Let’s look at the comparison Arthur Hayes draws between the 2022 environment and the potential future leading up to his Bitcoin 2028 target: Factor Q3 2022 Scenario Potential Future Scenario (Leading to 2028) Monetary Policy Trend Aggressive Interest Rate Hikes Potential Shift towards Easing / Stimulus Market Stressors Crypto specific (FTX collapse), broader economic uncertainty Potential banking sector stress, economic slowdown, geopolitical factors U.S. Response $2.5 Trillion Liquidity Injection Expectation of significant future Liquidity Injections Hayes’ Conclusion Liquidity helped stabilize markets Future liquidity will drive risk assets, including Bitcoin, higher Investment Implication Opportunity for long positions in equities/crypto Reinforces conviction for long positions in equities/crypto towards Bitcoin 2028 This comparison highlights Hayes’s belief that the underlying mechanism – U.S. government response to stress via liquidity – is a powerful and recurring theme that favors assets outside of traditional safe havens. Potential Challenges and Considerations for the Crypto Market While Arthur Hayes presents a compelling bullish case for his Bitcoin price prediction , it’s important to consider potential challenges and counterarguments on the path to Bitcoin 2028 : Timing of Liquidity: Predicting the exact timing and scale of future liquidity injections is difficult. They often occur in response to crises, which themselves can cause short-term market volatility. Inflation Concerns: Aggressive liquidity injections can fuel inflation. If inflation becomes a persistent problem, central banks might be hesitant to ease policy, or do so less aggressively than anticipated. Regulatory Headwinds: The crypto market still faces significant regulatory uncertainty in many jurisdictions, which could impact adoption and sentiment. Execution Risk: Even if the macro environment is favorable, specific risks within the crypto ecosystem (e.g., exchange failures, protocol hacks) could impact prices. Alternative Assets: While liquidity may flow into risk assets, competition from other investment classes could temper gains. Investors should view Hayes’s prediction as a scenario based on specific macroeconomic assumptions, not a guaranteed outcome. It underscores the importance of understanding the macro environment, but shouldn’t replace thorough research and risk management. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Crypto Market If Hayes’s analysis holds weight, what does this mean for investors looking at the crypto market today with an eye on Bitcoin 2028 ? Stay Informed on Macroeconomics: Pay attention to central bank announcements, inflation data, and indicators of economic health. These factors heavily influence the ‘dollar liquidity’ Hayes discusses. Long-Term Perspective: Hayes’s prediction is for 2028. This suggests a long-term investment horizon is necessary to potentially benefit from the trends he identifies. Short-term volatility is likely to continue. Consider Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA): Given the potential for volatility but a long-term bullish outlook based on liquidity, consistently investing a fixed amount over time can be a prudent strategy. Understand Risk: A $1M Bitcoin price prediction is incredibly bullish and comes with inherent risks. Only invest capital you can afford to lose and ensure your portfolio is diversified. Follow Experts Like Arthur Hayes: While not financial advice, keeping track of the analysis from experienced market participants like Arthur Hayes can provide valuable insights into potential market drivers. The path to $1 million for Bitcoin is unlikely to be a straight line, but understanding the macro forces, like dollar liquidity , that proponents like Hayes believe are at play is crucial for navigating the market. Conclusion: Is $1M Bitcoin by 2028 Possible? Arthur Hayes has once again sparked debate with his bold Bitcoin price prediction of $1 million by Bitcoin 2028 . His argument, rooted in the anticipated response of the U.S. government to potential future economic stress via significant injections of dollar liquidity , offers a compelling macroeconomic framework for understanding potential future price movements in the crypto market . While the target is ambitious and dependent on specific economic outcomes, Hayes’s analysis highlights the profound impact that global monetary policy and liquidity can have on risk assets like Bitcoin. Investors looking towards Bitcoin 2028 should factor in these macro considerations, alongside the inherent volatility and specific risks of the crypto space. Whether Bitcoin reaches $1 million or not, understanding the drivers discussed by figures like Arthur Hayes is invaluable for anyone participating in the digital asset revolution.

The firm also reported that deals in the rest of the world surged 43% in dollar value through April 28 from a year ago to $702 million. U.S. M&As faced uncertainty in April as President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement caused tensions in the economy and ushered in a period of extreme market volatility. The firm noted that some companies put deals on hold, awaiting greater clarity about the path ahead in the wake of Trump’s levies. Trump also paused many of the Liberation Day duties on April 9 for 90 days to give nations time to negotiate new trade deals with the U.S. U.S. M&A slows but accelerates globally Financial markets platform Dealogic revealed that U.S. dealmaking has dropped in the new Trump era but has accelerated in other parts of the world. According to the firm’s report, U.S. mergers and acquisitions plummeted 5.7% to $586.5 million for the year through April 28. The report also indicated that M&A volume outside the U.S. realized its best year-to-date result since 2022. Dealogic noted that announced deals in the rest of the world surged 43% in dollar value through April 28 from the same period a year ago to $702 million. “M&A is like a barometer of business confidence, and people are feeling uncertain, and the changes are very hard for boardrooms to work out.” -Lucinda Guthrie, Head of Data Provider Mergermarket. Guthrie acknowledged that several processes have been pulled or paused this month ahead of the President’s planned public announcements. Dealogic noted that the U.S. M&A volume dropped 8% during the month through April 28. The firm also revealed that merger volume across the rest of the world gained 2%. Dealogic revealed that U.S. M&As have still experienced some activity, with Alphabet’s $32 billion agreement to acquire Wiz. Other large deals include Sycamore Partners’ move to take Walgreens private, as did eight of the other top 15 deals. Trump’s tariffs cause slow U.S. M&As in Q1 2025 Q1 2025 turned disappointing for many on Wall Street who hoped the President’s economic agenda would unleash a new dealmaking boom. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon mentioned on Tuesday that policy actions to date have raised the level of uncertainty to a degree that “I don’t think is healthy for investment and growth.” He also asked for more clarity on the Trump administration’s tariff policies. The financial platform noted that things did improve in February and March, right before Trump’s April 2 tariff announcement. The firm found that the merger advisory business at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley surged 5% collectively during the first quarter from a year ago to $2.8 billion. Dealogic argued that some U.S. corporations also don’t have the luxury of waiting for trade policy to settle, which forces them to get more creative in deal structuring. Among them, Boeing last Tuesday revealed plans to sell portions of its digital aviation software unit to private equity firm Thoma Bravo for $10.55 billion, all in cash. Intel semiconductor firm also announced plans earlier this month to sell a 51% stake in its programmable chip unit, Altera, to private equity firm Silver Lake. A U.S. SEC filing indicated that the private equity company is deferring $1 billion of the purchases to be paid out over the next two years. Goldman’s Solomon highlighted Tuesday that if the level of uncertainty continues to grow, “ you won’t see the same amount of capital markets activity.” He also believes that things will settle down eventually.

Bloomberg analysts Eric Balchunas and James Seyffart have recently released their latest projections on the likelihood of approval for various ETFs currently under review by the SEC. Spot ETFs for Litecoin ( LTC ), Solana ( SOL ), and crypto Baskets/Indexes (including conversions like Grayscale’s GBTC) have the highest chances of approval in 2025—each assigned a 90% likelihood. The SEC’s favorable view of LTC and SOL as commodities, coupled with their ties to regulated futures markets, has likely contributed to these optimistic projections. All three have already had their 19b-4 forms acknowledged, with final SEC deadlines ranging from July to October this year. Source: @EricBalchunas Ripple ( XRP ) holds a slightly lower 85% chance of approval. The eventual outcome for XRP is still likely tied to how regulators categorize it—particularly after the CFTC’s April 21 announcement that it considers XRP a regulated asset for futures markets. Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Hedera ( HBAR ) are each assigned an 80% chance of approval. Avalanche ( AVAX ), Cardano ( ADA ) and Polkadot ( DOT ) trail slightly behind with a 75% chance of approval. “Would love to hear directly from Atkins, but all have a good chance of happening,” Balchunas wrote on X.

Paycoin (PCI), a prominent virtual asset payment platform, has just announced a groundbreaking development that could bridge the gap between cryptocurrencies and everyday spending. The platform has officially launched the beta version of its PCI token -based global payment service . What Does This Global Payment Service Mean for Paycoin Users? This isn’t just another minor update; it’s a move designed to bring the utility of crypto payments into mainstream financial networks. By integrating with major global payment giants like MasterCard and SWIFT, Paycoin is enabling its users to potentially spend their PCI holdings with unprecedented ease. Imagine using your virtual assets almost anywhere traditional cards are accepted or transferring value across borders more efficiently. The beta launch specifically focuses on two key areas: Global Card Service: A service that integrates with established card networks, aiming for wider acceptance. Mobile Payment Service: Direct integration with popular mobile wallets. How Can You Make Mobile Crypto Payment with Paycoin Now? One of the most exciting aspects of this beta launch is the direct support for leading mobile crypto payment platforms. Paycoin users participating in the beta program can now link their PCI holdings to familiar mobile wallets, including: Apple Pay Samsung Pay Google Pay This integration simplifies the process of using virtual assets for transactions. Instead of navigating complex crypto wallets at a checkout counter, users can potentially make payments using the same seamless process they use for their traditional debit or credit cards – simply tap their phone. What’s the Significance of Integrating with MasterCard and SWIFT? Integrating with networks like MasterCard and SWIFT is a crucial step for any crypto platform aiming for global adoption. MasterCard is one of the world’s largest payment processing networks, facilitating transactions between merchants and card issuers. SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is primarily known for enabling financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions securely. These integrations signal Paycoin’s ambition to operate within the existing global financial infrastructure, rather than solely parallel to it. For the global payment service offered by Paycoin , this could mean: Increased potential acceptance points globally. Improved efficiency for cross-border transactions involving PCI (potentially leveraging SWIFT infrastructure where applicable, though the exact nature of the SWIFT integration in this beta would require more detailed technical documentation from Paycoin). Greater legitimacy and trust in the eyes of both users and traditional financial players. It’s important to remember this is a beta phase. The full scope, transaction limits, fees, and regional availability will likely be refined based on user feedback and technical performance during this period. What Does This Mean for the PCI Token? Developments like this beta launch are critical for the utility and value proposition of the PCI token itself. As the native token of the Paycoin platform, PCI’s primary function is enabling payments within its ecosystem. By dramatically expanding the potential use cases and acceptance points through this global payment service and mobile crypto payment support, Paycoin aims to increase demand and utility for the token. A token with real-world spending capabilities is often more attractive to users than one confined to limited crypto-native environments. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Payments with Paycoin The beta launch of Paycoin’s global payment service is a strong indicator of the platform’s direction: making crypto payments as convenient and widely accepted as traditional fiat payments. While challenges remain in the broader regulatory landscape and achieving mass adoption, integrating with established players and enabling seamless mobile payments are significant steps forward. Users interested in the beta should consult Paycoin’s official channels for details on participation and availability. In conclusion, Paycoin’s beta launch of its PCI-based global card and mobile payment service, complete with integrations into MasterCard, SWIFT, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Google Pay, represents a bold move to enhance the utility of the PCI token and bring crypto payments into the daily lives of users worldwide. This could be a pivotal moment for the platform and its community.

At this point, Goldman Sachs Global Head of Digital Assets Mathew McDermott, who attended Token2049 in Dubai, said that regulations could increase Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption. Mathew McDermott said that regulatory clarity will allow large institutions to put more capital into the crypto ecosystem, which will help the crypto sector thrive. McDermott also stated that various lobby groups are making efforts to have the expected cryptocurrency regulations in the US enacted by the current administration. Stating that the US’s progress in cryptocurrencies is great for the global market, the Goldman Sachs executive claimed that the US will bring more people to the crypto sector and help accelerate growth. At this point, McDermott added that the two stablecoin bills currently in existence in the US could accelerate the adoption of digital currencies. “If regulations allow stablecoins to be easily adopted by financial institutions, this could accelerate the use of digital currency by major players.

But as 2025 unfolds, a growing number of experts, financial insiders, and crypto enthusiasts are beginning to ask a serious question: Is XRP becoming the “Bitcoin for banks” — the foundational digital asset for the future of global finance? For many in the crypto space, Ripple has long been a polarizing topic. Critics often cite the events of 2017, when a flood of misinformation painted Ripple as centralized, overly corporate, and anti-crypto. Allegations of excessive control, fears of XRP being pre-mined, and speculation about its status as a security fueled skepticism that lingers with some investors even today. But many of those narratives have since been debunked or disproven. XRP isn’t endlessly minted, it’s being burned with every transaction, and Ripple has established real-world partnerships with dozens of governments, central banks, and financial institutions. A Shift in Institutional Sentiment In addition to its institutional partnerships, XRP has also caught the attention of investment firms and market regulators. In a recent crypto market update, it was revealed that over 17 different XRP-based investment products are currently awaiting regulatory approval — an indicator of growing institutional interest. Meanwhile, financial powerhouses like BlackRock and tokenization-focused platforms such as Ono Finance are working alongside Ripple to build tokenized versions of traditional securities and other real-world assets. This collaborative momentum highlights how tokenization is poised to reshape not just crypto, but the broader financial markets. Could XRP Really Become the Financial Base Layer for Banks? Industry insiders and former U.S. financial officials have publicly entertained the possibility of XRP being used as the base layer for the U.S. national banking system or as part of a CBDC initiative. While official decisions are yet to be made, the discussion itself marks a shift from the hostility Ripple once faced. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) — often described as the “central bank of central banks” — has already collaborated with Ripple on CBDC projects and instant settlement solutions, signaling the token’s viability on a global scale.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|FIAT|MARKET|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-30 12:24:49

A significant development on this front involves a familiar name from the political arena making a pivot into the digital asset space: Jim Trusty, a former attorney for U.S. President Donald Trump. This move highlights the increasing importance of Crypto lobbying efforts in shaping the future of the industry. Who is Jim Trusty and Why is His Move Significant? Jim Trusty is well-known for his legal work, particularly his time serving as a lawyer for former President Trump. His background in high-profile legal cases and proximity to the corridors of power in Washington D.C. gives him a unique perspective and network. His transition into cryptocurrency lobbying signals a growing trend: individuals with deep political connections are recognizing the need for the crypto industry to have strong representation in the nation’s capital. It underscores that crypto is no longer a fringe topic but a subject demanding serious attention from policymakers. Introducing NexusOne: A New Player in Washington D.C. Crypto Trusty isn’t going it alone. He has co-founded a new consulting firm called NexusOne with Jeff Ifrah, the head of the respected law firm Ifrah Law. This partnership brings together legal expertise with political navigation skills. According to reports, NexusOne aims to be a crucial bridge between the burgeoning crypto industry and the policymakers in Washington D.C. crypto circles. What services will NexusOne offer? The firm is reportedly focused on providing strategic guidance and access for crypto-related clients looking to influence policy. Their services include: Arranging meetings with key White House officials and other high-level government figures. Helping clients understand and navigate the complex landscape of Washington, D.C. politics and regulations. Developing strategies to influence policy and legislation relevant to cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Providing insights into potential regulatory actions and political dynamics affecting the industry. Essentially, NexusOne is positioning itself as a guide for crypto businesses seeking to make their voices heard and understood by those writing the rules. Why is Influencing Crypto Policy Crucial Now? The need for effective Crypto policy advocacy has never been more urgent. Governments worldwide, and particularly in the United States, are grappling with how to regulate digital assets. Issues range from consumer protection and financial stability to taxation, national security, and fostering innovation. Without clear, sensible regulations, the industry faces uncertainty, potential stifled growth, and risks to both businesses and users. Lobbying firms like NexusOne play a role in this process by educating lawmakers about the technology, its potential benefits, and the practical implications of proposed regulations. They aim to ensure that new rules are not overly burdensome, do not inadvertently harm innovation, and provide necessary clarity for businesses to operate and grow. What Challenges Does Crypto Lobbying Face in Washington D.C.? Despite the increasing resources dedicated to it, Washington D.C. crypto lobbying faces significant hurdles. The regulatory landscape is fragmented, with multiple agencies (like the SEC, CFTC, Treasury, and others) claiming jurisdiction or playing a role. Furthermore, there is often a lack of deep technical understanding among policymakers, leading to potential misunderstandings or fear surrounding the technology. Other challenges include: Negative Perception: Crypto is sometimes associated with illicit activities or speculative bubbles, creating a negative starting point for discussions. Industry Division: Different sectors within crypto (e.g., DeFi, NFTs, exchanges, specific protocols) may have differing needs and priorities, making a unified lobbying message difficult. Political Polarization: Crypto issues can sometimes fall prey to broader political divides, making bipartisan consensus challenging. NexusOne and similar firms must navigate these complexities to build constructive relationships and advocate effectively. What Benefits Can Effective Lobbying Bring to the Crypto Industry? Successful Crypto lobbying can yield substantial benefits: Regulatory Clarity: This is perhaps the most sought-after outcome, providing businesses with certainty on how to comply with laws. Favorable Legislation: Advocating for laws that support innovation, protect property rights, and ensure fair market access. Preventing Harmful Regulations: Lobbying can help push back against overly restrictive or poorly designed rules that could stifle growth or push activity offshore. Increased Legitimacy: Engagement with policymakers can help legitimize the industry in the eyes of traditional finance and the public. The launch of NexusOne with a figure like Jim Trusty at the helm underscores the industry’s commitment to achieving these benefits by engaging directly with the political process. Looking Ahead: The Future of Crypto Policy The establishment of firms like NexusOne is a clear indicator that the crypto industry is maturing and understands the critical need to engage with the political system. As digital assets become more integrated into the global economy, the development of sensible and clear Crypto policy will be paramount. The efforts of lobbyists, think tanks, and industry associations in Washington D.C. crypto circles will play a significant role in shaping that policy for years to come. The journey towards comprehensive and effective regulation is ongoing, and firms like NexusOne are now positioned to be key players in navigating that path.

First up was ADP jobs numbers for April. Coming two days ahead of the government's own employment data for April, the ADP report showed just 62,000 private sector jobs created this month, well shy of estimates for 108,000 and March's 147,000. It was the weakest print since July 2024. Next was the government's first estimate of first quarter GDP growth, which came in at negative 0.3% against estimates for positive 0.2%. While the quarter ended in March, economic actors — fully aware of coming tariffs — front-loaded imports early in the year. Going back to Econ 101, rising imports (absent a corresponding gain in exports) are a drag on GDP growth. Indeed, the export-import imbalance cut GDP growth by nearly 5% in the first quarter. Also at work was the Trump administration's DOGE efforts, with government spending a drag on GDP for the first time since 2022. Turning to inflation, the Core PCE price index embedded within the GDP report rose 3.5% versus estimates for a gain of just 3.1%. It's all adding up to a big drop in U.S. stocks, with the Nasdaq lower 2% and S&P 500 by 1.5%.

In an April 30 post on blockchain-based social media platform Farcaster, Buterin outlined his personal areas of focus for Ethereum development this year. These include investigating changes to the network infrastructure to achieve single-slot finality, updates to smart contract execution and enhancements to privacy. The post comes as the Ethereum network hits a new milestone. GrowThePie data shows that the weekly number of unique addresses interacting with the Ethereum ecosystem reached a new high of over 15.4 million, with nearly 13.45 million on layer-2 protocols. Weekly chart of unique active addresses in the Ethereum ecosystem. Source: GrowThePie Buterin recently argued that privacy should be a top priority for developers and proposed solutions to boost privacy on Ethereum . Earlier in April, he also published a short-term privacy roadmap for Ethereum , detailing technical solutions to the network’s transparency. Buterin’s focus on forward-looking research follows changes at the Ethereum Foundation, the nonprofit organization developing the Ethereum ecosystem. Earlier this month, the Ethereum Foundation co-executive director, Tomasz Stańczak, said that Buterin now has more time for research and exploration . “Each time Vitalik shares insights or communicates a direction, he accelerates major long‑term breakthroughs,” he wrote. Related: Vitalik Buterin proposes swapping EVM language for RISC-V Proposed Ethereum protocol changes In today’s post, Buterin said that this year, he would be researching single-slot finality on Ethereum. This proposed upgrade would allow blocks to become final in a single slot within 12 seconds. This would significantly reduce the time needed to confirm transactions irreversibly and improve user experience. Another area of focus would be making Ethereum stateless. This would lead to nodes no longer storing the full state (account balances, contracts, etc.) but instead requiring users to provide the necessary state data (witnesses) with each transaction. This could potentially improve scalability and decentralization. Buterin also expects to study ways to improve the ecosystem’s cybersecurity on both the front and back ends, as well as its resilience and decentralization. He set some objectives that he specified should also apply to client software, such as third-party wallets: “Ensuring Ethereum is usable in a way that is highly secure, free of centralized intermediaries and privacy-friendly.“ Related: ‘Vitalik: An Ethereum Story’ is less about crypto and more about being human Not just the protocol Besides working on the Ethereum protocol, Buterin expects to dedicate his attention to improving communication tools, information sharing, and the social layer surrounding Ethereum. This includes governance changes, the network’s resources management and open-source development funding. Buterin explained that this also involves developing better encrypted messaging, software documentation, and leading their adoption in the ecosystem. He also hinted at developing prediction markets and related technology, as well as some potential new types of communication tools. Other objectives include the lower-level development. Buterin cited the intention to investigate cryptography, operating systems, hardware, physical infrastructure and biological defence without further explanation. Buterin also cited some areas of development where he is not personally involved, including plans to increase Ethereum’s gas limit as a short-term scalability solution, as well as peer-to-peer systems.

The massive losses underscored broader challenges within the crypto mining industry, including BTC price struggles in 2024, intensified competition, and soaring energy costs. Nonetheless, Argo Blockchain’s condition appears more severe than some of its competitors. For instance, MARA Holdings’ stock price lost 1.84 points in the past twelve months. The unaudited monetary figures have confirmed investors’ fear that the firm’s financial structure is weakening and the current leadership does not have an immediate solution. Argo Blockchain’s leadership woes The trading suspension is part of the struggle experienced in the past months. The firm’s CEO, Thomas Chippas, resigned in January after holding the position for over one year. The lack of explanation following the CEO’s sudden departure triggered investor worries about Argo’s governance issues and internal stability. Meanwhile, critics and most investors are demanding accountability. The mining firm witnessed significant endorsement from executives, influencers, and media voices in the past few years. These promoters endorsed Argo Blockchain as a profitable venture poised for impressive growth. As one X user stated: Those responsible for spreading this company’s bull**** are long gone into the sunset with their pockets full. TheBoatmanCapital @BoatmanCapital · Follow So @ArgoBlockchain finally suspends its shares leaving many investors with big losses. Meanwhile, those responsible for spreading this company’s bullshit are long gone into the sunset with their pockets full. 4:28 pm · 30 Apr 2025 0 Reply Copy link Read more on Twitter Such statements indicate a sense of betrayal among investors. Shareholders will wait for PKF Littlejohn LLP to complete the audit and Argo Blockchain to publish the full financial details. Only then can the firm’s shares resume trading. Nevertheless, the mining firm has an uphill battle with deteriorating financials and dented investor confidence. Argo Blockchain requires a significant shift in leadership and operations to avoid becoming another cautionary tale in the cryptocurrency mining industry.

MIND of Pepe Presale Nears $10M, Ready to Shoot Up",https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ai-tokens-are-back-stronger-than-ever-mind-of-pepe-presale-nears-10m-ready-to-shoot-up/,"AI-based cryptocurrencies have been performing well in the last couple of weeks. The resurgence seems driven by Bitcoin’s recent rally to $95K and renewed investor interest in artificial intelligence-related projects. AI agent launchpad tokens, for instance, have increased 27.5% in the last seven days. Out of these, coins like $MONKS and $MINDS have risen by more than 200% each. Coins relating to AI agents have also increased by 26.4% in the last week, whereas AI meme coins have surged around 10%. Though not a massive upward move, this steady revival indicates a shift in market sentiment regarding artificial intelligence in the Web3 space. This article discusses how you can benefit from this shift. We’ll also suggest a top AI agent coin you should consider investing in right now: MIND of Pepe ($MIND) . AI’s Comeback Isn’t Just Hype This revival is not just market hype but is backed by solid financial investments in artificial intelligence. For example, Nous Research has raised $50M from Paradigm, a known crypto venture investment firm, during its Series A funding round at a token valuation of $1B. Nous Research is an open-source research organization that focuses on improving large language models (LLMs). The company plans to launch its decentralized trading system on the Solana blockchain. Similarly, many venture capital firms, such as Digital Currency Group, Polychain, and dao5, have invested millions of dollars in $TAO, the proprietary token of Bittensor, a decentralized AI marketplace. Bittensor is working on building a global, open-source, and accessible-to-all artificial intelligence network. Anyone, including researchers and developers, can join the network and contribute their own AI models. $TAO has also increased by 10% in the last seven days and 67% in the previous month or so. AI will slowly become deeply rooted in the industry as more innovative and utility-driven projects emerge in the Web3 space. Some experts, however, argue that it’s still too early to predict the growth of AI in the cryptocurrency industry. However, as the saying goes, ‘The early bird catches the worm.’ Early investments in AI coins can bring you a fortune in returns if you back the right horse. As more money pumps into AI, the time to invest in value-driven AI tokens is surely now, and we have just the thing: MIND of Pepe ($MIND). What Is MIND of Pepe and How It Works? MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is a new cryptocurrency that harnesses the power of AI to identify cryptos that could be the next to curry the market’s favor and rally. This autonomous AI agent lives on the internet – on dApps and social media platforms like X, to be precise. Here, it chats with the crypto community, using its patient ear to register the multiple opinions, biases, and insights into the crypto market, including specific tokens. Next, it throws all the data it has collected into its state-of-the-art hive-mind intelligence system, which connects the dots and analyzes various pieces of information to discover the next cryptos to explode . Why $MIND Can Explode 1,000x? MIND of Pepe is revolutionary in giving investors real-time and research-based crypto investment advice. Because it proactively analyzes market sentiments and social media trends, $MIND has its pulse on the dynamic crypto environment. Its ability to be the perfect crypto investment buddy is the biggest reason we’ve predicted $MIND to explode 800% and reach $0.030 by the end of 2030. $MIND token holders will have a self-evolving bot pointing them towards the best cryptos to invest in at any time. Being self-evolving, MIND of Pepe grows and learns with every single conversation. Ultimately, it can drive conversations, shape online trends, and even launch its own tokens. This also means $MIND will be able to push the crypto community towards the tokens it has picked (or created). An AI agent that can drive up demand for specific tokens? Sounds straight out of a science fiction movie. But it’s real! MIND of Pepe Is Currently in Presale The project’s presale performance is proof of its popularity. With over $8.5M in early investor funding, MIND of Pepe is easily one of the best crypto presales on the market. The developers also recently announced on X that they will launch the autonomous AI agent on May 10. You can join the tribe for just $0.0037515 per token. What’s more, you can also stake your $MIND tokens and earn a nifty 267% APY in exchange. To buy $MIND, visit the official MIND of Pepe website , connect your crypto wallet, enter the number of tokens you want to purchase, and approve the transaction. If you need further help with the purchase process, here’s our step-by-step guide on how to buy $MIND . Also, check out the project’s whitepaper for more technical information, or visit their X feed and Telegram channel for regular updates. Last but not least, always bear in mind that the crypto market is subject to violent mood swings, so investing remains risky. We urge our readers to do their own research before investing.

Solana coin price could reach a potential high of $400 in 2025. With a potential surge, the SOL price could hit $1,351 by 2030. Solana is coming true to its community-claimed title, “Ethereum-Killer,” as it gradually surpasses Ethereum in the decentralized market. However, with the ongoing volatility amid the cryptocurrency market crash, the Solana price currently trades at a discount of 49.6% from its ATH of $ 294.33. Following this, crypto investors are storming Google with questions like “Is Solana going to go up?” or “How high can Solana go?” and “Will SOL price reach $500 this altcoin season?” To answer more such questions, we bring to you our Solana price prediction 2025, 2026 – 2030.

The RSI is cooling off from near-overbought levels, suggesting a potential minor pullback before continuation. A bullish ascending channel pattern has been visible since mid-March. If SOL holds above $144 support, it may target $160 and $181 next. However, a break below $144 could trigger a deeper correction. Potential High: $181 Average Price Range: $150–$160 Potential Low: $144 Solana Price Prediction 2025 Solana’s weekly transaction fees have plunged to 92.35% from the January peak of $0.0327, hitting a six-month low of $0.0025.

If the market favors the bulls, the Solana coin price could breach its current all-time high and head toward a new high of $400. Conversely, stricter regulations or a network congestion setback could pull the price toward its annual low of $250.

HOUSE mixes the potential of memes with the craze for tokenized real estate. HOUSE, a newly launched meme token, is drawing in trades from prominent crypto figures. The Solana-based asset mixes the drive for RWA tokenization with the meme cult craze. Within a short time span, whales and public traders stacked over $1.1M worth of HOUSE. In a new and illiquid market, the addition of buyers boosted the token’s rally. Based on Nansen smart money data, HOUSE was all the craze for the past day.

The token aims to follow the trajectory of other Solana memes that started on Pump.fun. This time around, the $100M valuation was harder to reach, while HOUSE strives for gains similar to FARTCOIN, SPX and other cult memes. HOUSE already has 19,389 holders, sufficient for a highly active meme community. In the past days, the token’s success created a series of similar tokens, aiming to use Solana’s meme platforms to present as RWA tokens, with no real proof of tokenization. HOUSE spoofs the housing market Similar to SPX6900, HOUSE launched as a form of RWA satire, with the tag line of ‘1 HOUSE = 1 house’. For now, the token is nowhere near SPX6900’s levels, but the blatant hype led to a growing following on social media. The HOUSE phenomenon has spawned copycat meme tokens, including LAND, Tornado (Housecoin Killer), American Dream, CRISIS, and others. The recent proliferation of memes showed that the Solana ecosystem is still equipped and waiting for a new trend. The emergence of an “RWA meme” trend also created tokens like Birkin, BAG, and wBirkin, all using the Solana decentralized infrastructure. As with other memes, they are completely unbacked by any asset, but rely on hype and a cult-like status. So far, HOUSE has the biggest market capitalization, after going vertical in the past day. The token also draws additional attention with a real-world campaign, complete with posters and financial nihilism about the housing market. $HOUSE posters campaign has more to do with RWA than any RWA project that has ever existed in this space pic.twitter.com/CiDK2H2J7x — unhinged (@unhinged100x) April 26, 2025 The token’s success happens while HOUSE is still trading on PumpSwap after graduating from its initial launch. More than 38% of the token’s volumes are on the PumpSwap DEX, with smaller markets on Orca and Meteora. The relatively small DEX volumes mean HOUSE may continue with more expansion if liquidity flows in. HOUSE has not given signs of insider trading, though it remains highly risky, similar to other memes with a limited history. The meme craze also showed the legitimate RWA market is much slower compared to the potential of meme markets. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Yet, a persistent question remains: What is holding back the full embrace of cryptocurrencies by major financial players? According to a leading voice from one of the world’s most prominent investment banks, the answer is clear: crypto regulation . Mathew McDermott, Global Head of Digital Assets at Goldman Sachs, recently shed light on this critical issue, emphasizing that regulatory clarity is not just helpful, but essential for unlocking the next wave of institutional crypto adoption . Why Clear Crypto Regulation is the Linchpin For large financial institutions like Goldman Sachs, operating within well-defined legal and regulatory frameworks is paramount. Their business models are built on trust, compliance, and managing risk on a massive scale. Unclear or fragmented regulations create significant hurdles. McDermott’s comments, made during a panel discussion at the prestigious Token2049 event in Dubai, underscored this point. He stated that clear rules would make it considerably easier for these large entities to: Deploy Capital: Institutions manage vast sums of money, often belonging to clients (pension funds, endowments, wealthy individuals). They need certainty about asset classification, ownership rights, and tax implications before committing significant capital. Manage Risk: Regulatory clarity helps define risks associated with digital assets, including operational, counterparty, and market risks. Without it, assessing and mitigating these risks becomes speculative and difficult. Ensure Compliance: Institutions operate under stringent Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), and other compliance requirements. Clear regulation provides the necessary guidelines to integrate digital assets into existing compliance structures. Build Scalable Infrastructure: Integrating digital assets into existing trading, custody, and settlement systems requires certainty about how these processes should be structured to meet regulatory standards. In essence, regulation provides the guardrails that allow institutions to participate safely and confidently. Without these guardrails, the potential for deploying capital and achieving scale development in the crypto field remains largely untapped by the biggest players. What is Goldman Sachs’ Crypto Stance? Goldman Sachs has been one of the more forward-thinking major banks in the digital asset space. While cautious and methodical, they have been actively exploring and engaging with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. Their involvement includes trading derivatives linked to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, exploring blockchain for traditional finance applications, and engaging in discussions about the future of digital assets. McDermott’s position as Global Head of Digital Assets highlights Goldman’s commitment to understanding and potentially participating in this market. His perspective is particularly valuable because it comes from within an institution that serves a sophisticated client base and understands the complexities of integrating new asset classes into global financial markets. His assertion that regulation is key isn’t just an observation; it reflects the internal requirements and considerations that a firm like Goldman Sachs faces when evaluating digital asset opportunities. The fact that a Goldman Sachs executive is publicly advocating for clear rules signals that the interest is there, but the framework is missing. They are ready, or getting ready, to engage more deeply, but they need regulators to pave the way. How Might US Crypto Regulation Accelerate Adoption? The United States is a critical market for global finance, and the regulatory approach taken there has significant ripple effects internationally. McDermott specifically mentioned that two stablecoin bills currently being formulated in the U.S. Congress could accelerate the adoption of digital currencies. This is a crucial point, as stablecoins are often seen as a potential bridge between the traditional financial system and the crypto world. Why are stablecoins particularly relevant for institutional adoption? Stability: Unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, stablecoins are designed to maintain a stable value, typically pegged to a fiat currency like the US dollar. This stability is essential for institutional use cases like payments, settlement, and treasury management. Efficiency: Stablecoins offer the potential for faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions compared to traditional payment systems, especially across borders. Programmability: As digital assets, stablecoins can be integrated into smart contracts and decentralized applications, opening up new possibilities for financial innovation. Clear stablecoin regulation in the US would provide certainty regarding their legal status, reserve requirements, and operational standards. This would make institutions more comfortable using stablecoins for various purposes, which in turn could increase overall activity and comfort levels within the broader digital asset ecosystem. It could legitimize the use of digital currencies for everyday financial tasks, paving the way for wider adoption. The Benefits of Increased Institutional Crypto Adoption While the crypto community often celebrates decentralization and retail participation, the entry of institutions brings significant benefits to the market: Increased Liquidity: Institutional capital can dramatically increase the trading volume and liquidity of digital assets, making markets more efficient and less volatile. Greater Market Maturity: Institutional participation brings professional trading strategies, risk management practices, and analytical rigor, contributing to the overall maturity of the market. Enhanced Credibility: The involvement of respected financial institutions lends credibility to the digital asset class, potentially attracting more retail investors and further innovation. Development of Infrastructure: Institutions require robust and reliable infrastructure (custody solutions, trading platforms, data providers), the development of which benefits the entire ecosystem. McDermott’s statement highlights that this scale development is contingent on regulatory clarity. The potential for growth is immense, but it requires a foundational layer of clear, understandable rules. Challenges on the Path to Clear Regulation While the need is clear, crafting effective crypto regulation is a complex undertaking. Regulators face challenges including: Defining Digital Assets: Are they securities, commodities, currencies, or something else? Different classifications trigger different regulatory regimes. Jurisdictional Issues: Crypto is global, while regulation is often national or regional. This creates challenges in enforcement and coordination. Rapid Technological Change: The technology is evolving quickly, making it difficult for regulation to keep pace without stifling innovation. Balancing Innovation and Protection: Regulators must protect investors and consumers without stifling the potential benefits and innovation that digital assets offer. Despite these challenges, the push for clarity from within the traditional finance sector, as voiced by Goldman Sachs, adds significant weight to the urgency for regulatory action. Looking Ahead: What’s Next? The comments from Mathew McDermott at Token2049 serve as a powerful reminder that the future scale of institutional crypto adoption is intrinsically linked to the actions of policymakers. As discussions around US crypto regulation continue, particularly concerning stablecoins, the industry watches closely. Clear rules could indeed trigger a significant influx of capital and accelerate the integration of digital assets into the global financial system. The path forward requires continued dialogue between industry participants, regulators, and legislators. The goal is to create a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while ensuring market integrity and investor protection – a balance that is crucial for the sustained, large-scale growth envisioned by institutions like Goldman Sachs. In Conclusion: The message from Goldman Sachs is loud and clear: clear crypto regulation is the key that will unlock the floodgates for institutional capital. As stablecoin bills and other regulatory efforts progress, the potential for accelerated institutional crypto adoption becomes increasingly real, promising a new era for the digital asset market.

This is particularly true for BTC whales, which have gone on an impressive accumulation spree in the past couple of weeks, coinciding with the easing of tension between the US and essentially the rest of the world. BTC Whales Start Buying Again Data shared by Ali Martinez indicates that BTC whales, referred to as large bitcoin investors who hold an excessive amount of the asset, have returned in full force after the hiatus earlier this year. Recall that these market participants had sold over 6,800 BTC within just a week in February as the aforementioned tension mounted. However, their most recent behavior is entirely different, and the notion that they are buying like “never before” received further validation. According to Martinez, they bought over 43,100 BTC in the past two weeks alone, which is worth almost $4 billion at today’s prices. Whales have accumulated over 43,100 #Bitcoin $BTC in the past two weeks, worth nearly $4 billion! pic.twitter.com/34RkxliINK — Ali (@ali_charts) April 30, 2025 Perhaps a sizeable portion of this amount could be linked to Strategy’s continuous accumulation , as well as other companies such as Metaplanet and Semler Scientific, who continue to add BTC to their respective stashes. At the same time, the inflows toward the spot Bitcoin ETFs have skyrocketed since April 17, with over $3.9 billion entering the funds. But Miners Are Selling? In contrast, another chart shared by the same popular analyst reaffirmed a previous narrative that BTC miners, the backbone of the world’s biggest and most secure blockchain, have been selling in large quantities. Their holdings have declined by almost $850 million in the past few weeks, as bitcoin’s price started to regain traction and added $20,000 since the April 7 low of under $75,000. Miners capitalized on the recent price surge, selling 943 #Bitcoin $BTC , worth roughly $850 million. pic.twitter.com/9LPxkpC1pq — Ali (@ali_charts) April 29, 2025 The post $4 Billion in 2 Weeks: Bitcoin Whales Go on Massive Accumulation Spree appeared first on CryptoPotato .",BTCEUR|BTCGBP|BTCUSD|BTCUSDT|Crypto News|featured1|Bitcoin (BTC) Price|Bitcoin Mining|Bitcoin Whales,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Crypto Potato', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopotato.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopotato,2025-04-30 13:42:03

According to Messari’s comprehensive Q1 report , the network generated $70.8 million in revenue, representing a 58.1% quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) increase. This surge was largely fueled by an astonishing 122.6% rise in wallet-to-wallet transaction fees, which overtook DeFi as the leading revenue contributor. Source: Messari The beginning of February marked a pivotal moment for the network, as the popularity of the TST memecoin helped boost user engagement, pushing unique on-chain users to an all-time high of 517 million on February 11. This spike in activity significantly contributed to BNB Chain’s revenue, which increased in both fiat and BNB terms, from 69,500 BNB in Q4 2024 to 109,800 BNB in Q1 2025. Source: Messari Despite BNB’s price depreciation, the chain maintained its position as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, trailing only Bitcoin, Ethereum, and XRP. This performance outpaced Ethereum, which saw a staggering 45.2% drop, and Solana, which declined by 29.6%. The BNB ecosystem’s deflationary mechanics remained intact, with the 30th quarterly burn incinerating 1.6 million BNB ($1.2 billion), contributing to an annualized deflation rate of 4.6%. DeFi, DEX, and Stablecoins Anchor a Thriving Ecosystem BNB Smart Chain’s on-chain activity saw strong growth, with average daily transactions rising 20.9% QoQ to 4.9 million and average daily active addresses increasing 26.4% to 1.2 million. Stablecoin transfers and wallet-to-wallet transactions accounted for the majority of this activity, collectively comprising 74.4% of all transactions. Stablecoin usage alone rose 28% to 1.2 million daily transactions, and wallet transfers surged 50.9% to 835,000 per day. DeFi engagement held firm despite broader market uncertainty. Although Total Value Locked (TVL) in USD terms dipped by 1.2% to $5.3 billion, BNB-denominated TVL grew 14.7%. This rise helped BNB Smart Chain claim the fourth spot in total TVL rankings, overtaking one rival chain. Decentralized exchange (DEX) volume experienced remarkable growth, rising 79.3% QoQ to an average of $2.3 billion in daily volume. PancakeSwap remained the dominant force, controlling 91.8% of all DEX activity, supported by a 95.2% increase in trading volume. Other DeFi applications, such as Venus Finance and Kernel, also played key roles. Venus led by TVL despite a small decline in asset borrowings, while Kernel saw a dramatic 655.6% TVL increase from $81.9 million to over half a billion, driven by restaking incentives. Stablecoins also fueled ecosystem revenue, generating 5,745.1 BNB in Q1, up 23.4% QoQ, although their share of total revenue declined to 5.2%. DeFi revenue increased 7.6% QoQ to 9,274.9 BNB, but fell to the second spot in revenue distribution as wallet-to-wallet fees surged. MEV and infrastructure revenue both declined slightly, with bridge fees seeing a modest 8.6% rise to 275.1 BNB. Upgrades Drive Long-Term Scalability Underpinning this operational growth was a series of substantial infrastructure and protocol upgrades. The Pascal hard fork , launched during Q1, introduced several Ethereum-compatible features such as EIP-7702 smart contract wallets, BLS12-381 cryptography for efficient signature aggregation, gas abstraction, and batch transaction support. Gas limits were also increased from 120 million to 140 million gas units, allowing the network to support more complex transaction activity. Pascal is only the first of three major upgrades slated for 2025. As for the BNB price , BNB is currently consolidating above the $595 support level and is trading near $602, close to the 100-hourly simple moving average. After forming a base at $592, the price rebounded and surpassed the $600 and $605 levels, reaching a high of $611 before pulling back to retest the $600 level. The presence of a key rising channel and a steady RSI above 50 suggests bullish momentum, with resistance at $606 and $610. A successful breakout above $610 could lead to further gains toward $620, with potential upside targets at $635 and $650. However, if BNB fails to overcome the $610 resistance, it may face renewed selling pressure. The initial support lies at $600, followed by stronger levels at $598 and $592. A drop below $592 could trigger a more significant decline, potentially pushing the price down to $585 or even $580. Overall, BNB’s short-term direction hinges on whether it can sustain support above $598 and break through the $610 resistance.

What was supposed to be a successful launch for MOVE ended in disaster, causing its price to drop to an all-time low of $0.219 . Behind this sudden collapse lies a financial deal that was supposed to boost the token’s success but instead led to market manipulation and shady tactics. Who’s really behind this crypto chaos, and how did it all go so wrong? Let’s break down the details. Deceptive Deal Leads to a Price Collapse The Movement Foundation, behind the launch of MOVE, is now under investigation for signing a deal that gave a single entity disproportionate control over the token market. The agreement granted Web3Port , a Chinese market maker with ties to Donald Trump-affiliated World Liberty Financial, significant leverage. This resulted in the sale of 66 million MOVE tokens just one day after their debut in December. The massive token dump triggered a sharp price drop and sparked allegations of insider trading. Rentech: The Middleman at the Center of the Scandal Internal messages from Movement’s co-founder, Cooper Scanlon, revealed that they were deceived into working with a middleman named Rentech. Initially believed to be a subsidiary of Web3Port, Rentech turned out to be a separate entity that facilitated this market manipulation. The deal allowed Rentech to borrow up to 5% of MOVE’s total supply, giving them significant control over the token’s price, raising red flags about potential price manipulation. Incentives for Price Manipulation The market-making agreements involved unusual provisions, such as one that incentivized Rentech to artificially push the price of MOVE token over $5 billion in value. This setup would have allowed them to profit from a sharp price rise and then sell off their tokens, benefiting from the inflated price. Industry experts, including crypto founder Zaki Manian, called this structure “dangerous” and unethical, accusing the deal of encouraging price manipulation. Internal Conflicts and Investigation Movement is also facing internal tensions. Allegations have surfaced about co-founder Rushi Manche’s involvement in pushing for the deal, with some suggesting that conflicts of interest played a role. The company is now investigating these claims and working to hold those responsible accountable. Binance Steps In As a result of the token dump, Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges, banned the market-making account tied to Rentech. In response, Movement Foundation launched a token buyback initiative to stabilize the price and regain investor trust. Despite the negative press and the fallout from the price crash, Movement Labs has promised to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deal and ensure accountability.",News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING|BNB,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-30 13:44:35

DeepSeek uploaded its newest model, Prover V2, to the hosting service Hugging Face on April 30. The latest model, released under the permissive open-source MIT license , aims to tackle math proof verification. DeepSeek-Prover-V2 HuggingFace repository. Source: HuggingFace Prover V2 has 671 billion parameters, making it significantly larger than its predecessors, Prover V1 and Prover V1.5, which were released in August 2024. The paper accompanying the first version explained that the model was trained to translate math competition problems into formal logic using the Lean 4 programming language — a tool widely used for proving theorems. The developers say Prover V2 compresses mathematical knowledge into a format that allows it to generate and verify proofs, potentially aiding research and education. Related: Here’s why DeepSeek crashed your Bitcoin and crypto What does it all mean? A model, also informally and incorrectly referred to as “weights” in the AI space, is the file or collection of files that allow one to locally execute an AI without relying on external servers. Still, it’s worth pointing out that state-of-the-art LLMs require hardware that most people don't have access to. This is because those models tend to have a large parameter count, which results in large files that require a lot of RAM or VRAM (GPU memory) and processing power to run. The new Prover V2 model weighs approximately 650 gigabytes and is expected to run from RAM or VRAM. To get them down to this size, Prover V2 weights have been quantized down to 8-bit floating point precision, meaning that each parameter has been approximated to take half the space of the usual 16 bits, with a bit being a single digit in binary numbers. This effectively halves the model’s bulk. Prover V1 is based on the seven-billion-parameter DeepSeekMath model and was fine-tuned on synthetic data. Synthetic data refers to data used for training AI models that was, in turn, also generated by AI models, with human-generated data usually seen as an increasingly scarce source of higher-quality data. Prover V1.5 reportedly improved on the previous version by optimizing both training and execution and achieving higher accuracy in benchmarks. So far, the improvements introduced by Prover V2 are unclear, as no research paper or other information has been published at the time of writing. The number of parameters in the Prover V2 weights suggests that it is likely to be based on the company’s previous R1 model . When it was first released, R1 made waves in the AI space with its performance comparable to the then state-of-the-art OpenAI’s o1 model . Related: South Korea suspends downloads of DeepSeek over user data concerns The importance of open weights Publicly releasing the weights of LLMs is a controversial topic. On one side, it is a democratizing force that allows the public to access AI on their own terms without relying on private company infrastructure. On the other side, it means that the company cannot step in and prevent abuse of the model by enforcing certain limitations on dangerous user queries. The release of R1 in this manner raised security concerns , and some described it as China’s “ Sputnik moment .” Open source proponents rejoiced that DeepSeek continued where Meta left off with the release of its LLaMA series of open-source AI models, proving that open AI is a serious contender for OpenAI’s closed AI . The accessibility of those models also continues to improve. Accessible language models Now, even users without access to a supercomputer that costs more than the average home in much of the world can run LLMs locally. This is primarily thanks to two AI development techniques: model distillation and quantization. Distillation refers to training a compact “student” network to replicate the behavior of a larger “teacher” model, so you keep most of the performance while cutting parameters to make it accessible to less powerful hardware. Quantization consists of reducing the numeric precision of a model’s weights and activations to shrink size and boost inference speed with only minor accuracy loss. An example is Prover V2’s reduction from 16 to eight-bit floating point numbers, but further reductions are possible by halving bits further. Both of those techniques have consequences for model performance, but usually leave the model largely functional. DeepSeek’s R1 was distilled into versions with retrained LLaMA and Qwen models ranging from 70 billion parameters to as low as 1.5 billion parameters. The smallest of those models can even reliably be run on some mobile devices.

According to a leading voice at one of the world’s largest asset managers, the answer might be yes. Robert Mitchinik, the Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock , has shared a compelling perspective that could reshape how investors view the premier cryptocurrency. Mitchinik suggests that Bitcoin (BTC) is on a path to becoming a permanent low-beta asset . This isn’t just a passing observation; it’s a view grounded in recent market behavior and carries significant implications for portfolio diversification and institutional adoption. Let’s dive into what this means and why it’s generating buzz in the financial world. What Exactly is a Low-Beta Asset? Before we explore BlackRock’s perspective, it’s helpful to understand the concept of ‘beta’ in finance. Beta is a measure of a stock’s or asset’s volatility in relation to the overall market (usually represented by a major index like the S&P 500). Here’s a quick breakdown: Beta of 1: The asset’s price tends to move with the market. Beta Greater Than 1: The asset is more volatile than the market. If the market goes up 1%, this asset might go up 1.5% or 2%. Conversely, it would likely fall more in a downturn. Beta Less Than 1 (Low Beta): The asset is less volatile than the market. It might not capture all of the market’s gains but is also less susceptible to its downturns. Beta of 0: The asset’s price movement is uncorrelated with the market. Negative Beta: The asset tends to move in the opposite direction of the market. Historically, Bitcoin has exhibited a high beta, meaning its price swings were often much larger than those of traditional stock indices. This is part of why it has been considered a high-risk, high-reward investment. Why is BlackRock Seeing Bitcoin as a Low-Beta Asset? Robert Mitchinik’s observation is based on recent market dynamics. He pointed to periods of heightened U.S.-China trade tensions as a key example. During these times, traditional equity markets often experience significant volatility and declines due to uncertainty and potential economic impact. However, Mitchinik noted that during such periods, Bitcoin demonstrated a surprising level of stability compared to the volatile stock market. This behavior suggests a decoupling – Bitcoin ‘s price movements were less tied to the immediate fluctuations driven by traditional geopolitical and economic factors affecting equities. This decoupling is crucial. It indicates that Bitcoin might be starting to trade on its own fundamentals, narrative, or a different set of market forces, rather than simply acting as a leveraged play on overall risk sentiment reflected in stock markets. The Strengthening Narrative: Bitcoin as a Safe Haven The idea of Bitcoin acting as a safe haven asset isn’t new, but it has been debated intensely. Traditionally, assets like gold or certain government bonds are considered safe havens – places investors flock to preserve capital during times of economic uncertainty or market turmoil. The recent market behavior highlighted by BlackRock strengthens the argument for Bitcoin ‘s potential as a safe haven . If BTC remains stable or even appreciates during periods when stocks are falling sharply, it starts to fulfill one of the key functions of a safe haven asset: providing refuge from volatility in other markets. This perceived shift is powerful because it changes the narrative around Bitcoin from purely speculative tech asset to a potential store of value and portfolio stabilizer. This evolving perception is vital for broader acceptance. The Real-World Impact: Renewed Inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs BlackRock isn’t just making theoretical observations; their firm is a major player in the practical application of Bitcoin investing through financial products. The launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. earlier this year was a watershed moment, providing regulated and easily accessible avenues for investors to gain exposure to BTC. Mitchinik links the observation of Bitcoin ‘s lower beta behavior and its strengthening safe haven narrative directly to market activity. The belief in Bitcoin ‘s potential stability and decoupling during turbulent times is contributing to renewed inflows into these spot Bitcoin ETFs . Think about it: if institutional investors and financial advisors start seeing Bitcoin not just as a speculative gamble but as an asset that could potentially offer uncorrelated returns or act as a hedge against equity volatility, it makes allocating capital to products like spot Bitcoin ETFs a much more attractive proposition. These inflows are tangible evidence of changing investor sentiment and strategy. What Does a Potential Permanent Low-Beta Bitcoin Mean for Your Portfolio? If BlackRock’s view holds true and Bitcoin does become a permanent low-beta asset , the implications for investors are significant: Diversification: A low-beta asset with low correlation to traditional markets is a powerful tool for portfolio diversification. It can potentially reduce overall portfolio risk without necessarily sacrificing returns. Reduced Volatility Exposure: While Bitcoin would likely still experience price swings, a lower beta suggests these swings might be less extreme or less directly tied to the broader market’s emotional rollercoasters. Shifting Investment Thesis: The focus might shift slightly from pure directional bets on price appreciation to incorporating BTC for its potential hedging or diversification benefits. Of course, it’s essential to remember that this is an evolving view. The crypto market is still relatively young compared to traditional finance, and Bitcoin ‘s behavior could change again. External factors, regulatory developments, and mass adoption levels will all play a role in its long-term beta profile. The Future Trajectory of Bitcoin Mitchinik’s statement about Bitcoin becoming a ‘permanent’ low-beta asset is a bold one. It suggests a belief that the recent decoupling behavior is not a temporary anomaly but the beginning of a new phase for Bitcoin ‘s market dynamics. For this to become permanent, several factors might need to solidify: Continued institutional adoption treating BTC as a distinct asset class. Increased liquidity and market maturity reducing susceptibility to smaller events. Broader acceptance of its digital gold or safe haven narrative among diverse investor bases. This perspective from a firm like BlackRock is noteworthy because of their influence and the vast amount of capital they manage. Their views can shape institutional strategies and further drive the narrative around Bitcoin ‘s role in the global financial system. Conclusion: A New Era for Bitcoin? Robert Mitchinik’s comments from BlackRock offer a fascinating glimpse into how major financial institutions are starting to perceive Bitcoin . The idea of BTC evolving into a permanent low-beta asset , decoupling from volatile equities and solidifying its status as a potential safe haven , is a significant shift from past perceptions. This evolving view, supported by observations of recent market behavior and evidenced by inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs , suggests a maturing asset class. While volatility will likely remain a characteristic, a lower beta could fundamentally alter Bitcoin ‘s role in investment portfolios, positioning it less as a purely speculative play and more as a sophisticated tool for diversification and capital preservation in turbulent times. Investors should watch closely to see if this low-beta trend continues, as it could signal a new era for Bitcoin ‘s integration into the mainstream financial world.

43988428,https://coinpaper.com/8777/staking-alone-won-t-save-ethereum-et-fs-bloomberg-analyst,1746021125,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png,Staking Alone Won’t Save Ethereum ETFs: Bloomberg Analyst,https://coinpaper.com/8777/staking-alone-won-t-save-ethereum-et-fs-bloomberg-analyst,"Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said on a recent podcast that the potential approval of staking for spot Ethereum ETFs may only have a small impact unless accompanied by a sustained price rally. He referred to Ethereum’s disappointing post-launch performance and pointed to the December 2024 price surge — driven by Trump’s election win — as the only period of notable ETF inflows. Balchunas now believes that ETH needs a multi-month rally and compelling narrative to rekindle investor interest. Meanwhile, Nasdaq filed to list a Dogecoin ETF from 21Shares, amid broader ETF proposals covering Solana, XRP, and other altcoins. The SEC also recently delayed decisions on Dogecoin and XRP ETFs until June. Despite a wave of over 70 crypto ETF applications, analysts still warn that market demand may not match Bitcoin’s. Ethereum ETFs Need More Than Just Staking Spot Ethereum ETFs may gain the ability to stake a portion of the Ethereum they hold, but this development alone is unlikely to attract major inflows unless there’s a more sustained rally in the token’s price. This is according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. A crypto ETF is a publicly traded investment fund that tracks the price of a cryptocurrency or a basket of cryptocurrencies. It allows investors to gain exposure to crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum without directly buying or storing the coins themselves. Instead, they can buy shares of the ETF on traditional stock exchanges, making it much easier and more accessible to invest in crypto through familiar financial channels. On the April 29 episode of the New Era Finance Podcast, Balchunas acknowledged that while staking approval would have ”a little” positive impact — and certainly wouldn’t hurt — the real issue lies in Ethereum’s lackluster performance since ETF launch. Balchunas pointed out that Ethereum struggled to sustain any long-term upward momentum, which has been a key reason behind the very tepid inflows to ETH ETFs since their launch in the United States in July. He specifically pointed to December’s brief surge in Ethereum’s price as evidence of the link between price action and ETF inflows. This surge was driven in part by Donald Trump’s election victory, which fueled a broader crypto market rally. During that period, ETH climbed 71% to reach $4,107 on Dec. 16, which started a 19-day positive streak in ETF inflows totaling around $2.44 billion, according to Farside data . ETH’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) However, that rally was short-lived. Since hitting its peak, ETH declined by more than 50% and now trades around $1,807. Balchunas stressed that for Ether ETFs to regain its momentum, the asset will need a ”multimonth run” alongside a compelling narrative, not just occasional spikes in price. He explained that the timing of ETF launches is also critical. In contrast to Ethereum ETFs, spot Bitcoin ETFs benefited from a strong price performance immediately after their debut in January of 2024. This helped attract investor interest and drive inflows as Bitcoin soared to new all-time highs within two months. Meanwhile, many ETF issuers are still awaiting a decision from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on whether Ethereum ETFs can offer staking. Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart commented that approval could come early, but the final decision deadline is not until the end of October. Nasdaq Seeks Approval for Dogecoin ETF Nasdaq recently filed a request with US regulators to list a 21Shares ETF tied to Dogecoin (DOGE), according to newly released regulatory documents . This move is the latest in a series of ETF proposals targeting the popular meme coin, following similar applications by asset managers Bitwise and Grayscale. 21Shares initially filed to launch its Dogecoin ETF on April 10 and also submitted filings for ETFs linked to other cryptocurrencies like Solana, XRP, and Polkadot. The listing cannot proceed until the SEC approves Nasdaq’s request, which could open the door to broader investor access to Dogecoin via an ETF structure. Dogecoin is considered to be one of the most recognized meme coins in the market. Unlike many other meme tokens, DOGE functions as the native token of its own blockchain network. The Dogecoin network is built on a proof-of-work system and is optimized for peer-to-peer transactions, offering faster and cheaper transfers compared to Bitcoin. It processed over 48,000 transactions in the past 24 hours, based on data from Bitinfocharts.com . Dogecoin stats ( Bitinfocharts.com ) Efforts to expand Dogecoin’s utility are also still ongoing. In September of 2024, blockchain projects QED Protocol and Nexus announced plans to introduce a layer-2 scaling solution that would enable smart contract functionality on the Dogecoin network. This could potentially enhance its capabilities and broaden its appeal beyond just simple payments. SEC Delays Dogecoin and XRP ETF Decisions While ETF issuers are still waiting to hear about Ethereum staking, the SEC delayed decisions on whether to approve two proposed ETFs tied to Dogecoin and XRP. According to newly released filings , the regulator pushed its deadline to rule on the ETF applications until June. The delay was announced after March submissions from exchanges NYSE Arca and Cboe BZX Exchange, which wanted to list Bitwise’s Dogecoin ETF and Franklin Templeton’s XRP ETF, respectively. DOGE’s price action over the past year (Source: CoinMarketCap ) Dogecoin is currently the most actively traded meme coin, and holds a market cap of around $26 billion. XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger, and has a market cap of approximately $130 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data . These ETF filings are part of a growing wave in 2025, with the SEC reportedly reviewing close to 70 crypto-related ETFs as of late April. Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas shared that asset managers are pitching funds linked to a wide range of cryptocurrencies — from established tokens like XRP, Litecoin, and Solana to novelty meme coins like Penguins, Doge, and Melania-themed 2x leveraged tokens. The flood of ETF proposals comes during a time of increasing political pressure, with US President Donald Trump reportedly urging the SEC to adopt a more crypto-friendly approach. Despite the surge in filings, analysts still warned that investor enthusiasm for altcoin ETFs may fall short compared to those based on Bitcoin and Ethereum. Balchunas compared the ETF approval process to a band getting its songs onto streaming platforms — a necessary step for exposure, but not a guarantee of popularity. While US exchanges are actively pursuing crypto ETF listings, some are also calling for stricter oversight. In a comment letter that was sent to the SEC, Nasdaq urged the agency to apply the same regulatory standards to digital assets that it does to traditional securities, and argued that some tokens may effectively function as ”stocks by any other name.”",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,DOGE|ETH|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-30 13:52:05

P2P.org , a leading staking-as-a-business provider for custodians, exchanges, and private investors, has been officially voted as a TRON Super Representative (SR), the company confirmed this Tuesday. The staking service provider will become a node validator on the TRON blockchain, bringing institutional TRX staking services to its clients. Becoming a TRON SR validator sees P2P.org expand its validation services to more than 40 blockchain networks, including Solana, Ethereum, Polkadot, Polygon, and Celestia, among others. Crucially, the move will establish a new pathway for its hundreds of institutional investors towards TRX staking on the TRON network. Alex Esin, CEO at P2P.org, believes joining TRON will be a significant move for institutional staking to enhance staking adoption globally. Speaking on its induction as a Super Representative validator, Esin shared: ""Becoming a TRON Super Representative Validator represents a significant advancement in our validator portfolio. This expansion strengthens our position across more than 40 networks and creates valuable new opportunities for our institutional partners to optimize their TRX holdings with industry-leading staking solutions."" Notwithstanding, as a newly elected SR, P2P.org will both strengthen TRON's infrastructure and create pathways for institutions to access staking rewards on the network. How To Become A TRON SR Validator TRON Super Representatives, or block producers, have the responsibility of securing the network, validating transactions, making governance decisions, and produce blocks. The Super Representatives are 27 elected validators that form the backbone of the network's delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus. This is done by producing blocks every three seconds, validating transactions, voting on governance decisions, and sharing block rewards with their voters. The SRs are elected through voting, with any account being eligible to enter the voting period. The candidates can apply to become an SR by paying 9,999 TRX (~$2455) and then participating in the election. Once the DAO votes you in among the top 27 candidates, you become an SR. Only a Super Representative (SR) or a Super Partner (backup SR) can act as a validator on the Tron network, helping validate transactions, produce blocks, and maintain the security of the network. Speaking on the growing TRON ecosystem and why more institutions are looking towards the blockchain over its competitors, Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson for the TRON DAO stated: ""With its scalability and minimal transaction costs, TRON has become the blockchain of choice for an increasing number of DeFi platforms focused on institutional adoption. As the builders of a thriving ecosystem with hundreds of institutional clients, we are thrilled to welcome P2P.org as a Super Representative."" As stated above, P2P.org aims to continue its quest to grow institutional staking, and the latest move is a testament to its goal. So far, the company boasts $4.7 billion in total value locked, spread across more than 40 blockchains. P2P.org has also built a thriving ecosystem that serves over 90,000 delegators and hundreds of institutional clients. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Here Are the Details,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-shared-his-strategic-priorities-for-the-next-year-he-draws-attention-to-two-topics-here-are-the-details/,"Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin has shared his strategic priorities for the coming year, identifying two main themes he will focus on in 2025: improving Ethereum’s core infrastructure and accelerating the development of decentralized ecosystems. Vitalik Buterin Reveals Ethereum and Decentralization Priorities for 2025 On the Ethereum front, Buterin emphasized that efforts will continue to strengthen the network's long-term roadmap, paying special attention to security, decentralization, and privacy. These efforts include ongoing updates aimed at increasing the scalability of the Ethereum protocol and reducing reliance on centralized components. These updates are critical to ensuring the blockchain’s resilience and neutrality in the face of increasing adoption and regulatory scrutiny. Beyond Ethereum’s core, Buterin emphasized a broader goal of promoting more holistic decentralized ecosystems. His priorities include encouraging innovation in decentralized communication tools, governance mechanisms, and underlying infrastructure that support open-source collaboration and censorship resistance. The creator of Ethereum has consistently advocated for decentralization beyond the technical realm of blockchains and has frequently called on the community to consider how decentralized systems could reshape social, political, and economic structures. The 2025 agenda reinforces this vision, striving for a future in which not only money but also power and coordination tools are distributed across networks rather than concentrated in institutions. Buterin’s renewed focus comes at a time when Ethereum continues to lead as the foundation layer for decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and increasingly new forms of digital identity and governance. With scalability upgrades like Danksharding and broader experiments in decentralized governance on the horizon, the roadmap outlines Ethereum’s ambition to continue to be the foundational layer of Web3 and a model for decentralized coordination in an increasingly digital world. *This is not investment advice.

Silo Finance is a perfect example, and with its recent launch of V2 on the Sonic network, the protocol is bringing a breath of fresh air to a buzzing sector. A top 20 lending protocol by TVL , Silo is on a mission to make borrowing and lending smoother, safer, and more user-friendly than ever. As you would expect from a V2, the latest iteration to roll off the production lines showcases no end of improvements and new features, including the much-vaunted Silo Vaults…. Locking Down Risk: Isolated Pools, Savvy Safeguards In truth, Silo didn’t have to reinvent the wheel with V2: the non-custodial protocol had already powered loans worth hundreds of millions across 50+ markets. Just as well, then, that its brain trust has retained all the features that made the OG protocol tick, while adding a sprinkling of stardust to raise the bar. One of the most notable improvements concerns the introduction of risk-isolated pools that keep twin-asset markets separate, meaning a single failure doesn’t spark a domino effect – even if a market goes south. V2 also brings a dual-oracle system to the table, splitting loan-to-value (LTV) calculations from liquidation triggers to cut down on bad debt risks. With the latter system, market creators can tweak LTV ratios, liquidation thresholds, and interest models for any ERC-20 asset, giving them more autonomy over loan terms than ever before. And that’s not all: V2 lets anyone spin up a lending market for any ERC-20 token, adjusting settings to fit their needs. A shiny new UI, meanwhile, helps lenders identify the best risk-adjusted yields; though the old-school UI has been retained for those who wish to use it. While Silo V2 meshes seamlessly with other DeFi platforms thanks to the ERC-4626 integration, “Hooks” let users redirect idle liquidity to other protocols for extra yield or even set up fixed-term loans. Unveiling V2 Vaults Perhaps the real cherry on top is the recent launch of Silo Vaults , described as a “liquidity-unifying, yield-optimizing layer” built on ERC-4626 markets. With managed vaults, liquidity can be shuffled between isolated markets to maximize yields for lenders and keep interest rates sweet for borrowers. Third-party managers, for their part, call the tune by whitelisting markets, allocating liquidity, and setting supply caps, charging a performance fee (plus 7% of the $SILO supply based on their contributions to SiloDAO revenues) in exchange for their services. Having recently launched, Silo Vaults will initially have four DeFi vault managers: Re7 Labs, Apostro, Varlamore Capital, and Shorewoods. Because this feature supports any ERC-4626 contract, vaults represent a universal interface for managing DeFi deployments generally. With V2 set to land on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and other EVM-compatible chains following the initial Sonic rollout, more users will soon be able to experience what Silo Finance claims is a serious upgrade on its predecessor.

In a fireside chat with Real Vision’s Raoul Pal, CZ spoke about scaling impact-driven initiatives like AI-generated storybooks for children, now available in 15 languages and reaching over 220,000 kids in just six months. CZ aims to educate up to a billion children for free with Giggle Academy. CZ is Advising Dozens of Country on Crypto Policy CZ’s ambitions extends beyond education. He revealed ongoing advisory roles with over a dozen governments, including the UAE, where his early involvement helped establish Dubai’s crypto regulatory body, VARA . He emphasized that blockchain’s value goes far beyond trading—covering use cases like land rights, digital IDs, and cross-border public services. “The Currency for AI is Crypto” “AI will change everything,” CZ said, highlighting its role in streamlining storybook creation, improving character consistency, and powering more interactive apps. He sees crypto as the natural financial layer for AI agents , which he believes will soon transact autonomously. “The currency for AI is crypto,” he added. Binance co-founder also said that while there were many AI agents with tokens today, most lacked real utility. He expressed a desire to see agents that provided genuine value and practical use, backed by meaningful tokens. He criticized the rise of AI token launchpads where users could create an agent with their own name at the click of a button, calling such tokens useless and claiming that “99.99% of them were useless.” CZ on Global Crypto Regulations On the state of global adoption, CZ noted that Europe is lagging while countries like Bhutan and the U.S. are leading the way with crypto strategic reserves. Talking about India , CZ pointed out high taxes as a blockade for crypto adoption in the country. He called for more mission-driven founders in Web3 and urged entrepreneurs to focus on building real, user-centric applications—not just chasing token hype. Reflecting on Binance’s early days, CZ admitted to underestimating the speed of its growth and the impact that stablecoins were going to have.

The group — a coalition of staking interests, including Kraken, a16z, Lido, Galaxy, Figment, Polychain and Paradigm — argued in a letter to the agency's crypto task force that the logic behind the SEC staff's recent statement that ""proof-of-work"" crypto mining isn't a securities transaction under the agency's jurisdiction, should extend to the practice of staking, pulling it out of the securities bucket. ""Stakers, like PoW miners, are compensated based on protocol-defined outcomes, not managerial actions or profit-sharing arrangements,"" according to the letter reviewed by CoinDesk. When users stake their coins, they agree to have them locked up for a certain period of time to participate in the operation and security of a blockchain, and they earn a return for that. Those who stake their crypto assets on ""proof-of-stake"" blockchain protocols are providing ""valuable technical services,"" and the resulting rewards aren't passive investment gains, the group contends. Read More: Crypto Staking 101: What Is Staking? The CCI view runs counter to the SEC's previous stance, when former Chairman Gary Gensler's enforcement staff targeted crypto staking operations, such as in Kraken's high-profile settlement with the agency as well as other cases, including one involving Consensys . The SEC also blocked staking in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking Ethereum (ETH) as it reviewed applications for those products in 2024. The CCI letter asked the SEC to provide guidance much like it's done for memecoin issuers, the miners and for some stablecoin issuers, declaring that their activities fall outside the agency's legal concern. While those statements aren't binding — not even as formal guidance — they're meant as markers to set the boundaries of the regulator's current thinking. ""Domestically, some states' securities regulators are pursuing enforcement actions relating to staking,"" according to the coalition. ""Guidance from the commission can help send a clear signal that, at least at the federal level, the U.S. is adopting common-sense regulations supportive of innovation and true to the limitations of the securities laws."" Since the start of President Donald Trump's administration, the SEC has generally taken a much more friendly posture toward digital assets. New Chairman Paul Atkins signalled at his first public event on Friday — a crypto roundtable — that he's open to rethinking how the agency has treated crypto businesses. The crypto companies aren't alone in seeking a new direction on staking. In February, U.S. senators sent a letter to the regulator calling for it to reconsider its opposition to staking in the industry's spot ETFs.",Policy|Regulation|Exclusive|Crypto Council for Innovation|U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|Staking|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-30 14:00:00

But while Solana has everyone’s attention, Ruvi AI , a new project that combines AI and blockchain, is quietly rising as a player in the space and offering early investors an opportunity to change their portfolios. Solana Price Outlook and Updates Trading at $148, Solana is getting attention, with bullish patterns like the “cup and handle” hinting at a move to $180. These technicals have everyone hopeful Solana will enter a new growth phase soon. Adding to the hype are the updates from Solana’s “Crossroads 2025” conference in Istanbul. The event showed off scaling infrastructure and new dapps, solidifying Solana’s commitment to the blockchain space. While Solana is evolving, Ruvi AI is emerging as a new contender in the market, introducing new features and offering early adopters an opportunity. Ruvi AI’s Explosive Start and Upcoming Price Increase Ruvi AI got the crypto world’s attention during its presale where 10 million tokens were sold in days, raising $100,000. This fast adoption shows growing demand for projects at the intersection of AI and blockchain. After the successful fundraising, Ruvi AI launched its beta and gave users a first look at predictive analytics and workflow automation. And for early investors, the current price of $0.01 won’t last long. With phase 2 of the presale coming soon, the token price is expected to increase by 50% so get in before the price goes up. VIP Tier 2 Details Ruvi AI’s structured presale incentives provide a rare opportunity to maximize returns. Those investors who accumulate 50,000 tokens qualify for VIP Tier 2, which comes with a 40% bonus, that’s an extra 20,000 tokens for free. At the current price of $0.01 per token, this would cost $500 but the investor will end up with 70,000 tokens total. With Ruvi AI’s listing price set at $0.07, this $500 investment would be worth $4,900 immediately upon listing. But that’s not all. If market projections hold and Ruvi AI’s token reaches $1, this $500 investment would be worth $70,000, a 13,900% ROI. It’s structured incentives like these that make Ruvi AI an attractive option for those looking for high growth in the crypto space. Ruvi AI vs Solana Solana is known for its speed and scalability so it’s a top choice for developers building dapps. Ruvi AI is also focused on efficiency but uses AI to solve real world problems in industries like healthcare and logistics. While Solana’s strength is in its blockchain infrastructure, Ruvi AI stands out by combining AI and blockchain to create tools like fraud detection systems and data driven decision making platforms. Both projects are solving practical problems rather than just relying on market hype but Ruvi AI’s focus on actionable solutions brings a fresh perspective to the growing blockchain space. What’s Next for Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI’s roadmap includes partnerships with businesses, refining its beta, and expanding its AI capabilities. These plans show the project is committed to long term value not short term hype. For early investors, the combination of low token prices, presale bonuses and the upcoming price increase in phase 2 is a clear opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a utility focused project.

Major shifts in traditional finance can significantly influence overall market sentiment and capital flows. A recent analysis from Goldman Sachs highlights one such potential shift: a move by central banks to diversify their substantial holdings of central bank reserves , potentially benefiting Asian currencies . Why Are Central Bank Reserves Shifting? Central bank reserves are a nation’s rainy-day fund, held in various assets, primarily foreign currencies, but also gold and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). Historically, the US Dollar has dominated these reserves globally. However, recent years have seen a growing conversation, and some action, towards currency diversification . Several factors are driving this: Geopolitical Considerations: Events like the freezing of Russia’s foreign reserves have prompted some nations to reconsider their heavy reliance on a single currency or jurisdiction. Search for Yield: In a low-interest-rate environment (though rates are rising now), central banks look for assets that offer better returns. Growing Economic Influence: The increasing economic weight of Asian nations means their currencies are becoming more relevant on the global stage. Trade Patterns: As trade shifts, central banks may want to hold currencies of their major trading partners. This push for diversification means central banks are exploring alternatives to the traditional reserve currencies like the US Dollar and Euro. The Goldman Sachs Analysis: A Boost for Asian Currencies? According to Goldman Sachs analysis , this trend of central banks seeking greater currency diversification is likely to benefit Asian currencies . Their research suggests that while the shift might be gradual, it is a notable development in the world of central bank reserves . Here’s what the Goldman Sachs report generally indicates: Central banks are looking at a wider basket of currencies for their reserve holdings. Emerging market currencies, particularly those in Asia, are becoming more attractive candidates. Factors like economic stability, market liquidity, and the openness of capital accounts play a role in which currencies are chosen. This isn’t necessarily about replacing the US Dollar’s dominance overnight, but rather a reallocation of a portion of these vast reserve holdings, which can still have a significant impact on demand for the target currencies. Which Asian Currencies Stand to Benefit Most? While the Goldman Sachs report would detail specific currencies, the general candidates often include currencies from economies with strong fundamentals and increasing global integration. Think about currencies like: The Chinese Yuan (CNY) The Japanese Yen (JPY) The South Korean Won (KRW) The Indian Rupee (INR) The Singapore Dollar (SGD) The degree to which each currency benefits depends on various factors, including a country’s economic policies, market accessibility, and its central bank’s willingness to see its currency used more widely as a reserve asset. Understanding Reserve Currency Shifts The concept of reserve currency shifts is crucial here. A reserve currency is one held in significant quantities by central banks and international institutions as part of their foreign exchange reserves. This status provides benefits to the issuing country, such as lower borrowing costs and increased global influence. When central banks diversify their reserves, it signals a potential, albeit slow, shift in the global financial power balance. Historically, major reserve currency shifts have occurred over decades, even centuries. The current environment, however, with rapid technological change and evolving geopolitical dynamics, could potentially accelerate these trends, though significant hurdles remain. What Are the Potential Benefits for Asian Economies? If central banks increase their holdings of Asian currencies , it could bring several advantages to the respective economies: Increased Demand: Direct demand for the currency from official institutions. Enhanced Stability: Greater demand can contribute to currency stability. Lower Borrowing Costs: Reserve currency status can make it cheaper for governments and companies in that country to borrow internationally. Greater Global Influence: A currency used more widely in international finance increases a country’s economic and political standing. These benefits are significant, potentially leading to improved economic conditions and greater resilience against external shocks for the countries whose currencies are increasingly held as central bank reserves . Are There Challenges to This Diversification Trend? Yes, absolutely. While the trend towards currency diversification is real, several factors could limit its speed and scope: Market Depth and Liquidity: Some Asian currency markets may not be deep or liquid enough to absorb large-scale reserve holdings without causing significant volatility. Capital Controls: Some Asian economies still maintain capital controls, which can make it difficult for foreign institutions, including central banks, to freely move funds in and out. Rule of Law and Governance: Central banks holding reserves prioritize safety and security, looking for strong legal frameworks and predictable governance. Geopolitical Risks within Asia: Regional tensions could deter central banks from holding certain currencies. These challenges mean that while the direction of travel might be towards diversification and increased holdings of Asian currencies , the path is not entirely smooth and will depend on ongoing developments in these economies. In Conclusion: A Trend to Watch The analysis from Goldman Sachs points to a significant, albeit potentially gradual, shift in how central banks manage their vast holdings of central bank reserves . The move towards greater currency diversification , driven by geopolitical factors and evolving economic landscapes, presents a compelling opportunity for Asian currencies . While traditional reserve currencies will likely maintain their prominence for the foreseeable future, the increasing interest in Asian alternatives signals a subtle but important change in the global financial architecture. Tracking these reserve currency shifts is essential for anyone interested in macroeconomics, forex markets, and understanding the broader context in which digital assets also operate.

Analyst Reveals The Key Drivers,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/what-will-send-dogecoin-soaring-key-drivers/,"Technical analyst Kevin, known on X as @Kev_Capital_TA, highlights what he describes as “a low at the exact level that we were eyeing for the last couple of months.” In a post that accompanied the chart, the chartist pointed to the confluence between the macro 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement—drawn from the 2021 all-time-high to last year’s capitulation low—and a long-running falling resistance line that has acted as support since the depths of the bear market. Spot price touched $0.138 — the numerical location of that 0.382 retracement — before rebounding to the current $0.18 region. Possible Path To $1 For Dogecoin Kevin argues that the higher-time-frame momentum picture is beginning to shift. “The weekly RSI hit the exact level that it has been finding a low on since back in the depths of the bear market yet every time the price gets there we are at higher prices,” he wrote, noting that the relative strength index is carving out successive higher troughs even as price stair-steps upward. At the same time, the one-week Stochastic RSI has already produced a bullish crossover, while a two-week crossover “is pending,” a structure that in previous cycles presaged multi-week rallies in the memecoin. From a risk-reward perspective, Kevin maintains that the asymmetry remains compelling. “Like I was saying weeks ago the risk reward ratio on DOGE was phenomenal as your downside was minimal and the upside was massive,” he said, disclosing that members of his Patreon community took a “sizeable entry at 0.15 cents and have a stop loss set at break even.” In his view, the only missing ingredient is a tail-wind from macroeconomic data: “Positive Macro data is necessary to continue momentum and will expedite the process.” Related Reading: ‘Dogecoin In May And Walk Away,’ Predicts Analyst — What It Means The chart shows a sequence of overhead Fibonacci extension and retracement levels that map out potential resistance zones should the rebound mature into a trend reversal. The first, and closest, is the 50 percent retracement at $0.19039; it coincides with the underside of a broken trend line, making it the next technical gatekeeper. Above that, the 61.8 percent retracement, sitting at roughly $0.26216, marks the golden-ratio threshold that often distinguishes corrective rallies from primary up-trends. A minor cluster at the 65 percent level, visible on Kevin’s chart at $0.28522, represents an intermediate hurdle before price could attack the deeper 78.6 percent retracement around $0.41339—an area that lines up with the early-2022 distribution range. Related Reading: Dogecoin MVRV Returns To This Crucial Level — DOGE Price Up 400% The Last Time Should Dogecoin reclaim that zone, the full 100 percent retracement near $0.73839 would recover the entirety of the prior decline, while a shaded violet band above $1 depicts the extension territory that would formally usher in price discovery. Crucial Factors Kevin’s framework is not confined to the DOGE pair itself. In a separate post he set a short-term target for Bitcoin Dominance (BTC.D) at 65.45 percent, identifying it as “the macro .786 FIB.” He expects that level to impose resistance on the metric, creating a window during which “altcoins [have] the opportunity to catch a bid.” For Dogecoin bulls, any stall in BTC’s share of the crypto market could reroute liquidity toward the meme-asset complex precisely when the technical backdrop is turning constructive. Despite the recent bounce, Kevin stresses that neither Bitcoin nor the broader altcoin basket has entered a parabolic phase comparable to prior cycles. “Never at any point has BTC or altcoins moved into a parabolic stage,” he wrote, attributing the muted slope to “monetary policy and a lack of liquidity which leads to less social risk.” The analyst sees that dynamic changing as “global liquidity starts to rise and monetary policy starts to ease,” although he cautions that the timetable has been stretched by what he calls “the mistakes by central banks and governments during the pandemic and post pandemic.” For now, the memecoin that began as a joke remains tethered to the macro conversation. A base at the 0.382 Fib and a synchronized momentum reset provide a technical springboard, but Kevin’s thesis—and Dogecoin’s path toward the higher Fib targets of $0.26, $0.41 and beyond—ultimately hinges on the broader cycle delivering the liquidity that has been absent so far. At press time, DOGE traded at $0.175.

Price Prediction Heats Up After Trump Teases India Deal,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-a-100k-bitcoin-rally-incoming-price-prediction-heats-up-after-trump-teases-india-deal/,"Bitcoin (BTC) hovered above $94,000 on Tuesday as traders locked in on political cues out of Washington. All eyes were on former President Donald Trump’s evening rally in Macomb County, Michigan, where he hailed his first 100 days in office as “the most successful in history.” While no formal crypto policy emerged, the tone of the event sparked speculation around BTC’s potential role in future U.S. economic strategy. Analysts at Bitfinex emphasized that even indirect references to digital assets could prove meaningful. “If BTC is positioned as part of national infrastructure or reserves, it could validate the asset at an institutional level,” the firm noted. India Deal Talk Lifts Risk Sentiment; Bitcoin Supported? Adding fuel to the bullish outlook is speculation around a U.S.-India trade agreement. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick hinted Tuesday that a deal had been struck with a nation impacted by Trump’s recent reciprocal tariffs. Trump later confirmed India talks were “ going well ,” stoking hopes of a pending announcement. #News India and the US make strides on their Bilateral Trade Agreement with a ""forward most-favoured-nation"" clause to automatically extend favorable terms to the US. This aims to prevent the 26% tariff hike proposed by the US. Read: https://t.co/sKC4SRIA1w @PMOIndia … — Bureaucrats India (@BureaucratsInd) April 30, 2025 This potential breakthrough is seen as a macro tailwind for risk assets, including crypto. According to David Lawant, head of research at FalconX, “Trade policy headlines continue to move markets—and crypto is no exception.” He added that while short-term optimism could boost Bitcoin, longer-term inflation risks from tariffs may also shape investor positioning in the months ahead. Investors are now awaiting Wednesday’s Core PCE Price Index—the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge—to assess whether trade-induced inflation is beginning to impact U.S. consumers. A hot print could delay rate cuts, while a soft reading may strengthen the case for easing. $100K in Sight for Bitcoin? Analysts Outline the Path With the BTC/USD consolidating above $94,000 and risk sentiment turning more optimistic, chatter around a push toward $100,000 is growing louder. Analysts say that if BTC holds above $94,000 and breaks cleanly above the $95,600 resistance zone, the stage could be set for a run toward six figures. Bitcoin Price Chart Source: Tradingview Key Catalysts to Watch: Trump’s pending India trade deal announcement Political narratives linking Bitcoin to U.S. economic strategy Results from the Core PCE inflation report Institutional positioning ahead of the next Fed decision While no single headline will push BTC to $100K, the convergence of geopolitics, macro policy, and on-chain momentum is creating fertile ground. For now, bulls are holding their ground—waiting for the green light to push higher.

The core idea behind this Circle Onafriq partnership is to leverage the efficiency of stablecoins to reduce the friction and cost associated with traditional cross-border money transfers. Onafriq’s massive network, which connects over 500 mobile wallets and facilitates transactions for more than 200 million bank accounts across Africa, provides the perfect infrastructure to test this innovative approach. Think of it this way: Instead of relying solely on traditional banking correspondent networks, which can involve multiple intermediaries and fees, this pilot uses USDC as a bridge currency for settlement between different points in Onafriq’s network. This has the potential to streamline the process dramatically. Why Are Cross-Border Payments in Africa So Expensive? Understanding the problem helps appreciate the solution. Traditional methods for sending money across African borders often involve: Multiple intermediary banks, each adding their own fees. Currency exchange costs and unfavorable rates. Delays in processing, sometimes taking days. Lack of transparency regarding final costs upfront. These factors combine to make sending and receiving money a costly affair, impacting individuals and businesses alike. Reducing the cost of cross-border payments Africa is a critical step towards greater financial inclusion and economic growth on the continent. How Can Stablecoin Settlements Help? This is where the power of stablecoins like USDC comes into play. USDC is a digital dollar, pegged 1:1 with the US dollar, designed for stability. Using stablecoin settlements offers several key advantages for international transactions: Lower Transaction Costs: Moving value via a stablecoin on a blockchain network can be significantly cheaper than traditional wire transfers, especially for smaller amounts. Faster Settlement Times: Transactions on blockchain networks can settle in minutes, not days, providing near real-time value transfer. Increased Transparency: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, offering a degree of transparency not always present in traditional systems. Greater Accessibility: By integrating with existing mobile money and banking networks like Onafriq’s, stablecoins can potentially reach a wider population, including the unbanked or underbanked. The pilot aims to demonstrate these benefits in a real-world setting, proving that stablecoin settlements can offer a viable, cost-effective alternative for cross-border payments Africa . Leveraging Onafriq’s Extensive Network for USDC Payments Africa The success of this pilot hinges significantly on Onafriq’s pre-existing infrastructure. Onafriq isn’t just a small player; they are a dominant force in the African payments landscape. Their network spans over 40 countries, connecting a vast ecosystem of mobile wallets, banks, and agents. This means that the integration of USDC doesn’t require building a payments network from scratch but rather adding a new, efficient settlement layer to an already operational system. By enabling USDC payments Africa within this established network, Circle and Onafriq can potentially facilitate smoother, cheaper transfers directly into mobile wallets or bank accounts, bypassing some of the costly traditional routes. This is a powerful combination of innovative technology (USDC) and established distribution (Onafriq). What Does This Mean for Africa Crypto Adoption? Initiatives like the Circle Onafriq partnership are crucial drivers of Africa crypto adoption . When cryptocurrency technology, specifically stablecoins, is used to solve real-world problems like high payment costs, it demonstrates practical utility beyond speculation. This pilot could serve as a tangible example of how digital currencies can improve financial services for everyday users and businesses across the continent. Increased use cases for stablecoins in remittances, trade finance, and local payments can accelerate the broader acceptance and understanding of digital assets, contributing significantly to overall Africa crypto adoption trends. Potential Challenges Ahead While the potential benefits are clear, implementing such a system across multiple countries in Africa comes with challenges: Regulatory Clarity: Navigating the diverse and evolving regulatory landscapes in over 40 countries requires significant effort and compliance. User Education: While users interact with Onafriq’s familiar interface, understanding the underlying technology and its implications might require education. Technical Integration: Ensuring seamless and secure integration between Circle’s systems and Onafriq’s complex network is crucial. Market Perception: Despite being stable, USDC is still associated with the broader crypto market, which can be perceived as volatile or risky by some users and regulators. Overcoming these hurdles will be key to the pilot’s success and potential wider rollout. Looking Ahead: The Future of Payments in Africa If this pilot proves successful in significantly reducing costs and improving efficiency, it could pave the way for wider adoption of USDC payments Africa for various use cases, including: Personal remittances from abroad. Payments for goods and services between African countries. Facilitating cross-border trade for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Providing access to stable value storage in economies facing currency volatility. This initiative represents a significant step towards leveraging digital currencies to build a more connected, efficient, and inclusive financial ecosystem across the African continent. Conclusion The pilot program launched by Circle and Onafriq to utilize USDC for cross-border settlements in over 40 African nations is a compelling development. By targeting the high costs and inefficiencies plaguing traditional payment systems, the Circle Onafriq partnership has the potential to make a tangible positive impact on millions of users. Leveraging Onafriq’s extensive network, the pilot aims to demonstrate the power of stablecoin settlements in providing faster, cheaper, and more transparent transactions. This initiative is not just about payments; it’s a significant push forward for Africa crypto adoption , showcasing how digital assets can offer practical solutions to real-world financial challenges and help reduce the burden of expensive cross-border payments Africa .

The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the number the Fed watches closest, was flat last month compared to February. Stripping out food and energy, core PCE also didn’t move. It was the softest reading since 2019. Consumer spending, however, didn’t slow down. Inflation-adjusted outlays jumped 0.7% in March, with February’s number bumping higher too. That means people were spending hard—most likely trying to stock up before the latest wave of Donald Trump’s tariffs take hold and raise costs on almost everything. Consumers spend ahead of tariffs as GDP contracts The March report wrapped up a shaky quarter. The US economy shrank by 0.3% in the first three months of 2025—the first contraction since the beginning of 2022. The shrink came off a massive spike in imports, which many companies rushed in before the tariffs fully kicked in. Meanwhile, core PCE inflation jumped to a 3.5% annual rate in Q1, the highest pace in over a year, meaning prices were already running hot before March’s pause. Wall Street didn’t love the news. The S&P 500 stayed red. Treasury yields bounced. The dollar was all over the place. Everything pointed to traders trying to figure out what the hell comes next. As all of this dropped, President Donald Trump went straight to Truth Social to try and rewrite the story. “This is [Joe] Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s. I didn’t take over until January 20th,” Trump posted. Minutes after the Department of Commerce released the GDP data, he was already throwing blame around. He kept going. “Tariffs will soon start kicking in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden ‘Overhang,’” Trump wrote. He added: “This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!” The numbers disagree. The 3.6% jump in PCE inflation across the full quarter is way up from the 2.4% gain in Q4 of 2024. Trump might say the boom is coming, but right now, the data looks ugly. The March pause in inflation is just a slice of the quarter—and the rest of it was still burning hot. Hiring slows, market stumbles, Trump tries to redirect Things got worse Wednesday morning when ADP published April’s private payrolls report. Hiring was weak, with just 62,000 new jobs when Wall Street expected 120,000. It was the smallest payroll gain since July 2024 and a sharp drop from March’s already-soft 147,000, which got revised down. Investors bailed. Markets opened down and stayed there. Corporate earnings didn’t help either. The whole thing hit just hours before Trump was scheduled to host over two dozen business executives at the White House. Still, Trump keeps pumping the brakes on blame. During a Tuesday night speech marking his 100th day back in office, he claimed, “Prices are coming way down,” and said, “That’s what I’ve done.” The report that came out less than 24 hours later said the opposite. Inflation didn’t fall. It rose sharply. The Federal Reserve’s metric climbed to 3.6%, not dropped. That’s just math. Meanwhile, a bunch of economists are pointing to Trump’s tariff policy as the reason confidence is falling apart. Companies are holding back. Consumers are scared prices will jump again. And job growth is slowing because nobody wants to take risks under unclear trade rules. Trump’s way of dealing with the mess is to deny it. But that’s not new. Back when the market was flying in 2023 and early 2024—under Joe Biden—Trump was already taking credit. On January 29, 2024, he wrote: “THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET BECAUSE MY POLLS AGAINST BIDEN ARE SO GOOD THAT INVESTORS ARE PROJECTING THAT I WILL WIN.” Now he’s president again. The market’s falling. The economy is shrinking. Inflation’s running hot. But somehow, it’s still Biden’s fault. Trump wants credit when things look good. He disappears from the blame list when things look bad. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

Sound futuristic? It’s already a reality. In traditional finance (TradFi), algorithms handle nearly 70% of U.S. stock trades . Now, artificial intelligence (AI) agents are stepping up. These aren't just basic bots but innovative systems that learn, adapt and make real-time decisions. VanEck predicts the number of AI agents will skyrocket from 10,000 to over a million by the end of 2025. What this means for you AI agents are already at work behind the scenes analyzing market trends, balancing portfolios and even managing liquidity across decentralized exchange platforms like SaucerSwap and Uniswap. They're blurring the lines between TradFi and decentralized finance (DeFi), with cross-chain transactions expected to jump 20% in 2025 . Can we really trust AI with our money? Autonomous finance isn’t new, but today’s AI agents operate with increased autonomy and sophistication. So, can we trust these agents to manage billions in digital assets? What safeguards exist when decisions come from algorithms, not humans? Who would be held responsible for market manipulation performed by an agent? These concerns are valid. As AI agents take on more responsibility, and especially as the convergence between crypto and TradFi accelerates, worries around transparency and market manipulation will grow. For example, some blockchains enable front running trades and sandwich attacks that can exploit blockchain consensus in a process known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) . These transaction strategies harm fairness and market trust. Operating at machine speed, AI agents could supercharge these risks. Enter DLT: the trust layer we need Trust is key, and distributed ledger technology (DLT) offers a solution. DLT provides real-time transparency, immutability and decentralized consensus, ensuring decisions are trackable and auditable. The Identity Management Institute reported companies that integrated blockchain identity systems have already cut fraud by 40% and identity theft by 50%. Applying these guardrails to AI-driven finance can counter manipulation and promote fairness. Moreover, the use of DLTs with fair ordering is growing rapidly, ensuring transactions are sequenced fairly and unpredictably, addressing MEV concerns and promoting trust in decentralized systems. DeFAI: where finance is headed A blockchain-powered, trust-centric model could unlock a new paradigm, “DeFAI”, in which autonomous agents can operate freely without sacrificing oversight. Open-source protocols like ElizaOS , which have blockchain plugins , are already enabling secure and compliant AI interactions between agents across DeFi ecosystems. Bottom line: trust will define the future of AI As AI agents take on more complex roles, verifiable trust becomes non-negotiable. Verifiable compute solutions are already being built by firms like EQTY Lab, Intel and Nvidia to anchor trust on-chain. DLT ensures transparency, accountability and traceability. This is already in motion; on-chain agents are now operating that offer services ranging from trade execution to predictive analytics. We can trust AI when we have trust in the model input and output. The question now isn’t if institutions will adopt autonomous finance, but whether frameworks can evolve fast enough. For this revolution to thrive, trust must be embedded into the foundation of the system.",CoinDesk Indices|Portfolio management|AI|Artificial Intelligence|Trading|Crypto Long & Short|CoinDesk Indices|Opinion|Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-30 15:29:07
43991122,https://crypto.news/?p=14374732,1746027000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/43991122.jpeg,New report suggests over half of the U.S. millennials own crypto. What else did we learn?,https://crypto.news/over-half-of-the-u-s-millennials-own-crypto/,"CouponFollow website released its new study called “Millennial Shopping Habits.” The study is based on a survey in which over 1,185 Americans between the ages of 29 and 44 shared their shopping habits with researchers. The report has a cryptocurrency section. For instance, it reveals that 53% of the U.S. millennials (45% of women and 66% of men) now own crypto. What are other insights? The survey was held in February 2025. 60% of respondents were women, the rest were men. The study compares the gathered data with respective data from 2022 and 2019 to indicate trends and shifts in the shopping behavior of millennials. It’s worth noting that CouponFollow doesn’t compare the 2025 data on crypto use to any respective data from the past. What does the report reveal? According to “Millennial Shopping Habits: Trend Report 2025,” AI and cryptocurrencies are increasingly in use among millennials. While AI is used for assistance in online shopping, cryptocurrencies are used both as a means of payment and as a savings currency or investment. Nearly the same share of millennials are using AI for shopping (54%) and cryptocurrencies (53%). 53% of surveyed millennials own digital money, while 7% haven’t even heard about crypto. The rest (39%) are aware of the existence of cryptocurrencies but don’t own any. Over 55% of millennials below 40 are crypto owners. Only 45% of millennials between the ages of 39 and 44 own crypto, while nearly every tenth of them doesn’t know what cryptocurrency is. Gender-wise, male millennials are generally more active in crypto. 66% of male respondents and only 45% of female respondents own crypto. 30% of men are aware of crypto but don’t own any. For women, this number is 45%. As for men and women totally unaware of cryptocurrencies, the numbers are 4% and 10% respectively. Read more: Gender imbalance and wage gap in the crypto sector Another interesting finding is the way millennials spend crypto. 8% of all surveyed millennials (including those who don’t own crypto or are even unaware of its existence) use crypto as a means of payment “whenever possible.” Considering that only 53% of millennials own crypto, this means that around 15% of crypto owners aged 29-44 use crypto as a payment method whenever possible. Around 20% of millennials owning crypto never use it for shopping (11% of all respondents). Nearly two-thirds (64%) of millennial crypto owners use crypto to pay for goods and services from time to time. As for the purchase volume made via crypto, the study reveals that 62% of millennial crypto owners made between one and five retail purchases via crypto within 12 months. Only 4% of crypto owners made over 10 purchases with crypto last year. As the report indicates, 42% of all respondents admitted to purchasing something, paying in crypto. At the same time, one in five American millennials made over six purchases last year, indicating the growing crypto adoption rate. Apart from crypto Apart from findings on the way millennials interact with crypto as retail buyers, the report indicates various curious facts and statistics. For instance, it suggests that discounts starting at 20% may be a good reason for over half of millennials to change the brand. More than that, millennials increasingly (if compared to a 2022 study) prefer free shipping, free trials, and gifts as a form of discount. Another interesting finding is that in 2025, millennials browse and buy goods in-store more often than in 2022 and 2019. However, online shopping is still leading for this generation. The use of computers for online shopping is declining. As for browsing goods on Amazon, millennials increasingly choose goods based on Amazon’s recommendations and top search results. Finally, the report reveals that women rely on TikTok more often than men while looking for shopping recommendations. Millennials in crypto, according to other reports So far, millennials have been the crucial generation for crypto adoption. According to a survey conducted by Bankrate back in 2021, millennials are the main driving force of crypto adoption, as they are more confident in investing in crypto than average Americans of other ages. On top of that, many cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and groundbreaking developers are coming from Gen Y. The Statista report confirms that millennials are by far the most cryptocurrency-integrated generation so far. Statista’s findings are based on the data gathered from several countries in North and South America and Europe. A study conducted by CryptoQuant earlier in 2025 points to a different age group as the core group of crypto users and inventors. Instead of laying emphasis on millennials, CryptoQuant reveals that the core age group for crypto adoption is the people aged 25–34 years, the youngest millennials, and the oldest members of Gen Z. They make up 35% of all crypto investors and users.

For years, retail and institutional investors have targeted beta exposure , or returns that mirror the broader crypto market. However, the introduction of products like bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and exchange-traded products (ETPs ) have made achieving beta more accessible, with these products drawing over $100 billion in institutional capital. But as the asset class matures, the conversation is shifting. More institutions are now pursuing alpha, or returns that exceed the market, through actively managed strategies. The role of uncorrelated returns in diversification Low correlation to traditional assets enhances the role of digital assets in diversified portfolios. Since 2015, bitcoin’s daily correlation to the Russell 1000 Index has been just 0.231 , meaning that bitcoin's daily returns move only weakly in the same direction as the Russell 1000 Index, with gold and emerging markets remaining similarly low . A modest 5% allocation to bitcoin in a 60/40 portfolio, a portfolio containing 60% equities and 40% fixed income, has been shown to boost the Sharpe ratio (the measure of risk-adjusted return on a portfolio) from 1.03 to 1.43 . Even within crypto itself, varying correlations allow for intra-asset diversification. This makes digital assets a powerful tool for risk-adjusted return enhancement [see exhibit 1]. Digital assets enter the active era Just as hedge funds and private equity redefined traditional markets, digital assets are now evolving beyond index-style investing. In traditional finance, active management represents over 60% of global assets . With informational asymmetries, fragmented infrastructure and inconsistent pricing, digital assets present a compelling landscape for alpha generation . This transition mirrors the early stages of the alternatives industry, when hedge funds and private equity capitalized on inefficiencies long before these strategies were adopted by the mainstream. Market inefficiencies Crypto markets remain volatile and structurally inefficient. Though bitcoin’s annualized volatility fell below 40% in 2024, it remains more than twice that of the S&P 500. Pricing inconsistencies across exchanges, regulatory fragmentation and the dominance of retail behavior create significant opportunities for active managers. These inefficiencies — combined with limited competition in institutional-grade alpha strategies — present a compelling case for specialized investment approaches. Arbitrage strategies: Utilization of trading strategies such as cash and carry, which captures spreads between spot and futures prices, or basis trading, which involves entering long positions in discounted assets and shorts in premium ones, enables alpha generation by utilizing market inefficiencies within the digital assets market. Market making strategies: Market makers earn returns by placing bid/ask quotes to capture spread. Success relies on managing risks like inventory exposure and slippage, especially in fragmented or volatile markets. Yield farming: Yield farming taps into Layer 2 scaling solutions, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms and cross-chain bridges. Investors can earn yields through lending protocols or by providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs), often earning both trading fees and token incentives. Volatility arbitrage strategy: This strategy targets the gap between implied and realized volatility in crypto options markets, offering market-neutral alpha through advanced forecasting and risk management. High upside and an expanding universe Meanwhile, new opportunities continue to emerge. Tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) are projected to exceed $10.9 trillion by 2030 , while DeFi protocols, which have amassed 17,000 unique tokens and business models while accumulating $108 billion+ in assets, are expected to surpass $500 billion in value by 2027. All of this points towards an ever expanding, ever developing digital asset ecosystem that is ideal for investors to utilize as a legitimate alpha generating medium. Bitcoin's price has surged over the years, while its long-term realized volatility has steadily declined, signaling a maturing market.",CoinDesk Indices|DeFi|Portfolio management|Institutional Investment|Crypto Long & Short|CoinDesk Indices|Opinion|Opinion,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-30 15:30:31

Lock your tokens, help secure the network, and earn steady rewards. In theory, it sounded like a simple way to grow wealth. But in reality, staking comes with long lock-up periods, complex requirements, and limited control over your assets. Now, Bitcoin Solaris is offering something much more accessible — and potentially much more rewarding: mobile mining designed for everyday users. Bitcoin Solaris breaks away from the limitations of traditional staking by letting anyone mine BTC-S tokens directly from their phone, without needing expensive hardware or lengthy technical setup. Through the Solaris Nova App, daily rewards are just a few taps away. This platform is built for scale, speed, and everyday access — something Ethereum staking simply can’t match. Mining That Fits Everyday Life Traditional mining operations have always favored those with resources to spare — huge rigs, low electricity costs, and technical expertise. Bitcoin Solaris levels the playing field by using Solana’s ultra-efficient blockchain infrastructure, making it possible to mine daily rewards without draining your device or hiking your energy bills. Mining on Bitcoin Solaris requires no specialized equipment, no big upfront costs, and no complicated onboarding. The Solaris Nova App is lightweight, energy-efficient, and designed for real-world usability. Anyone with a smartphone can participate, turning idle time into daily mining rewards.

The digital money has failed to breach the point of resistance at this level since last Friday, market data revealed. Still, despite this strain, a very impressive 91% of entire supply of Bitcoins are in the black, reflecting what market strategists describe as the “euphoria phase” of market activity. Related Reading: XRP Headed For $1,000 – CryptoGuard Exec Drops Bold Prediction Profits Soar As Market Rebounds The strong percentage of profitable Bitcoin holdings is during a recent market recovery, according to data from analytics firm CryptoQuant. Technical expert Darkfost notes that when Bitcoin supply in profit is over 90%, it generally represents the last phase of a bull market. This phase usually sees large price rises before any correction takes place. During recent price drops, the supply in profit nearly fell to 75%, a level that analysts believe could have triggered widespread selling if breached. Market Pressure Eases On Holders The current context provides room to breathe for Bitcoin holders. Since the majority of holdings are in profit, investors are less pressed to offload their coins during times of market uncertainty. This diminished pressure might assist in sustaining Bitcoin’s price stability near the $95,000 level and gaining steam for future upside potential. As per various experts, this period of diminished selling pressure tends to lead to significant price action in cryptocurrency markets. Analysts Project Possible $250,000 Bitcoin Some institutions have made some high-profile Bitcoin price predictions. Standard Chartered is predicting that the cryptocurrency will hit $120,000 by the second quarter of 2025. Other market analysts have predicted higher prices, in the range of $200,000 to $250,000, before the year’s end. These are some of the predictions as Bitcoin traded at $94,900, just below the psychological $95,000 mark that has been challenging to crack. History Indicates Caution Following Euphoria Although the market mood is positive today, CryptoQuant cautions that history indicates a pattern of corrections after these euphoria periods. Historical data from past Bitcoin bull cycles suggest that after such periods of high profitability, corresponding massive price declines usually ensued. Related Reading: Only XRP? Expert Claims That’s All You Need To Succeed In previous cycles, the proportion of Bitcoin supply in profit has dropped to approximately 50% at these times of correction – a characteristic of bear market situations. The euphoria phase is not permanent, with CryptoQuant CEO Ki Youn Ju intimating such periods usually last from three to 12 months before the corrective action sets in. The ongoing Bitcoin cycle has witnessed consistent growth over the past few months, driving the percentage of profitable holdings to levels that indicate both opportunity and caution. As investors observe the $95,000 resistance level, many are asking whether history will repeat itself in another spectacular price spike before an eventual correction. With 91% of Bitcoin currently in profit, the market is at a critical point that will challenge both bullish forecasts and historical trends in the coming months.

In a keynote speech at Token2049 in Dubai, Hayes said that the United States government will need to increase dollar liquidity, and this will help propel Bitcoin to as high as $1,000,000 in three years. Bitcoin’s Route To $1 Million Maelstrom CIO Arthur Hayes has shared a bullish view of the crypto market. “It’s time to go long everything,” he said in his keynote speech, referring to both crypto assets and equities. To defend his outlook, Hayes cited his frequently repeated statement that the U.S. will have to embark on quantitative easing and print more money, a move he thinks will prop up crypto prices. The Bitcoin OG compared the present state of the market to the third quarter of 2022. He pointed out that there were various reasons to be rattled by the state of the market back then, like the central bank raising interest rates. In the cryptosphere, it was just before the implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s empire. Yet, the U.S. intervened and injected $2.5 trillion into the economy through its repo program. Similarly, there are concerns in the present market after U.S. President Donald Trump unleashed sweeping tariffs, which have roiled global markets in recent weeks. The initial announcement triggered a crypto market downturn, though prices rebounded shortly afterward after Trump said he would allow a 90-day pause on the implementation of reciprocal tariffs against most countries. According to Hayes, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, is not a fan of Trump and is thus unlikely to intervene to help fix the markets. But, he argued that even if the banking system won’t directly finance the repair, value hedge funds would do it via Treasury buybacks. The BitMEX co-founder believes these hedge funds could boost liquidity by purchasing more debt. “Don’t worry, Bitcoin is going to $1 million by 2028,” Hayes posited. Don’t worry, Bitcoin is going to $1 million by 2028,” The world’s oldest and largest cryptocurrency was trading hands around $95,080, up 0.1% over the past 24 hours, according to crypto data provider CoinGecko. While $1 million seems like a stretch from the asset’s current price, other prominent players in the industry have voiced similar ultra-bullish outlooks.

Dive into the article to uncover the names ready to shine. JasmyCoin Market Dynamics: Strong Monthly Surge vs. Half-Year Adjustment JASMY 's strong monthly performance saw a 52.86% increase coupled with an 11.16% surge over the past week while the six-month period recorded a 4.75% decline. Price volatility alternated between pronounced upswings and modest pullbacks, indicating shifting market activity over time. Historical moves have built a picture of dynamic price action with intensity in short-term gains contrasted by a longer-term correction. Current prices trade between $0.007 and $0.0175 with resistance around $0.0244 and a later barrier at $0.0349. Support holds near $0.00335. RSI reads 59.64, suggesting mild bullish lean while the overall trend remains unclear. Trading within these levels offers opportunities for buyers on breaks above resistance or cautious entries near support. VeChain Set for a Bullish Breakout Amid Key Levels VET steady gains marked recent price actions with a nearly 20% monthly climb and a 22% surge over six months. The weekly uptick of about 1.5% reflects modest movement within a broader upward trend that has gradually built strength. Price performance points to an expanding interest over the past period, with consolidation phases supporting further gains and a notable buildup in market activity. Current trading sees VeChain oscillating within the $0.0179 to $0.0310 zone. Key resistance tests at $0.0389 and $0.0519 will be critical, while support holds near $0.0128. A near-neutral RSI near 58 suggests bulls are edging ahead, with traders advised to consider short-term entries below resistance for possible breakouts and sustained upward momentum. Kaspa Volatility: Monthly Surge Higher Amid Long-Term Setbacks Kaspa recorded a noteworthy 41.91% increase over one month, contrasting with a 20.08% drop over six months and a recent weekly decline of 7.46%. Price action over these periods has been uneven, reflecting a mix of strong short-term gains and persistent long-term headwinds. Past movements indicate renewed interest despite significant corrections in overall performance, highlighting a volatile environment. Current trading sees Kaspa moving between $0.0485 and $0.0875. The price faces resistance around $0.11 and a further barrier at $0.15, with support near $0.03. Indicators point to moderate bullish sentiment, though uncertainty remains. Trading decisions could involve careful entry near support and monitoring for a decisive break above resistance for further upward movement. Conclusion The potential for low-priced cryptos to gain value increases with Bitcoin 's next movement. Coins such as JASMY , VET , and KAS show promise in this environment. These assets have demonstrated strong foundations and are well-positioned for growth. Monitoring Bitcoin's trends could provide insight into their future performances. The market's next phase may reveal significant advancements for these currencies. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Adopt Bitcoin Or Face Obsolescence Eric Trump has launched a scathing attack on traditional finance, predicting that banks across the globe must embrace crypto or face extinction within a decade. “The modern financial system is broken, it’s slow, it’s expensive,” Eric quipped during a Wednesday interview with CNBC in Dubai. He claimed that the current traditional banking system only favors the “ultra-wealthy” and is weaponized against the vast majority of people in the U.S., either because they aren’t rich or supported his father in last November’s presidential election. “It forced me into the crypto world,” he added: “And I’m telling you, if the banks don’t watch what’s coming, they’re going to be extinct in 10 years.” While stressing the need for banks to monitor developments in the crypto sector, Eric mentioned the benefits of cryptocurrency’s underlying blockchain technology to the financial system. He slammed the current international transaction solutions, like SWIFT, for their slow and expensive transactions — a criticism shared by many, especially crypto enthusiasts. “There’s nothing that can be done on blockchain that can’t be done better than the way that the current financial institutions are working. SWIFT is an absolute disaster,” the entrepreneur postulated. Traditional payment systems like SWIFT are at risk of losing market share to decentralized alternatives as crypto booms, he noted: “You can open up a DeFi [decentralized finance] app right now, you can open up any cryptocurrency app, and you can send money, wallet to wallet, instantaneously, without the expense, without the variability.” Earlier this month, Eric told CNBC that the Trump Organization was drawn to crypto after being “debanked” by multiple financial groups, particularly during the Biden-Harris Administration. “It actually is what drove us toward cryptocurrency,” he said at the time. Trump Family Bets Big On Crypto A vocal advocate of digital currencies, the second son of President Trump, in December predicted that Bitcoin was headed to the $1 million milestone while attending the Bitcoin MENA 2024 conference in Abu Dhabi. Eric Trump also backs World Liberty Financial , a decentralized finance project and planned blockchain-based marketplace where users can borrow and lend crypto assets, create liquidity pools, and trade stablecoins. In March, World Liberty Financial announced plans to launch its own stablecoin, USD1 , with BitGo providing custody services.

During a wide-ranging fireside chat with Raoul Pal at the Token2049 conference in Dubai, held on April 30, CZ gave advice on countries seeking his guidance on handling crypto. He also reiterated his call for creating AI agents with real utility and said that crypto will become the go-to currency in the AI-driven economy. According to CZ, countries approaching him typically want to keep crypto infrastructure localized, from wallets to custody and order books. However, CZ says that this is not optimal because setting up secure custody solutions to manage billions of dollars “requires a lot of funds and expertise, which is lacking.” CZ explained that establishing localized solutions for every country is impractical. “For each cold wallet, you need about 15 signers,” he said. “You can’t find 15 signers that are not public, that are extremely trustworthy in different parts of the world, in different geographies. They’re not incentivized by more money. They have a steady job, they’re high income, they have a nice family. You just can’t find a hundred times more of those 15 people.” The same goes for order books, exchanges and other nodes in the crypto ecosystem. “If you divide each country with their own order book, liquidity is going to suck,” CZ reiterated. During extreme volatility, localized exchanges, wallets or order books may see even wilder swings given that many will invariably handle less volume.

Bhutan , led by a forward-thinking king, has surplus clean energy and has been using it to mine Bitcoin, making the country an early and smart adopter of crypto for national wealth and sustainability. As for countries that are yet to jump on the crypto reserve bandwagon, CZ said that they should act sooner, because they may have to buy at much higher prices later. He recommends that governments starting with modest allocations use professional custody solutions and move to more secure cold storage as their holdings scale. You might also like: News Changpeng Zhao calls for AI agents to focus on utility instead of launching tokens Another key takeaway from CZ’s talk was his call to redirect focus toward building AI agents with real utility rather than flooding the market with useless AI tokens, a sentiment he has expressed in the past. “Today there are so many different AI agents with a token, but the agents don’t have any real utility,” he said. “I want to see real agents that can actually help you — with tokens that serve a purpose.” He criticized the rise of AI token launchpads that let anyone mint a token-backed AI agent with the click of a button. “That token is useless — 99.99% of them are useless,” he said. However, CZ believes that “it’s all going to change,” with AI poised to radically transform how people engage with the blockchain ecosystem thereby driving crypto adoption. “The currency for AI is crypto,” he said, arguing that traditional payment methods won’t work in the AI economy. “AI is not going to swipe a card or get an SMS code. That doesn’t work for AI. It’s going to be crypto.” You might also like: Binance founder Changpeng Zhao sparks debate over UAE’s alleged $40b Bitcoin holdings",News|Binance|Changpeng Zhao,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|EXCHANGE|MARKET|BNB,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-04-30 15:38:01

Roswell, New Mexico, famous for a UFO incident alleged to have occurred near the city in 1947, has become the first city in the United States to establish a Bitcoin ( BTC ) reserve. The news was first broken by pseudonymous cryptocurrency YouTuber Crypto Rover in an April 30 X post . 💥BREAKING: CITY OF ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO SETS UP STRATEGIC #BITCOIN RESERVE AS FIRST CITY! pic.twitter.com/D6r06vBaLx — Crypto Rover (@rovercrc) April 30, 2025 Per the shared document, the Roswell Strategic Bitcoin Reserve has received a “first seed” donation of 0.3050233 BTC, worth roughly $2,906 at the time of receipt. How the Roswell Bitcoin reserves will be used The UFO capital’s intention is for the reserves to hold funds for no less than 10 years, after which the proceeds can be used to alleviate a percentage, up to 100%, of the water bills of all the senior citizens in Roswell. In addition, after the value of the reserves surpasses $1 million, the Bitcoin holdings can be used as a “liquid emergency fund”. To be more precise, up to 21% of the value of the reserves can be used every five years for disaster relief — but only with the unanimous approval of the Roswell City Council. While 2025 hasn’t been a great year for BTC returns thus far, the leading cryptocurrency has show signs of resilience, and has recently exhibited price action that does not correlate with the stock market . Moreover, as the Roswell Bitcoin reserves will be funded exclusively from donations and sponsorships, the city is not exposing itself to any financial risk from the cryptocurrency’s volatility.

43991485,https://coinpedia.org/?p=449416,1746027769,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png,Top 3 Cryptos to Watch in Early May: MUTM Gains Traction Against ADA and XRP,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/top-3-cryptos-to-watch-in-early-may-mutm-gains-traction-against-ada-and-xrp/,"The post Top 3 Cryptos to Watch in Early May: MUTM Gains Traction Against ADA and XRP appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The start of May often brings renewed activity in the cryptocurrency market, and this year is no exception. As major players like Cardano (ADA) and Ripple (XRP) continue to maintain strong communities and high liquidity, new contenders are beginning to carve out their space. Among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly standing out — and early signs suggest it could be the project to watch most closely in the weeks ahead. ADA and XRP Cardano has long been praised for its research-driven development and methodical approach to blockchain innovation. ADA captured massive attention in previous market cycles, delivering impressive returns to early investors. However, as the platform matures and competition intensifies, its growth trajectory has naturally slowed. Price movements are becoming more tied to broader crypto prices and broader market dynamics rather than explosive individual adoption, leading many investors to look elsewhere for faster upside. XRP, on the other hand, has maintained a strong presence in the cross-border payments sector. Ripple’s ongoing expansion into new financial corridors and regulatory clarity efforts have kept XRP relevant. Yet, despite its strong position, XRP’s current price action reflects a more measured path, focused on steady institutional adoption rather than sharp speculative rallies. Both ADA and XRP continue to offer value for longer-term strategies, but for those seeking faster, high-upside opportunities in the immediate term, attention is shifting toward newer projects offering the next big crypto possibilities. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Is the Standout for Early May Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has quickly built momentum during its presale, raising over $7.3 million from a growing community of more than 9,200 holders. With over 431 million tokens sold, it’s clear that market interest is heating up — and the timing could not be better for early participants seeking the best crypto to invest in right now. Currently priced at just $0.025, MUTM is on the verge of a 20% price increase as Phase 4 of the presale nears completion. The next phase will raise the token price to $0.03, offering early buyers a narrow window to secure a position before broader awareness and exchange listings push prices even higher. For those asking what crypto to buy now or looking for the best cheap crypto to buy now, Mutuum Finance offers an attractive setup. Unlike many new crypto coins entering the market, Mutuum’s appeal isn’t just based on presale momentum. The platform introduces a dual-model lending system — peer-to-contract (P2C) for stable, blue-chip assets and peer-to-peer (P2P) for more speculative tokens. This structure creates a highly flexible, capital-efficient DeFi environment where both lenders and borrowers benefit from dynamic opportunities. On top of this, Mutuum is building its own overcollateralized stablecoin system. Instead of depending on third-party stablecoins, users mint stable assets directly through Mutuum’s protocol, ensuring the platform’s value remains self-contained and resilient against outside volatility. For anyone following crypto predictions or studying crypto investing strategies, this model adds a vital layer of strength compared to other platforms relying heavily on external liquidity. Passive income opportunities through mtTokens — which automatically grow in value as interest accumulates — further add to Mutuum’s appeal. This is a major advantage for investors seeking the best cryptocurrency to invest today with real, built-in yield generation potential. The combination of Mutuum’s low entry price, the upcoming presale price increase, and the platform’s real DeFi utilities has fueled growing excitement among investors. Early participants are already securing their positions before the expected 20% surge, with the next phase moving the price to $0.03 — an event that could trigger a fresh wave of buying activity and drive attention on crypto charts. In a market where timing is often critical, Mutuum Finance offers a rare setup: a powerful DeFi model, real passive income streams, expanding community interest, and a clear upcoming price catalyst. For those looking into what cryptocurrency to invest in for both short-term gains and long-term growth, MUTM stands out as one of the most promising options available. As May kicks off, while ADA and XRP continue along their established paths, MUTM is capturing the attention of investors searching for early-stage altcoins with breakout potential. Whether you’re wondering what is the best cryptocurrency to invest in or simply seeking the next crypto to explode, Mutuum Finance deserves serious attention. For investors serious about crypto investment growth and seeking top cryptocurrencies to watch, MUTM could be the new crypto project that defines early May’s success stories.

Now, Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) is stepping in with a bold vision, combining Bitcoin’s security with Solana’s blazing speed. With a live presale, rising buzz from influencers, and a fast-moving 5-year plan, BTC-S could turn a $1,000 investment into a life-changing opportunity. This isn’t just another crypto—it might be the breakout star of the decade. Ethereum Changed Crypto — But It’s No Longer Enough Ethereum pioneered DeFi and decentralized applications, but many users have been stuck with slow speeds, expensive transactions, and technical limitations: High gas fees during peak usage Delays in completing the transition to Ethereum 2.0 Complex user interfaces and confusing staking models Scaling solutions that require third-party layers These issues have left investors searching for a blockchain that can deliver Ethereum-level utility, but with the performance and accessibility that modern users demand. That’s where Bitcoin Solaris shines. Bitcoin Solaris: Fast, Audited, and Built for Real-World Use Bitcoin Solaris is redefining what a blockchain should be. Unlike other projects that rely solely on a single protocol, Bitcoin Solaris runs on a dual-layer blockchain: Base Layer (Proof-of-Work): Handles security and transaction validation, just like Bitcoin Solaris Layer (Delegated Proof-of-Stake): Powers high-speed smart contracts, DApps, and staking Together, this hybrid model delivers: 10,000+ transactions per second 2-second finality 99.95% less energy use than traditional mining Audited smart contracts , securing all critical code from day one Smartphone-compatible mining via the Solaris Nova App It’s not just a coin— it’s a performance engine built for everyday users. The 5-Year Roadmap: What Makes It Different While Ethereum’s roadmap spans over a decade with ongoing delays, Bitcoin Solaris has laid out a clear 5-year plan — and it’s already being executed. Here’s what sets the roadmap apart: 2025: Token generation, smart contract deployment, and mobile mining app release 2026: Testnet and mainnet launches, DEX partnerships, and exchange listings 2027: Layer-2 scaling, quantum resistance, and institutional-grade security 2028: Real-world business adoption and hardware wallet support Beyond: Government and enterprise partnerships, blockchain education programs, and research labs This isn’t vague planning — these milestones are strategically designed to deliver constant value to investors, from community mining access to institutional partnerships. Mining for the Masses, Not Just the Tech Elite One of Bitcoin Solaris’s most innovative features is its universal mining model. Through the Solaris Nova App, anyone — from students to seasoned investors — can mine BTC-S on devices they already use. Smartphones: Low energy usage and smart optimization for extended battery life Laptops and PCs: Balanced load that doesn’t interfere with daily use Mining Rigs: Fully optimized for high-performance setups There are no technical barriers, no expensive hardware requirements, and no learning curve. Just open the app and start earning BTC-S. Presale Live: The Final Chance for Early Entry Bitcoin Solaris has officially launched Presale Phase 1, and early buyers are securing their positions quickly: Current Price: $1.00 Next Phase: $2.00 Launch Price: $20.00 Potential ROI: Up to 1,900% Timeframe: Only 3 months Don’t Watch Crypto Evolve—Be the One Leading with BTC-S With only 21 million BTC-S tokens ever to exist and growing media attention from experts and crypto influencers , the presale is a limited opportunity to invest before the price surges. Conclusion Ethereum changed crypto, but Bitcoin Solaris is upgrading it for the next era — and it’s doing it faster. With a realistic 5-year roadmap, mobile-first mining, eco-friendly infrastructure, and audited smart contracts, BTC-S is creating the kind of accessibility and innovation Ethereum never fully delivered. If you’ve ever looked back wishing you had invested in Ethereum during its early stages, this may be your second chance. With the roadmap already in progress and the presale heating up, Bitcoin Solaris is more than a project — it’s a shot at the kind of wealth-building opportunity that rarely comes twice.

Most on-chain users seek trading opportunities, but decentralized social media is also growing. On-chain users are tackling the increasing complexity of Web3, decentralized services, according to recent research by Reown with data assistance from Nansen. Several trends are forming in on-chain behaviors, reshaping the crypto market. Reown, rebranded from WalletConnect, creates app and wallet SDK kits for on-chain experiences. To better serve its customers, Reown performed in-depth research on user habits, experiences, and the most in-demand apps. The company based its findings on a survey of 1,038 users, queried in February 2025, extending similar queries from 2024 to track sentiment over time. Nansen added transaction data to explore sentiment and app demand further. On-chain users flock to trading, DeFi and payments For the query period, only 17% of users were newcomers to the crypto market. The biggest group of users, 56%, were traders who swapped crypto in the past three months. 47% used crypto for payments, and 45% interacted with DeFi protocols. Airdrops, gaming, and social apps were also attractive, but only 17% of users interacted with NFT protocols in February 2025. Participants overlapped, and some reported several types of apps and use cases. Governance is also a relatively slow use case, with only 6% of users reporting some type of vote through their wallets. Most users were in the intermediate to highly comfortable category, with 14% of users reporting advanced interactions with apps. The relatively mature crypto market in 2025 continues to see experienced users and traders returning for more opportunities. As more Web3 projects offered incentives, some users joined for the social factor, while others responded they were more interested in the airdrop value. Bitcoin remained the most widely held asset, chosen by 64% of respondents. Meme tokens showed the biggest gains, with up to 37% of respondents holding some type of meme. For the same period in 2024, around 20% of users held meme tokens. Europe leads in new wallet creation Wallet usage is growing, reflecting the evolving on-chain engagement. Europe is the leader in new wallet creation, while Southeast Asia is the leader in interconnected wallets and on-chain interactions. North and South America lagged both in terms of wallet creation and connectivity despite remaining one of the biggest crypto markets. The user behavior of US wallet owners is still a remnant of the harsh crypto regulations of the Biden administration, as noted in the survey paper. More on-chain users resort to managing multiple wallets due to the fragmented ecosystems of different chains. 48% of users kept multiple wallets due to a lack of interoperability, and 44% reported security as the main reason. Mobile wallets are still the most widely used type, with a growing demand for hardware wallets. New users tended to test more wallets of various types, while experienced traders consolidated around big brands, choosing the dominant wallets of Binance and Coinbase. Wallet users became more specialized, using Ethereum as a settlement layer and for DeFi interactions. Solana users are mostly linked to DEX, while BNB Wallet owners have moved to specific Binance services. Base users were the most diverse in terms of on-chain behaviors.

The development was shared by crypto commentator Brett on X, igniting widespread interest across the digital finance ecosystem. A Major Step Toward Regulatory Clarity The release of this draft legislation marks a crucial turning point in the UK’s ongoing journey to establish itself as a global crypto hub. The document, prepared by HM Treasury, lays the groundwork for a structured and legally coherent regulatory framework that seeks to integrate digital assets into the country’s broader financial architecture, while also protecting consumers and ensuring market stability. BREAKING UK releases draft legislation for $XRP and crypto regulation! pic.twitter.com/xGV3VU4lz1 — Brett (@Brett_Crypto_X) April 30, 2025 Unlike past efforts that took a broad approach to digital assets, this draft outlines granular guidance, including how certain cryptocurrencies, such as XRP, might be classified, utilized, and regulated under existing financial laws. XRP in the Spotlight XRP, developed by Ripple, has long been at the center of discussions surrounding regulatory treatment due to its dual role as both a utility token and a cross-border liquidity asset. The UK’s approach appears more innovation-forward and technologically neutral than the United States’ ongoing legal entanglements involving Ripple and the SEC. This divergence between the UK and US regulatory environments could create a competitive advantage for London, attracting fintechs and blockchain firms that seek clear, forward-thinking guidelines for operations, fundraising, and asset management. Implications for Ripple and the Broader Industry For Ripple, which already has a significant operational presence in London, this draft legislation offers not only clarity but validation. The company has consistently advocated for regulatory frameworks that support innovation without sacrificing oversight. With this draft, the UK government appears to be answering that call, offering a middle ground that champions both innovation and accountability.

The proposed rules suggest a pathway for licensing, custodianship, stablecoin management, and digital asset trading, giving market participants a clear understanding of what compliance entails in the UK. Such clarity could usher in increased institutional investment, promote market stability, and establish the UK as a leader in blockchain adoption. The Road Ahead While the draft legislation is just the beginning of the parliamentary process, it sets a strong tone. Public and industry feedback will likely shape the final form of the law, but the initial language is decisively pro-crypto. As XRP enthusiasts, legal analysts, and global investors watch closely, the UK’s legislative rollout could become a template for other jurisdictions looking to regulate the evolving crypto space intelligently. With the UK’s move, the global financial system inches closer to fully integrating blockchain-based assets. The stage is set, and XRP may be among the first digital assets to thrive under this newly forming legal order.

Where once APYs of 15–30% were common, today’s staking rewards typically sit around 3–7% — a far cry from the golden era. Platforms are pivoting towards sustainability, cutting back rewards, and changing tokenomics. Yield farmers and passive investors are now scrambling for better options. Meanwhile, FXGuys is standing tall. By offering a 20% profit share from real broker trading volume, FXGuys is showing how to earn passive income with crypto sustainably — even as others shrink. >>>JOIN FXGUYS HERE The Shift: Yields Down, Volume-Based Rewards Up DeFi staking is no longer what it once was. Early projects, once promising huge returns, have either failed or pivoted. FXGuys, however, takes a smarter route. By staking $FXG, users receive a 20% share of the broker’s trading volume, rather than receiving outsize returns based on inflationary emissions. This aligns with an activity-based model. When traders win, you win too. This enables yield match performance, creating one of the most sustainable ways to earn passive income in crypto today. What Makes FXGuys Different? This isn’t your typical stakeholder project. The ecosystem of FXGuys is of traders, not holders. Here’s how. Staking $FXG = Earn from the platform’s broker revenue.

This Market is Tough… but not for the FX Guys. As the presale enters Stage 3, now priced at $0.05 per $FXG token, the project has already raised over $5 million. Why This Matters in 2025 As centralised platforms clamp down on regulations and staking rewards diminish, degens & retail investors are screaming out for more. They’re looking for: Real passive income crypto—not just emissions. Access to capital without risking personal funds. Decentralised tools without compliance hurdles. FXGuys delivers on all three fronts — and more. It’s more than just another DeFi token; it’s a full-scale trader development ecosystem with real-world revenue sharing. Who’s It For? Whether you’re.

Despite a 50% monthly surge, it may be too little, too late—whale holdings continue to decline, with 41 trillion tokens offloaded over the past three months as PEPE shed 60% of its value. Economic uncertainty from the ongoing US-China trade war has fueled profit-taking as whales move to limit downside exposure. Whales Offload 41 Trillion Tokens, but Should You Sell Too? Santiment Data shows that the supply of Pepe tokens held by these investors stands at 148.7 trillion—a 41 trillion drop from its 165 trillion peak in February. Token supply held by whales. Source: Santiment. More so, data indicates that the 90-day Mean Dollar Invested Age (MDIA) has been in a downtrend, suggesting increased selling from long-term holders. On the positive side, there are signs that the selling pressure is fading as the supply held by whales has held steady over the past week. Sentiment may be shifting, especially with major technical developments on the daily time frames. Pepe Price Analysis: Recovery Hangs on Key Resistance PEPE’s rebound over the past month marked the second bounce in a double-bottom pattern forming along a support zone that has marked major bottoms since mid-2024. PEPE / USDT 3-day chart, double-bottom pattern. Source: TradingView / Binance. While the first stage of gains has materialized, a full breakout eyes a further 87% push to the $0.0000168 resistance zone. A breakout is usually confirmed by a decisive break above the neckline—in this case, the $0.00000855 resistance—but the PEPE price has stalled. If it can’t hold its position above this level, the meme coin risks a sharp reversal back toward the support zone and its YTD low of $0.000005725—a 41% decline from here. Still, momentum indicators lean bullish, with the MACD line holding above the signal line and the RSI trending sideways above neutral. The current slip hasn’t triggered a full trend reversal just yet, but the setup remains fragile. PEPE is vulnerable to broader market headwinds, particularly amid economic uncertainty.

The round includes backing from major investors such as Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Dragonfly Capital, VanEck Ventures, Coinbase Ventures, and co-founders of the Solana blockchain. The company’s valuation was not disclosed, according to a report from Fortune . Timinsky Pushes for Stablecoin Usage Timinsky told Fortune that he aims to make stablecoins accessible to users in cash-heavy economies through existing retail infrastructure. With stablecoins now representing a $238 billion market and growing in importance for cross-border payments and inflation protection, Zar aims to turn any store into a physical crypto exchange. To accomplish this, the company is tapping into a network of over 28 million mobile money agents globally—individuals and businesses that already facilitate more than $1.5 trillion in financial services outside the traditional banking system. Zar’s platform will allow users to walk into a local shop, scan a QR code, and initiate a transaction via the Zar app. Customers can review vendor ratings, check exchange rates, and hand over cash in exchange for stablecoins like USDT or USDC, which will be deposited directly into their digital wallets. Store owners can earn money by applying a margin to the exchange rate, while Zar collects a transaction fee, varying by region. The service is not yet live but is already gaining traction. Nearly 100,000 users have signed up for Zar’s waitlist, and 7,000 vendors across 20 countries—including Pakistan, Nigeria, Argentina, and Indonesia—have expressed interest. Unlike typical crypto platforms, ZAR is engineered to facilitate dollar inflows without enabling capital flight. By helping people access stable digital dollars while keeping that value within their local economies, we're addressing a critical need—especially in countries like… — ZAR (@zardotapp) April 30, 2025 Timinsky says the company is not initially targeting the U.S., where stablecoin usage is relatively limited due to a more stable currency and mature banking systems. Instead, the focus is on emerging markets where people lack reliable access to financial services and seek alternatives to volatile local currencies. The funding will be used to expand Zar’s team, open new offices, and continue building out the technology. The company plans to launch its service by the end of the summer. Stablecoin Market to Surge 10x to $2 Trillion by 2030 Citigroup has projected a dramatic rise in the stablecoin market, forecasting that its total market capitalization could soar from nearly $240 billion today to over $2 trillion by 2030 . The prediction says the growth in adoption would be driven by regulatory developments and increased interest from both financial institutions and the public sector. According to the banking giant, stablecoin supply could reach $1.6 trillion by the end of the decade under its base-case scenario, while a more optimistic outlook places the figure at $3.7 trillion. As reported, the number of active stablecoin wallets has surged by over 50% in the past year , reflecting growing adoption and engagement within the digital asset ecosystem. More specifically, active stablecoin addresses increased from 19.6 million in February 2024 to 30 million in February 2025, marking a 53% year-on-year growth.

This new partnership aims to expand over $200 million in tokenized assets, including private credit offerings, across more than 30 blockchain ecosystems. The Rio de Janeiro-based exchange is already a major player in Latin America’s digital asset landscape, with over 4 million clients and a growing portfolio of tokenized offerings. By integrating Wormhole’s interoperability protocol, MB seeks to offer a more scalable and transparent solution for on-chain asset issuance and trading, especially in the underserved secondary markets for private credit. “This partnership with Wormhole marks a pivotal step in our mission to democratize access to digital assets,” said Fabrício Tota, Vice President of New Business Development at MB. “Wormhole, now our official interoperability partner, enables us to scale beyond regional boundaries and connect our tokenized asset ecosystem to a truly global, multichain environment.” You might also like: Ripple partners with Mercado Bitcoin to launch payments solution in Brazil Long-term structure As part of the agreement, the Wormhole Foundation will also make a strategic investment in one of MB’s tokenized products.

With this partnership, we’re deepening our presence in Latin America, as well as further growing our leadership in providing critical infrastructure for scaling institutional-grade assets,” said Dan Reecer, co-founder of the Wormhole Foundation. The partnership is designed to address longstanding liquidity and access issues in the tokenized finance sector.

Currently in phase 4 at $0.025 per token, this decentralized finance project is capturing the crypto market’s attention. As altcoin season approaches, investors are eyeing opportunities to multiply their portfolios. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out with its lending model and structured tokenomics, promising significant returns by July in 2025. The project’s momentum is undeniable, and its innovative approach to DeFi is sparking curiosity. Let’s explore why this altcoin could be the key to unlocking substantial gains. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale Ignites FOMO Surging through phase 4, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is selling tokens at $0.025, a price that won’t last long. Phase 5 looms, bringing a 20% price hike to $0.03, meaning current investors will pocket an immediate 20% gain when the next stage opens. The tokenomics guarantee a 140% return at the $0.06 listing price. Analysts project a post-launch value of $2.50, offering a jaw-dropping 9,900% ROI for early buyers. The team is finalizing a CertiK smart contract audit, with results soon to be shared on social media, bolstering trust. This structured growth fuels urgency, as phase 4 tokens are vanishing fast. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi with its dual lending model. Users can lend assets to liquidity pools, earning interest via mtTokens, which represent deposits like ETH or DAI and accrue value over time. Borrowers access funds by posting collateral, ensuring stability through overcollateralization. A unique peer-to-peer lending feature allows direct loan negotiations, even for niche assets like meme coins. The platform’s buy-and-distribute system uses revenue to repurchase MUTM tokens, redistributing them to stakers. This creates constant demand, supporting price growth. Such utility sets Mutuum Finance (MUTM) apart in a crowded crypto market. Rewarding Loyalty with Transparency Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is fostering community trust with a newly launched dashboard showcasing the top 50 holders. These investors earn bonus tokens for maintaining their positions, sparking competition and loyalty. The initiative amplifies FOMO as holders vie for rankings. The ongoing CertiK audit underscores the team’s commitment to security, with an announcement expected soon. As phase 4 nears its end, the 20% price jump to $0.03 in phase 5 looms large. Investors are racing to secure tokens before the window closes, knowing the $0.06 listing price promises a 140% profit. Dogecoin (DOGE) Lags Behind Dogecoin (DOGE), trading at $0.17, struggles with bearish signals and a 22% drop in activity. Despite whale accumulation, its speculative nature lacks the utility of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Predictions suggest DOGE may hit $1 in 2025, but technical resistance at $0.17 casts doubt. Without a clear use case, DOGE’s volatility pales against MUTM’s structured growth. Investors seeking stability and high returns are shifting focus to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), where tangible DeFi applications promise sustained value over meme-driven hype. Cardano (ADA) Faces Uncertainty Cardano (ADA), priced at $0.6853, is faltering with a 3.5% daily drop and bearish technicals. Support at $0.652 is shaky, and resistance at $0.745 looms. While long-term hopes rest on Bitcoin DeFi bridges, immediate upside is limited. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a clearer path to profits with its 9,900% ROI potential. ADA’s institutional backing can’t match MUTM’s presale momentum and practical lending model, making Mutuum Finance (MUTM) the smarter bet for portfolio growth. Riding the Altcoin Wave Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is poised to lead as altcoin season nears. Its phase 4 presale at $0.025 offers a rare entry point before the $0.03 price in phase 5. With a 140% return at listing and a projected $2.50 post-launch value, MUTM could 10x portfolios by July in 2025. The crypto market craves utility, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) delivers with its lending platform and tokenomics. Don’t wait—join the presale now to secure your stake in this DeFi powerhouse.

Analysts Think Ruvi AI Will Surpass XRP By the end of the Year,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/ripple-xrp-price-forecast-could-it-reach-5-in-may-analysts-think-ruvi-ai-will-surpass-xrp-by-the-end-of-the-year/,"Ripple (XRP) is known for its focus on cross-border payment solutions and continues to develop its technology and use cases in the financial sector. But while Ripple is in the spotlight, Ruvi AI, a new player in the crypto space, is making waves with its approach to blockchain and artificial intelligence. Ripple’s Progress Amid Market Volatility Ripple’s XRP has been revolutionizing the way international transactions are done. Its network is faster and cheaper than traditional banking systems and has institutional partnerships with major financial institutions worldwide. Recently, Ripple expanded to emerging markets and solidified its position as a leader in the blockchain financial sector. While Ripple is doing well, a quieter but equally interesting story is unfolding. Ruvi AI , a new crypto project, is building its reputation and offering solutions for data-driven industries and attracting savvy investors. Ruvi AI’s Explosive Start and Upcoming Price Move Ruvi AI launched with a big presale. 10 million tokens were sold in days and $100,000 was raised. This initial success plus the release of the beta platform shortly after the presale positions Ruvi AI as a project with real momentum. The beta platform allows users to try out Ruvi AI’s features including predictive analytics and creativity tools designed to help decision making and operational efficiency in industries like healthcare and logistics. Investors should act fast if they want to get in at the current price of $0.01 as phase 2 of the presale will see a 50% price increase. VIP Tier 4 Breakdown Ruvi AI’s structured presale incentives is a golden opportunity for investors to maximize their returns. VIP Tier 4 is one of the best options for those who want to have significant exposure to this project. Accumulating 200,000 tokens during the presale comes with an 80% bonus. This means you will get an additional 160,000 tokens and total 360,000 tokens for an investment of $2,000 at the current price of $0.01 per token. With Ruvi AI’s listing price of $0.07, this would grow to $25,200 and be a 11.4x return at launch. But the real potential is in the projections for Ruvi AI’s future market performance. If the token reaches $1, the $2,000 investment would be $360,000 and a 17,900% ROI. These structured incentives is why Ruvi AI is getting the attention of forward thinking crypto enthusiasts. Ruvi AI’s Unique Selling Point Ruvi AI targets industries that rely heavily on data processing and analytical insights. By combining blockchain with artificial intelligence, Ruvi AI is a more targeted approach to operational challenges. Its tools are designed to streamline activities, increase efficiency and reduce costs in industries like logistics, healthcare and fraud prevention for the banking sector, as well as in the finance industry. This practical and solution oriented approach sets Ruvi AI apart in the increasingly crowded crypto space. Investors are not just buying a token but also supporting technology that solves real world problems. What’s Next for Ruvi AI? Ruvi AI has several milestones coming up. These include partnerships with enterprises to scale the platform, new features to add more value to users and increasing visibility in the crypto market. With phase 2 of the presale approaching and a 50% token price increase, this is one of those rare opportunities for early adopters to get in before the market fully realizes Ruvi AI’s potential. For those tired of speculative projects with no real world use cases, Ruvi AI is different. If you want to be part of a project at the forefront of blockchain and artificial intelligence, this is a name to keep on your watchlist. Now is the perfect time to join and position yourself for maximum profits before the prices go up.

He insisted his own trade policies would soon reverse the downturn and drive strong growth. Trump said the shrinkage “has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS” and argued that once tariffs fully kicked in, the economy would “boom.” “When the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!” he wrote on social media. In a longer post on TruthSocial, he added, “This is Biden’s Stock Market, not Trump’s. I didn’t take over until January 20th. Tariffs will soon kick in, and companies are starting to move into the USA in record numbers. Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden ‘Overhang.’ Meanwhile, the President is set to host CEOs from major firms, including Nvidia and GE Aerospace, later today. He will also convene a Cabinet meeting with his leadership team. Trump has been making multiple public appearances to mark his first 100 days in office, which he completed yesterday. First dip since early 2022 puts the U.S. on the brink of technical recession The Commerce Department said the latest figure marked a sharp reversal from the 2.4% annual growth rate posted in the final quarter of last year. On the surface, the shift from a 2.4% expansion to a 0.3% contraction was shocking. Officials noted the downturn largely reflected a surge in imports, as businesses rushed to bring in goods ahead of President Trump’s tariff increases. It was the first contraction in three years, a sign that economic activity was already softening even before the highest tariffs took effect. This dip, the first since early 2022, places the U.S. economy on the brink of a technical recession, which is typically defined by two straight quarters of negative growth. Consumer sentiment plunged 32% in April, falling to its lowest level since the 1990 recession. Influential economists had warned that the risk of a U.S. recession this year was close to 50%.

Hines framed the administration’s first 100 days as a deliberate reversal of the “lawfare” that had hounded the crypto sector. “The President made promises on the campaign trail,” Hines said at the outset, “and he’s delivered on many of those promises thus far, but we still have quite a bit of work to do.” The Bitcoin ‘Space Race’ Central to that is the launch of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) and a broader Digital Assets National Stockpile. The goal, Hines explained, is to secure as much of the digital gold as fiscal prudence permits. “We recognize bitcoin as being unique and we’ve said repeatedly that we view Bitcoin as digital gold,” he said. When asked how much bitcoin the United States hopes to amass, Hines dismissed the premise: “That’s a silly question. That’s like asking any country how much you want of any asset with intrinsic stored value. You want as much as you can possibly accumulate.” Statutory language requires all accumulation to be budget-neutral , but Hines voiced confidence that “high-IQ people in this administration, specifically over at Treasury and Commerce,” will “come up with extremely creative ways for us to accumulate.” That intent is animated by an explicitly geopolitical lens. “There is definitely a sort of space race as it pertains to accumulation of this asset,” Hines said. “We’ve positioned ourselves to be the bitcoin superpower of the world.” The analogy to the twentieth-century contest for extraterrestrial dominance recurred throughout the conversation; in the administration’s view, hash rate, custody competence and sovereign reserves may soon count as strongly as launch pads once did. Hines credited much of the early velocity to what he called a deliberate infusion of private-sector talent into government. David Sacks , named both AI and “crypto czar,” was singled out for lending the expertise of Silicon Valley venture capital to federal decision-making. “We’re finally testing the hypothesis… what happens when you take a bunch of private-sector actors who have been successful and inject them into government?” Hines said, arguing that three months of regulatory reversals and policy construction already vindicate the experiment. The White House’s demolition-construction-implementation roadmap is aggressive. Stage one—removing “burdensome regulations that really stifled innovation”—is already under way with lawsuits dropped by the Securities and Exchange Commission and new banking guidance designed to make the United States, in Hines’s words, “the most pro-crypto-friendly environment that possibly exists in the world.” Stage two entails shepherding both stablecoin and market-structure bills through Congress. “We want to make sure we deliver on the President’s wishes to get both pieces of legislation on his desk before August recess,” Hines declared, predicting bipartisan passage. Stage three, scheduled to begin once a statutory framework exists, will integrate blockchain rails into conventional payments—an overhaul Hines said could become the signature achievement of the President’s second term. Open Questions That timetable is undergirded by a 180-day inter-agency report mandated by the executive order, meant to articulate how federal departments will operate under the forthcoming legal architecture. Treasury has already audited existing government-held Bitcoin (deadline was April 5); Hines said every relevant agency “has been extremely cooperative in producing what they have,” with consolidation now in progress. One open question is how the government will acquire new coins. Policymakers have floated ideas ranging from revaluing gold certificates to leveraging federal energy assets for on-site mining. Hines declined to privilege any single path. “We can do this in numerous different ways,” he said, emphasizing speed and practicality. “What can we move on in the quickest fashion, and how can we start this accumulation process in the most expeditious manner possible?” The administration is also trying to strike a balance between blockchain transparency and individual privacy. Hines rejected the notion that crypto rails are uniquely hospitable to illicit finance—“You’re a pretty dumb criminal if you want to use digital assets to do something nefarious, because that can be traced publicly”—while acknowledging the importance of self-custody and anonymity for lawful users. “It is a delicate balance, but it’s one that we can strike very effectively,” he said, adding that the world will “look to the US” for precedent. As the interview concluded, Hines framed the initiative as both domestic necessity and international contest. If legislation passes and the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve begins accumulating before year’s end, he argued, “we will be the crypto capital of the world at that point.” Whether other nations accept that outcome—or accelerate their own sovereign accumulation—now depends on how seriously they take the United States’ declaration that Bitcoin is the new battlefield where economic superpowers measure their reach.

DOGE is now down by 4% in a week, although the altcoin – the eighth-biggest coin in the market – remains up by 8.5% in a month and by 26% in a year. And while the news of the SEC’s delay may come as bad news to some, analysts had expected a postponement, with the regulator already having a final deadline in October for the Dogecoin ETF. As such, DOGE remains in as good a position as it had been prior to the latest delay, with the token’s long-term price prediction still looking strong. Dogecoin Price Prediction: SEC Delays ETF Decision — What Traders Must Watch Now Bitwise first submitted the application for its Dogecoin ETF in late January, riding the wave of optimism that followed Donald Trump’s inauguration that month. The ETF enjoyed some good news last month when NYSE Arca filed a 19b-4 proposal to list and trade its shares, bringing it a step closer to approval. Yet the SEC’s delay means we have to wait until at least June 17 for a decision from the regulator, although in theory it could keep delaying until October. And while the Dogecoin price may give the impression that the market has reacted negatively to this news, many analysts were anticipating a delay. We also had the SEC delay decisions on Ethereum Staking and Dogecoin ETFs today. I am expecting more delays today or at least this week on some Solana and Hedera/HBAR ETF filings. This is expected IMO. Final deadlines for most of this stuff is in October 2025 or later. https://t.co/kOZNCSjy6c — James Seyffart (@JSeyff) April 29, 2025 And if we look at Polymarket, we see that the odds for its ‘Doge ETF approved in 2025?’ market have actually increased today, having risen from 52% only five days ago to 69% as of writing. This leaves DOGE in a good position, with its chart today also showing signs of recovery after several months of stagnation. Its relative strength index (purple), for example, recently climbed over 50 and remains elevated, a sign that it has entered a new phase. Similarly, its 30-day moving average (orange) is rising again after bottoming out a few days ago, with an ascent towards the 200-day average (blue) looking increasingly likely. Source: TradingView We’re highlighting $0.30 as a medium-term price target for Dogecoin, with an improvement in global trade likely to help it towards this level. And in the longer run, it could potentially hit $0.70 by the end of the year, especially if Bitwise’s DOGE ETF does gain approval. This New Altcoin Could Outshine the Entire Market This Summer There remains a chance that we may not see Dogecoin do much unless Bitwise’s application is successful, in which case some traders may opt to diversify into newer tokens that could pick up the slack. This includes newer meme coins such as Pudgy Penguins (PENGU) and Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), but it will also include presale tokens, which can often rally hard when they list. And probably the biggest presale coin right now is Solaxy (SOLX) , a Solana-based token that has now raised a hugely impressive $32.4 million in its ongoing sale. Solaxy is hitting a Supernova! 32M Raised!! pic.twitter.com/0oWzeK5vTm — SOLAXY (@SOLAXYTOKEN) April 27, 2025 Solaxy is Solana’s first true layer-two network, providing a sidechain with very low fees and ultra-fast confirmation times. Solaxy will also enable instant bridging itself and Solana, with the platform also planning to widen its compatibility to other chains in the longer term. Given that Solana experiences congestion and failed transactions, even after recent upgrades, there’s clearly a space in which Solaxy could grow to become quite prominent. Its native token SOLX will pay for transaction fees, while holders will also be able to stake it, giving it considerable utility. Investors can still join its sale by going to the Solaxy website and connecting a wallet, such as Best Wallet. SOLX is currently available at $0.00171, although this will increase again in two days, so traders should act quickly.

While many countries are following Trump's lead, Europe is lagging behind in terms of BTC reserves. While the BTC reserve issue continues to be discussed as a hot topic, Binance founder and former CEO CZ, who attended Token2049 held in Dubai, made important statements. Stating that he has advised many countries on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency reserves, CZ said that Europe remains outside the reserve debate. CZ said that he has advised many countries, excluding Europe, to establish national crypto reserves like the US. At this point, CZ stated that some countries are already ahead and advanced in terms of BTC reserves and showed Bhutan as an example. CZ stated that Bhutan has billions of dollars in Bitcoin and said, “Bitcoin already exists and they are currently adding Ethereum and BNB to their national reserves.” CZ also noted that Bitcoin ETFs are driving the current market cycle and that while Ethereum has not seen the same success, Bitcoin’s success will eventually spill over into Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. CZ finally argued that Bitcoin and crypto are financial freedom, saying, “No freedom works without freedom of speech, and that includes financial freedom. Crypto is more than technology.

Ruvi AI, a project that combines artificial intelligence with blockchain, is quickly gaining momentum with its innovative approach and promising applications. After a successful presale launch and the release of its beta product, Ruvi AI is becoming a familiar name in the crypto world. Ripple’s Success and How Ruvi AI Compares Ripple has long been recognized for its efficient solutions in global payments. XRP, its native token, facilitates rapid and cost-effective transactions, making it a go-to technology for bridging financial systems. Ripple’s focus on real-world utility has been a driving force behind its adoption by banks and institutions worldwide. Ruvi AI shares this commitment to practical use. However, its focus extends beyond payments by applying artificial intelligence to resolve challenges in industries like logistics, healthcare, and data processing. By combining blockchain’s transparency with AI’s ability to analyze information, Ruvi AI aims to create tools that help solve everyday problems in business. Although Ripple leads in the payment sector, Ruvi AI has carved a niche for itself by targeting multiple industries, offering solutions tailored to data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency. Presale Success Boosts Confidence One of the elements driving Ruvi AI’s momentum is its successful presale . The project sold over 10 million tokens within a few days, raising over $100,000 early on. This performance speaks to the growing interest in AI and blockchain convergence, an area many believe has significant opportunities. Alongside its financial success, Ruvi AI made an important step by launching its beta platform. This release allows users to experience the product’s capabilities, providing insight into how its tools might function in real-world settings. For instance, businesses could use Ruvi AI for automating repetitive tasks or analyzing large volumes of data more efficiently. Easy Entry for Investors with VIP Tier Bonuses Ruvi AI’s investor incentives have also drawn attention. One of its standout offerings is the VIP Tier 4 bonus. Investors who accumulate 200,000 tokens during the presale are offered a 80% bonus on their purchase as they qualify for the VIP 4 bonus. This grants another 160,000 tokens for a total of 360,000 now. Considering the current presale price of 0,01$ per token this equals to a $2,000 investment. The listing price is already confirmed to be $0,07$ per token which will balloon this $2,000 investment to an impressive $25,200 right out the gate. If the analyst’s prediction of $1 post listing value proves to be true, the value of the holding would hit $360,000 which represents almost 10,000 % of ROI. This tier is an attractive bridge between accessibility and meaningful returns, making it appealing to those who want to support Ruvi AI’s growth while potentially benefiting from early exposure to the project. Future Plans and Broader Applications Ripple has established itself by helping financial institutions modernize their payment systems. Ruvi AI, while different in purpose, offers long-term potential by focusing on tools that reduce inefficiencies in other industries. For example: Predictive analytics could support businesses in making better decisions. Fraud detection systems could enhance security for online transactions. Workflow automation might save time and resources for businesses dealing with complex operations. These use cases represent practical solutions that go beyond simply holding value as a digital asset and showcase Ruvi AI as a project with utility at its core. Challenges and Opportunities Despite its strong start, Ruvi AI faces challenges that any rising crypto project encounters. Competing in a market dominated by large and established players like Ripple requires consistent development, clear communication with investors, and the ability to deliver on its promises. However, Ruvi AI’s unique position as a blend of blockchain and AI gives it an opportunity to appeal to sectors that remain largely untapped by existing cryptocurrency projects. Looking Ahead Both Ripple and Ruvi AI highlight how blockchain technology can provide solutions to real-world problems. While Ripple focuses on transforming the financial world, Ruvi AI aims to bring the benefits of AI-driven insights to various industries. Ruvi AI’s strong entry into the market and focus on useful applications signal a promising path forward. For those interested in the overlap of blockchain and AI, Ruvi AI is a name worth watching.

43992242,df94e6f3-f82a-4505-8d89-de84c57517e8,1746029096,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/43992242.jpeg,AI-Powered Court System Is Coming to Crypto With GenLayer,https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/04/30/ai-powered-court-system-is-coming-to-crypto-with-genlayer,"What if there were a crypto protocol that specialized in arbitrating on-chain disputes? Imagine if, whenever prediction markets like Polymarket settled in a controversial manner, users had a formal way to appeal through a sort of neutral on-chain court system. Or if decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) could rely on an efficient, knowledgeable third party to help them make decisions. Or if insurance contracts could automatically execute payouts when specific real-world events occurred. That’s essentially what Albert Castellana Lluís and his team are building with GenLayer, a crypto project that markets itself as a decision-making system, or trust infrastructure. “We're using a blockchain that has multiple AIs coordinate and reach agreement on subjective decisions, as if they were a judge,"" Castellana, co-founder and CEO of YeagerAI told CoinDesk in an interview. ""We're basically building a global synthetic jurisdiction that has an embedded court system that doesn’t sleep, that’s super cheap, and that’s super fast.” The demand for such an arbitration project may spike in the coming years with the development of AI agents — sophisticated programs powered by artificial intelligence that are capable of carrying out complex tasks in an autonomous manner. When it comes to crypto markets, AI agents can be used in all kinds of ways : for trading memecoins, arbitraging bitcoin on exchanges, monitoring the security of DeFi protocols, or providing market insights through in-depth analysis, to cite only a few use-cases. AI agents will also be able to hire other AI agents in order to complete even more complex assignments. Such agents may proliferate at an unexpected rate, Castellana said. In his view, most crypto market participants could be managing a handful of them by the end of 2025. “These agents, they work super fast, they don’t sleep, they don’t go to jail. You don’t know where they are. Are they going to pass anti-money laundering rules? Are they going to have a bank account? Can they even use a Visa card?” Castellana said. “How can we enable fast transactions between them? And how can trust happen in a world like this?” Thanks to its unique architecture, GenLayer could provide a solution by allowing entities — human or AI — to get a reliable, neutral opinion to weigh in on any decision in record time. “Anywhere where you normally would have a third party made of a bunch of humans… We replace them with a global network that provides a consensus between different AIs, a network that can make decisions in a way that is as correct and as unbiased as possible,” Castellana said. Synthetic court system GenLayer doesn’t seek to compete with other blockchains like Bitcoin, Ethereum or Solana — or even DeFi protocols such as Uniswap or Compound. Rather, the idea is for any existing crypto protocol to be able to connect to GenLayer and make use of its infrastructure. GenLayer’s chain is powered by ZKsync, an Ethereum layer 2 solution. Its network counts 1,000 validators, each one connected to a large language model (LLM) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Google’s Bert or Meta’s Llama. Let’s say a market on Polymarket settles in a controversial manner. If Polymarket is connected to GenLayer, users of the prediction market have the ability to raise the issue (or, as Castellana put it, to create a “transaction”) with its synthetic court system. As soon as the transaction comes in, GenLayer picks five validators at random to rule on it. These five validators query an LLM of their choice in order to find information on the topic at hand, and then vote on a solution. That produces a ruling. But the Polymarket users, in our example, don’t necessarily need to be satisfied with the ruling: they can decide to appeal the decision. In which case, GenLayer picks another set of validators — except this time, their number jumps to 11. Just like before, the validators issue a ruling based on the information they gather from LLMs. That decision can also be appealed, which makes GenLayer pick 23 validators for another ruling, then 47 validators, then 95, and so on and so forth. The idea is to rely on Condorcetʼs Jury Theorem, which according to GenLayer’s pitch deck states that “when each participant is more likely than not to make a correct decision, the probability of a correct majority outcome increases significantly as the group grows larger.” In other words, GenLayer finds wisdom in the crowd. The more validators are involved, the more likely they are to zero in on an accurate answer. “What this means is that we can start small and very efficiently, but also we can escalate to a point where something very, very tricky, they can still get right,” Castellana said. The average transaction takes roughly 100 seconds to process, Castellana said, and the court’s decision becomes final after 30 minutes — a timeframe that can be elongated if multiple appeals occur. But that means the protocol can reach a decision on major issues in a very short period of time, day or night, instead of going through arduous real-world litigation processes which may take months or even years. Looking at incentives GenLayer’s mission naturally raises a question: is it possible to game the system? For example, what if all of the validators select the same AI (say, ChatGPT) to solve a given proposal? Wouldn’t that mean that ChatGPT will have essentially issued the ruling? Every time you query an LLM, you generate a new seed, Castellana said, so you obtain a different answer. On top of that, validators have the freedom of choosing which LLM to use based on the topic at hand. If it’s a relatively easy question, perhaps there’s no need to use an expensive LLM; on the other hand, if the question is particularly complex, the validator may opt for a higher-quality AI model. Validators may even end up in a situation where they feel like they’ve seen a certain type of question so many times that they can pre-train a small model for a specific purpose. “We think that, over time, there's just going to be endless new models,” Castellana said. There’s a strong incentive for validators to be on the winning side of the decision-making process, because they’re financially rewarded for it — while the losing side ends up incurring costs associated with using computation, without collecting any rewards. In other words, the question is not whether one’s validator is providing a correct answer, but whether it manages to side with the majority. Since validators have no idea what other validators are voting, the goal is for them to use the necessary resources to provide accurate information with the expectation that other validators will converge on that information as well — because arriving at the same incorrect answer would probably require rigorous coordination. And if that gambit doesn’t work out, the appeal system is ready to kick in. “If I know that I'm reusing a good LLM, and I think that other people are using a bad LLMs and that's why I lost, then I have quite a big incentive to appeal, because I know that with more people, there’s going to be an incentive for them to be using better LLMs as well” since other validators will want to earn the rewards from a successful appeal, Castellana said. The system makes it hard for validators to collude, because they only have 100 seconds to reach a decision, and they don’t know whether they will be picked to settle specific questions. An entity would need to control between 33% and 50% of the network to be able to attack it, Castellana said. Like Ethereum, GenLayer will be using a native token for its financial incentives. With a testnet already launched, the project should go live by the end of the year, according to Castellana. “There's going to be a very big incentive for people to come and build things on top,” he said.",Tech|GenLayer|Zksync era|AI|News,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|ETH|FIAT|MARKET,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-30 16:04:56

It is now looking bullish on the daily scale. As most altcoins recovered from their local bottoms earlier this month, Pundix followed suit as it picked up from $0.214 after a slight rejection. Holding this price level as support, it recovered steadily, but struggled with volatility on the way up following a low volume inflow daily. While the recovery led to a temporal suspense in the short-term bearish correction, the price reached the $0.3 level after three weeks of recovery. This looks more like a liquidity gathering phase, and as we can see on the daily chart, the price exploded massively due to an enhanced volume since yesterday. Such an explosion is considered a pump from a technical standpoint, and with the look of things, it will most likely be followed by a dump soon, washing away the gains in no time. However, it is important to note that the trading landscape has changed, and the bulls are now gaining control. Sustaining the pressure above last December’s high could lead to a complete trend reversal, invalidating further bearish moves from a mid-term perspective. Pundix’s Key Levels to Watch Source: Tradingview Anticipating a dump, there’s a close support level at $0.437. If this level collapses, the next support for drops would be $0.391 before rolling back to the $0.32 level, where the price flipped through yesterday. Aside from the $0.584 level, rejected a few hours ago, higher resistance levels to watch for growth are $0.6 and $0.7. A surge through these levels could send the price to a new high. Key Resistance Levels: $0.584, $0.6, $0.7 Key Support Levels: $0.437, $0.391, $0.32 Spot Price: $0.51 Trend: Bullish Volatility: High Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Despite this, the crypto market cap has registered a marginal increase of 0.32%. Bitcoin (BTC) is marginally up but still trading under $95,000, at around $94,880. Meanwhile, Ethereum (ETH) is down nearly 1%, struggling to stay above $1,800. Ripple (XRP) has seen a bigger drop and is down almost 2%, trading at $2.24. Meanwhile, Solana (SOL) continues to trade under $150 after registering a marginal decline over the past 24 hours. Dogecoin (DOGE) is down over 2%, while Cardano (ADA) is down 1.58% and trading at 1.58%. Chainlink (LINK) , Stellar (XLM) , Toncoin (TON) , Hedera (HBAR) , Polkadot (DOT) , and Litecoin (LTC) have also registered notable declines over the past 24 hours. Australia To Crack Down On Dormant Crypto Exchanges Australia’s financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC, has asked dormant crypto exchanges to withdraw their registrations or risk having them canceled over fears they could be used to orchestrate elaborate scams. Over 400 crypto exchanges are registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). However, the agency suspects many of them are inactive and vulnerable to being acquired by criminals. The agency has reached out to digital currency exchanges (DCEs) that are no longer trading and will tell them to “use the license or lose it.” AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas stated, “Businesses registered with AUSTRAC are required to keep their details up to date; this includes details about services that are no longer provided.” Any business that wishes to offer Australians conversions between cash and crypto, including crypto ATM providers, is required to register with AUSTRAC. The agency monitors crimes, including money laundering and tax evasion. The agency also has the authority to cancel registrations if it has reasonable grounds to believe the business is inactive or no longer offering crypto-related services. AUSTRAC has canceled the licenses of ten firms since 2019, the most recent being FTX Express. The agency also plans to publish a list of registered exchanges to help Australians verify legitimate providers. According to Thomas, a registry of legitimate providers will make it difficult for malicious entities to scam people, and improve the accuracy of the agency’s register. “If a DCE does intend to offer a service, they need to contact us otherwise we will cancel the registration, and this information will be added to the register. Members of the public should feel confident that they can identify legitimate cryptocurrency providers that are registered and subject to regulatory oversight and that we are driving criminals out of this industry.” DOJ Seeks 20-Year Sentence For Mashinsky The United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has sought a 20-year prison sentence for Alex Mashinsky, co-founder and former CEO of defunct crypto lender Celsius. The DOJ filed the government’s sentencing memorandum on April 28, recommending a 20-year sentence for Mashinsky for his fraudulent actions, which led to billions in losses for Celsius customers. The 97-page memorandum stated that Celsius users could not access $4.7 billion in crypto after the platform stopped withdrawals on June 12. The DOJ stated, “The Court should sentence Alexander Mashinsky to twenty years’ imprisonment as just punishment for his years-long campaign of lies and self-dealing that left in its wake billions in losses and thousands of victimized customers.” The DOJ also noted that Mashinsky personally profited from the fraudulent schemes at Celsius. Mashinsky admitted in his guilty plea that he was the leader of criminal activity at Celsius and that his crimes led to losses of over $550 million and that he personally benefited $48 million. Crypto Group Asks Trump To Stop Prosecution Of Open-Source Developers The DeFi Education Fund has petitioned White House Crypto Czar David Sacks to end the “lawless prosecution” of open-source software developers, including Roman Storm, the creator of Tornado Cash. The group also urged President Donald Trump to take immediate action and discontinue the Biden-era Department of Justice’s campaign to criminalize open-source software development. The group highlighted Storm’s case, stating that he was charged in August 2023 with helping to launder over $1 billion in crypto through Tornado Cash. The group said that the DOJ is attempting to hold software developers criminally liable for how others use their code, calling it absurd and stating that it sets a precedent that adversely impacts crypto development in the US. The DeFi Education Fund’s petition has garnered over 250 signatures from industry executives and developers. SEC Delays Franklin Templeton ETF Decision The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has delayed its decision on the proposed Franklin Templeton XRP Fund. According to a recent filing, the SEC extended the review period from the initial deadline of May 3 to June 17, stating that additional time was required to assess the application and associated regulatory concerns. Franklin Templeton filed the proposal for the Franklin Templeton XRP Fund on March 13 through the Cboe BZX Exchange, with the SEC officially publishing the filing for public comments in the Federal Register on March 19. The SEC noted in its filing, “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) continues to oscillate around $95,000 as buyers struggle to overcome the overhead resistance between $95,000-$96,000. The flagship cryptocurrency has traded sideways since the middle of last week after rallying past $90,000 and has stayed between $90,000 and $95,000 since, briefly rising above $95,000 on a few occasions. However, buyers have not ceded ground to the bears, and a breakout could push the price to $100,000 or beyond. Markets remained calm on Tuesday, with most cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin , registering marginal gains. Despite the stability, markets remain pessimistic about the Trump administration’s policies and their impact on the market. Crypto stocks were quiet on Tuesday, with Coinbase (COIN) and Strategy (MSTR) up 9.0% and 3.3%. Some analysts believe the market has become unanchored from the wave of economic data suggesting US economic activity is slowing down. Consumer confidence has also dropped to its lowest point since 2020, while consumer outlook fell to its lowest point since 2011. Jeff Park, Head of Alpha Strategies at Bitwise, warned of a blind market, stating, “Hard to fathom how blind the market really is. A Fed cut means nothing if U.S. creditworthiness is permanently impaired by the global community as a result of dollar weaponization. That's the mispricing we are talking about here. The myopic focus on whether [we] are getting a fed cut in May/June is completely irrelevant if the notion of the risk-free as we know it is fundamentally challenged forever, which means the cost of capital globally is going higher.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s hashrate registered a significant increase, rising to 913.63 exahashes per second, a 9.91% increase over the past 24 hours. The increase suggests growing confidence and activity among Bitcoin miners. The hashrate is the total computing power securing the Bitcoin network, measuring the number of calculations by BTC miners each second to process and secure transactions. An increase in the hashrate suggests that more machines are working to ensure the network’s security and decentralization. A higher hashrate also indicates positive market sentiment, suggesting more miners are participating in the network. BTC’s price action was positive over the previous weekend, rising 0.61% on Saturday and 0.22% on Sunday to reclaim $85,000 and settle at $85,224. The price continued to push higher on Monday, rising nearly 3% to cross $87,000 and settle at $87,508. Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as BTC rallied almost 7%, surging past $90,000 and settling at $93,373. However, the rally stalled on Wednesday after encountering volatility and selling pressure. Despite this, BTC registered a marginal increase and settled at $93,749. The price dropped to an intraday low of $91,693 on Thursday as sellers attempted to overwhelm the support at $90,000. However, BTC rebounded from this level to register a marginal increase and settle at $94,009. Source: TradingView Buyers retained control on Friday as the price rose almost 1% to $94,776. Price action turned negative over the weekend as BTC registered a marginal decline on Saturday and then dropped 0.99% to settle at $93,802. The week started on a bullish note as BTC rose 1.29% to claim $95,000 and settled at $95,010. However, it could not stay above $95,000 and fell almost 1% on Tuesday to settle at $94,341. The current session sees BTC marginally up as buyers look to reclaim $95,000. If BTC can break above $95,000, it could extend its gains and test the resistance around $97,000. A resumption of bullish sentiment could see the price surge to $100,000. Ethereum (ETH) Price Analysis Ethereum (ETH) remains penned below $1,850 as it struggles to build momentum and move past this key resistance level. A break above this level could set ETH on a course toward $2,000. ETH has entered a consolidation phase, trading around $1,800 for now. ETH ended the previous weekend on a bearish note, dropping almost 2% to $1,586. Buyers attempted a recovery on Monday as the price reached an intraday high of $1656 before losing momentum and settling at $1,579, ultimately registering a marginal decline. Sentiment changed on Tuesday as markets rallied. As a result, ETH surged over 11%, going past the 20-day SMA and settling at $1,757. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as the price rose 2.19% and settled at $1,796. However, ETH lost momentum on Thursday after encountering selling pressure. As a result, the price fell 1.40% to $1,770. Buyers returned to the market on Friday as ETH registered a marginal increase and settled at $1,786. Source: TradingView Price action remained positive on Saturday as ETH registered an increase of almost 2% to cross the 50-day SMA and $1,800 and settle at $1,821. Despite the positive sentiment, the price was back in the red on Sunday, dropping 1.60%, slipping below $1,800 and the 50-day SMA, and settling at $1,792. ETH started the week on a tepid note, rising to $1,799 after a marginal increase. However, it was back in the red on Tuesday, registering a marginal decline. The current session sees ETH back above $1,800 as it looks to build momentum and overcome the overhead resistance. If ETH breaks and closes above the $1,850 resistance, it could extend its gains and test the $2,000 level. The RSI is above the neutral level, suggesting bullish momentum, and the MACD also indicates a bullish bias. Solana (SOL) Price Analysis Solana (SOL) continued its recent decline on Tuesday as it struggled to reclaim the $150 level. SOL’s impressive recovery from a low of $95 (April 7) stalled at $150 after buyers lost momentum in the face of substantial selling pressure at upper levels. The price had stalled around $140 last weekend before forming a base and starting a fresh increase towards $150-$155. SOL ended the previous weekend in the red, dropping 1.44%. Price action remained bearish on Monday as SOL lost momentum after reaching an intraday high of $142 and settled at $136, ultimately falling almost 1%.

Source: TradingView SOL reached an intraday high of $156 on Friday as buyers attempted a move past key resistance levels. However, the price lost momentum after reaching this level and dropped 1.10% to $150. Price action remained bearish over the weekend as SOL dropped 1.08% on Saturday and 0.84% on Sunday, slipping below $150 and settling at $148. SOL experienced volatility on Monday as buyers and sellers attempted to establish control. Buyers ultimately gained the upper hand as SOL registered a marginal decline and settled at $147. The price declined on Tuesday, falling almost 1% to $146. The current session sees SOL up nearly 1% as it looks to reclaim $150 and move past $155.

Bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as the price rallied over 9% and settled at $0.440. Buyers retained control on Wednesday as JUP rose to an intraday high of $0.474.

The current session sees JUP down over 2% and trading at $0.459. Buyers will look to build momentum and push the price beyond $0.50. Cardano (ADA) Price Analysis Cardano (ADA) registered a sharp rally at the beginning of the previous week but lost momentum after falling to cross $0.750. ADA rose to an intraday high of $0.651 on Monday (April 21) but lost momentum after reaching this level and settled at $0.624, ultimately registering a marginal increase. However, bullish sentiment intensified on Tuesday as ADA rose almost 9% and settled at $0.679.

This impressive growth, however, has highlighted a critical gap in the ecosystem: the lack of institutional-grade staking infrastructure. Existing staking mechanisms on TON have presented considerable challenges for institutions, burdened by hefty capital requirements, cumbersome manual processes, and inherent scalability limitations. Recognizing this unmet need, Chorus One , a globally recognized leader in institutional staking infrastructure, has stepped forward to bridge this divide. With the unveiling of TON Pool , a next-generation staking solution, Chorus One initiates institutional engagement within the TON ecosystem, offering a fully compliant, scalable platform designed to meet the stringent demands of institutions worldwide. As the cryptocurrency world converges on Dubai for TOKEN2049, Chorus One stands ready to showcase TON Pool, setting a new benchmark for institutional participation in the TON network. Addressing the Institutional Staking Bottleneck on TON The remarkable ascent of the TON blockchain got the attention of institutional investors. Its deep integration with a widely used messaging platform provides a unique avenue for mass adoption and network growth. But the existing landscape for staking TON has presented significant hurdles for these larger players – capital outlay required to operate native validators is one of them. Demands reaching as high as 600,000 TON have effectively barred many institutions from directly participating in securing the network and earning staking rewards. Beyond the financial barrier, the operational complexities of existing staking methods on TON have also proven to be a deterrent. Manual processes for managing staking activities are inefficient and prone to errors, particularly when dealing with the large capital allocations typical of institutional investors. Furthermore, the scalability of traditional nominator contracts on TON has been limited, often capped at around 40 addresses per pool. This constraint makes it challenging for institutions with numerous clients or complex fund structures to efficiently manage their staking activities. Regulatory considerations add another layer of complexity. Institutions operate under strict compliance frameworks, and the lack of clearly defined and compliant staking solutions on TON has created uncertainty and hindered adoption. The absence of features like partial withdrawals, crucial for institutional treasury management, further compounds these challenges. In essence, while the potential of the TON network is undeniable, the existing staking infrastructure has not been adequately equipped to accommodate the specific needs and regulatory obligations of institutional participants. This is the precise gap that Chorus One’s TON Pool is meticulously designed to fill. TON Pool as Purpose-Built Solution for Institutional Investors Chorus One’s TON Pool emerges as a comprehensive and forward-thinking solution, specifically engineered to overcome the limitations of existing TON staking mechanisms and cater to the unique demands of institutional clients. At its core, TON Pool dramatically lowers the barrier to entry, allowing institutions to stake with a minimum of just 10 TON. This significantly contrasts with the prohibitive requirements of native validators, opening the door for a broader range of institutional participation. Scalability is another key differentiator of TON Pool. Its innovative architecture eliminates the 40-address cap inherent in traditional nominator contracts, enabling an unlimited number of delegators per pool. This feature is crucial for institutions managing multiple client portfolios or large, complex funds, providing the flexibility and efficiency required for seamless operations. Operational efficiency is further enhanced through the automation of critical staking processes. TON Pool automates validator selection and stake distribution, streamlining the entire staking lifecycle and reducing the need for manual intervention. This not only saves time and resources but also minimizes the risk of human error. Recognizing the importance of liquidity for institutional treasury management, TON Pool offers support for partial withdrawals, providing greater flexibility in managing staked assets. Crucially, TON Pool has been designed with regulatory compliance at the forefront. By opting for pure delegation and explicitly avoiding Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs), Chorus One ensures that TON Pool aligns with the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation, providing institutions with a compliant pathway to participate in network security and earn rewards. Security and transparency are also paramount. The TON Pool smart contracts have undergone a thorough audit by Sparebit, a testament to Chorus One’s commitment to providing a secure and reliable platform. Continuous optimizations are also in place to ensure optimal validator performance and maximize annualized rewards for delegators.",Information,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|REGULATION|TON,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-30 16:11:35

Here’s Why,https://timestabloid.com/dont-sell-yet-expert-warns-xrp-holders-heres-why/,"In a post shared by prominent crypto influencer Edo Farina, a sharp message was delivered to retail investors currently offloading their XRP holdings amid a minor market dip. According to Farina, the short-term panic over a mere 3% decline is shortsighted—and could cost investors dearly once the broader financial market shifts and XRP assumes its long-anticipated role as a foundational layer in global finance. Retail Capitulation Amid Small Corrections Over the past several days, XRP has experienced a moderate pullback of around 3%, causing concern among retail investors. Many have begun liquidating positions, fearing deeper losses. However, experienced analysts argue that such a dip is not only routine but expected in volatile markets, especially as macroeconomic uncertainties loom and digital asset regulations evolve. Retail is panicking, selling $XRP over a 3% dip. But when the market flips and XRP becomes The Standard, they’ll be begging to buy it back from you, at three-digit prices. Wall Street, Grayscale, BlackRock, they’ll be on their knees, desperate for what you HODL. Don’t give it… — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) April 30, 2025 Edo Farina, a respected voice in the XRP community, noted that this type of short-term thinking may soon backfire. His pointed observation: “Retail is panicking, selling XRP over a 3% dip. But when the market flips and XRP becomes The Standard, they’ll be begging to buy it back from you, at three-digit prices.” Institutional Interest in XRP Is Quietly Building Farina’s warning draws attention to the underlying institutional movements that many retail traders overlook. While small investors react emotionally to price volatility, power players like BlackRock, Grayscale, and other institutional giants are quietly exploring infrastructure to support digital assets like XRP. Though U.S. banks and major funds have not yet made formal public announcements regarding XRP integrations , various on-chain data and subtle corporate filings suggest these players are preparing for the possibility of using XRP in cross-border settlement, tokenization frameworks, and regulated digital asset markets.

While regulatory battles with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have created headwinds, the 2023 partial ruling from Judge Analisa Torres in favor of Ripple clarified that XRP is not a security when sold on exchanges—a major step toward legitimizing the asset. As the legal fog lifts and tokenized finance grows, experts believe XRP is well-positioned to become a pillar in the emerging digital economy. If this vision materializes, current market prices may look like a historic bargain in retrospect. Don’t Let Short-Term Fear Steal Long-Term Gains Farina’s post is more than just commentary—it’s a call for patience and strategic conviction . In his view, many of today’s sellers will regret capitulating when the financial infrastructure of tomorrow begins leaning on XRP. And if institutional demand spikes as anticipated, XRP holders could find themselves in a position of enormous leverage. “In the not-so-distant future,” Farina suggests, “Wall Street may be on its knees, desperate for what you HODL.” Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Everyone is talking about the next big crypto. Whether you’re scrolling through your Twitter feed or chatting with friends in the industry, there’s one thing that keeps popping up—presales. But here’s the kicker: a lot of people feel they’re missing out. It’s like watching a huge opportunity sail away, and you’re left wondering if you should’ve jumped on board. If you’ve been on the lookout for the best crypto presale to join in May 2025 , you’ve probably already heard about Qubetics, Gala, and Aptos. These three projects are making waves for a reason, and if you’re paying attention, you don’t want to miss the chance to learn about them. Now, here’s the twist: these aren’t just your average blockchain projects. We’re talking about Qubetics disrupting the way multi-chain wallets operate, Gala revolutionizing gaming with its blockchain-based ecosystem, and Aptos bringing a whole new level of scalability to the blockchain world. Let’s break down the latest updates on each and dive into what sets them apart. Qubetics: The Multi-Chain Game-Changer You Need to Know About When people talk about Qubetics, the buzz is real. This isn’t just another token presale; it’s a game-changer. Why? Because it focuses on solving the issues many blockchain projects haven’t fully addressed—multi-chain interoperability, security, and usability. With Qubetics, there is an entirely new approach to how businesses, professionals, and individuals interact with blockchain technology. Qubetics is developing a non-custodial, multi-chain wallet and ecosystem designed to give users control over their digital assets across multiple blockchain networks. But it doesn’t stop there. Qubetics is also launching QubeQode and the Qubetics IDE, powerful tools that enable businesses and developers to create decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts easily. This is about more than just crypto—it’s about providing the tools for the future of blockchain development. Why is Qubetics Exciting Right Now?

The excitement around Qubetics is contagious, and it’s only growing as the presale progresses. Current $TICS Price : $0.2093 per token (32nd presale stage). Analysts’ Predictions: At $1, a 377% ROI. At $5, a 2288% ROI. At $6, a 2766% ROI after mainnet launch. At $10, a 4677% ROI after mainnet launch. At $15, a 7066% ROI after mainnet launch. The ability to transact seamlessly across multiple blockchains without the need for third-party custodians will make Qubetics incredibly attractive to businesses, developers, and even regular users looking for a more secure and flexible way to manage their assets. This is a project that could reshape how blockchain ecosystems are connected—and that’s why it’s generating so much buzz. ​Gala Games Enhances Ecosystem Stability with Token Burn and Smart Contract Upgrade​ Gala Games has taken significant steps to bolster the stability and sustainability of its ecosystem. In response to recent security incidents, the platform announced the destruction of nearly 1 billion GALA tokens. This move was part of a broader governance proposal aimed at addressing unauthorized minting and ensuring the integrity of the token supply. By permanently removing these tokens from circulation, Gala Games aims to enhance the value and trustworthiness of its native currency, GALA.​ Additionally, Gala Games has completed a significant upgrade to its smart contract infrastructure. The transition to the new GALA token contract was executed smoothly, with support from numerous exchanges. This upgrade not only enhances the security and efficiency of the token but also lays the groundwork for future developments within the Gala Games ecosystem. The platform’s commitment to decentralization and community governance continues to drive its evolution in the blockchain gaming space.​ Aptos Blockchain Accelerates Growth with Strategic Partnerships and Technological Advancements​ Aptos is making significant strides in expanding its blockchain ecosystem, with a focus on scalability, interoperability, and developer engagement. The introduction of Zaptos, a new parallel pipeline architecture, aims to reduce latency and increase throughput, enhancing the performance of decentralized applications.

Hines also confirmed that the government is moving swiftly to establish a Strategic Bitcoin stockpile. Bitcoin Stockpile Plans In a recent interview with Bitcoin Magazine, the White House crypto advisor stated that countries around the world are quietly working to collect Bitcoin as a long-term asset, emphasizing that America aims to take the lead. According to him, the administration is collaborating with the Treasury Department to audit current Bitcoin holdings and design “budget-neutral” acquisition methods. He also clarified that no single policy approach is being pursued. Instead, multiple strategies are being explored to determine the most practical and efficient path forward. Hines expressed confidence in the U.S. Treasury Department and the Chamber of Commerce to develop “extremely creative” ways to accumulate the flagship cryptocurrency. The initial objective is to begin the process quickly, prioritizing speed and scalability, with additional steps to be introduced in phases. The crypto advisor has previously cited tariffs implemented by the president as a potential means for building federal Bitcoin reserves. When asked about how much Bitcoin the U.S. wants to acquire, Hines referred to it as “a silly question,” implying that the government has plans to hold more of the digital asset. Milestones and Bitcoin’s Value Reflecting on the first days of his administration, the 29-year-old highlighted early actions taken under President Trump, including an executive order signed during his first week in office. The directive created an interagency working group, officially ended what is widely known as “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” and led to major regulatory reversals. This included the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropping key lawsuits and banking regulators easing restrictions on crypto firms. The Trump administration also hosted the first-ever White House Crypto Summit. Hines stated that the U.S. is positioning itself to become “the crypto capital of the world,” aligning with the president’s broader vision to make America the most attractive destination for innovation in digital assets. The former Republican nominee was appointed in January 2025 to the newly formed crypto advisory group and serves alongside crypto czar David Sacks. Although he acknowledged the existence of other digital ecosystems, Hines emphasized that the main focus is on Bitcoin due to its uniqueness. He also referred to the cryptocurrency as “digital gold,” describing it as a commodity, not a security. Trump’s advisor referenced its origins and the concept of “Immaculate Conception,” a term previously used by David Sacks to show its intrinsic value.

The proposed institutions would offer services like digital asset exchange, storage, and transaction support in a regulated framework, according to The Astana Times. This sentiment was expressed by Prime Minister Olzhas Bektenov in a response to Parliament on April 25. These functions are already being partially handled by entities under the Astana International Financial Centre, including cryptocurrency exchanges, custodians, brokers, and digital asset platform operators. The government aims to expand these capabilities through upcoming legislative amendments designed to liberalize the circulation of digital assets and open access to a broader range of platforms. In January, ​​Kazakhstan announced plans to expand its legal crypto operations. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev called for urgent infrastructure improvements to support the digital asset sector. He noted that most crypto users operated in a “gray zone,” with only 5% using regulated platforms.

Bektenov emphasized that introducing crypto banks would increase Kazakhstan’s investment appeal and demonstrate the maturity of its financial infrastructure within the decentralized finance space. The move is also expected to create demand for new talent, particularly in compliance, blockchain analytics, and AML roles, while improving liquidity for both fiat and digital currencies in the AIFC.

Macroeconomic forces and currency movements often spill over into the crypto market, influencing investor sentiment and capital flows. A recent perspective from Citi, a major player in global finance, offers a significant view: they maintain a bearish USD outlook while anticipating a stronger Saudi Riyal (SAR). This divergence highlights important dynamics in the global economy and the Forex forecast . What Drives Citi’s Bearish USD Outlook? Citi’s position on the US Dollar isn’t isolated; it’s based on several factors analysts are watching closely. The general sentiment suggests that some of the tailwinds that previously supported the dollar may be fading. Here are some points contributing to this Citi forecast : Shifting Interest Rate Expectations: As other central banks potentially catch up or even surpass the pace of the Federal Reserve’s policy adjustments, the interest rate differential that favored the USD could narrow. Global Economic Rebalancing: A potential recovery or stabilization in other major economies could reduce the demand for the USD as a safe-haven asset. Fiscal and Debt Considerations: Ongoing discussions around US fiscal policy and national debt levels can sometimes weigh on currency sentiment. Reduced Safe-Haven Demand: If global risk sentiment improves, the need to hold assets perceived as safe, like the USD, might decrease. This perspective suggests that while the USD has shown resilience, its path forward may face headwinds, impacting overall currency trends . Why the Positive View on the Saudi Riyal? In contrast to their USD outlook , Citi’s view on the Saudi Riyal is more optimistic. The SAR is pegged to the US Dollar, which provides a degree of stability. However, the underlying strength comes from other factors: Oil Market Dynamics: Saudi Arabia is a major oil producer. Higher and stable oil prices significantly boost the nation’s revenues and economic stability, underpinning the value of the Riyal. Economic Diversification Efforts: The Kingdom’s ongoing efforts under Vision 2030 to diversify its economy away from oil can attract foreign investment and strengthen economic fundamentals. Strong Reserves: Saudi Arabia maintains substantial foreign exchange reserves, providing a buffer and supporting the peg to the USD. Fiscal Strength: Improved government finances due to oil revenues and fiscal reforms contribute to confidence in the economy and its currency. These factors contribute to a robust economic picture for Saudi Arabia, which supports the stable and potentially stronger standing of the Saudi Riyal within the pegged system, despite the broader USD outlook . How Do These Forex Forecasts Impact the Market? Citi’s Forex forecast is one of many, but it holds weight given their market presence. A bearish view on the USD suggests potential opportunities or risks in various currency pairs. If the USD weakens against a basket of currencies, it can influence global trade, commodity prices (often denominated in USD), and capital flows. For instance, a weaker USD could make commodities cheaper for buyers using other currencies. Conversely, a stronger Saudi Riyal , even within its peg, reflects underlying economic strength that can attract investment into the region. Considering Challenges and Risks to the Citi Forecast No Citi forecast is without potential challenges. Several factors could alter the expected path for both currencies: The USD outlook could change if: Global geopolitical tensions escalate, increasing safe-haven demand for the USD. The Federal Reserve maintains a tighter monetary policy for longer than anticipated. Other major economies face unexpected downturns. The Saudi Riyal outlook could face risks if: Oil prices experience a sharp and sustained decline. Global economic growth slows significantly, impacting demand for oil. Regional geopolitical stability deteriorates. These potential shifts underscore the dynamic nature of currency trends and the importance of monitoring global events. Actionable Insights from These Currency Trends For investors, including those in the crypto space who watch macro indicators, these currency trends offer insights: Firstly, a bearish USD outlook might influence investment decisions in assets sensitive to dollar strength, including potentially some commodities or even certain cryptocurrencies that sometimes move inversely to the dollar. Secondly, the positive view on the Saudi Riyal highlights the importance of oil market stability and regional economic strength. While direct SAR trading might be limited for many due to the peg, understanding the underlying economic health of a major global player like Saudi Arabia provides context for global economic conditions. Keeping an eye on major bank forecasts like this Citi forecast helps build a broader understanding of the financial landscape beyond just digital assets. Summary: Navigating Divergent Currency Paths Citi’s perspective offers a clear picture of potentially diverging paths for two important currencies: a challenging road ahead for the US Dollar and a stable, potentially strengthening position for the Saudi Riyal, supported by oil and economic reforms. This Forex forecast reminds us that global finance is interconnected, and understanding these major currency trends is vital for grasping the larger economic forces at play.

The city of Roswell, New Mexico, is putting that question to the test. They’ve officially kicked off their ambitious new initiative, the Roswell Strategic Bitcoin Reserve , with an unexpected, yet significant, anonymous contribution. This move positions Roswell as a pioneer in exploring the potential of digital assets at the municipal level. What is a City Bitcoin Reserve and Why Consider One? The concept of a city holding cryptocurrency, specifically Bitcoin, in its treasury might sound futuristic, but it’s gaining traction globally. A City Bitcoin Reserve is essentially a portion of a municipality’s financial holdings allocated to Bitcoin. The motivations behind such a move can be multifaceted: Inflation Hedge: With concerns about traditional currency devaluation, some view Bitcoin as a potential store of value with a capped supply, offering a hedge against inflation over the long term. Innovation and Technology Adoption: Embracing digital assets signals a city’s forward-thinking approach and can attract tech-savvy businesses and residents. Diversification: Adding a non-correlated asset like Bitcoin to a traditional treasury portfolio could potentially reduce overall risk and enhance returns over time, although this comes with its own volatility risks. New Funding Sources: Crypto donations or even future yield generation from assets could provide alternative revenue streams for public services. Roswell’s decision to establish a Bitcoin Reserve appears to be rooted in the desire to create a dedicated fund for specific community benefits, leveraging the potential long-term appreciation of Bitcoin. Roswell Bitcoin : The Anonymous Beginning The genesis of Roswell’s Municipal Crypto journey is particularly intriguing. According to reports, the reserve was seeded with a donation of 0.0305 BTC. While this amount translated to approximately $2,906 at the time of the city’s formal acknowledgment on April 29th, its true value lies in being the foundational piece of a larger strategy. What’s fascinating is that the donation originated from an anonymous address back on January 3rd. The time lag between the initial transaction and the city’s official receipt highlights some of the unique processes involved when a public entity interacts with decentralized digital assets. It requires careful verification, policy implementation, and secure handling before the asset can be formally integrated into the city’s treasury management system. This anonymous kick-off for the Roswell Bitcoin reserve adds an element of mystery and underscores the borderless nature of cryptocurrency transactions. How Will Roswell’s Crypto Treasury Fund Be Used? The city has clearly defined the initial purpose of its newly formed Crypto Treasury . The funds generated from the reserve are earmarked for vital community programs, specifically: Providing subsidies for water bills for local senior citizens. Supporting emergency disaster relief efforts within the city. This focus on tangible community benefits makes Roswell’s Bitcoin Reserve unique. It’s not just about holding an asset; it’s about leveraging its potential growth to directly impact the lives of residents. The city has also outlined a clear long-term vision: The initial donation and any future contributions will be held for a minimum of 10 years. This demonstrates a commitment to a long-term investment horizon, acknowledging Bitcoin’s historical volatility but banking on its potential for significant appreciation over a decade. Once the value of the reserve surpasses $1 million, it may transition into a dedicated emergency fund. This threshold provides a clear target and purpose for the fund’s growth, positioning it as a safety net for unforeseen crises. This structured approach to managing the Municipal Crypto asset, with defined use cases and long-term goals, is crucial for transparency and public trust. Challenges and Opportunities for Municipal Crypto Initiatives While the establishment of a City Bitcoin Reserve presents exciting opportunities, it also comes with significant challenges that municipalities must carefully navigate. Opportunities: Potential for Significant Growth: As seen with Bitcoin’s historical performance, the potential for substantial returns exists, which could greatly amplify the impact of the reserve on community programs. Attracting Investment and Talent: Being at the forefront of digital asset adoption can enhance a city’s reputation as innovative and forward-thinking, potentially attracting tech companies and skilled workers. Diversification: Adding Bitcoin can diversify a city’s treasury holdings beyond traditional low-yield or inflation-susceptible assets. Challenges: Price Volatility: Bitcoin’s price can fluctuate dramatically, posing risks to the value of the reserve in the short to medium term. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, which can create legal and compliance challenges for public entities. Security Risks: Holding digital assets requires robust security measures to prevent theft or loss, demanding technical expertise that many municipalities may lack. Public Perception: There may be skepticism or misunderstanding among the public regarding the use of taxpayer-adjacent funds (even if initially donation-based) in volatile assets like Bitcoin. Custody and Management: Securely storing and managing the private keys for the Bitcoin requires specialized knowledge and infrastructure, whether done in-house or through third-party custodians. Roswell’s decision to hold the asset for a minimum of 10 years indicates an awareness of the volatility challenge and a focus on long-term potential rather than short-term gains. Beyond Roswell Bitcoin : The Future of Public Sector Crypto Adoption Roswell isn’t the only entity exploring the world of Municipal Crypto and Crypto Treasury management, although they may be one of the first cities to establish a dedicated reserve for specific community aid purposes seeded by a donation. Other cities and even states have looked into accepting crypto for tax payments (like Arizona or Colorado proposed) or exploring blockchain technology for various civic functions. Miami’s Mayor Suarez has been a vocal proponent of making Miami a crypto hub, exploring initiatives like MiamiCoin (though this is different from holding Bitcoin directly in the city treasury). These examples, alongside Roswell’s initiative, suggest a growing interest in how digital assets and blockchain technology can intersect with public finance and city administration. The success or challenges faced by the Roswell Bitcoin reserve over the coming years will likely serve as a case study for other municipalities considering similar ventures. It raises important questions about policy, security, transparency, and the role of volatile assets in public funds. Actionable Insights for Municipalities Considering Crypto For other cities watching Roswell’s experiment, here are some key takeaways: Start Small and Define Purpose: Like Roswell, begin with a manageable amount (perhaps via donations) and clearly define the goals for the fund. Develop Clear Policy: Establish comprehensive policies regarding acceptance, custody, management, and use of digital assets before receiving them. Prioritize Security: Invest in robust security measures or partner with reputable custodians to protect the assets. Seek Expertise: Consult with legal, financial, and technical experts familiar with cryptocurrency and public finance regulations. Educate Stakeholders: Ensure city officials, staff, and the public understand the nature of the assets and the strategy behind holding them. Focus on Long-Term Strategy: Given volatility, a long-term holding period aligns better with the nature of assets like Bitcoin. Conclusion: A Small Step, A Giant Leap for Municipal Crypto ? Roswell, New Mexico, famous for its extraterrestrial legends, is now making headlines for a different kind of pioneering effort – establishing a strategic Bitcoin Reserve . Kicked off by a modest anonymous donation, this initiative is more than just acquiring a digital asset; it’s about exploring innovative ways to fund vital community services like senior water bill subsidies and disaster relief. By committing to a minimum 10-year hold and setting a $1 million threshold for emergency funding, Roswell is taking a deliberate, long-term approach to Crypto Treasury management. While challenges related to volatility, regulation, and security remain, this move signals a bold willingness to adapt to the evolving financial landscape. The Roswell Bitcoin story is just beginning, but it serves as a compelling example of how municipalities might start leveraging digital assets for public good. The world will be watching to see if this small reserve in the Land of Enchantment can indeed grow into a significant resource, paving the way for other cities to consider the potential of Municipal Crypto .

ChatGPT and Grok Make Shocking Statement",https://timestabloid.com/xlm-or-xrp-which-is-best-swift-replacement-chatgpt-and-grok-make-shocking-statement/,"Artificial intelligence models from xAI and OpenAI have independently assessed which blockchain networks are best positioned to replace or complement the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), a system that has long served as the backbone of international financial communication. Their evaluations consistently highlight the XRP Ledger and Stellar (XLM) as standout candidates. SWIFT connects over 11,000 financial institutions across the globe, but it faces criticism for high transaction fees, slow processing times, and its centralized infrastructure. As interest in blockchain-based alternatives grows, both Grok AI and ChatGPT examined the capabilities of several platforms based on essential metrics such as transaction efficiency, interoperability, adoption rates, and regulatory compatibility. XRP Ledger Named Leading Option by Grok AI According to Grok’s analysis , the XRP Ledger ranks as the most practical blockchain to serve as a SWIFT replacement. It cited XRPL’s rapid settlement times, typically between three and five seconds, and extremely low transaction costs, which are just a fraction of a cent. This marks a significant improvement over SWIFT’s average processing time of one to five business days and its fees, which can range from $15 to $50 per transaction. Additionally, Grok highlighted XRPL’s processing capacity of approximately 1,500 transactions per second, supported by Ripple’s growing payments ecosystem. RippleNet currently includes over 300 financial institutions such as Santander, Standard Chartered, and American Express, suggesting real-world traction in cross-border finance. Grok also emphasized XRPL’s compatibility with legacy financial systems and its decentralized validation system, which reduces the risks associated with centralized control. Nonetheless, it noted that unresolved regulatory issues, especially in the United States, along with a smaller institutional user base compared to SWIFT, may present short-term limitations. Stellar Recognized as a Strong Secondary Option Stellar (XLM) received recognition as a viable alternative, particularly for regional and remittance-focused applications. Transactions on the Stellar network typically settle within two to five seconds, and transaction costs are negligible, averaging around 0.00001 XLM. The network handles about 1,000 transactions per second and has been integrated into several prominent initiatives, including IBM’s World Wire and MoneyGram. Grok pointed out that while Stellar’s institutional reach does not yet rival Ripple’s, the platform’s adoption in emerging markets and among fintech firms, such as Lightnet, which aims to modernize payments in Asia, underscores its potential. Other Blockchain Platforms Considered Grok also identified Hedera Hashgraph, Ethereum (with Layer-2 scaling), and the XDC Network as supplementary technologies rather than full replacements. Hedera offers impressive transaction throughput (up to 10,000 TPS) and utilizes an asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerant (aBFT) consensus mechanism. It is supported by organizations like Google and IBM. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Ethereum was acknowledged for its smart contract capabilities, especially in Layer-2 environments like Arbitrum and Optimism, though concerns were raised about its higher transaction fees and latency. The XDC Network was noted for its alignment with ISO 20022 standards and focus on trade finance. ChatGPT Also Endorses XRPL OpenAI’s ChatGPT reached a similar conclusion, noting that any platform aiming to replace SWIFT must excel in areas such as global interoperability, security, speed, compliance, privacy, and reliability. It identified the XRP Ledger as a frontrunner due to its integrated messaging and settlement functions, as well as its ongoing use by institutions such as Santander and SBI Holdings. ChatGPT acknowledged that XRPL is already demonstrating its capabilities as an operational alternative to traditional systems, citing its widespread financial network and performance under real-world conditions. Stellar and Other Solutions Highlighted Stellar was again acknowledged for its strengths in facilitating quick, affordable international transfers. ChatGPT emphasized its active use in remittances and currency exchange but noted its more limited institutional reach compared to Ripple. Other technologies that ChatGPT mentioned include Quant’s Overledger, which enables interoperability between blockchains and legacy systems, as well as private Ethereum implementations like ConsenSys Quorum, currently being tested by institutions including JPMorgan . Corda by R3 and Hyperledger Fabric were also referenced for their enterprise-level applications, though ChatGPT categorized them more as complementary systems. Both AI models concluded that the XRP Ledger is the most suitable blockchain platform to replace or enhance SWIFT, with Stellar standing as a credible secondary option. While other technologies offer specialized capabilities, XRPL’s current adoption, transaction efficiency, and alignment with institutional needs place it at the forefront of potential blockchain-based alternatives for cross-border financial messaging.

Cryptocurrency exchanges constantly strive to build confidence with their users. A significant development emerged from TOKEN2049 Dubai recently, where the global crypto exchange KuCoin announced a groundbreaking initiative aimed squarely at these crucial areas: the “Trust Plan.” Understanding the KuCoin Trust Plan: A $2 Billion Commitment At the prestigious TOKEN2049 Dubai event, KuCoin made waves by unveiling its ambitious “Trust Plan.” This isn’t just a strategic roadmap; it comes with a substantial financial backing. The exchange has pledged a staggering $2 billion investment dedicated to significantly enhancing several core pillars of its platform and ecosystem. The primary goals outlined include: Platform Security: Strengthening defenses against potential threats and vulnerabilities. Transparency: Increasing openness in operations and user fund management. Compliance: Deepening collaboration with global regulatory bodies to meet evolving standards. KCS Ecosystem Development: Fostering growth and utility for the KuCoin Token (KCS). This multi-faceted approach signals KuCoin ‘s commitment to building a more reliable and secure environment for its millions of users worldwide. According to reports, the plan involves bolstering core infrastructure and actively engaging with regulators across different jurisdictions. Why is Crypto Security More Important Than Ever? The digital asset landscape, while offering unprecedented opportunities, also presents unique risks. Incidents involving hacks, exploits, and regulatory uncertainties have unfortunately become part of the narrative. For a leading crypto exchange like KuCoin, maintaining robust security is not just a feature; it’s a necessity for survival and growth. Users entrust exchanges with their valuable digital assets, and any breach of that trust can have severe consequences for both the platform and its community. The increasing sophistication of cyber threats requires continuous investment in cutting-edge security measures. Furthermore, as the industry matures, regulators globally are paying closer attention, demanding higher standards of compliance and transparency from exchanges. The KuCoin Trust Plan directly addresses these critical challenges head-on, aiming to set a higher benchmark for the industry. Diving Deeper into KuCoin’s Investment Strategy A $2 billion investment is a considerable sum. Where exactly is this capital likely to be deployed under the KuCoin Trust Plan ? While specific breakdowns weren’t fully detailed in the initial announcement, the core pillars provide a strong indication: Technological Infrastructure: Upgrading and reinforcing trading engines, wallet systems, and overall network architecture to withstand high volume and potential attacks. This includes investing in advanced encryption, multi-signature technologies, and cold storage solutions. Security Personnel & Practices: Hiring top-tier cybersecurity experts, conducting regular audits, penetration testing, and implementing stringent internal security protocols. Compliance & Legal Teams: Expanding teams dedicated to navigating complex global regulations, obtaining licenses where necessary, and ensuring adherence to KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) standards. User Education Initiatives: Developing resources and programs to help users understand common scams, phishing attempts, and best practices for securing their own accounts. A secure platform is most effective when paired with security-aware users. KCS Ecosystem Development: Investing in projects built on or integrated with the KCS ecosystem, potentially through grants, partnerships, and development support, increasing the utility and value proposition of the KCS token. This comprehensive strategy suggests KuCoin is looking beyond just reactive security measures, aiming for a proactive and holistic approach that includes regulatory collaboration and community empowerment. TOKEN2049 Dubai: The Ideal Venue for a Trust Announcement? Announcing the “Trust Plan” at TOKEN2049 Dubai was a strategic move. TOKEN2049 is one of the largest and most influential global crypto events, attracting industry leaders, policymakers, investors, and enthusiasts from around the world. Making such a significant commitment on this international stage amplifies the message and underscores KuCoin ‘s position as a major player in the space. The event provides a platform for networking and dialogue, facilitating the very collaboration with global regulators and industry partners that the Trust Plan emphasizes. It allowed KuCoin to directly communicate its vision for a more secure and transparent future to a key audience. What Does This Mean for KuCoin Users? For the everyday trader or investor on the platform, the KuCoin Trust Plan is designed to translate into tangible benefits: Increased Confidence: Knowing that the exchange is making substantial investments in security can provide greater peace of mind when trading and storing assets. Enhanced Platform Stability: Improved infrastructure should lead to a more reliable and faster trading experience. Clearer Regulatory Landscape: KuCoin’s focus on compliance aims to ensure the platform operates within legal frameworks, potentially reducing uncertainty for users in various regions. Potential KCS Growth: Development within the KCS ecosystem could lead to new features, increased demand, and potential value appreciation for KCS holders. While challenges in the regulatory space and the constant evolution of security threats remain, this investment signals a serious effort to address these issues head-on. Challenges and the Path Forward While the $2 billion pledge is impressive, the success of the KuCoin Trust Plan ultimately hinges on execution. Navigating the fragmented and rapidly changing global regulatory environment is a significant challenge. Ensuring the deployed capital is used effectively to stay ahead of increasingly sophisticated cyber threats requires constant vigilance and adaptation. However, the clear articulation of goals – security, transparency, compliance, and ecosystem growth – provides a solid framework. The commitment announced at TOKEN2049 Dubai sets a high bar and signals KuCoin ‘s intent to be a leader in building a trusted digital asset future. Conclusion: A Step Towards a More Secure Crypto Future KuCoin’s $2 billion investment in its “Trust Plan,” announced at TOKEN2049 Dubai, represents a significant commitment to enhancing platform security, transparency, and compliance. By focusing on these critical areas and fostering the growth of the KCS ecosystem, KuCoin aims to build a more reliable and trustworthy environment for its global user base. This strategic move is a positive step not just for KuCoin, but potentially for raising security and trust standards across the entire crypto exchange industry.

Polkadot ( DOT ) token was trading at $4, a few points above the crucial support at $3.63, where it has failed to break below since 2023. According to data from Santiment, the number of commits in the network jumped to 53.6 on Wednesday, the highest level since April 14. That marked a significant increase from this month’s low of 31.8. Meanwhile, seven-day development activity rose by 25.7% to 314. Polkadot developer activity | Source: Santiment Similarly, activity in Kusama ( KSM ), its canary network, also jumped by over 25% in the same period. These numbers make Polkadot and Kusama some of the most active chains in terms of Github activity after Internet Computer (ICP), Filecoin ( FIL ), and Cardano ( ADA ). You might also like: Can Cardano price rebound as staking inflows jump by $215m? This uptick in development is likely linked to the ongoing transition to Polkadot 2.0. Two of the three major components have already been implemented: agile coretime and asynchronous backing. Agile coretime replaces the parachain slot auction system with an on-demand blockspace model, while asynchronous backing reduces block time to just six seconds. Developers are now working on the third phase: elastic scaling, which introduces dynamic resource allocation, allowing parachains to scale based on demand. Polkadot price technical analysis DOT price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the DOT price bottomed around $3.5, where it has failed to drop since November 2023. It has formed a triple-bottom chart pattern whose neckline is at $11.70, its highest swing on December 2 last year. The last time Polkadot dropped to this level was in November, after which it surged by 187%. Prior to that, it rebounded nearly 200% to its peak on March 13, 2023. The two lines of the Percentage Price Oscillator have formed a bullish crossover. Additionally, the Relative Strength Index has been trending upward. Therefore, the outlook for Polkadot is bullish, with the key target being the December high at $11.63. This bullish view remains intact as long as DOT holds above the support level at $3.50.

43994780,https://blockworks.co/news/ubisoft-layerzero-blockchain-network-crypto-game,1746034318,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/blockworks.png,"Ubisoft, LayerZero launch network for migrating crypto game assets",https://blockworks.co/news/ubisoft-layerzero-blockchain-network-crypto-game,"This is a segment from The Drop newsletter. To read full editions, subscribe . Remember the “interoperability” gaming dream? Ubisoft is spinning up a Decentralized Verification Network (DVN) to verify crypto assets that are being moved or bridged from one blockchain to another. The company is using LayerZero’s tech — more specifically, its codebase and omnichain messaging protocol — in the deal. The game studio is running its own clients and nodes for its network, however. The DVN means Ubisoft can let players move their NFTs and in-game currencies from one chain to another, which makes them usable with other Ubisoft crypto games (or external games or platforms). It could also make complete migrations from one chain to another easier if Ubisoft ever decided to move one of its blockchain games. Ubisoft may enable cross-chain bridging soon for its fantasy turn-based RPG Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles, which launched using the Oasys EVM blockchain in October 2024. Last year — months before the game launched — LayerZero said it was adding support for Oasys with the end goal of making Champions Tactics “omnichain.” Now, it sounds like that’s actually possible. LayerZero’s tech turns assets in transit into Omnichain NFTs ( ONFTs ) or Omnichain fungible tokens (OFTs). ONFTs could be assets like in-game items, while OFTs could be used for in-game currencies. Ubisoft will be able to decide the cost of bridging assets for users, LayerZero Labs CEO and cofounder Bryan Pellegrino told Blockworks in an interview. LayerZero tech makes all costs upfront, so that no surprise tokens are required for bridging. The DVN is intended to be easier to use than a traditional crypto bridge, which can require multiple currencies across multiple chains and anywhere from a few minutes to a week to complete bridging an asset depending on the chain. Pellegrino believes crypto gaming is moving toward becoming a “broader, much more liquid ecosystem,” and that enabling more asset movement between chains is a step toward that vision. We don’t yet know which chains Ubisoft plans to support with its DVN. But given its existing and upcoming games use Oasys and Immutable zkEVM, respectively, those may be two of the options if Ubisoft adds a bridging feature to Champions Tactics, for example. LayerZero currently supports over 130 blockchains including Ethereum and Solana. Ubisoft’s Nicolas Pouard, VP of the studio’s Strategic Innovation Lab, has previously said their goal is to be chain-agnostic — which a DVN supporting dozens to over a hundred chains would certainly enable. After I previously reported that Ubisoft’s next crypto game is likely a trading card game (TCG) using Immutable’s zkEVM, Ubisoft and Immutable announced that they’re rebooting Might and Magic as a crypto TCG. “Long term, the goal is that, you know, the user doesn’t think about a chain at all. They don’t think about gas at all. Their wallets are just dollar-denominated. Everything is just abstracted in the backend,” Pellegrino said, adding: “Users aren’t going to think about chains and RPCs for too much longer.” Get the news in your inbox.

Solana’s pump.fun has spawned over 7 million low-effort tokens since 2021. Stablecoins near $240 billion cap as altcoins bleed value. The crypto market is overflowing with tokens, and most won’t survive. A new Coingecko report shows that 3.7 million cryptocurrencies have failed since 2021. Nearly half of these collapses happened between 2024 and early 2025. Why Did 1.8 Million Tokens Collapse in Early 2025? The first quarter of 2025 alone saw 1.8 million token failures, accounting for 49.7% of all recorded shutdowns. Over 52% of cryptocurrencies launched between 2021 and now have collapsed. Source: CoinGecko This surge in failed projects coincided with heightened market instability following Donald Trump’s presidential inauguration in January 2025. The event triggered a downturn that exposed the fragility of many newly launched, low-effort coins. Politically-themed joke coins were hit hardest. Tokens like $MELANIA (Melania Trump-themed) and Libra, linked to Argentina’s President Javier Milei, suffered catastrophic losses, each declining more than 95% in value. Nansen reported that 86% of Libra token traders, around 15,430 wallets, collectively lost over $251 million. How Pump.fun Fueled the Memecoin Graveyard According to Coingecko, the rapid expansion of meme coins greatly contributed to recent cryptocurrency market instability. Between 2021 and 2025, the number of tracked crypto projects grew from 428,383 to nearly 7 million. BREAKING: PUMPFUN MEMECOINS ARE DUMPING HARD WITH LESS 1% SURVIVAL RATE UTILITY SUPERCYCLE IS COMING! pic.twitter.com/6F9fOZvXJZ — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) March 14, 2025 This growth was largely facilitated by platforms like Pump.fun, a Solana-based service that simplified token creation down to a few clicks, requiring no demonstration of utility or sustainable design. During the peak “Meme Season 2024” period, Solana-based meme tokens generated billions in daily trading volume. However, Coingecko data reveals that of the 3 million+ crypto tokens launched that year, over 1.3 million have already failed. These conditions have spurred w idespread criticism of the crypto industry’s unchecked token creation culture. The ease of launching coins, many without whitepapers, clear roadmaps, or real-world use cases, has diluted the market and undermined investor confidence. Nearly 1.4 million tokens launched in 2024 are dead. Source: CoinGecko Aside from memecoins, the NFT market, once at the forefront of Web3 development in 2022, has seen its cultural relevance fade . This downturn has contributed to broader concerns about the cryptocurrency industry’s ability to develop and maintain substantive, enduring applications beyond speculative trading. Are Stablecoins the Only Reliable Crypto Bet Now? From just 66 coins in 2013 to millions today , the 13,573% rise in token creation has not been matched by long-term viability. Unlike past bull runs in 2017 and 2021, where altcoins rallied en masse, the current market has seen most altcoins remain down at least 40% from their prior all-time highs. Why ALTSEASON is delayed ? In 2013-2014 – 500 tokens In 2017-2018 – 3,000 tokens In 2021 – 300k- 3M tokens Today in 2025 – 36.4 million Tokens and expected to reach 100 million. Market is Diluted AF, Exchanges only listing memes to grab volume and grow their user base.… pic.twitter.com/kf6ov8owGe — Ash Crypto (@Ashcryptoreal) January 26, 2025 This stagnation has tarnished the broader image of the crypto sector. Traditional investors now see crypto as just a “pump-and-dump arena” — and the data backs their skepticism. As a result, cautious capital tends to concentrate on blue-chip assets like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, and Solana, which are also in negative YTD territory. Amid the chaos, stablecoins have emerged as one of the most robust crypto use cases. As of April 29, the total stablecoin market cap reached $240 billion , nearing an all-time high. Tether (USDT) holds the majority, with a 61.92% market share, followed by USDC, USDe, and DAI. Even traditional finance is taking note. In a recent report, Citigroup projected that the stablecoin market could exceed $2 trillion by 2030, assuming regulatory clarity and continued adoption. Citigroup has projected a rise in stablecoin market, forecasting its total market cap to soar from $240 billion to $2 trillion by 2030. #Stablecoin #Citigroup https://t.co/tGNT3XfNC0 — Cryptonews.com (@cryptonews) April 25, 2025 Even Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller acknowledged their potential, stating that U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins could support the dollar’s international dominance. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Why did Trump’s inauguration trigger a memecoin crash? The crypto community expected Trump to mention digital assets or announce pro-crypto policies. When he omitted any reference to cryptocurrencies or Bitcoin, traders saw this as government indifference. This triggered massive sell-offs, and the price slump was particularly felt in politically themed memecoins that had rallied in anticipation. Which blockchain has the highest token failure rate? Solana currently has the highest token failure rate. Its low fees and easy-to-use tools like Pump.fun enabled a flood of low-quality memecoins. While Ethereum sees failures too, Solana’s combination of accessibility and hype create perfect conditions for disposable tokens, and many projects vanish within weeks as creators cash out, leaving investors helpless. Do dead crypto tokens impact Bitcoin and Ethereum prices? Dead tokens mainly damage confidence in speculative altcoins rather than major assets. While Bitcoin and Ethereum may see brief dips during mass sell-offs, their prices typically recover quickly.

Investors are closely watching these two cryptocurrencies for their next big moves. Could this be the perfect moment to buy in? This analysis delves into the factors fueling their momentum and what could be expected in the near future. Discover which coins are set for a leap. Filecoin Market: Recent Setbacks With Cautious Near-Term Outlook Filecoin shows a slight weekly lift of 0.70% yet a 1-month loss of nearly 1% against a deeper 6-month drop of 22.59%. Price action over these periods indicates diminishing momentum and growing bearish pressure. Trends in the last month and half-year signal that cautious sentiment has prevailed despite occasional upward attempts. Current trading sees price moving between $2.29 and $3.44. Resistance stands near $4.10 with a further cap at $5.25, while support is found at $1.79 and then at $0.64. Indicators such as a neutral RSI and slightly negative oscillators point to no strong trend. Trading within these levels appears balanced between bulls and bears, presenting opportunities for short-term moves. Chainlink Steady Growth with Emerging Bull Strength Chainlink experienced an 8.85% rise in the past month and a strong 28.21% gain over the last six months, accompanied by a weekly increase of 3.21%. This performance indicates consistent investor interest and a gradual buildup of market confidence over time. Chainlink is currently trading between $11 and $16, with a notable resistance level at around $20 and support near $8. The market shows a slight bullish leaning, as indicated by the RSI at 57 and positive moving average signals. Price movements within these levels present a cautious trading opportunity for buyers looking to capitalize on emerging momentum, while remaining vigilant for potential reversals near critical support and resistance areas. Conclusion FIL and LINK are showing signs of significant movement. Recent developments in their technology and partnerships point to potential growth. Market interest is increasing, suggesting traders are paying attention. Watching the price trends and upcoming news could offer insights. Decisions should be based on individual research and timing.

The Open Network (TON) Foundation has recently partnered with Libre, a company focused on tokenizing real-world assets, to create a new $500 million bond fund. This new initiative is called the Telegram Bond Fund. It offers a fresh way for investors to invest in traditional bonds using the TON blockchain, bringing traditional finance into the world of crypto. Telegram to Use Blockchain to Offer Traditional Bond The Telegram Bond Fund marks TON’s first major move into the growing sector of real-world asset tokenization (RWA). The new fund brings part of Telegram’s existing bonds onto the blockchain. Telegram currently has over $2 billion in outstanding bonds. This move allows institutional and accredited investors to access traditional financial assets using a decentralized platform. The fund is designed to support Telegram’s current and future bond offerings in a way that follows financial rules and uses trusted blockchain tools. How the System Works Libre’s infrastructure makes this possible. The company’s system is built to let investors use tokenized bonds as collateral in decentralized finance platforms. This opens the door for developers on TON to create new financial products that use these real-world bonds to generate returns. Investors can subscribe to the bond fund using regular fiat currencies or stablecoins. They can also manage their bond investments directly through wallets built into the TON blockchain. This makes it easier for people to interact with the system in a user-friendly and secure way. The new fund shows how traditional finance can work with blockchain technology . By working together, TON and Libre bring real-world financial products to the digital space. The Role of Libre’s Gateway System Libre is building a new system called Gateway. This system will handle important tasks such as subscriptions, redemptions, and fund transfers. It is designed in several stages to ensure it follows all rules and is easy to use. This setup allows investors worldwide to access real-world assets safely through a digital platform. Libre already has experience in this field. The company has tokenized over $200 million in assets and runs several active funds that hold millions of dollars in well-known financial products.

Unveiled ahead of TOKEN2049 Dubai, the FLOKI Minibot M1 is powered by RICE AI, Rice Robotics’ decentralized AI protocol. This small but capable robot can handle day-to-day tasks like managing grocery lists, scheduling household chores, and even providing bedtime stories or dancing to your favorite music — all while adapting to your personality and preferences over time. But the innovation doesn’t stop at the hardware. As part of the rollout, Rice Robotics will also launch the $RICE token, the main utility token of the RICE AI protocol. The token integrates real-world usage with on-chain incentives. Users of the FLOKI Minibot M1 will earn $RICE tokens through interaction — turning ordinary conversations and commands into valuable AI training data, and rewarding users for participation in the ecosystem. According to Rice, the $RICE token will be launched through the TokenFi Launchpad, allowing $TOKEN stakers to participate in the early sale. Additionally, airdrops are coming for both $FLOKI and $TOKEN holders, adding to the growing utility behind the FLOKI ecosystem. The $RICE token will serve various functions within the RICE AI ecosystem, including access to premium features, AI upgrades, and data exchange within decentralized physical AI networks. Rice Robotics, known for its work with top-tier clients like Nvidia, SoftBank, Mitsui Fudosan, and 7-Eleven Japan, is no stranger to real-world deployment. Their robots are already in use in offices, shopping centers, and urban infrastructure across Japan, Dubai, and Hong Kong. Softbank, notably, is also a key player behind President Trump’s $500 billion Stargate Initiative, aimed at building AI infrastructure across the U.S. Rice’s involvement further signals the blend between policy, AI, and tokenized economies. This collaboration marks the next big chapter in decentralized physical AI (DePAI), a concept where robots can learn, share data, and self-upgrade using blockchain-backed protocols. FLOKI Goes Big at TOKEN2049 FLOKI is making its mark as an official Gold Sponsor of TOKEN2049 Dubai, one of the world’s premier crypto events scheduled for April 30–May 1, 2025.

FLOKI’s strong presence at the event reflects its expanding ecosystem and bold push into utility-driven innovation. As part of its sponsorship, FLOKI branding will feature across venue signage, tables, and marketing campaigns. The project’s Community Relations Officer will also deliver a keynote on the IO NET Stage titled “How utility will shape the memecoin revolution.” The event will culminate in “AFTER 2049,” the official closing party, also sponsored by FLOKI.

Several key U.S. macroeconomic indicators today painted a picture of stagnant growth and persistent inflationary pressures, adding to uncertainty in financial markets. The latest ADP report showed private sector job creation slowing significantly in April. Only 62,000 new jobs were added, well below expectations of 108,000 and well below March’s 147,000. At the same time, U.S. first-quarter GDP unexpectedly shrank by 0.3%, marking the first negative quarterly growth since 2022. Economists had forecast a modest 0.2% expansion. Meanwhile, inflation data from the Fed’s preferred indicator, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE), presented a mixed picture. March PCE rose 2.3% annually, slightly ahead of expectations of 2.2%, while Core PCE, which excludes food and energy prices, came in at 2.6% annually, in line with expectations and down from February’s revised 3.0%. The combination of slow growth and steady inflation has revived talk of stagflation and led to speculation that the Fed may be forced to ease monetary policy sooner than expected. Related News: JUST IN: Important Listing News from Coinbase - One Has Been Long Awaited “Fed funds futures reflect the increasing likelihood of 4+ rate cuts this year as the Fed navigates clear signs of declining inflation and an economic slowdown,” David Hernandez, crypto investment expert at 21Shares, told The Verge. “This delicate balancing act will be at the core of market dynamics in the coming weeks.” Bitcoin briefly dropped below $94,000 after the economic data was released, falling 1% on the day. However, some analysts say lower interest rates and a softer U.S. dollar could pave the way for a new rally in cryptocurrency markets. “A weaker dollar, better liquidity from looser monetary policy, and lower Treasury yields present a more supportive macro backdrop for Bitcoin,” said Dr. Kirill Kretov, senior automation expert at CoinPanel. Kretov also noted that President Donald Trump’s increasing pressure on the Fed to cut interest rates, combined with easing tariff concerns and weak liquidity in crypto markets, could amplify the impact of any dovish policy changes. “A dovish shift looks even more likely when we factor in the surprise -0.3% GDP print,” Kretov said. “Even modest inflows could send BTC sharply higher. This market is poised for upside but is also extremely sensitive to macro changes.” *This is not investment advice.

FIFA Rivals, a mobile game developed by Mythical Games, marks FIFA’s push into blockchain gaming with player-owned assets and real-time gameplay. FIFA Collect will migrate to a new EVM-compatible infrastructure, the FIFA Blockchain, beginning no earlier than May 20. According to a migration notice published by the platform, the update will support future features and enhance scalability while maintaining users’ access to existing collectibles. Wallet Support Shifts Toward EVM Standards Assets purchased before the migration will be moved automatically unless they were previously exported. Those who have moved collectibles off-platform must reimport them before the migration date to ensure they’re included in the transition. Users will not need to take immediate action. FIFA said it will issue clear instructions as the process begins, with a 12-hour service downtime expected during the switch. Collectibles already listed on the platform will remain listed unless users choose to delist them. The FIFA Blockchain will also change wallet compatibility. Algorand-based wallets like Pera and Defly will no longer be supported. Instead, users will need to connect using MetaMask or any WalletConnect-compatible EVM wallet. Balances in USDC will remain available for withdrawal post-migration, but cannot be spent on the platform after the move. FIFA also confirmed that no fees will be charged for migrating existing assets. According to the FAQ, the infrastructure shift is designed to support wallet compatibility and lay the groundwork for new product experiences. FIFA Builds Out Ecosystem In 2024, the announcement of FIFA Rivals marked the beginning of FIFA’s push into blockchain gaming. The mobile title is being developed by Mythical Games and will feature free-to-play, real-time arcade gameplay where players manage teams and compete globally. Skill, style, and pure football! FIFA Rivals takes over this summer, watch the trailer now! #FIFARivals pic.twitter.com/VZ8lfJkC0m — FIFA Rivals (@FIFARivals) March 13, 2025 The game will operate on the Mythos blockchain, which runs on the Polkadot network. It draws from Mythical’s experience with NFL Rivals, a similar game that has amassed millions of users despite a smaller sports audience. FIFA Rivals will also incorporate features that allow players to own and trade in-game items. These mechanics follow Mythical’s earlier project Blankos Block Party, which supported NFT-based economies and saw high transaction volumes after transitioning to the Polkadot ecosystem. Leading sports brands are moving from experimenting with digital assets to building the infrastructure. By shifting to proprietary blockchains, groups like FIFA are asserting more control over user data, licensing terms, and platform dynamics. What began as collectibles could become a networked model of participation—where play, identity, and ownership move through the same digital rails.

Bitcoin faces selling pressure with its spot volume delta dropping $300 million in 3 days. Whales are accumulating BTC, but smaller holders are selling, hinting at profit-taking. Bitcoin’s (BTC) price dropped under $93,000 on April 30, after the US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data revealed a -0.3% contraction in Q1. While the GDP missed expectations of +0.3%, the GDP Price Index soared to 3.7%—the highest since August 2023. Polymarket odds of a recession in 2025 hit 67%, with consumer confidence at its lowest since May 2020. Quarterly US GDP growth data. Source: X.com Meanwhile, in March 2025, PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) inflation fell to 2.3% (above the expected 2.2%), and Core PCE dropped to 2.6% (in line with expectations). Still, February’s Core PCE was revised from 2.8% to 3.0%, signaling mixed inflation trends. Short-term bearish, long-term bullish for Bitcoin? During the 2020 COVID-19-induced market crash, BTC initially followed traditional markets before rallying over 300% by year-end as the global M2 money supply increased, reflecting its appeal during periods of monetary expansion. However, stagflation, highlighted by the -0.3% GDP contraction in Q1 2025 and a 3.7% GDP Price Index, pose short-term risks. Cointelegraph noted that high inflation often deters retail crypto investment, as seen in 2022 when BTC fell 60% amid Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. The March 2025 PCE inflation data suggests cooling pressures that could ease Fed rate hike fears and support Bitcoin. On the other hand, February’s upward revisions (headline PCE from 2.5% to 2.7%, Core PCE to 3.0%) signal persistent inflation, keeping the Fed’s next moves uncertain. While fear of stagflation may pressure BTC in the short term, its long-term hedge potential remains valid. Related: Bitcoin macro indicator that predicted 2022 bottom flashes 'buy signal' Bitcoin sees $300 million in spot selling pressure Bitcoin’s spot volume delta dipped over $300 million over the past three days, increasing potential sell-off pressure for BTC around the $95,000 level. Data from Glassnode indicates the 7-day moving average of BTC spot volume delta recorded negative flows over consecutive days. The negative inflows progressively increased with a minor $16 million flush on April 26, followed by $30.9 million on April 27, $76.1 million on April 28, and $193.4 million on April 29. Bitcoin Spot volume delta chart. Source: Glassnode This sharp decline signals aggressive selling and weakening spot demand, a signal to profit-taking or a potential short-term trend reversal. Despite the sell-off, the analytics platform noted that accumulation trends among Bitcoin holders paint a more nuanced picture. Whales holding over 10,000 BTC remain in an accumulation mode, with a trend score near 0.95. However, smaller holders show signs of distribution. The 10–100 BTC group is trending toward 0.6, while those with 1–10 BTC (0.3) and less than 1 BTC (0.2) are net sellers. This top-down accumulation suggests the current selling pressure stems from short-term holders potentially taking profit around the $95,000 level. Termed as a “profit-taking pressure test” for BTC, the current market is at a key decision point, where profit-taking is a pivotal metric to monitor. BTC: realized profit data.

Unveiled ahead of TOKEN2049 Dubai, the FLOKI Minibot M1 is powered by RICE AI, Rice Robotics’ decentralized AI protocol. This small but capable robot can handle day-to-day tasks like managing grocery lists, scheduling household chores, and even providing bedtime stories or dancing to your favorite music — all while adapting to your personality and preferences over time. But the innovation doesn’t stop at the hardware. As part of the rollout, Rice Robotics will also launch the $RICE token, the main utility token of the RICE AI protocol. The token integrates real-world usage with on-chain incentives. Users of the FLOKI Minibot M1 will earn $RICE tokens through interaction — turning ordinary conversations and commands into valuable AI training data, and rewarding users for participation in the ecosystem. According to Rice, the $RICE token will be launched through the TokenFi Launchpad, allowing $TOKEN stakers to participate in the early sale. Additionally, airdrops are coming for both $FLOKI and $TOKEN holders, adding to the growing utility behind the FLOKI ecosystem. The $RICE token will serve various functions within the RICE AI ecosystem, including access to premium features, AI upgrades, and data exchange within decentralized physical AI networks. Rice Robotics, known for its work with top-tier clients like Nvidia, SoftBank, Mitsui Fudosan, and 7-Eleven Japan, is no stranger to real-world deployment. Their robots are already in use in offices, shopping centers, and urban infrastructure across Japan, Dubai, and Hong Kong. Softbank, notably, is also a key player behind President Trump’s $500 billion Stargate Initiative, aimed at building AI infrastructure across the U.S. Rice’s involvement further signals the blend between policy, AI, and tokenized economies. This collaboration marks the next big chapter in decentralized physical AI (DePAI), a concept where robots can learn, share data, and self-upgrade using blockchain-backed protocols. FLOKI Goes Big at TOKEN2049 FLOKI is making its mark as an official Gold Sponsor of TOKEN2049 Dubai, one of the world’s premier crypto events scheduled for April 30–May 1, 2025. With over 15,000 attendees and 10,000 companies expected, TOKEN2049 brings together industry leaders, innovators, and investors to explore the future of Web3, AI, and digital finance. FLOKI’s strong presence at the event reflects its expanding ecosystem and bold push into utility-driven innovation. As part of its sponsorship, FLOKI branding will feature across venue signage, tables, and marketing campaigns. The project’s Community Relations Officer will also deliver a keynote on the IO NET Stage titled “How utility will shape the memecoin revolution.” The event will culminate in “AFTER 2049,” the official closing party, also sponsored by FLOKI.

Total2 primed for big surge Source: TradingView Total2 is the chart of the combined market capitalization of all the cryptocurrencies excluding $BTC . The chart shows that the descending trendline has been crossed through, and that a new upside phase could be in its early stages. A higher high still needs to be made above $1.1 trillion, and if this can occur, that would be the signal that the trend change is official. At the bottom of the chart, the Relative Strength Index is showing that a crossover of the indicator line with the moving average (yellow) could be about to take place. The last time this happened, back in September 2024, the resulting price surge went up nearly 100%. Bitcoin dominance could top at 66% Source: TradingView Of course, for the altcoins to really fly, Bitcoin dominance must start to reduce. Calling a top for Bitcoin dominance has been a losing pastime for many chart analysts over the last few months. However, it can be seen in the chart above that dominance is reaching the top of the ascending channel, and that the 0.786 Fibonacci is overhead at 66%. It might be imagined that if the top of the channel does not stop dominance increasing, then the last of the Fibonacci levels should put the brakes on. All this said, if crypto is to enter a bear market at the end of this year, or perhaps at the beginning of the next, any decrease in dominance would likely only be temporary, as altcoins would generally fall at a much quicker rate than Bitcoin. A select band of altcoins to accompany Bitcoin to the top? Finally, all charts aside, it does currently appear that Bitcoin could throw off its fetters and surge back to the all-time high and beyond. If it does this, it’s by no means certain that the majority of altcoins will outperform, or even keep up. Things are different in this cycle, and one major difference is the sheer amount of altcoin projects that are now out there. The likelihood of there being enough money to go around and lift all boats is very slim. Even a lot of the altcoins that have been around for a few years have failed to make a case for successful adoption. Therefore, it could just be Bitcoin + a few of the top performers with the best use cases that do well in this next rally. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

With regulators tightening their grip and investors asking harder questions, only a handful of tokens are proving they can thrive. That’s why this list of the top crypto coins 2025 zeroes in on coins that aren’t just surviving, but growing. Each project we’ve picked, Cold Wallet, Ethereum, Cardano, and Binance Coin, offers something the market needs right now: real use cases, fresh utility, or huge upside. Whether it’s Cold Wallet bringing bulletproof privacy, Ethereum prepping for a game-changing upgrade, Cardano tightening its governance, or BNB expanding its chain economy, these tokens are bringing more than promises. They’re shipping product, locking in traction, and earning long-term holders. If you’re serious about spotting the top crypto coins 2025, start with this list, it’s backed by data, not drama. 1. Cold Wallet – Private. Powerful. Ready. Cold Wallet is shaping up to be one of the top crypto coins 2025, and it’s not just because of the eye-catching presale numbers. Yes, it launched at just $0.007, and yes, it’s expected to list at around $0.35171, which means early backers could be looking at a 4,900% ROI. But Cold Wallet is more than a moonshot. It’s a non-custodial wallet project with a serious focus on privacy. Zero-knowledge proofs power its private transactions, hidden balances, and anonymous user verification. You’re in full control of your keys, your data, and your security. What sets Cold Wallet apart is how it’s turning $CWT into a real ecosystem token. There’s staking with flexible rewards, access to governance through its DAO, partner airdrops, and loyalty rewards that grow as you stay in. The presale is structured across 150 stages, with 4 billion tokens up for grabs out of the total 10 billion supply. And it’s all rolling out in phases, alpha launched, beta on the way, full platform coming in Q3. If you’re sorting through the noise to find the top crypto coins 2025, Cold Wallet belongs on your radar. It’s built to be useful, private, and worth holding. 2. Ethereum – Building With the Pectra Upgrade Ethereum is holding strong in 2025 and currently trading around $1,800. What’s keeping it on this list of top crypto coins 2025 is the upcoming Pectra upgrade, set to go live in early May. This isn’t just a patch, it’s a big leap in scalability and speed. Ethereum is still the go-to platform for DeFi, NFTs, and smart contracts, and now it’s doubling down on performance. While it’s down nearly 45% from last year, a 12% spike in just the last 24 hours has pushed market cap to about $215.9 billion. Add to that a noticeable uptick in whale activity and a reduction in futures arbitrage pressure, and it’s clear Ethereum is regaining traction. With strong developer momentum and an upgrade that targets one of its most cited weaknesses, transaction throughput, Ethereum is showing it can adapt. Analysts are floating year-end price targets between $3,500 and $3,700. Long-term projections even stretch as high as $10,000, depending on how successful the network’s transition is. For serious investors looking at the top crypto coins 2025, Ethereum still earns its place through upgrades, not just legacy. 3. Cardano – Focused, Upgrading, and Climbing Cardano has made a solid recovery and is trading near $0.68, with a 10.78% daily jump. Over the past year, it’s grown by over 34%. What puts Cardano on the top crypto coins 2025 list is how it’s structured its upgrades. Ouroboros Leios, a major revamp of the consensus layer, is aimed at improving scalability while staying energy-efficient. Combined with growing stablecoin integration like $RLUSD and full community governance rollouts, Cardano is building its platform step-by-step without rushing timelines. On the tech side, indicators like RSI and MACD are pointing to bullish signals. Resistance levels around $0.703 and upward targets of $0.91 for May show there’s still room to move. What’s also worth noting is that Cardano continues to build out real-world utility for its native assets, recently launching the Ada Asset Index. For those watching the top crypto coins 2025, Cardano isn’t the flashiest coin on the list, but it’s showing exactly the kind of long-game consistency that attracts strong hands. 4. Binance Coin – Dominating Exchanges, Expanding Reach BNB is holding steady at around $618 with a market cap pushing $87 billion. It remains one of the top crypto coins 2025 due to its continued role as the fuel for Binance’s massive exchange ecosystem. Beyond exchange discounts, BNB is now tied to Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which pulled in $170 million in fees just in Q1 2025. That’s real user activity and real revenue, something a lot of coins can’t claim. The coin was recently listed on Kraken, which adds liquidity and user reach outside Binance’s ecosystem. Technical indicators are healthy, with RSI sitting at 56 and a bullish MACD crossover. Analysts have short-term price projections topping $657, while long-term estimates suggest the potential for a $1,000+ target depending on how Q2 plays out. With Binance pushing new launches like KernelDAO via Megadrop campaigns, BNB keeps evolving. If you’re making a short list of the top crypto coins 2025, BNB is still a clear pick for those who value stability and platform utility. Where Real Value Is Flowing in 2025 This year is showing us something different. It’s not about chasing buzz or falling for meme-driven cycles. The top crypto coins 2025 are the ones that are bringing real products, upgrades, and active ecosystems. Cold Wallet has jumped out ahead with a presale that’s offering huge ROI potential and a privacy-first wallet platform that people actually want to use. Ethereum is fixing core problems with Pectra, Cardano is staying on track with consistent technical and governance growth, and BNB is anchoring itself through real exchange utility and smart chain expansion. Whether you’re here for long-term value, early-stage upside, or platform-based power, each of these coins offers a clear angle in 2025. Keep an eye on their roadmaps, stay up with the upgrades, and most importantly, track how the communities are building around them. That’s how you spot the top crypto coins 2025 before the rest of the market catches up. Disclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

Among the sea of contenders, the FloppyPepe (FPPE) meme coin has emerged with the most dominant narrative, bolstered through its connection to the legendary Matt Furie coins. With powerful fundamentals, social media virality, and real-world application, these three altcoins could define the next wave of wealth-building opportunities in crypto. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Altcoin Set To Dominate The AI Agent Crypto Sector FloppyPepe (FPPE) blends humor, scarcity, and cutting-edge technology into one of the most dynamic altcoin narratives in the AI agent space. It goes far beyond the meme category, harnessing powerful AI frameworks to deliver real-world utility and viral engagement. While the Meme-o-Matic AI tool drives meme creation from simple prompts, FloppyX an AI video bot, transforms text into intelligent video with live feedback loops—each offering both entertainment and passive earning potential. Its presale demand reflects this utility: the private sale sold out in a single day, and the ongoing stage continues to see heavy inflows. Now selling at $0.0000002 , FloppyPepe (FPPE) is attracting early buyers eager to capitalize on its high upside potential. Floppynomics also remains deeply deflationary with a 1% burn per transaction and built-in holder rewards. These mechanics are further amplified by staking bonuses, airdrop campaigns, and community-driven value, proving FloppyPepe’s (FPPE) commitment to sustainable investor returns. FloppyPepe (FPPE): Security Framework And Sustainable Investment Ecosystem FloppyPepe (FPPE) prioritizes security in its operations. The project’s smart contract has undergone a rigorous audit by SolidProof, and it employs multi-signature wallets in conjunction with a bug bounty program to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities. These security measures, combined with proactive community education on wallet safety, create a trustworthy environment for investors. With connections to wildlife conservation, unique hand-drawn art from top creators, and a tribute to Matt Furie’s legacy, FloppyPepe (FPPE) transcends being just a token; it embodies a narrative, a movement, and a significant player in the altcoin landscape. Floki (FLOKI): The Altcoin With Massive Brand Appeal And Ecosystem Utility Trading at $0.00008529, Floki (FLOKI) remains one of the most culturally potent altcoins available this week. Riding off Elon Musk’s infamous Shiba Inu namesake, Floki (FLOKI) has built a sprawling ecosystem that includes DeFi, education, and gaming utilities, all designed to deliver real benefits to holders. ‘CryptooELITES,’ in their post on X (formerly Twitter), stated that Floki (FLOKI) is expected to rise. As analysts scan the altcoin field for tokens with longevity, Floki (FLOKI) continues to climb the charts, thanks to its multi-channel visibility and community incentives. Pi Network (PI): Altcoin Bringing Mass Adoption Through Mobile Mining Currently trading around $0.6027, Pi Network (PI) is entering a new phase as an altcoin positioned for mass adoption. Known for pioneering mobile-first mining, Pi Network (PI) has unlocked a powerful advantage: frictionless onboarding for non-technical users. With over 35 million pioneers already participating in the ecosystem, Pi Network (PI) is one of the few altcoins capable of scaling at a social level. An analyst on X (formerly Twitter) with the name Satoshi Nakamoto, who studies user growth in the altcoin space, indicated that if Pi Network (PI) breaks the area with high volume, the token is likely to push up towards $1. Pi network (PI) is also producing transactions and testing decentralized utilities on the mainnet, a clear indicator that this altcoin is preparing to go global in both use and valuation. FloppyPepe (FPPE) Remains The Best Investment Opportunity Among Altcoins The current market trend reveals clues for those paying attention. Altcoins with real momentum, inventive technology, and viral community narratives are showing potential for 1000x moves. Floki (FLOKI) boasts strong brand recognition, while Pi Network (PI) simplifies mass onboarding. However, FloppyPepe (FPPE) is rewriting the narrative with AI creativity, scarcity-based tokenomics, and rapid presale growth. FloppyPepe (FPPE) is entering its breakout moment now.

In a new note to investors, Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan says the four largest wirehouses in the world – Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo and UBS – who together hold over $10 trillion in assets, will soon strive to give their clients access to the crypto king via ETFs. “I suspect all four wirehouses will be open for business on Bitcoin ETFs by the end of the year. It’s one of the reasons I still expect Bitcoin ETFs to set a new record for net inflows this year, despite pulling in ‘just’ $3.7 billion so far in 2025, compared to $35 billion in 2024.” Hougan also predicts that more institutionally oriented investors will open up to Bitcoin as more and more milestones get hit. The investor notes that previously unimaginable developments keep happening for the flagship crypto asset, like institutional custody, government adoption, and easy access through ETFs. “If you go back even a few years, what we thought it would take – like the U.S. government owning bitcoin or the largest asset manager in the world embracing the asset – seemed far-fetched. But here we are… I think a lot of people are going to come to the same conclusion this year.” Bitcoin is trading for $93,869 at time of writing, a 1.1% decrease during the last 24 hours.

Bitcoin (BTC) is increasingly benefiting from stablecoin-driven liquidity growth. On Wednesday, April 30, Tracy Jin, COO of crypto exchange MEXC, shared her insights with crypto.news on the growing role of stablecoins in the Bitcoin ecosystem. “Fiat inflows converted into Tether and Circle are steadily flowing into Bitcoin, and that remains the primary driver behind its price growth this year. Right now, every additional billion in stablecoins tends to push Bitcoin up by 8 to 10 percent,” Tracy Jin of MEXC. You might also like: Analyst suggests declines in US Dollar Index are positive for BTC price, predicts all-time high by May Jin explained that despite macroeconomic uncertainty, demand for stablecoins remains high. The total stablecoin market capitalization has grown by over $38 billion year-to-date and is expected to continue rising. This added liquidity, in turn, supports increased demand for Bitcoin. “Despite the recent volatile market landscape, stablecoin demand has remained resilient, growing over $38 billion year-to-date. Stablecoins now account for 1% of the global M2 USD money supply, processing over $33T in volume in the last year, including $2.8T in the last month alone.” Stablecoins could be worth $2 trillion by 2026 One of the key drivers of this growth is the role stablecoins play in bridging traditional financial markets and the crypto ecosystem. They are particularly vital for crypto investors, especially during periods of heightened volatility. According to Jin, this utility could help propel the stablecoin market cap to over $2 trillion by 2026. You might also like: Stablecoins can hold central banks fiscally accountable | Opinion “With many sovereign banks and corporations exploring stablecoin issuance, particularly in other fiat currencies, and governments prioritizing regulation clarity, the stablecoin market cap could exceed $2 trillion by 2026 as they continue to drive the evolution of financial services, serving as a hedge against volatility and a launchpad for broader capital deployment,” Tracy Jin of MEXC. This would represent a 200% increase from its current level of $241 billion. For Bitcoin, this translates into a significant boost in available liquidity, likely placing upward pressure on its price.

43995328,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154320,1746036583,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Bybit & FXStreet Report: Gold could reach US$4,000 per ounce by 2025",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/bybit-fxstreet-report-gold-could-reach-us4000-per-ounce-by-2025/,"DUBAI , UAE , May 1, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Bybit , the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, in partnership with FXStreet published a comprehensive report forecasting gold’s potential to reach US$4,000 per ounce by the end of 2025. Key Highlights: New record highs Gold has recently surged to an all-time high of US$3,500 per ounce. The rally marks a 26% increase year-to-date and a 41% gain over the past 12 months — sharply outperforming equities, with the S&P 500 down 11% in the same period. This underscores gold’s renewed strength as a reliable safe-haven asset. Safe-haven demand Gold’s outperformance reflects a broader macroeconomic trend: investors fleeing volatility in traditional markets. A weakening US dollar, persistent inflation, and negative equity returns have made gold increasingly attractive. As fiat currencies lose purchasing power, gold’s status as a hedge against currency devaluation has been reaffirmed across global markets. Tariff-driven uncertainty Trade policies under U.S. President Donald Trump have reignited fears of a global tariff war. This uncertainty is driving capital towards gold as a politically neutral store of value. Tariffs on key commodities — and the possibility of levies on gold itself — are pushing exporters and importers to divest from vulnerable currencies such as the CAD, JPY, EUR, CNY, and MXN in favor of gold reserves. Traditional safe-haven instruments like US Treasuries are seeing reduced demand from exporting nations affected by US tariffs. As Treasury yields lose their appeal, gold is increasingly seen as the only truly stable alternative for risk-averse capital. Technical momentum From a technical perspective, bullish signals remain in place. The MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) remains positive, with the short-term (12-day) moving average staying above the longer-term (26-day) average — a classic sign of continued upward momentum. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 60, indicating healthy momentum without entering overbought territory. End-of-year target Given the supportive macroeconomic backdrop, persistent geopolitical risks, and favorable technical setup, analysts are forecasting the rally will continue short-term. Gold appears poised to test its next resistance level at US$3,500 , with a potential to climb to US$4,000 per ounce by year end if current momentum holds. Diversification potential Silver presents an overlooked but compelling opportunity for diversification. Historically moving in tandem with gold, silver remains significantly undervalued compared to its 2011 all-time high of US$50 per ounce. With industrial demand also contributing to its strength, silver could benefit from both defensive capital flows and cyclical economic recovery, offering investors an additional layer of resilience. Conclusion Gold’s rise to historic highs is the result of intersecting forces: economic headwinds, inflationary pressure, political uncertainty, and a global search for reliable stores of value. With traditional safe-havens underperforming and demand from markets like China rising, gold’s outlook remains strong. As momentum builds, both gold and silver are reasserting themselves as essential components of a diversified portfolio in 2025.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. XRP and XLM lead 2025’s crypto rebound, but new ISO 20022 token Remittix may outshine them in cross-border payments. Table of Contents XRP: XRP does well on the back of ISO 20022 Stellar: The underdog that can steal the show Remittix: The third option may take the title Conclusion The first few months of 2025 were rocky for crypto, but one of the tokens that weathered the storm the best was XRP , with the XRP price performing better than most. But scroll a bit further down the list, and see that Stellar’s XLM is also not doing too badly. These two tokens have much in common; both networks provide cross-border payments and comply with the ISO 20022 standard, which will become mandatory later this year. This could increase the XPR price, and XLM could follow, but what if there is another cross-border payment token that simplifies the process and can pull the rug from XRP and XLM? This is where Remittix comes in, and it could be the shining star of 2025. You might also like: Investors rush to Remittix presale, Dogecoin and Solana could fall up to 30% in April XRP: XRP does well on the back of ISO 20022 While the rest of the cryptosphere has been reeling since the February downturn, the XRP price suffered relatively minor damage. This is because RippleNet is ISO 20022 compliant, a standard all financial communications must comply with by November 2025 . In this regard, XRP is running in the inside lane; its network is already widely implemented in banks and financial institutions, especially in Asia. The XRP price has been up 12.5% this year so far, in stark contrast to Ethereum, which is down almost 50%. XRP is locked in for the ISO 20022 implementation, and the bull signals of a 500% increase are there. But can other tokens steal its thunder? Stellar: The underdog that can steal the show Stellar and XRP are so close that they could be twins. On the face of it, XLM has not done brilliantly in the market downturn, but it has gained a number of places in the market cap rankings. Like XRP’s RippleNet, XLM’s Stellar is ISO 20022 compliant and is definitely a dark horse that can take a chunk of XRP’s market share. It is evident that in the last week of the market recovery, XLM has outpaced the more established XRP, a clear shot across the bow that XLM means business. Fortunately, one does not have to choose, and investors can invest in both, hedging some XLM growth while the XRP price makes an upward climb. Remittix: The third option may take the title While XRP and XLM play within the TradFi sandbox, the new PayFi solution Remittix takes global payments outside of the banking system and into the hands of investors. Remittix has changed the rules of the game, giving the world the first-ever crypto-to-fiat payment system where Remittix users can use the crypto system to make payments into almost any fiat bank account in the world. Remittix cuts out the middleman, which means lower fees, almost instant clearances, and none of the regulatory hurdles and red tape obstacles to worry about. The potential here is massive, and the investment case for Remittix is not one that can be ignored. Even YouTube crypto vloggers say so. Conclusion While XLM hopes to rise on the coattails of a rising XRP price, which in turn is banking heavily on the banking systems, newcomer Remittix is taking the ball and running with it. The XRP price could go up 500%, and XLM could follow, but even those numbers pale compared to what Remittix can offer its early adopters. Remittix is now available during presale at $0.0757.

43996853,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154202,1746040236,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Address Poisoning: $100K USDC Lost in Devastating Crypto Scam,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/address-poisoning-crypto-scam/,"The world of cryptocurrency moves fast, offering incredible opportunities, but it also harbors significant risks. A recent, unfortunate event highlighted a particularly cunning type of crypto scam known as address poisoning , resulting in a user losing a staggering $100,000 worth of USDC . This incident serves as a stark reminder of the constant threats lurking in the digital asset space and underscores the critical need for robust wallet security practices. What Exactly is Address Poisoning? Address poisoning is a sophisticated scam technique that exploits how users often verify cryptocurrency wallet addresses. Instead of trying to trick you into clicking a malicious link (like phishing), this scam aims to trick you into sending funds to the wrong address by making a scammer’s address look like one you’ve interacted with before. Here’s how it typically works: The Setup: The scammer sends a tiny amount of cryptocurrency (often 0 value) from an address they control to your wallet address. They generate their address to have the exact same first few and last few characters as a legitimate address you frequently use or plan to use. Poisoning the History: This small transaction appears in your wallet’s transaction history. Because wallet interfaces often truncate addresses, showing only the beginning and end, the scammer’s address looks virtually identical to the legitimate one in your history. The Trap: Later, when you intend to send funds to the legitimate address, you might look up the address in your transaction history to copy it. Due to the visual similarity, you mistakenly copy the scammer’s address instead of the real one. The Loss: You send your funds, believing you are sending them to the correct recipient. However, the funds go directly to the scammer’s wallet. It’s a devious method that preys on habits users develop for convenience, like quickly scanning transaction history and checking only the address extremities. The $100K USDC Incident The specific crypto scam perfectly illustrates the danger of address poisoning . A user, likely intending to send $100,000 in USDC to a known address, inadvertently copied a scammer’s address from their transaction history. The scammer had clearly executed the poisoning step beforehand, ensuring a visually confusing entry in the victim’s history. As soon as the significant sum of USDC landed in the scammer’s wallet, the attacker acted quickly. They swapped the $100,000 worth of USDC for DAI, likely to make tracing and recovering the funds more difficult. This rapid conversion is a common tactic employed by scammers to obfuscate the trail of stolen assets. Why is This Crypto Scam So Effective? This particular crypto scam is effective for several reasons: Visual Deception: It leverages the fact that most wallet interfaces don’t display the full 42-character Ethereum address (or similar lengths on other chains) by default. Users become accustomed to checking only the first few and last few characters. Habit and Convenience: Copying from recent transaction history is faster than using an address book or manually verifying. Scammers exploit this desire for convenience. Targeted Attack: While seemingly random, scammers might target users who frequently perform large transactions, hoping to poison the history of a valuable recipient address. Irreversibility: Once funds are sent on the blockchain, the transaction is irreversible. There’s no bank to call to cancel a transfer. Strengthening Your Wallet Security: Actionable Insights Protecting yourself against address poisoning and other blockchain security threats requires vigilance and adopting better habits. Here are key steps you can take: Verify the FULL Address: This is the most crucial step. Do not rely on checking only the first and last characters. Always verify the entire address, character by character, against the known legitimate address before sending funds. Use Address Books: For frequent recipients, add their legitimate address to your wallet’s address book (if available). This stores the full, correct address, reducing the risk of copying a poisoned one. Send a Small Test Transaction: Before sending a large amount, send a tiny amount first (e.g., $1). Confirm the recipient received it correctly. This adds a small fee but can save you from losing a fortune. Double-Check Before Confirming: Your wallet will show the recipient address before you confirm a transaction. Take a moment to compare it carefully with the correct address. Be Suspicious of Unexpected Transactions: If you receive tiny amounts of crypto you didn’t expect, especially from unknown addresses that look vaguely familiar, be extra cautious when you next send funds. This could be an address poisoning attempt. Consider Hardware Wallets: Hardware wallets often have screens that display the full address for verification, making it harder to fall for visual tricks on your computer screen. Explore Security Tools: As suggested by Cyvers Alerts, consider using AI-based security tools or browser extensions that can analyze transaction destinations and flag potential risks or known scam addresses. The Role of Blockchain Security and AI Tools While user vigilance is paramount, the broader field of blockchain security is also evolving. Companies are developing sophisticated tools, including those leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), to detect malicious patterns and warn users. These tools can potentially: Analyze incoming transactions for signs of poisoning attempts. Compare destination addresses against known scam databases. Provide real-time warnings if a transaction destination looks suspicious or has been recently involved in malicious activity. While not foolproof, integrating such tools into your security routine can add an extra layer of defense against sophisticated scams like address poisoning . Conclusion: Stay Safe in the Crypto World The loss of $100,000 in USDC due to an address poisoning scam is a harsh lesson for the victim and a critical warning for the entire crypto community. It highlights that scammers are constantly innovating, finding new ways to exploit human behavior and the technical nuances of blockchain transactions. Protecting your digital assets begins with understanding the threats.

Its representatives requested that the administration put an end to what they called the “lawless prosecution” of open-source crypto platform developers. Among them is Roman Storm, one of the creators of the crypto mixer Tornado Cash. What will happen to the creator of the Tornado Cash mixer In an April 28 letter to White House counsel on crypto and artificial intelligence David Sachs, the group urged Donald Trump to ”take immediate action to end the Department of Justice's campaign under Biden to criminalize open source software development.” The letter mentions the case of Storm, who was accused in August 2023 of helping launder more than one billion dollars through Tornado Cash. His trial is scheduled for July, while another co-founder of the platform, Roman Semenov, is still wanted, allegedly hiding in Russia. DeFi Education Fund officials said that in Storm's case, the Justice Department is trying to hold the developer accountable for how others use the code he created. Not only is this absurd in nature, but it sets a precedent that threatens the entire cryptocurrency community in the United States. The group also pointed out that this prosecution contradicts FinCEN guidance issued by the Treasury Department during President Trump's first term. It states that developers of autonomous p2p protocols are not considered money transfer operators. In January, a federal court in Texas ruled that the Treasury Department exceeded its authority by imposing sanctions on Tornado Cash. The group thanked Trump for his support of the industry and his stated goal of making the U.S. the ”cryptocurrency capital of the planet.” The letter emphasizes that this goal is unattainable if developers continue to be prosecuted for creating tools for new technologies. We ask President Trump to protect American developers, restore legal certainty, and stop this unlawful arbitrariness by the DOJ. The work is not yet done, and the cost is too high. Variant Fund General Counsel Jake Czerwinski called the case against Storm ”an outdated relic of the Biden administration's war on cryptocurrencies.” His statement appeared to be as follows. There is no legal or political reason to prosecute developers for launching autonomous smart contracts. At the time of publication, the organization's petition has already been signed by 232 industry members, including Coinbase co-founder Fred Ersam, Paradigm co-founder Matt Huang and one of the key developers of Ethereum Tim Beyko. ICO money scandal Unfortunately, scandals involving the fraudulent use of funds are still relevant in the crypto industry. Today, it has come to light that the founders of cryptocurrency company Bankera used funds raised during an ICO in 2018 to buy luxury real estate properties around the world. This is the subject of a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Investigation Project (OCCRP). Almost half of the 114 million dollars raised by Bankera was transferred to a bank in Vanuatu, which was acquired by the founders of the project themselves - Vytautas Karalevicius, Justas Dobriauskas and Mantuas Mockevicius. Shortly thereafter, a bank in Vanuatu began making multi-million dollar loans to companies owned by the three, to build a portfolio of luxury real estate. These included a villa on the French Riviera and properties in Lithuania, where the project was based. These funds were used to secure loans to other companies, through which expensive real estate was then purchased. According to OCCRP, a bank in Vanuatu also lent millions more euros directly to the founders for ”personal use.” Lawyers representing the founders said the ICO was not fraudulent, but declined to comment on individual transactions. As a reminder, Bankera has stated its intention to become a ”bank for the blockchain era,” offering a suite of investment services for retail and institutional clients with the ability to store and exchange cryptocurrencies. Many investors became interested in Bankera token (BNK) due to the promise of discounts on the company's products and services, as well as weekly payouts. Although as one ICO investor told OCCRP, these payments soon began to ”drop significantly from the promised level.” In addition, Bankera promised to obtain a European Union banking license, but that never happened. Despite the fact that the ICO raised more than $100 million, BNK's capitalization currently barely reaches the $1 million level. Bankera continues to provide cryptocurrency-related banking services and maintains social media activity - particularly on LinkedIn and, to a lesser extent, Twitter. The bottom line The Tornado Cash story raises an important question: can developers be judged for how others use their code? As the cryptosphere struggles for recognition and justice, high-profile cases like this one continue to shape the legal boundaries of the industry.

The Visa cards enable holders to spend USDC directly from their crypto wallets, using smart contracts to move a stablecoin balance upon card authorization from the consumer to Baanx in real time, with Baanx converting the balance into fiat for payment, according to a press release on Wednesday. Allowing people to manage their money on-chain with the help of major card networks like Visa and Mastercard is a fast growing segment within crypto. Baanx, a firm that specializes in crypto debit cards, is also working with Mastercard on a card linked to MetaMask wallets. The stablecoin payments is also heating up with Circle recently announcing its own payment network focused initially on cross-border payments and remittances. Baanx’s stablecoin-linked Visa cards promise a global reach with low-cost cross border payments in the mix, according to the release. “In many regions, access to stable currency is a luxury.

Fed’s policy may accelerate Bitcoin’s rise to $1 million. ECB’s Christine Lagarde rejects crypto due to volatility and liquidity risks. Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and son of U.S. President Donald Trump, says traditional banks could vanish within 10 years if they don’t adapt. He believes the rise of digital assets reshapes finance, and banks that ignore crypto adoption will fall behind. Are Banks Stuck in a 50-Year-Old Financial Model? In an exclusive interview with CNBC on April 30, Eric Trump described the modern financial system as broken, slow, and expensive. Eric Trump: Banks are outdated. If banks don’t change, they’ll be left behind. They favour only the rich and punish regular people. That’s why I turned to crypto. pic.twitter.com/qZD3oDtIPw — Kashif Raza (@simplykashif) April 30, 2025 He believes the system, dominated by traditional banks, is stuck in the past, relying on technology such as SWIFT, which dates back to 1973. SWIFT is a revered global messaging network that powers most cross-border payments. Eric Trump called it an absolute disaster, pointing out how it often takes days to move money from one country to another. Transfers take 1–5 days, sometimes longer if multiple banks are involved. Each bank adds delays with its own checks, and missing deadlines can make transfers even slower. These hurdles make the system feel outdated and inefficient, especially in today’s digital world. Eric Trump argues that this slow pace benefits the ultra-wealthy, not ordinary people. Those with large assets can access exclusive banking services, better loan rates, and special investment opportunities. He sees crypto adoption as a way to level the financial playing field. For example, sending Bitcoin or Ethereum can take just a few minutes, while some newer blockchains settle transactions almost instantly. He added that anyone can open a decentralized finance (DeFi) or cryptocurrency app and instantly send money directly from wallet-to-wallet. The transaction would be processed without the high fees or unpredictability associated with banks. Will Crypto Adoption Define the Next Era of U.S. Finance? Eric Trump is not alone in his views. Many in the crypto community share his belief that digital assets are the future of finance. Major institutions like JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs are investing in blockchain, digital asset infrastructure, and even exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The U.S. Federal Reserve has also withdrawn major guidance that discouraged banks from investing in crypto and stablecoins. SWIFT itself is feeling the pressure. In response to the rise of crypto adoption, the network plans to pilot digital currency transactions in 2025. Exciting news! Starting next year, financial institutions from around the world will start trialling live digital asset and currency transactions on the Swift network. This marks an important milestone in our journey to enable banks to transact interchangeably across both… pic.twitter.com/70BxOMoBpT — Swift (@swiftcommunity) October 3, 2024 This move is intended to bridge the gap between old and new, allowing banks to send and receive digital assets alongside traditional currencies. Eric Trump’s outlook aligns with his previous bold prediction that Bitcoin would reach $1 million per coin. ERIC TRUMP: ""I AM CONFIDENT THAT #BITCOIN IS GOING TO HIT $1 MILLION"" HE KNOWS WHAT'S COMING pic.twitter.com/1WtlxtZ2eg — The Bitcoin Conference (@TheBitcoinConf) March 18, 2025 In line with this vision, Eric and his brother, Donald Trump Jr., partnered with Hut 8, a publicly traded Bitcoin mining company. The partnership will create a new subsidiary in the U.S. named American Bitcoin. The development aligns with his father President Trump’s promise to make America the sole hub of crypto. The Trump family has also launched a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin through World Liberty Financial, a crypto venture they control. Can Crypto Overcome Its Volatility Problem? Many global banks remain skeptical when it comes to cryptocurrency. The risk it poses to financial systems is a major concern. For example, the Bank of Italy holds a cautious stance on crypto adoption . Italian officials assert that if crypto becomes more integrated into its traditional financial systems, it could create greater instability in markets. European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde shares these concerns. She recently blocked a proposal to add Bitcoin to the Czech Republic’s reserves , arguing it fails the ECB’s standards for reserve assets—stability, security, and liquidity. Her caution proved justified weeks later. When the U.S. announced sweeping trade tariffs in early 2025, both stock and crypto markets plunged, exposing crypto’s vulnerability to economic shocks. Bitcoin price dropped from over $90K to around $74K. This volatility in crypto assets has raised doubts about their ability to provide the stability and security needed for financial markets. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Can crypto replace traditional banks for the unbanked? Yes, if they have a smartphone and internet. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and stablecoins let people in remote areas send, receive, and store money instantly, without a bank account. This is a game-changer in countries like the Philippines, Peru, and Morocco, where traditional banking infrastructures are weak. Why do banks still block crypto startups from basic services? Most banks enforce strict policies on crypto firms, citing regulatory risks. The result? Endless delays, scrutiny, and frequent rejections for routine needs like payroll, expenses, or fiat conversions.

For those navigating the complexities of the digital economy, understanding how AI is being leveraged to simplify burdensome tasks like sales tax compliance is crucial. This is where companies like Kintsugi are making waves, demonstrating remarkable growth and attracting significant investment. What is Driving the Demand for AI Sales Tax Solutions? The landscape of commerce has fundamentally shifted. The explosion of e-commerce and the increasing volume of cross-border transactions mean businesses are selling to customers in more locations than ever before. This growth, however, comes with a significant administrative burden: sales tax compliance. Regulations vary wildly not just between countries, but often within them, creating a complex web that is difficult and time-consuming to navigate manually. A key turning point for the industry was the 2018 US Supreme Court ruling, which empowered states to require online sellers to collect sales tax regardless of physical presence. This dramatically expanded the compliance obligations for countless e-commerce businesses. While established players capitalized on this shift, newer companies recognized the potential of AI to offer more efficient, cost-effective solutions. This escalating complexity and the need for businesses to focus on growth rather than getting bogged down in paperwork are the primary drivers behind the surge in demand for tax compliance automation. Companies are actively seeking tools that can handle these tasks accurately and efficiently. Fintech Startup Kintsugi Secures Significant Kintsugi Funding Kintsugi, a fintech startup based in Silicon Valley, has recently announced securing $18 million in new funding. This investment round was notably led by Vertex, a global provider of indirect tax technology solutions. This substantial funding highlights strong investor confidence in Kintsugi’s technology and market position. The funding round included a $15 million minority investment from Vertex, representing a 10% ownership stake. Additionally, Kintsugi raised $3 million from its existing investors. This combined fresh capital infusion is set to fuel the company’s ambitious expansion plans. How Kintsugi’s AI Tax Software Works At its core, Kintsugi provides AI-enabled capabilities designed to automate sales tax calculations and filings for businesses. The software is built to integrate seamlessly with various revenue-generating platforms commonly used by companies today. These integrations include popular services like Shopify, Stripe, Chargebee, and Quickbooks, as well as custom API implementations. By integrating with these platforms, Kintsugi gains a comprehensive, 360-degree view of a company’s revenue streams. This allows the AI tax software to ingest transactional data in real-time and instantly calculate the applicable sales tax based on the specific location and regulations involved. This automated process significantly reduces the manual effort and potential for error associated with traditional tax compliance methods. Kintsugi aims to make tax compliance accessible and manageable for businesses of all sizes, particularly small and medium businesses (SMBs) who often lack dedicated tax departments or resources. Doubling Valuation: A Mark of Success The recent funding round has propelled Kintsugi’s post-money valuation to $150 million. This represents a significant jump from the $80 million valuation the startup held just six months prior in November. Doubling its valuation in such a short period underscores Kintsugi’s rapid growth trajectory and the perceived value of its AI sales tax solution in the market. This valuation increase is supported by strong business metrics. Kintsugi reported $3 million in annual revenue last year and is targeting to exceed $10 million by the end of 2025. The company also boasts an impressively low churn rate of just 0.1%, indicating high customer satisfaction and retention. With over 2,400 customers ranging from early-stage businesses to those generating hundreds of millions in revenue, Kintsugi has demonstrated its ability to serve a diverse client base. A Strategic Partnership for Tax Compliance Automation The investment from Vertex is more than just capital; it represents a strategic partnership. Vertex, with its nearly five decades of experience, primarily focuses on serving large enterprise multinational corporations and complex mid-market businesses. Kintsugi’s strength lies in efficiently servicing the SMB market with its scalable, AI-driven approach. Vertex’s Chief Strategy Officer, Chirag Patel, noted that Kintsugi complements Vertex’s existing business, allowing them to address a segment they don’t currently serve directly. The partnership includes IP sharing, enabling Vertex to leverage Kintsugi’s AI innovations. Vertex has committed an additional $10-12 million investment this year specifically to utilize Kintsugi’s IP for accelerating its own AI integration efforts, acknowledging the agility and innovation happening within the startup. This collaboration is expected to be mutually beneficial, potentially opening doors for Kintsugi to gain customers across different sectors through Vertex’s extensive network, while Vertex enhances its AI capabilities. Future Outlook and Global Ambitions With high profit margins exceeding 93% and a growing team of 95 employees, Kintsugi is well-positioned for future expansion. Having already established a presence in the U.S., Canada, and Europe, the startup now plans to extend its reach into South America, Africa, and key markets in the Eastern world, including India and China. Kintsugi’s success illustrates the power of leveraging AI to solve real-world business problems, particularly in complex areas like tax and compliance. As regulations continue to evolve globally, solutions that offer simplicity, accuracy, and automation are likely to see sustained demand. The journey of Kintsugi from a startup founded in 2023 to a company valued at $150 million in under two years is a testament to the potential of AI and the critical need for effective tax compliance automation in the modern economy.

For venture capital, it was business as usual, with investors continuing to pour money into promising startups across layer-1 blockchains, infrastructure, real-world asset tokenization (RWA), and Web3 social media. This edition of VC Roundup highlights six notable funding deals from April. Unto Labs raises $14.4M for layer-1 blockchain Blockchain R&D company Unto Labs raised $14.4 million to continue developing its scalable layer-1 network called Thru. The pre-seed and seed funding was led by venture firms Electric Capital and Framework, with support from angel investors in the Solana engineering community. The company is led by former Solana contributor Liam Heeger, who argues that “blockchains painted themselves into a corner by inventing custom Virtual Machines (VMs),” which he believes has prevented mainstream adoption.

43997371,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154209,1746041436,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Decentralized AI Project Gata Secures $4M Funding for Breakthrough Data Network,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/gata-decentralized-ai-funding/,"In a significant move for the intersection of artificial intelligence and blockchain technology, Gata, an innovative Decentralized AI project, has successfully closed a Seed funding round, securing a substantial $4 million investment. This influx of capital is poised to accelerate Gata’s ambitious plans to construct a verifiable, user-owned data network, a crucial component for powering the next era of frontier AI applications. What is Gata and Why Does This Gata Funding Matter? Gata positions itself at the forefront of building AI infrastructure that is not only powerful but also aligned with principles of decentralization, transparency, and user ownership. The core problem Gata aims to solve is the current centralized nature of AI data, which can lead to issues of bias, lack of transparency, and control being concentrated in the hands of a few entities. By building a decentralized data network, Gata intends to create a more open, fair, and robust ecosystem for AI development. The recent Gata Funding announcement is a strong validation of the project’s vision and potential. Raising $4 million in a Seed round, especially in the current market climate, demonstrates significant investor confidence in Gata’s ability to execute its roadmap and contribute meaningfully to the decentralized AI landscape. This funding provides the necessary resources to scale operations, attract top talent, and accelerate the development of their core technology. Who Backed Gata’s Vision? Exploring the Blockchain Funding Landscape The Seed round saw participation from several notable investors within the blockchain and venture capital space. According to Gata’s announcement on X (formerly Twitter), key participants included YZi Labs, Gate Ventures, IDG Blockchain, and Maelstrom Fund, among others. The involvement of such prominent names highlights the growing interest in projects that bridge the gap between blockchain technology and artificial intelligence. This specific instance of Blockchain Funding for an AI project underscores a broader trend: investors are increasingly looking at how decentralized technologies can address some of the fundamental challenges facing AI, particularly around data governance, privacy, and verification. Gata’s success in attracting these investors suggests a belief that their decentralized approach offers a viable path forward. Building the Future: Gata’s AI Data Network Explained At the heart of Gata’s mission is the creation of a decentralized AI Data Network . Unlike traditional centralized databases where data is stored and controlled by a single entity, Gata’s network aims to distribute data storage and access across a decentralized infrastructure, likely leveraging blockchain or distributed ledger technology. Key characteristics of the network Gata intends to build include: Decentralized: Data is not stored in a single location, reducing single points of failure and censorship risks. Verifiable: Mechanisms are in place to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data, crucial for training reliable AI models. User-Owned: Users retain ownership and control over their data, potentially being compensated for its use in AI training. This approach promises to unlock new possibilities for AI development by providing access to diverse, high-quality, and ethically sourced data sets that might be difficult to access in a centralized paradigm. A robust decentralized AI Data Network is seen as essential for training the complex models required for ‘frontier AI’ – the most advanced forms of artificial intelligence currently being developed. What Does This Mean for Crypto News and the Decentralized Ecosystem? Gata’s successful funding round is significant Crypto News . It signals continued innovation and investment within the decentralized technology space, extending beyond traditional finance applications into cutting-edge fields like AI. Projects like Gata demonstrate the potential of blockchain to serve as foundational infrastructure for entirely new digital paradigms. For the broader decentralized ecosystem, Gata’s progress is encouraging. It validates the thesis that decentralization can provide tangible benefits – such as increased transparency, security, and user control – to technologies like AI that are currently dominated by centralized models. As Gata develops its network, it could become a key piece of infrastructure within the decentralized web (Web3), enabling a new generation of decentralized AI applications and services. The Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities for Gata While the funding is a major boost, Gata faces significant challenges. Building a truly decentralized, verifiable, and scalable AI Data Network is a complex technical undertaking. Ensuring data quality, developing effective governance models for the network, and achieving widespread adoption among AI developers and data providers will be crucial hurdles to overcome. However, the opportunities are immense. If successful, Gata could become a foundational layer for decentralized AI, attracting a large ecosystem of developers, researchers, and data owners. This could lead to more innovative, ethical, and powerful AI applications that benefit from a decentralized and user-centric data infrastructure. The successful Gata Funding round provides the resources to tackle these challenges head-on and capitalize on these opportunities. Conclusion: A Promising Step for Decentralized AI Gata’s $4 million Seed funding round marks a significant milestone in the journey towards decentralized artificial intelligence. By focusing on building a verifiable and user-owned data network, Gata is addressing a critical need for the future of AI development. Backed by notable investors, the project is well-positioned to make substantial progress on its ambitious roadmap. This development is not just important for Gata but serves as a positive indicator for the continued growth and potential of the decentralized technology space as it converges with cutting-edge fields like AI.

To read full editions, subscribe . The US economy contracted in the year’s first three months. It’s the first quarterly decline since 2022. Today’s advanced GDP estimate for Q1 showed a 0.3% annualized decline, sending stocks lower, and Treasury yields and gold higher. Analysts had expected GDP to grow 0.4% in the first quarter. The report comes a day after President Trump marked 100 days in office , during which time the S&P 500 notched its worst performance (-7.3% since Inauguration Day) since the first 100 days of President Nixon’s second term. The Nasdaq Composite lost 11%, which is the biggest drop since President Bush’s first term in 2001. In a Truth Social post Wednesday, Trump insisted that “This is Biden’s stock market, not Trump’s.” While the “Liberation Day” tariffs came at the beginning of the second quarter, the Q1 data suggested that consumers and businesses started preparing for more aggressive trade policies at the beginning of the year. The first quarter saw an increase in imports alongside declines in consumer and government spending — the perfect recipe for a negative print. Imports were up more than 41% in Q1, compared with a 1.9% decline in the last quarter of 2024. Goods imports were up more than 50%, showing that consumers and businesses were in a rush to secure larger purchases and increase inventories ahead of expected tariffs. The GDP print, as expected, falls between projections from the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow (-1.9%) and the New York Fed’s Nowcast (2.6%). Also today, the Treasury Department announced plans to revamp its buyback program. There could be “possible enhancements” made to the purchase amounts, scheduling and frequency, Treasury said in a statement . The update comes after Treasurys sold off earlier this month, sending yields higher and raising concerns about a slowing economy and tightening financial conditions. The surge in yields, Trump said, was concerning enough for him to pivot on some of his tariff policies; he issued the 90-day pause on most countries just a week after Liberation Day. Now investors are waiting for signs that the administration is inking trade deals with other countries. After comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent that the situation with China is “unsustainable,” stocks felt some short-term relief, but have since faltered on the recovery path. The GDP print also comes a day after the Conference Board released the latest consumer confidence figures, which surprise, surprise, were very bleak. The index fell 7.9 points, marking the eighth straight monthly decline and the lowest reading since 2020. As Sevens Report Research founder Tom Essaye wrote in a note this morning, the report emphatically proves that investors and consumers are certain that the future looks bleak.

Ripple is keen to expand its recently launched RLUSD to compete with Tether USDT among others. Ripple Labs proposed to takeover Circle Internet Group Inc. for $4 billion to $5 billion. According to people familiar with the matter, Circle, the second largest stablecoin issuer, turned down the offer and termed it as too low. Meanwhile, Ripple has not yet made another move but remains interested in acquiring Circle. Moreover, Circle’s USDC has penetrated global web3 markets to hit a market cap of about $61.6 billion and a 24 hour average trading volume of about $6.9 billion. “We do not comment on market rumors. As we are currently in a quiet period with the U.S. SEC, we cannot comment further on our corporate financial plans. Our long-term goals remain the same,” Circle’s spokesperson told Bloomberg. Top Reasons Why Ripple Eyes Circle Circle’s market complexities Earlier in April, Circle filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the U.S. SEC, with the aim of listing on NYSE under ticker CRCL. While Circle’s revenue grew by 16 percent to $1.7 billion YoY, the company’s net income and EBITDA fell sharply. The company has attributed the decline in net income to increased partner costs, service discontinuation, in addition to operational expenses. For instance, the company has reported an increase in distribution and transaction costs from higher fees on its partners led by Coinbase Global. Future growth prospects for RLUSD Ripple Labs recently launched RLUSD to help streamline its cross-border payments system, which includes backing up XRP adoption. However, the company has faced intense competition from existing stablecoins led by Tether USDT.

Although the trend remains bullish, technical indicators suggest a healthy pause may be on the horizon before the next leg of expansion. The impulsive nature of SUI’s (SUI) recent rally reflects strong bullish momentum. However, price is now facing clear rejection from a resistance zone where both the range high and the 0.618 Fibonacci level are stacked in confluence. This zone is not arbitrary, it was previously established as a structural ceiling, and the current failure to break cleanly through it forms what appears to be a swing-failure pattern (SFP). This adds weight to the idea that a short-term pullback may unfold as part of a larger trend continuation. Key technical points, Major Resistance: Confluence of 0.618 Fibonacci retracement and range high Support Levels to Watch: $2.70 to $2.40 (range mid and VWAP support region) Trend Structure: Potential wave 3 expansion in play after corrective move SUIUSDT (1D) Chart Source: TradingView A potential short-term pullback would be technically healthy, providing an opportunity for a higher low to form. Key zones to monitor for this include the VWAP support region, the range mid, and the 0.618 retracement level, this time acting as support on the way down. These areas serve as the most probable launch points for the next leg higher, potentially initiating a wave 3 expansion in the broader bullish structure. You might also like: XRP must break the $2.50 cluster of resistance to trade higher It’s also important to recognize that the market is entering a phase of balance, where buyers and sellers are competing around key levels. This kind of indecision often precedes a volatility breakout, especially following a strong impulsive move. Traders should watch for volume spikes and candle formations near support for early clues. Notably, while the recent rally was strong, volume has started to taper, further supporting the case for either consolidation or a correction. Price is currently trading within a defined range between $2.70 and $2.40 and is likely to remain in this rotational zone until one of these levels breaks convincingly with volume. What to expect in the coming price action For now, traders should remain patient. The structure of the pullback, if it occurs, will provide critical clues as to whether the next move is another explosive rally or a deeper retracement. A break and hold above the swing high would invalidate the pullback thesis, while a bounce from support would set the stage for further upside.

These pressures are thought to have increased Washington's desire to bring China back to the negotiating table. Meanwhile, analysts say China remains cautious. The sources say Beijing will not reciprocate until the US takes concrete steps instead of relying solely on verbal overtures.

Galaxy Digital , a major player in the crypto financial services sector, has announced a significant step towards expanding its reach within the U.S. market. What’s Happening with Galaxy Digital’s Nasdaq Listing? The core of the announcement, shared by none other than Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz on X, is the planned Nasdaq listing date. According to Novogratz, the company aims to list on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on May 16. However, this isn’t a done deal yet. The listing is contingent upon shareholder approval of Galaxy’s corporate reorganization. This crucial vote is scheduled to take place on May 9. If shareholders give the green light, Galaxy will begin trading under the ticker symbol GLXY on Nasdaq. It’s also important to note that during this transition phase, Galaxy plans to maintain its listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), where it currently trades. Why is a Nasdaq Listing Important for Galaxy Digital and Crypto Stock? A listing on a major U.S. exchange like Nasdaq is a significant milestone for any company, particularly one operating in the still-evolving cryptocurrency industry. Here’s why it matters: Increased Visibility and Access: Listing on Nasdaq opens the door to a much wider pool of potential investors, including large U.S. institutional funds that may have restrictions on investing in foreign-listed or less liquid securities. Enhanced Liquidity: Trading on a high-volume exchange like Nasdaq typically leads to greater trading activity and improved liquidity for the GLXY stock, making it easier for investors to buy and sell shares. Potential for Inclusion in Indices: While not immediate, a U.S. listing could eventually make Galaxy Digital eligible for inclusion in various Nasdaq and other U.S. market indices, further increasing demand and visibility. Regulatory Signal: Listing on a regulated U.S. exchange can be perceived positively by investors, suggesting a level of regulatory compliance and corporate governance adherence. Peer Comparison: It places Galaxy Digital on a more direct playing field with other U.S.-listed companies operating in or adjacent to the crypto space, allowing for easier comparison and valuation. Who is Mike Novogratz and What Does This Mean Coming From Him? Mike Novogratz is a prominent figure in both traditional finance and the cryptocurrency world. A former Goldman Sachs partner and hedge fund manager, he founded Galaxy Digital in 2018 with the vision of building a bridge between the institutional investment world and the nascent digital asset market. His announcement carries weight due to his position as CEO and his deep understanding of both markets involved in this transaction. His public announcement on X signals confidence in the process and provides direct communication to the company’s followers and potential investors about the planned timeline. What Are the Next Steps and Potential Hurdles? The immediate next step is the shareholder vote on May 9. Approval of the reorganization is a necessary condition for the Nasdaq listing to proceed on May 16. While the company anticipates approval, shareholder votes can sometimes hold surprises, although this is typically a procedural step if the board recommends it. Beyond the vote, potential hurdles could include: Market Conditions: The broader performance of the crypto market and traditional equity markets can influence investor sentiment around the listing. Regulatory Environment: The evolving regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies in the U.S. remains a factor for all companies in the space, including those seeking public listings. Execution Risk: Ensuring a smooth transition between listings and meeting all Nasdaq’s requirements is crucial. Actionable Insights for Investors Interested in Crypto Stock For investors looking at gaining exposure to the crypto space through publicly traded companies, Galaxy Digital’s potential Nasdaq listing offers a new avenue. If the listing is approved: Research Galaxy Digital: Understand the company’s business model, financials, and competitive position within the crypto financial services sector. Monitor the Shareholder Vote: Keep an eye on the outcome of the May 9 vote, as this directly impacts the listing date. Consider Liquidity and Access: A Nasdaq listing typically means easier access through standard brokerage accounts and potentially better liquidity compared to foreign exchanges. Assess Market Dynamics: Evaluate the current state of both the crypto market and the broader stock market when considering an investment in GLXY . In Summary: A Potential Game Changer for Galaxy Digital Galaxy Digital’s plan for a Nasdaq listing on May 16, following the crucial May 9 shareholder vote, marks a significant moment for the company and the broader integration of crypto assets into mainstream finance. Should the approval be granted, trading under the GLXY ticker on Nasdaq will provide increased visibility, liquidity, and access for U.S. investors, potentially boosting the profile of this key crypto stock player. It’s a development closely watched by the market, reflecting the ongoing maturation of the digital asset ecosystem.

Shares connected to digital coins jumped even as the S&P 500 Index lost ground. Michael Saylor’s Strategy, trading platform Coinbase Global Inc., and miner CleanSpark Inc. each scored double-digit gains during the month, outpacing the tech firms they usually track. As reported by Bloomberg , the push followed a 13 % rise in Bitcoin itself, reopening arguments about the token as a possible safer asset during market instability. Equities tied to Bitcoin usually swing harder than the crypto asset itself, so they climbed faster when prices went up. “The main driver has been obviously the spot price,” said Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Bill Papanastasiou. “A lot of these miners as well, during this whole tariff debacle, were hit pretty hard, and now they’re rebounding.” Many crypto-linked stocks are yet to rebound Still, many crypto shares are down for the year after a rough first quarter, when falling Bitcoin prices dragged them lower.

Upexi Inc. has soared roughly 450% in April after outlining a plan to raise $100 million to acquire Solana tokens. Blank-check vehicle Cantor Equity Partners Inc. has tripled as it works on a Bitcoin fund tied to key industry players. Moreover, Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. led with shares up nearly 40%. It won permission to list on Nasdaq and gained AI computing work from CoreWeave Inc. “Galaxy is very intriguing just given its multitude of businesses,” said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Brett Knoblauch. “Obviously, as the crypto market does well, their crypto-adjacent businesses do well.” Bitcoin surged past gold and tech stocks Bitcoin climbed higher than gold and major technology shares in April. President Donald Trump’s April 2 statement on new reciprocal tariffs, which he called “Liberation Day,” unsettled investors worldwide. Since the day before his announcement, the Nasdaq Composite has slipped 0.2% , and the Bloomberg Dollar Index is down roughly 4%. Gold, often chosen by cautious investors, touched a record of 3,500 dollars an ounce before easing, but it still holds a 6.1% gain. Bitcoin has advanced sharply during the same span.

The move is aimed at supporting its monetization strategy across its growing media and financial ecosystem. Truth Token and Investment Platform The announcement was made in a shareholder letter ahead of the organization’s 2025 annual meeting. In the document, TMTG reaffirmed its original mission to provide an uncensored alternative to mainstream social media. As part of this vision, the firm has already launched Truth+, a streaming service designed to host family-safe content.

The wallet and token will be integrated into Truth Social and Truth+, offering a built-in payment option for users. TMTG also intends to enhance the former with premium features linked to the latter’s membership, such as verification badges, scheduled posts, editing tools, expanded character limits, and longer video uploads. At the same time, Trump Media is expanding into financial services with the creation of Truth.Fi , a division focused on offering America First-branded investment products. The corporation also plans to launch separately managed accounts (SMAs) and ETFs tailored for its customers in collaboration with Index Technologies Group, Yorkville America Equities, and Crypto.com. Growth and Funding Initiatives To fund its blockchain ambitions, TMTG announced it will allocate up to $250 million from its $777 million cash reserves. This includes direct investments in Bitcoin and other crypto assets, as well as support for the development of its utility token and wallet infrastructure. Meanwhile, Trump Media continues to pursue mergers and acquisitions to diversify its business interests, while addressing concerns over alleged naked short selling of its DJT stock. The firm has also initiated legal action against media outlets, claiming defamation that negatively impacted its brand and market valuation. The company has also confirmed plans to reincorporate in Florida, citing the state’s pro-business, pro-freedom environment as more conducive to its long-term innovation and financial goals.

For those familiar with the resource demands of processes like cryptocurrency mining or complex blockchain computations, the challenge of managing compute resources efficiently is well understood. This is where AI optimization becomes critical. Enter Cast AI, a startup dedicated to easing this resource headache by automating the optimization of AI, Kubernetes, and other demanding workloads. What is Driving the Need for AI Optimization? The explosion of AI development and deployment has placed unprecedented strain on existing infrastructure. Companies are grappling with the sheer volume of data and processing power required, leading to escalating costs and resource allocation complexities. Beyond AI, other modern workloads like those managed by Kubernetes also contribute significantly to compute demands. A key challenge is the underutilization of expensive computing resources. Cast AI highlights research indicating surprisingly low average utilization rates for CPUs (around 10%) and memory (around 23%). This inefficiency extends to GPUs, which are particularly vital and costly for AI tasks. In a market facing processor shortages, getting the most out of available hardware is paramount. Cast AI’s Solution for Kubernetes Cost and Cloud Efficiency Cast AI offers a platform designed to analyze an organization’s cloud and on-premise infrastructure to find the optimal cost-performance ratio for distributing compute workloads. By automating this process, they help businesses reduce waste and improve efficiency. While AI is currently a major growth driver, Cast AI’s roots and a significant portion of its business remain firmly in optimizing Kubernetes cost. The platform integrates with all major cloud providers, allowing customers to manage diverse environments effectively. Yuri Frayman, Cast’s CEO, emphasizes their core mission: “It’s all about GPU, compute and electricity. Our play is to ensure that we create efficiency, to be able to promote more workloads across GPUs. That is what we are about.” Their technology serves a diverse customer base, including large enterprises like Akamai, BMW, FICO, HuggingFace, NielsenIQ, and Swisscom, demonstrating its applicability across various industries facing high compute demands. Achieving Better GPU Utilization GPUs are the backbone for much of today’s advanced AI training and inference. However, like other compute resources, they are often underutilized, leading to wasted investment. Cast AI’s platform directly addresses this by intelligently managing workloads to improve GPU utilization. This focus on efficient GPU use is strategic, aligning Cast AI with major players in the AI infrastructure space. Notably, their recent funding round includes investors like SoftBank Vision Fund 2, placing them in the same portfolio as OpenAI and AI infrastructure provider Crusoe Energy. Frayman highlights these connections: “We are partnering with Crusoe, where we’re inside their stack, and we are partnering with SoftBank to be able to facilitate the efficiency in their AI datacenters.” This integration into critical AI infrastructure projects underscores their role in maximizing the value of high-demand hardware like GPUs. Cast AI Funding and Future Plans Cast AI has successfully raised a significant $108 million in Series C funding. This substantial round follows strong growth and strategic partnerships. Sources indicate the funding values the company at close to $900 million post-money, nearing unicorn status. This marks a significant jump from their previous $35 million round in November 2023, which valued them at $300 million. Prior to this latest infusion, the company had already raised over $86 million. The Series C round was co-led by G2 Venture Partners and SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Other participants include Aglaé Ventures, Hedosophia, Cota Capital, Vintage Investment Partners, Creandum, and Uncorrelated Ventures. The capital will be used to accelerate R&D efforts and expand their business operations in core markets like the U.S., as well as internationally. Who is Cast AI? A Look at Their History and Reach Founded in 2019 by Yuri Frayman, Leon Kuperman, and Laurent Gil, Cast AI draws on the founders’ deep experience in technology and tackling resource challenges. Frayman and Gil previously built Viewdle, an early machine learning startup that utilized Nvidia GPUs for image analysis, later acquired by Google. Their subsequent venture, Zenedge (a cloud-based cybersecurity startup acquired by Oracle), highlighted the difficulties in controlling cloud costs at scale – an experience that directly inspired Cast AI. While officially based in Miami, Florida, Cast AI has a strong European presence, with significant development teams in Lithuania, Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria. In just three years of operation, the company has amassed over 2,100 customers, a testament to the widespread need for their optimization solutions. The Road Ahead: What This Funding Means The $108 million funding round is a clear indicator of investor confidence in Cast AI’s approach to solving critical compute challenges. At a time when AI and complex workloads are driving up infrastructure costs and resource demands, their platform for AI optimization, Kubernetes cost reduction, and cloud efficiency is increasingly vital. By enabling better GPU utilization and overall infrastructure management, Cast AI is poised to play a key role in making advanced computing more accessible and sustainable for businesses worldwide.

Tether’s flagship stablecoin, USDT ( USDT ), is already the US dollar’s top “exporter,” Ardoino told CNBC. It has a market capitalization of nearly $150 billion, according to data from CoinGecko. Now, Tether is preparing to expand into the US market “by the end of this year or early next year, at the fastest,” Ardoino said, adding that the timing depends on US lawmakers’ progress on stablecoin legislation. The stablecoin issuer is working to woo US regulators by proactively collaborating with law enforcement and highlighting USDT’s benefits for the US economy. ""We are just exporters of what we believe to be the best product the United States ever created — that is, the US dollar,” the CEO said. Tether's USDT has 66% of the stablecoin market share. Source: Nansen Related: Tether still dominates stablecoins despite competition — Nansen Market leader As of April 25, USDT commanded a roughly 66% market share among stablecoins, according to Nansen, a Web3 researcher. Tether is also the most profitable stablecoin issuer, logging a net income of nearly $14 billion in 2024. It earns revenue by accepting US dollars to mint USDT and then investing those dollars into highly liquid, yield-bearing instruments such as US Treasury bills. Still, USDT’s popularity is largely limited to users outside of the United States, where rival stablecoin USDC ( USDC ) is dominant. Tether designed USDT “for the people that live in small villages in Africa... [or] a shop owner in Istanbul,” Ardoino told CNBC, adding that Tether is developing a “different product” for the US. Adoption of USDC has accelerated in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s November election win, Nansen said in an April 25 report. Circle’s USDC has a market capitalization of more than $60 billion, CoinGecko data shows. However, USDT is still likely to maintain its leading position in the stablecoin market. “Despite the potential dispersion in stables, we inevitably believe this is a ‘winner-takes-most’ market dynamic,” the Web3 researcher added.

In a post on the social media platform X, Coinbase says it’s added the project’s native token WLD to its listing roadmap. Being added to Coinbase’s roadmap doesn’t guarantee a future listing, but it announces the potential for it to be listed in order to promote transparency and prevent possible insider trading. World Network, recently rebranded from “Worldcoin,” aims to create digital identities for everyone on earth by confirming their humanity with eye-scanning “orbs.” After scanning their eyes with the orbs, users are granted “World IDs” which help counter online bots and fake identities. The project’s ecosystem also includes WLD tokens and an app. Last year, regulators in Spain ordered the project to stop collecting data after receiving numerous complaints from customers that its data-gathering process was invasive. World Network said it conducted a study of 21,000 Spanish users and found that nearly 90% of them support it coming back to Spain. “A new customer survey of more than 21,000 people in Spain, the first of its kind to give a voice to Worldcoin users, shows just how important digital proof of humanness has become in the country and the extent to which people recognize the value provided by World ID… Importantly, 81% of respondents stated that they feel safe using Worldcoin (15% were unsure). The survey results also showed that respondents in Spain strongly support the return of Worldcoin operations in the country (87% support, with 9% unsure).” Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Mathematical genius in the world of algorithms DeepSeek's Prover series are highly specialized models designed to solve mathematical problems. Interestingly, the company has not yet provided any details about the new model on its Hugging Face page. The files that have been viewed suggest that the Prover-V2 is based on the DeepSeek V3 model with an impressive 671 billion parameters. V3 uses a ”mixture of experts” architecture, an approach that enables cost-effective training and operation. This architecture is a smart move to maximize performance at minimal cost. Imagine that instead of hiring one expensive super-expert, you hire a team of highly specialized experts who only work when you need them - that's the savings! Competition between technology giants The launch of Prover-V2 comes just after Alibaba released its Qwen3. The e-commerce giant claimed, citing tests, that their newest model outperforms DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's o1 reasoning models. Prover-V2 is an update to the previous version, Prover-V1.5, which debuted in August, four months before DeepSeek wowed the world with its V3 model. The company claimed that V3 was developed at a fraction of the cost and energy that Western competitors spend on training advanced AI models. ”Our team has achieved an efficiency breakthrough,” DeepSeek executives might be heard saying. - We've proven that innovation doesn't necessarily require giant data centers and budgets the size of a small country's GDP.” Math as the key to advanced AI In a technical report on Prover-V1.5, DeepSeek noted that work on pre-training a specialized model has improved the capabilities of the underlying model in formal theorem proving and mathematical reasoning. The development of a math-oriented model that can augment the math skills of the underlying multi-purpose model has fueled speculation that DeepSeek will soon launch additional products. While DeepSeek doesn't officially share a timeline or progress on new models, the company regularly publishes its latest research results, including updates to the Prover model. Last month, DeepSeek also released an update to its base V3 model, which, according to the company's website, features improved reasoning capabilities, optimized programming, and updated Chinese writing skills. DeepSeek is expected to unveil a new R2 reasoning model soon, amid growing interest in this area of the AI industry.",News|Ai,EN,0,0,TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-30 19:56:29

While its short-term outlook seems promising, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is quickly stealing the spotlight with even more explosive prospects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is currently in Phase 4 of its presale priced at $0.025. The price of MUTM token will climb to $0.03 during Phase 5 locking in a 20% ROI for phase 4 buyers. From its launch the project has managed to secure 9100 investors and raise more than $7.2 million. As XRP looks to reclaim new ground, MUTM’s unique DeFi model and growing adoption could propel it to new heights, making it one to watch as 2025 unfolds. Further driving the newcomer’s momentum is a newly-launched dashboard featuring a leaderboard that highlights the top 50 MUTM holders. Investors who manage to remain among the top 50 will be rewarded with bonus tokens. Title: XRP Price Prediction: Will XRP Hit $4 in the Next 7 Days? XRP has seen increasing interest as it rides a wave of optimism, with analysts expecting it to hit the $4 mark in the next 7 days. The major driver for this optimism is good news on the legal front and increasing institutional adoption, which could support its position in the market. While XRP’s growth continues, its traders are awaiting a potential breakout, and if it can sustain these gains, the $4 level can be more than just a distant fantasy. While XRP takes the lion’s share of attention, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is slowly building its own compelling case for explosive growth in 2025, proving to be yet another player worth keeping an eye on. Mutuum Finance: Shaping the Next Generation of DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance attracts major investor interest through its unique method of decentralized financing. Users can benefit from the combined Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) framework which creates a dual-lending system that provides users with adaptive control together with improved efficiency. The lending process in P2C is fully managed by smart contracts. The P2P model on the other hand gives users complete control over their loan management which provides increased privacy alongside self-directed autonomy. Mutuum Finance provides a high-yield DeFi platform through its adaptive operations alongside liquidity provider returns exceeding 10% which makes it both profitable and easy to use. Boosting Adoption Through a $100K Community Giveaway Mutuum Finance has initiated a $100K prize drive where ten investors receive worth of $10K Mutuum Finance tokens each. These motivating measures attract present platform users while boosting community growth through person-to-person participation and raised membership. The move serves as a strategic method that enhances exposure while promoting genuine user expansion. Security is built into Mutuum Finance by design. The system offers a fully collateralized Ethereum-backed USD-pegged stablecoin to offer long-term stability and avoid volatility common in algorithmic designs. Regular smart contract audits and offering financial transparency build trust with users and counter common vulnerabilities for DeFi protocols. In this setup, Mutuum Finance offers a sensible and trustworthy option for serious long-term investors. XRP may hit $4 in the near term as legal wins and institutional support fuel bullish momentum, but its upside remains relatively modest when compared to the staggering potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM). With $7.2 million raised, 9,100 investors onboard, and Phase 4 pricing still at just $0.025, MUTM offers an anticipated 140% ROI before launch. As the presale nears its next price increase to $0.03, now is the optimal time to act. Secure your position in one of DeFi’s fastest-growing projects today and ride the wave before it crests.

While meme coin enthusiasts are speculating about these bold predictions, a quieter revolution is happening with Ruvi AI, a project that combines blockchain and artificial intelligence to deliver real world solutions. Ruvi AI’s Explosive Entry and Future Growth Ruvi AI launched with a bang, selling over 10 million tokens in just a few days, raising over $100,000 and getting the attention of forward thinking investors. Shortly after, Ruvi AI released its beta platform and users can now try out innovative tools suited for everyday users, as well as for creators and businesses. The platform merges the transparency of blockchain and the intelligence of AI, and is getting interest from industries like healthcare and logistics. If you want to get in on Ruvi AI at the very beginning, time is running out. Tokens are currently priced at $0.01, but phase 2 is coming and the price will increase by 50%, so there is a limited window to get in at the discounted rate before the price goes up further. VIP Tier 1 Breakdown Ruvi AI’s structured presale has different VIP tiers to reward early investors, and VIP Tier 1 is a great starting point for those who want to test the waters. By buying 20,000 tokens, investors get a 20% bonus, which is an additional 4,000 tokens for free. At the current token price of $0.01, this is a $200 investment, for a total of 24,000 tokens. With a confirmed listing price of $0.07, that $200 investment would turn into $1,680, which is a 8.4x return right out of the gate. And it doesn’t stop there. If Ruvi AI hits its ambitious targets and gets to $1 per token, that same investment could be $24,000, which is massive growth. Why Ruvi AI? Unlike Dogecoin and Shiba Inu which live on community sentiment and speculative gains, Ruvi AI is focused on delivering real value through its tech. Its beta platform is solving real world problems, with tools to increase efficiency, reduce costs and tackle fraud in data intensive industries. This practical approach is getting the attention of investors who want more than just hype. What really sets Ruvi AI apart is usability. By using blockchain’s security and AI’s predictive capabilities Ruvi AI is simplifying complex processes and creating solutions that are scalable and impactful. That’s what makes Ruvi AI different in the crypto space. Looking Forward While Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are getting all the headlines with massive percentage gains, Ruvi AI is building a foundation that could change how blockchain and AI intersect. With the presale moving to phase 2 and the token price increasing soon, investors looking for a mix of innovation and growth should pay attention. If you want to get in on a project that’s not only changing how blockchain is perceived but also solving real world problems and brings massive profits, Ruvi AI is a rare ground floor opportunity. This is more than a token; it’s a look into the next wave of technological evolution.

Technical indicators as well as the price charts continue to reflect a bearish market scenario. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins and holding them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,696.64 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price decreased over the last 24 hours towards the support at $582. Sellers stepped in to sell the assets; moreover, the support floor at that level seems unstable because the Bulls secured the level this week. In addition, the coin is now trading below the psychological mark of $600. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB. The burning process also decreases the token supply and increases demand, which is expected to increase in value above $3000 in 2029, according to Binance coin price prediction. Does BNB have a good long-term future? All cryptocurrencies involve risks and uncertainties. However, BNB has a strong market position and a management team that runs the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange. BNB has the potential for increased utility and is expected to retain a strong position in the cryptocurrency sphere. Binance coin price prediction suggests that holding it for the long haul is a good option, with tenfold expected returns in five years and the price reaching $4,696.64 by 2031.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. BNB traded near the psychological mark of $600 in March and April 2025, a level it continues to maintain in May.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|BNB|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-30 20:00:00

Bonk (BONK) is a crypto token built on the Solana blockchain, much like DOGE, WIF, or SHIB. Bonk is a digital asset that can be traded on a number of online platforms, such as Binance, KuCoin, Kraken, MEXC, CoinEx, OKX, gate.io, and Bybit. Bonk has a maximum supply of 93 trillion. It is important to note that 76.92 trillion BONK are already in circulation. Interestingly, despite being a meme coin, Bonk’s supply is tied to its burning process to appreciate its value. The token became popular in 2022 after an airdrop to the Solana community. Despite its popularity and appeal, Bonk is highly volatile, and wild swings in its price action are routine. Along with being a meme coin, the Bonk ecosystem is far more diverse. Several projects built around Bonk also increase its utility prospects, which makes it a popular choice among traders and is also considered the primary trigger behind its 2024 bull run. Bonk Swap, Bonk Rewards, and Bonk BOT are the main features of the Bonk ecosystem. How will the utility of the Bonk ecosystem influence the value of the coin? Will BONK scale new heights?

Being on the Solana blockchain triggered a surge in SOL’s price, attributed to Bonk’s unique distribution strategy. Bonk is a meme coin, but it has many side projects that contribute to its usability and make it more valuable than a mere dog meme coin. It is expected that by 2031, Bonk will reach $0.00009488, which is approximately 7.9 times its current price, making it a good investment to consider. Why is Bonk down? Bonk lost a good portion of its value over the last 24 hours. In the last few hours, its value decreased to $0.000001900. Today’s decreasing pressure triggered a notable descent in the coin’s value. Will Bonk reach $0.000055? Bonk’s strongest current resistance level is $0.00001640. However, just a few days ago, Bonk saw some price action above this level. Bonk may not break above this level in the short term, but according to market speculation, it will reach $0.000055 by the end of 2028. Will Bonk reach $0.0000700? Bonk price prediction suggests that the coin can reach $0.0000700 and surpass it by 2029. When Bonk reaches this price level, its market capitalization will increase 4.5-fold. Will Bonk reach $1? According to the Bonk price prediction, Bonk may not achieve the $1 level in the foreseeable future. It will take considerable time and significant growth in the coin’s market cap to reach $1, which seems impossible as of now. Does Bonk have a good long-term Future? Bonk has garnered much attention from investors with its community-driven value. However, analysts do not share the same sentiment and are divided in their views on the crypto pair. This is true to an extent, as after its initial surge, sustaining the momentum has proved a challenge for Bonk. According to The Cryptopolitan’s review of the cryptocurrency, it is expected that Bonk will reach a maximum value of $0.00009488 by the end of 2031, which is quite a bit above its current price.

Claver’s thread—viewed more than 250,000 times within 48 hours—posits that private liquidity venues are absorbing large buy orders that would otherwise inflate the public order book. “So what’s a dark pool, exactly? Picture trying to buy $500 million worth of XRP without tipping off the market,” he wrote. “Dark pools are private spots where huge orders get filled off the main exchanges.” XRP Price Rigged? The pundit described the mechanism as a “double-edged sword.” In the near term, he contends, clandestine accumulation “hides bullish momentum and drags prices down,” leaving retail traders to conclude that the asset has lost steam. Over a longer horizon, however, the same process allegedly tightens circulating supply until, he warned, “the dam bursts.” Related Reading: XRP Price Takes a Breather — Can Bulls Bounce Back from Here? “Institutions are quietly draining liquidity from public exchanges,” Claver asserted, adding that hedge funds, family offices and even sovereign entities have begun using dark-pool facilities now offered by major exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken, as well as emerging decentralized alternatives. Because transactions are reported only after execution, he argued, “smart money doesn’t leave a trail.” Claver suggested that XRP is a prime beneficiary of this covert activity. In his view, pending regulatory clarity and enterprise-level adoption could coincide with dwindling float, leading to an abrupt repricing. “At a certain point, demand on public exchanges will explode past supply — and that’s when the market will panic to reprice itself. Get ready for a potential 2×, 3×, even 5× sprint,” he wrote. Should the hidden bid exhaust available inventory, “the price gaps straight up … charts will look like someone flipped a switch.” Related Reading: XRP To Hit $8, No Double Digits This Cycle — Warns Crypto Analyst He underscored the psychological dimension of a prolonged flat tape: “These are the stretches where even the die-hard believers start doubting and walk away. But if you hang tight, you might just catch what comes next.” Comparing dark-pool activity to a “pressure cooker,” Claver added, “They bottle up all that buying pressure now, but eventually, the lid blows off.” Concluding his thread, he urged patience: “Stay locked in. When the dam breaks, you’ll be grateful you bought at 50 cents instead of scrambling to buy at $10.” Is There Proof? Market data do indicate muted volatility in XRP, which has traded in a narrow corridor around $2.00 for much of April despite a succession of positive fundamentals and news from Ripple. Whether dark-pool activity is the decisive variable, however, remains unverified; most over-the-counter (OTC) trading is reported only in aggregated form, and no public ledger tracks the size of institutional flows Claver describes. Claver offered no documentary evidence for the alleged scale of purchasing, and his analysis stops short of quantifying volumes. Nevertheless, his thread reinforces a familiar narrative in crypto markets: that price calm on the surface may belie deep currents of accumulation below. For retail spectators, the question is whether those unseen currents will indeed surface as the “vertical” move Claver envisions—​or remain, like most dark-pool orders, permanently out of sight. At press time, XRP traded at $2.21.

The report covered comparisons of how much money the industry has lost this year compared to last year, how much users lost this month alone, which projects got hit the hardest, how the thefts occurred, and the most affected chains. Bad actors have carted away a whopping $1.7 billion from the crypto world so far. Source: Immunefi More money has been lost this year than all of last year We are now four months into 2025, and according to Immunefi’s report , bad actors have carted away a whopping $1.7 billion from the crypto world so far. The number looks large, and it is because the industry lost about $420 million around the same time. In essence, this year has been four times worse than 2024. The $1.7 billion that has been reported stolen within the first four months of this year is more than the total amount of money stolen in 2024, which totaled $1.49 billion. This month alone, hackers got away with $92.5 million, which represents a 27% increase compared to what they stole last April, when they stole about $72.6 million. That is also more than the $41.4 million they stole in March this year, which means this month has been twice as bad as March. The biggest losers of 2025 According to Immunefi , about ten projects got hit the hardest with hacks, losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in most of the cases. However, of those ten projects, two stand out for losing the most. They include UPCX, which lost up to $70 million, while KiloEx lost $7.5 million. According to the report, all the money carted away were lost to hacks rather than fraud. Source: Immunefi Other projects that lost money include Loopscale, ZKsync, and Term Labs, although their losses were limited relative to the biggest incidents, ranging from $84,100 to $5.8 million. Fortunately, some of the stolen funds were recovered thanks to the help of on-chain sleuths like ZachXBT. According to the report, all the money carted away was lost to hacks rather than fraud. In fact, there was no single case of fraud reported, according to Immunefi. As for the chains where these attacks went down, Ethereum leads the poll with five different attacks, while BNB endured only four attacks. The total amount of money lost on both chains makes up 60% of all the stolen funds in April. Of course, they were not the only two chains hit. Other chains like Base, Arbitrum, Solana, Sonic, and ZKsync got hit too. However, the hacks happened less often compared to those on Ethereum and BSC. The report also revealed that all the stolen funds came from the DeFi sector, while the CeFi sector recorded no losses in April. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

A major player in the sports world is making a significant move in the Web3 space. FIFA, the international governing body of football, has announced exciting plans regarding its digital collection platform. If you’re interested in the intersection of sports, technology, and digital ownership, this news about the FIFA Blockchain is something you’ll want to understand. What’s Happening with FIFA Collect? FIFA is taking a bold step by migrating its existing Web3 digital collection platform, known as FIFA Collect , to a new, dedicated network. This isn’t just a minor update; it’s a fundamental shift to a proprietary blockchain solution. According to reports, including insights shared by @solidintel_x, this migration is set to move FIFA Collect onto the new FIFA Blockchain itself. Think of FIFA Collect as the digital home for fans to collect and trade official FIFA digital memorabilia. These collectibles are typically Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), representing unique digital assets like iconic moments from World Cups, player cards, posters, and more. Until now, these collectibles likely resided on a third-party blockchain network. The move to their own chain signifies a desire for greater control and customization. Why Build a Dedicated FIFA Blockchain? The primary drivers behind this migration, as highlighted by FIFA, are centered around improving the platform’s core capabilities. These include: Performance: Running on a dedicated chain can potentially reduce transaction times and improve the overall speed of interactions on the platform, especially during peak demand times like major tournaments. Functionality: Having control over the blockchain allows FIFA to implement custom features and functionalities specifically tailored to the needs of sports collectibles and fan engagement, without being limited by the roadmap or capabilities of a public chain. Scalability: A proprietary chain can be designed or adjusted to handle a potentially massive number of users and transactions, crucial for a global brand like FIFA with hundreds of millions of fans. This is vital as the platform grows and more digital collectibles are introduced. Beyond these technical points, building their own chain also gives FIFA more direct control over the platform’s economics, governance, and future development. It allows them to create a more integrated ecosystem around their digital assets. Understanding EVM Compatibility A key technical detail of the new FIFA Blockchain is that it will be EVM Compatible . What exactly does this mean, and why is it important? EVM stands for Ethereum Virtual Machine. Ethereum is the blockchain network that pioneered smart contracts and is currently the largest ecosystem for decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs. The EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts on Ethereum. Being EVM Compatible means that the new FIFA Blockchain can run smart contracts written for Ethereum. This offers several significant advantages: Developer Familiarity: Many blockchain developers are already skilled in writing smart contracts for the EVM using languages like Solidity. This makes it easier for FIFA or third-party developers to build applications and features on their new chain. Tooling and Infrastructure: A vast ecosystem of development tools, wallets, and infrastructure built for Ethereum is often compatible or easily adaptable for EVM-compatible chains. Potential for Interoperability: While a separate chain, EVM compatibility can sometimes facilitate future bridges or interactions with the broader Ethereum ecosystem, though this depends on FIFA’s specific implementation. Essentially, choosing an EVM Compatible architecture allows FIFA to leverage the maturity and widespread adoption of Ethereum’s development standards without being directly tied to the performance or transaction costs of the main Ethereum network. How Does This Impact FIFA NFT Collectors? For existing users of FIFA Collect and those interested in collecting NFT s from FIFA, this migration brings both potential benefits and things to consider. Potential Benefits: Improved user experience due to better performance and scalability. Potential for new, platform-specific features and types of collectibles. A more stable and predictable environment, potentially with lower or different transaction fees compared to a busy public chain. Increased confidence in the long-term vision for FIFA’s digital collectibles platform. Things to Consider: Users will need to understand how to interact with the new FIFA Blockchain . This might involve using specific wallets or going through FIFA’s official platform interface. The process of migrating existing NFTs from the old chain to the new one will need to be clearly communicated by FIFA. Users must follow instructions carefully to ensure their assets are transferred safely. The value and liquidity of the NFTs will now be tied to the success and activity on the new FIFA chain, rather than a larger public network. Overall, the goal is likely to create a smoother, more integrated experience for fans who want to engage with FIFA’s digital offerings in the Web3 space. FIFA’s Web3 Strategy: A Broader Trend FIFA’s decision to build its own chain for FIFA Collect isn’t happening in a vacuum. It reflects a growing trend among large brands and organizations exploring Web3 technologies. Why are more entities considering dedicated or semi-private chains? Reason Explanation Control Full ownership over the network rules, upgrades, and data. Customization Ability to tailor the chain specifically for their use case (e.g., collectibles, supply chain, loyalty points). Predictable Costs Avoidance of fluctuating transaction fees (gas fees) often seen on public chains like Ethereum. User Experience Potential to abstract away some blockchain complexities for the end-user, making it feel more like a traditional app. Regulatory Clarity Operating a more controlled environment might offer clearer pathways for compliance in some jurisdictions. While public blockchains offer decentralization and transparency, a dedicated chain can provide the performance, control, and customization that large organizations often require for specific applications like managing a large volume of digital collectibles and fan interactions. FIFA is leveraging the core technology of blockchain (secure, verifiable digital ownership) while building it within an environment they can manage to best serve their audience and business goals. What’s Next for FIFA Collect and the FIFA Blockchain? The announcement of the migration is just the first step. The actual transition will involve technical work to set up the new FIFA Blockchain and move existing NFT assets. FIFA will need to provide clear instructions and support for users during this process. Looking ahead, having a dedicated chain opens up possibilities for FIFA to explore deeper integrations of Web3 technology into its broader ecosystem. This could include: Enhanced utility for collectibles (e.g., granting access to exclusive content or experiences). Integration with future FIFA digital initiatives. Potential for new types of fan engagement powered by blockchain. The success of this migration and the new FIFA Blockchain will depend on its technical execution, the user experience it provides, and the value it delivers to fans who engage with FIFA Collect . Actionable Insights for Fans and Collectors If you are currently collecting or are interested in collecting NFT s from FIFA Collect , here are a few things to keep in mind: Stay Informed: Pay close attention to official communications from FIFA regarding the migration timeline and process. Understand the New Platform: Familiarize yourself with how the new FIFA Blockchain works and any changes to accessing or managing your digital assets. Secure Your Assets: Ensure you understand how your wallet interacts with the new chain and take necessary steps to secure your private keys. Evaluate the Ecosystem: Observe how the new dedicated chain impacts the trading and community around FIFA collectibles. Conclusion FIFA’s decision to migrate FIFA Collect to its own EVM Compatible FIFA Blockchain marks a significant evolution in its Web3 strategy. It’s a move aimed at gaining more control, enhancing performance, and improving scalability to better serve its massive global fanbase. While moving to a dedicated chain presents challenges, particularly around user transition and building a new ecosystem, it also unlocks exciting possibilities for integrating digital ownership more deeply into the football experience. This development is a clear indicator that major global brands see a future in leveraging blockchain technology, not just for collectibles, but potentially for broader fan engagement and digital ecosystems.

Cardano (ADA) technical analysis points toward bullish movement near $0.70, with momentum building to clear $0.720. On the flip side, the Avalanche (AVAX) short-term outlook raises caution as volatility and bubble risk levels climb. As the big names move, new opportunities are attracting investors eager for bigger rewards. That spotlight is shifting toward BlockDAG . With its presale reaching final stages and its beta testnet already live, BlockDAG is gaining traction as one of the best long-term crypto investments. What is drawing even more attention now is the 25% referral frenzy, creating a rare “second chance” moment. Every $1,000 you help someone accumulate nets you $250 in free BDAG coins, but time is quickly running out. BlockDAG’s Presale Momentum Strengthens Buying Appeal BlockDAG’s presale performance is setting new benchmarks, with more than $222.5 million raised and over 19.6 billion coins sold. After a temporary rollback to $0.0019, the discounted pricing has ended, and buyers are moving fast to lock in BDAG before the launch, where listing is planned at $0.05. Its beta testnet is already live, handling more than 800 transactions per second, adding to BlockDAG’s reputation as one of the best long-term crypto investments heading into 2025. Central to the surge is the 25% referral program, giving participants a direct way to grow their holdings. For every $1,000 referred, users receive $250 in BDAG, creating an advantage not often seen in presales. BlockDAG’s approach mirrors early Bitcoin opportunities, where quick movers captured the greatest gains. The introduction of “Buyer Battles,” offering daily rewards from a 25 million BDAG prize pool, is keeping energy high. Coupled with partnerships like Inter Milan’s blockchain collaboration and third-party audits by CertiK and Halborn, BlockDAG is positioning itself to become a serious force. As the presale edges toward completion, BlockDAG is cementing its place among the best long-term crypto investments of the year. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis Points to Potential Breakout Momentum is building around Cardano as it pushes above $0.70. The latest Cardano (ADA) technical analysis highlights resistance near $0.7150 and $0.720, with a breakout above these points possibly leading to a rally toward $0.750 and even $0.780. Indicators are flashing green, with the MACD flipping bullish and the RSI trending above 50, suggesting buyers are gaining strength. If Cardano successfully breaks $0.750, a sharper upward move could unfold. However, failure to sustain the above resistance could lead to a retest of $0.70 or even $0.680 in support. Still, Cardano (ADA) technical analysis suggests the setup remains promising for bulls as broader market sentiment improves. ADA’s price action is worth watching closely in the near term. Avalanche (AVAX) Short-Term Outlook Flags Growing Volatility While optimism builds elsewhere, the Avalanche (AVAX) short-term outlook paints a more cautious picture. Avalanche’s bubble risk score has climbed to 0.769, signaling bearish conditions. With historical swings between $4 and $100, AVAX’s past volatility is well known, and the latest risk readings raise red flags once again. Currently hovering around $20, AVAX faces growing pressure. Past instances of similar risk scores in 2021 and 2023 were followed by sharp sell-offs. Right now, the Avalanche (AVAX) short-term outlook points toward continued instability, prompting many traders to adopt cautious, flexible strategies. While a recovery is still possible, the caution signs are too strong to ignore. The Window Is Closing Fast Cardano (ADA) technical analysis reveals bullish momentum that could push prices toward $0.750 if buyers maintain their hold. Meanwhile, the Avalanche (AVAX) short-term outlook remains risky, with rising volatility signaling unstable ground around the $20 mark. Both projects could see quick moves ahead, but risk profiles differ sharply. At the same time, BlockDAG continues to capture buyer interest as one of the best long-term crypto investments . With over $222.5 million secured, a successful beta testnet, and a strong referral incentive offering $250 for every $1,000 referred, BlockDAG is creating a pathway for early movers to grow their stakes before public trading begins.

Emphasizing the need for banks to keep a close eye on developments in the crypto industry, Trump highlighted the benefits of the blockchain technology behind cryptocurrencies to the financial system. He trashed existing solutions for cross-border transactions, such as the global international messaging network SWIFT, which is often criticized for its turtle-like transactions. ”There is nothing that can be done on blockchain that can't be done better than the way current financial institutions work. SWIFT is an absolute disaster,” he stated. With the advent of cryptocurrencies, traditional payment instruments such as SWIFT risk losing market share to decentralized alternatives, Trump said, ”You can open the DeFi app right now, you can open any cryptocurrency app and send money, wallet to wallet, instantly, no additional costs, no variability.” Trump's warning comes amid a backdrop of many global banks still resisting the adoption of cryptocurrencies, with Italy's finance minister stated that U.S. stablecoins pose a greater threat than tariffs.

A major challenge remains bridging the gap between traditional fiat currencies and the efficiency of digital assets, particularly for seamless, low-cost international transactions. This is where Alchemy Pay , a prominent fiat-to-crypto payment gateway provider, is stepping up its game with an exciting new development: the planned launch of its own dedicated network, Alchemy Chain . What is Alchemy Chain and Why is it Needed for Stablecoin Payments ? Alchemy Pay has officially unveiled the roadmap for Alchemy Chain , a planned Layer-1 blockchain network designed with a very specific and powerful purpose: enabling efficient and affordable stablecoin payments , especially for cross-border transactions. While existing blockchains can handle stablecoins, a dedicated network like Alchemy Chain aims to optimize the process by addressing common pain points. Think about sending money internationally today. It often involves multiple intermediaries, high fees, and slow settlement times. Cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar, offer a potential solution. However, even using stablecoins on existing blockchains can face issues like unpredictable or high gas fees and the need for manual currency conversion on either end. Alchemy Chain is being built from the ground up to tackle these challenges head-on. By creating its own infrastructure, Alchemy Pay can tailor the network’s features specifically for high-volume, low-value payment transactions using stablecoins. Key Features Revealed in the Alchemy Chain Roadmap The roadmap published on Alchemy Pay’s website details several core features intended to make Alchemy Chain a compelling platform for global payments. Here are some highlights: Fixed Gas Fees: One of the biggest hurdles for using many blockchains for everyday transactions is the volatility and unpredictability of gas fees. Alchemy Chain aims to implement fixed gas fees, providing cost certainty for users and businesses. This is crucial for mass adoption, especially for smaller transactions. Integrated Currency Conversion: Handling multiple currencies is inherent in cross-border payments. Alchemy Chain plans to integrate currency conversion directly into the network’s functionality, simplifying the process for users and potentially reducing reliance on external services. Stablecoin Focus: While likely supporting other assets, the primary focus is on stablecoins. This ensures transaction value stability, which is essential for payments and commerce. Layer-1 Architecture: Building a dedicated Layer 1 blockchain allows Alchemy Pay full control over the network’s design, security, and performance, optimizing it specifically for its intended use case rather than building on top of a general-purpose chain. These features suggest Alchemy Pay is serious about creating an ecosystem where sending and receiving value across borders using stablecoins is as simple and cost-effective as possible. Addressing the Need for Streamlined Cross-Border Payments Crypto The demand for better cross-border payments crypto solutions is massive. Traditional systems are often slow, expensive, and opaque. Cryptocurrencies, particularly stablecoins, offer the promise of instant, near-free transactions globally. However, realizing this promise requires infrastructure that is reliable, scalable, and user-friendly. Alchemy Chain aims to be that infrastructure. By focusing on fixed fees and integrated conversion, it removes significant friction points that currently hinder widespread crypto adoption for payments. Businesses, freelancers, and individuals sending remittances could all potentially benefit from a network optimized for these specific needs. The development of a dedicated Layer 1 blockchain for this purpose highlights Alchemy Pay’s long-term vision. Instead of being just a gateway on existing chains, they are building their own highway for stablecoin value transfer. This strategic move could position Alchemy Pay as a key player in the future of global digital payments. The Road Ahead: Mainnet Launch and Beyond According to the published roadmap, the mainnet launch for Alchemy Chain is targeted for the second quarter of 2026. This indicates a significant development period ahead, involving rigorous testing, security audits, and ecosystem building. While 2026 might seem far off, building a secure, scalable, and reliable Layer 1 blockchain is a complex undertaking. The timeline suggests Alchemy Pay is taking a deliberate approach to ensure the network is robust and ready for real-world adoption upon launch. The success of Alchemy Chain will depend on several factors, including: Ecosystem Adoption: Will businesses, merchants, and other payment providers integrate with Alchemy Chain? Stablecoin Support: Which stablecoins will be natively supported and easily convertible? Regulatory Environment: How will global regulations impact a network focused on stablecoin payments? Competition: The space for crypto-based payments is becoming increasingly crowded. Nevertheless, the roadmap provides a clear direction and demonstrates Alchemy Pay’s commitment to innovation in the payment space. For holders of the ACH token, the development of Alchemy Chain could be a significant catalyst, potentially increasing the utility and demand for the token within the new ecosystem. Conclusion: Alchemy Pay’s Bold Step into the Future of Payments Alchemy Pay’s announcement of the Alchemy Chain roadmap marks a significant step in its evolution. By planning a dedicated Layer 1 blockchain focused on optimized stablecoin payments with features like fixed fees and integrated conversion, Alchemy Pay is positioning itself to address the growing demand for efficient cross-border payments crypto solutions.

In a case challenging the Internal Revenue Service’s handling of user crypto data, Coinbase was the latest to weigh in. On April 30, the exchange filed an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court in the Harper vs IRS case, advocating for more privacy protections when it comes to crypto transactions. Back in 2016, the IRS requested data on 14,000 of Coinbase’s customers, in an attempt to find any evidence of tax evasion. The agency relied on the third-party doctrine, which states that once users voluntarily share data with a third party, like a crypto exchange, they forfeit their privacy protections. In response, Bitcoin researcher James Harper sued the IRS in 2020, accusing it of overreach. Supreme Court should redefine privacy protections: Coinbase In its brief to the Supreme Court, Coinbase argued that this doctrine is outdated, especially when it comes to crypto transactions. Notably, Coinbase believes that crypto exchanges are more similar to platforms than crypto custodians. Instead of broad searches, the IRS should have probable cause when it comes to requesting information.

It was unprecedented in its sweep. The summons targeted 14,355 Americans. The IRS did not have particularized reasonable suspicion that a single one of them was evading his or her tax obligations,” Coinbase The Supreme Court is the highest court in the U.S. and one that has unparalleled influence on the legal system. Any ruling it makes automatically becomes legal precedent, and both the courts and the executive branch have to abide by it. If the Supreme Court sides against the IRS in this case, its ruling would fundamentally change the government’s powers when it comes to protecting user privacy.

A Circle spokesperson declined to comment on the reported offer and reiterated the firm’s long-term focus. “We do not comment on market rumors,” the spokesperson said in an email. “As we are currently in a quiet period with the SEC , we cannot comment further on our corporate financial plans.” Ripple launched its own stablecoin, RLUSD, in December.

Through this collaboration, Circle will gain access to regulatory sandbox resources to test its blockchain-based products, including its stablecoins USDC and EURC, under local supervision.

While it might seem unrelated at first glance, key economic data from the United States, like the monthly US Jobs Report , often sends ripples through global financial markets, including the volatile world of cryptocurrencies. The latest report for April delivered a surprise, showing a significant slowdown in employment growth that could have interesting implications for investors keeping an eye on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. What Did the Latest Nonfarm Payrolls Data Show? According to data cited by Investing.com based on ADP figures, the US Jobs Report for April revealed that nonfarm employment increased by a modest 62,000. This figure fell considerably short of market expectations, which had anticipated a gain closer to 114,000 jobs. To put this into perspective, it also represents a sharp deceleration from the previous month’s performance, where the economy added a more robust 147,000 jobs. Here’s a quick look at the numbers: April Nonfarm Employment Gain: 62,000 Market Forecast: 114,000 Previous Month (March) Gain: 147,000 This miss in the Nonfarm Payrolls data suggests that the pace of hiring in the U.S. economy is slowing down more rapidly than economists and analysts had predicted. Why Does the US Jobs Report Matter for Financial Markets? The US Jobs Report , particularly the Nonfarm Payrolls number, is one of the most closely watched economic indicators globally. It provides a crucial snapshot of the health and momentum of the U.S. labor market, which in turn is a significant driver of consumer spending and overall economic activity. A strong labor market typically indicates a growing economy, which can lead to inflationary pressures. Conversely, a weakening labor market can signal an Economic Slowdown , potentially reducing inflation risks. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve pay very close attention to this data when making decisions about monetary policy, specifically regarding Federal Reserve Interest Rates . How Could This Economic Slowdown Impact Federal Reserve Interest Rates ? This is where the link to the crypto market becomes clearer. The primary tool the Federal Reserve uses to manage the economy is adjusting the benchmark interest rate. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which can cool down economic activity and curb inflation. Lower interest rates have the opposite effect, stimulating borrowing and spending. When economic data, like the recent US Jobs Report , suggests an Economic Slowdown , it can influence the Fed’s calculus. A weakening labor market might give the Fed more reason to consider cutting interest rates sooner than previously anticipated, or at least hold off on any potential future rate hikes. Conversely, strong jobs data would typically support the argument for maintaining higher rates for longer or even considering hikes if inflation remains a concern. The Potential Crypto Market Impact So, how does a potential shift in Federal Reserve Interest Rates due to an Economic Slowdown affect the Crypto Market Impact ? Here’s the general dynamic: Lower Interest Rates: When interest rates are lower, the cost of borrowing decreases. This can encourage investment in riskier assets, as the returns from safer investments like bonds become less attractive. Cryptocurrencies, being high-volatility assets, often benefit from environments where investors are more willing to take on risk. Lower rates can also lead to increased liquidity in the financial system, some of which may flow into crypto. Higher Interest Rates: Conversely, higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive and increase the appeal of safer, fixed-income investments. This can draw capital away from riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies. The recent miss in the US Jobs Report , by signaling a potential Economic Slowdown , could increase the market’s expectation of earlier or more significant rate cuts by the Federal Reserve . This expectation can sometimes trigger a positive reaction in risk asset markets, including crypto, even before any actual rate change occurs, as markets tend to price in future events. Challenges and Considerations While a weaker jobs report can be interpreted as potentially bullish for crypto due to rate cut expectations, it’s crucial to consider other factors: One Data Point: The Fed doesn’t base decisions on a single report. They look at a wide range of economic data (inflation, GDP, manufacturing, etc.) over time. Reason for Slowdown: Is the slowdown a controlled cooling or a sign of deeper issues? A severe recession would likely be negative for all markets, including crypto. Other Global Factors: Geopolitical events, regulatory news, and developments within the crypto space itself also heavily influence prices. Market Volatility: The crypto market is inherently volatile and can react unpredictably to macro news. Actionable Insights for Crypto Investors What should you take away from this US Jobs Report ? Stay Informed: Keep an eye on major economic indicators like the Nonfarm Payrolls and inflation data. Understanding the macro environment is key. Understand the Link: Recognize how Federal Reserve Interest Rates policy, influenced by data like the US Jobs Report and signs of Economic Slowdown , can impact the broader market sentiment towards risk assets like crypto. Look for Trends: Don’t overreact to a single data release. Look for consistent patterns in economic data over several months. Manage Risk: Given the potential for market shifts based on economic news and Fed actions, ensure your crypto portfolio aligns with your risk tolerance. Summary: Navigating the Data The April US Jobs Report , showing a significant miss in Nonfarm Payrolls growth, points towards a potential Economic Slowdown . This development is important because it could influence the Federal Reserve ‘s decisions regarding Federal Reserve Interest Rates . While a weaker economy might prompt the Fed to consider lower rates sooner, which is generally seen as positive for the Crypto Market Impact , investors must consider this data point within the broader economic context and other market-moving factors. Staying informed and understanding these connections is vital for navigating the intersection of traditional finance and the digital asset space.

The company has announced a new product that will enable stablecoin payments in six countries in Latin America, including Mexico and Argentina. Developed in collaboration with Stripe-affiliated technology startup Bridge, the solution aims to make cryptocurrencies a part of everyday commerce for both consumers and businesses. Stablecoins are blockchain-based assets whose value is pegged to fiat currencies like the US dollar. They are quickly gaining popularity in traditional financial circles due to their easy transferability. Visa’s new service will allow a freelancer in Colombia, for example, to receive payments in stablecoins from the US and spend the amount with a physical or digital Visa card. Visa Vice President Rubail Birwadker said that stablecoin payments are integrated into Visa’s system, allowing businesses to receive instant payments in their own currency. Birwadker noted that many people in Latin America already hold stablecoins as a hedge against economic volatility, and that this new service will accelerate the integration of crypto assets into everyday use. Related News: New Developments in the Tariff Dispute Between the US and China - Is an Agreement Near? Chinese Sources Speak Out The new service will be available in six countries including Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile. What makes this solution stand out is that it has been developed with more stablecoins, rather than cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which have volatile prices. Visa’s technology partner Bridge was founded by former Coinbase employees Zach Abrams and Sean Yu and was acquired by Stripe for $1.1 billion in 2023. Bridge is described as a neutral technology provider that allows developers to create stablecoin-based financial services. Visa says that through this partnership, various third parties can develop their own applications and provide services to both consumers and businesses. The system, which will be implemented with the USDC stablecoin supported by Circle and Coinbase in the first phase, is expected to support different stablecoins and blockchain infrastructures in the future. Currently, the system will use the Ethereum network. Bridge CEO Zach Abrams stated that this structure will enable the rapid development of financial applications, especially in countries lacking complex fintech infrastructures. *This is not investment advice.

If bulls confirm the signal with a strong May open, especially above April’s high of around $1,950, Ethereum could be primed for another multimonth rally, beginning with an initial run toward $2,100 .

To read full editions, subscribe . Solana is stalled sideways, with the broader crypto market hitting some light turbulence. SOL is trading at $145.45 midweek, down 2.5% from last Wednesday and now drifting crabwise after a month-long rally that pushed it up nearly 30% from April lows. Despite the modest cooling of momentum, Solana continues to print usage at speed. Over the past 30 days, transaction fees have hit an annualized $432.9 million, with SOL burn running at an annualized $216.5 million pace. Besides macro headwinds, we can probably trace some of the cautious price action to the looming FTX liquidation, where over 60% of the estate’s onchain assets are in SOL. The first wave of creditor repayments is scheduled for May 30 — funded by prior asset sales, including FTX’s March SOL deals — which may still weigh on sentiment even if the tokens themselves are no longer in play. SOL’s market cap has slipped to $75.3 billion, and while 24-hour volume remains strong at $3.49 billion, buyers can’t seem to stop peeking over their shoulders. The last round of FTX estate unlocks kicked off March 1 — right before a drawdown in SOL’s price, although there were obviously other factors involved . Bitcoin, meanwhile, had a little gut punch this morning due to macro. On Wednesday, BTC dropped to $92,910 after US GDP data showed a 0.3% contraction in Q1 — its first in three years. Analysts were quick to cite the sudden impact of Trump’s revived tariff policy, with imports surging and dragging down the GDP print. Stocks sold off, recession chatter kicked up, and bitcoin dipped. As is tradition, the price rebounded within hours to $94,000, buoyed by strong spot demand and resilient ETF inflows, including over $3 billion in net new capital through April 29. Last weekend’s Crossroads event in Istanbul allowed the Solana community to take stock of direction. It was a lot of builders comparing notes, investors checking pulse, and variant teams workshopping infrastructure that still has a shot at scaling mainstream demand — lots of honest conversations about payments, gaming, DePIN and the gaps that still need filling. So far, though, the resulting confidence of those discussions has not translated into price. For now, conviction is expensive. The market is still frozen by what-ifs. What if the market prices in the FTX overhang? What if bitcoin fails to clear $96K and drags everything else with it? What if global retaliation hits US tech exports, and risk assets feel the heat? Once these questions have answers, folks will either step up or step aside. And that’s when the market’ll start moving again…ready or not. Get the news in your inbox.

However, their widespread adoption has brought a critical challenge to the forefront: data privacy. Feeding sensitive or proprietary information into centralized LLMs raises significant concerns about confidentiality and security. This is where the groundbreaking collaboration between decentralized blind computing platform Nillion and tech giant Meta steps in, offering a revolutionary solution. The two entities have co-authored a significant paper introducing Fission LLM , a novel system designed to address these very privacy concerns. Announced via Nillion’s official X account, this partnership signals a major step towards making powerful AI tools accessible and secure for handling confidential data. The paper, titled “Fission: Distributed Privacy-Preserving LLM Inference,” delves into the technical intricacies of how this system operates. What is Fission LLM and Why Does Privacy Matter? At its core, Fission LLM is described as a decentralized, privacy-preserving system specifically built for LLM inference. But what does that mean in practical terms, and why is privacy such a hot topic when it comes to AI? Traditional LLM inference often requires sending data to a central server for processing. If this data includes sensitive information—like personal health records, financial details, or confidential business strategies—it becomes vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, or misuse. Regulatory frameworks like GDPR and HIPAA further underscore the legal and ethical imperative to protect such data. The goal of Privacy-Preserving LLMs is to allow users to leverage the power of AI without compromising the confidentiality of their input data. This can be achieved through various cryptographic techniques, and Fission proposes a novel approach leveraging decentralized infrastructure. Decoding Decentralized Blind Computing with Nillion Understanding Fission requires a look at Nillion and its core technology: decentralized blind computing. Unlike traditional computing models where data is processed in a single location, Nillion utilizes a decentralized network of nodes. The ‘blind’ aspect comes from its use of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and other cryptographic techniques. Think of it like this: Instead of sending your entire secret to one person to be processed, you break it into pieces and send different pieces to multiple people (the decentralized nodes). Each person performs a part of the computation on their piece without ever seeing the whole secret or the pieces held by others. The results are then combined to get the final answer, without any single party (or the network as a whole) ever learning the original secret data. Nillion’s platform is designed to perform complex computations, including those required for AI models, in this distributed and private manner. This capability is foundational to the Fission system. The Meta Connection: Bringing LLM Expertise While Nillion brings the decentralized blind computing infrastructure, Meta, a leader in AI research and development (including LLMs), contributes significant expertise in the architecture and operational demands of large language models. The collaboration involves co-authoring the research paper, suggesting a joint effort in designing the Fission system’s theoretical framework and practical implementation considerations. This partnership is noteworthy because it combines cutting-edge decentralized privacy technology with deep knowledge of state-of-the-art AI models. It’s a powerful synergy aimed at solving a critical problem facing the broader adoption of LLMs in sensitive domains. Fission LLM: Faster, More Secure, and Private? The paper highlights key benefits of the Fission LLM system: Enhanced Privacy: Input data remains encrypted or secret-shared across the decentralized network, preventing any single entity (including the LLM provider or individual nodes) from accessing the raw, sensitive information. Improved Security: A decentralized architecture inherently reduces single points of failure. Data is not concentrated in one vulnerable location, making it more resilient to attacks. Faster Inference (Potentially): While privacy-preserving techniques can sometimes introduce overhead, the paper suggests Fission is designed for efficient inference. Decentralized computing can potentially parallelize tasks more effectively than traditional methods, leading to faster processing times for certain types of LLM queries, especially as the network scales. Decentralized Control: Moving away from centralized servers gives users and applications more control over their data and how it’s processed. The system leverages Nillion’s network to perform the LLM inference computation in a distributed, private manner. This means the sensitive prompt or data is processed by the network nodes using cryptographic techniques, and only the non-sensitive output is returned to the user. Potential Challenges and Considerations While promising, the implementation and widespread adoption of systems like Fission LLM also face challenges: Technical Complexity: Implementing and scaling decentralized privacy-preserving computation for large, complex models like LLMs is technically demanding. Performance Overhead: Although designed for efficiency, cryptographic operations inherently add some computational cost compared to plaintext computation. The paper likely addresses how Fission minimizes this. Network Adoption: The success relies on a robust and reliable decentralized network of computing nodes (Nillion’s network). Model Compatibility: Adapting different LLM architectures to be compatible with a distributed, privacy-preserving computation framework requires significant research and development. The paper likely explores these aspects, detailing the specific cryptographic protocols and distributed computing strategies employed to mitigate potential drawbacks. Real-World Use Cases: Where Could Fission Make an Impact? The implications of a functional Privacy-Preserving LLM system are vast. Here are a few examples: Healthcare: Analyzing patient data for research, diagnosis assistance, or drug discovery without compromising patient confidentiality. Finance: Processing sensitive financial reports, transaction data, or proprietary trading strategies for analysis or compliance checks. Legal: Reviewing confidential legal documents or case files using AI without exposing sensitive details. Enterprise Data Analysis: Companies using LLMs on internal, confidential datasets for insights, reporting, or decision-making. Personalized AI: Users interacting with AI models using highly personal data (e.g., health metrics, browsing history) with assurance that their data remains private. These examples highlight the critical need for solutions like Fission in unlocking the full potential of AI in sensitive sectors. What Does This Mean for Decentralized Computing and AI? The collaboration between Nillion and Meta on Fission LLM is more than just a research paper; it’s a strong signal about the future direction of AI and decentralized technologies. It suggests that: Decentralization is Key to AI Privacy: Leading AI developers recognize that centralized models struggle with privacy at scale, and decentralized approaches offer a viable path forward. Cryptographic Privacy is Becoming Practical: Advanced techniques like MPC are moving from theoretical concepts to practical applications for complex tasks like LLM inference. Collaboration Across Sectors is Crucial: Partnerships between blockchain/decentralized tech companies and mainstream AI powerhouses can accelerate innovation in critical areas like privacy. For investors and enthusiasts in the crypto and decentralized computing space, this development underscores the growing relevance and potential real-world utility of platforms like Nillion. It validates the thesis that decentralized infrastructure can provide unique capabilities (like blind computing) that are essential for the next generation of secure and private applications, including AI. Actionable Insight: Keep an Eye on This Space While Fission is currently presented as a research paper, the involvement of Nillion and Meta suggests a serious exploration into practical implementation. For developers, researchers, and businesses handling sensitive data, understanding the principles behind Privacy-Preserving LLMs and decentralized computing is becoming increasingly important. Keep an eye on Nillion’s network developments and potential future announcements regarding the practical deployment or integration of Fission-like capabilities. Conclusion: A Pivotal Moment for Private AI The introduction of Fission through the Nillion and Meta collaboration marks a pivotal moment in the quest for secure and private artificial intelligence. By leveraging decentralized blind computing, Fission offers a compelling vision for how we can interact with powerful LLMs without sacrificing the confidentiality of our most sensitive data. This development not only validates the potential of decentralized technologies but also paves the way for a future where AI can be safely deployed in highly regulated and privacy-conscious environments, unlocking new possibilities across numerous industries.

The controversy erupted after the coins were sold for $38 million just one day after the project’s token creation event (TGE), prompting Binance to immediately freeze the accounts involved. According to documents disclosed by CoinDesk, the suspicious transaction stems from a market-making agreement previously signed by Movement Labs. The internal agreement allegedly gave a then-unknown entity, Rentech, significant control over MOVE coins. Notably, Rentech appears in the agreement as both a representative of the Movement Foundation and a subsidiary of Web3Port, indicating a conflict of interest. Notably, Rentech’s domain name was registered the same day the agreement was completed. Related News: New Developments in the Tariff Dispute Between the US and China - Is an Agreement Near? Chinese Sources Speak Out The contract reportedly allowed Rentech to borrow around half of MOVE’s publicly traded coins. In addition, it allowed Web3Port to liquidate the coins and share the profits with Rentech if MOVE’s value reached $5 billion. Movement Labs acknowledged the situation and is actively investigating whether it was misled into signing a financial deal that disproportionately empowered one party. The organization is also reviewing the role of its co-founder Rushi Manche, who initially introduced and promoted the deal internally. A Movement Foundation attorney, identified only as Pek, described the deal in a newly leaked email as “probably the worst deal he’s ever seen.” The attorney also warned that the structure appeared designed to inflate the price of MOVE before selling coins to individual investors. *This is not investment advice.

44000203,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154232,1746048007,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crypto AI Agents: CZ Calls for Revolutionary Utility Amidst Uselessness,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/crypto-ai-agents-utility/,"Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the influential founder and former CEO of Binance, recently dropped a truth bomb at Token2049 in Dubai, shaking up the conversation around Crypto AI Agents . His stark assessment? A staggering 99.99% of current crypto-AI agents are, in his words, “useless.” This isn’t just a casual observation; it’s a powerful call to action for the industry to pivot towards building applications with genuine, tangible utility. Changpeng Zhao (CZ)’s Blunt Assessment: Why Most AI Agents Fail Speaking to a packed audience, Changpeng Zhao (CZ) didn’t mince words. He highlighted a significant disconnect between the hype surrounding AI integration in crypto and the actual value being delivered. While many projects are quick to slap “AI” onto their name or token, very few are leveraging artificial intelligence in ways that truly enhance the user experience, improve efficiency, or solve real-world problems within the crypto ecosystem. CZ’s point is clear: the industry needs to move past speculative token launches fueled by buzzwords and focus on creating AI-powered tools that perform necessary functions. This critique comes at a time when the intersection of AI and blockchain is a hot topic, attracting significant attention and investment. His comments serve as a crucial reminder that innovation must be grounded in utility, not just potential. What Does Real Crypto Utility Look Like for AI? So, if most existing agents are useless, what constitutes a useful one? CZ provided examples of the kind of Crypto Utility he envisions: Enhanced Customer Support: AI agents capable of providing intelligent, context-aware support to users navigating complex crypto platforms, resolving issues efficiently, and offering guidance. Proactive Risk Monitoring: AI systems that can analyze vast amounts of on-chain and off-chain data to detect fraudulent activity, identify security vulnerabilities, and alert users or platforms to potential risks in real-time. These examples point towards AI being used to tackle specific, operational challenges within the crypto space, improving safety, accessibility, and user satisfaction. It’s about AI as a functional tool, not just a marketing label. The Transformative Potential of AI in Crypto Despite his criticism of the current state, CZ remains optimistic about the long-term impact of AI in Crypto . He believes that artificial intelligence will fundamentally transform how users interact with blockchains and decentralized applications. Imagine a future where: AI agents act as personal crypto assistants, managing portfolios, executing complex trading strategies based on user goals, and providing personalized market insights. AI enhances the security of smart contracts through automated auditing and vulnerability detection before deployment. AI streamlines compliance processes for businesses operating with digital assets. AI improves the efficiency of decentralized networks through optimized resource allocation and consensus mechanisms. The potential applications are vast, ranging from improving trading algorithms and market analysis to enhancing security protocols and automating complex tasks on the blockchain. The key, as CZ emphasizes, is building agents that perform these functions effectively and reliably. Building Useful Blockchain AI: Challenges and the Path Forward Creating truly useful Blockchain AI agents is not without its challenges. The unique nature of blockchain data (often immutable and transparent, but also complex and sometimes unstructured) requires specialized AI approaches. Other hurdles include: Data Accessibility and Quality: Training robust AI models requires massive, high-quality datasets. Accessing and processing relevant on-chain and off-chain data can be complex. Integration Complexity: Seamlessly integrating sophisticated AI models with existing blockchain infrastructure and decentralized applications is a significant technical challenge. Trust and Transparency: Users need to trust AI agents interacting with their digital assets. The ‘black box’ nature of some AI models can be a barrier in a trust-is-paramount environment like crypto. Explainable AI (XAI) will be crucial. Security Risks: AI models themselves can be targets for attacks or manipulation, posing new security risks to the systems they manage. Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for both AI and crypto is still evolving, creating uncertainty for developers building integrated solutions. Overcoming these challenges requires a focus on building solid technological foundations, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers and blockchain developers, and prioritizing real-world problem-solving over speculative features. Actionable Insights for the Future CZ’s comments serve as a vital course correction for the industry. For developers, it’s a call to build with purpose and utility in mind. For investors, it’s a signal to look beyond hype and evaluate projects based on their tangible use cases and technological substance. For users, it’s an encouragement to demand more than just buzzwords and seek out tools that genuinely enhance their crypto experience. The future of AI in crypto isn’t in useless agents with speculative tokens, but in powerful, intelligent tools that make interacting with the decentralized world safer, easier, and more efficient. This requires a collective shift in focus from speculation to genuine innovation and utility creation. Conclusion: The Urgent Need for Utility-Driven AI Changpeng Zhao’s critique at Token2049 serves as a crucial wake-up call. While the convergence of AI and crypto holds immense promise, the current landscape is cluttered with projects lacking real Crypto Utility . The path forward requires a deliberate focus on building Crypto AI Agents that solve concrete problems, enhance user experience, and contribute meaningfully to the ecosystem. The potential for AI in Crypto to transform interactions with Blockchain AI is undeniable, but realizing this future depends on the industry’s commitment to moving beyond hype and building solutions that are genuinely useful.

This integration provides Soneium’s users with seamless exposure and access to yield products backed by assets. Soneium Joins Plume’s RWAfi Infrastructure The company stated in a statement that “with the integration of SkyLink, Plume’s native interoperability layer that allows real-world asset value and yield to be streamed cross-chain in a secure manner, Soneium joins Plume’s RWAfi infrastructure and brings real-world assets to the chain.” This strategic partnership will give Soneium users access to asset-backed yield products, such as yield from tokenized U.S. treasuries and private credit directly from the Plume chain. Chris Yin, Plume’s CEO, acknowledged the deal, citing that it is a combined strategy to accelerate previously inaccessible yield opportunities. What the Future Holds For RWAfi Yin pointed out that the future of RWAfi transcends beyond assets living on a single chain. He says it also facilitates the seamless flow of actual yield to users’ locations. It is worth noting that Soneium had earlier inked a deal with Moca Network, one of Plume’s partners. Their partnership aimed to expand into digital identity, anime like Solo Leveling, and gaming experiences. Alongside RWAs, Soneium is also associated with other forms of digital assets, such as Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) and stablecoins. Soneium Deals in NFTs and Stablecoins About eight months ago, USDC issuer Circle announced a pivotal partnership with Sony Block Solutions Labs to expand the adoption of its stablecoin. The partnership involved integrating Circle’s Bridged USDC Standard into Soneium and positioning USDC as one of the key tokens for transactions within the Soneium ecosystem. According to Circle, “this marks a significant milestone to set the stage for a new era of creativity in the Web3 space.” This year, the L2 blockchain launched a collection of music-inclined digital collectibles. One of its latest works is a brewing partnership with messaging giant LINE. They plan to integrate the messaging firm’s mini-apps into the Soneium ecosystem. Such developments are likely to spring up and trigger a gradual expansion of the blockchain.

As the market transitions from selling to buying, on-chain data shows that institutional investors are heavily accumulating ETH tokens, indicating a shift in sentiment. Institutions Load Up On ETH As Buy Signal Flashes On-chain analytics platform, Lookonchain, has identified a notable increase in Ethereum accumulation, largely driven by institutional whales. Over the course of three hours, a wallet address reportedly associated with the trading firm Cumberland DRW withdrew a staggering 27,632 ETH, worth approximately $50.24 million. This transfer was made from major exchanges, including Coinbase, Copper and Binance. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Reaches Last H1 Support, Next Major Resistance Comes Into View The wallet’s activity involved multiple high-value transfers, such as a 7,600 ETH withdrawal worth $13.83 million from Coinbase, a 5,992 ETH withdrawal worth $10.92 million from Copper and Binance, and an additional 5,960 ETH transfer valued at $10.88 million from Copper. Notably, the receiving wallet, 0ex287AA111…, was consistently used across all transactions, suggesting coordinated accumulation rather than a typical trading activity. Historically, large-scale withdrawals from Ethereum exchanges have preceded price surges, as they significantly reduce sell-side liquidity and indicate a longer-term holding pattern by investors. Amid this growing institutional accumulation, the Ethereum CrossX Indicator, as noted by Ezy Bitcoin on X, has recently flashed a strong buy signal. This reinforces the notion that institutional interest is rising, signaling an increase in demand and potentially setting the stage for further upward price movement. Ethereum CrossX Indicator Suggests $4,000 Surge Ahead Shedding more light on Ezy Bitcoin’s report, the CrossX indicator, which officially triggered a buy signal for Ethereum, is signaling a potential surge above $4,000 for the altcoin’s price. The market expert highlights that this is the first signal seen in nearly six months and, historically, has often preceded significant price action and explosive moves. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Threatened With Sharp Drop To $1,400, Here’s Why The CrossX Indicator, a tool used to detect high-probability trend reversals based on volume, price action, and divergence patterns, has shown remarkable accuracy in past cycles. As seen in the analyst’s weekly chart, previous buy signals were followed by rallies that took ETH to new local highs. Now, with Ethereum’s price rebounding off recent lows and a fresh Bullish Divergence in place, the same rally pattern may be unfolding again. If history repeats, ETH could be gearing up for a run beyond $3,000, with the possibility of testing the $4,200 range by year’s end. According to CoinMarketCap’s data, Ethereum is currently trading at $1,803, reflecting a yearly decline of 43.10%. A potential rise to $4,200 would represent a staggering 132.95% increase, bringing Ethereum (ETH) closer to its present all-time high of over $4,800.

44000482,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154234,1746048656,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,AI Legaltech Startup Supio Secures Powerful $60M Funding Boost,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/supio-funding-legal-ai/,"In the rapidly evolving world of technology, where AI is making waves across industries, the legal sector is experiencing its own transformation. A significant development comes from Supio, an AI Legaltech startup focused on automating data collection and analysis for legal teams. The company recently announced a substantial funding round, signaling strong investor confidence in the future of AI in Law . Supio Funding: Powering Growth in Legal AI Supio has successfully raised $60 million in a funding round. This significant investment was led by Sapphire Ventures, with key participation from Mayfield and Thomson Reuters Ventures. This brings Supio’s total funding raised to $91 million, a clear indicator of market belief in their mission and technology. The fresh capital is earmarked for several critical areas: Accelerating overall company growth. Expanding the team through strategic hiring. Scaling go-to-market efforts to reach more legal professionals. Jerry Zhou, co-founder and CEO of Supio, shared with Bitcoin World that the company plans to expand its Seattle headquarters and establish a new office. This expansion aligns with their goal to roughly double their current 100-person staff, supporting increased demand and product development. The Rise of AI in Law: Addressing Skepticism and Seizing Opportunity Supio operates within the competitive landscape of AI Legaltech , vying for market share and user adoption. While some skepticism exists regarding AI’s capability in complex legal tasks, law firms face increasing pressure to adopt these technologies to remain competitive. The trend of AI Adoption in the legal profession is accelerating dramatically. According to one survey, AI adoption nearly tripled from 11% in 2023 to 30% in 2024, highlighting a pivotal shift in the industry. The vision for Supio emerged from a clear pain point identified by co-founders Jerry Zhou and Lam, who previously worked together at a tax compliance software firm. They recognized a significant opportunity to fundamentally change how legal professionals interact with documents. Zhou explained, “Every day, attorneys and paralegals spend thousands of hours manually reviewing medical records, police reports, and expert opinions.” He added that Supio’s core product directly addresses this challenge by providing users with a deep, automated understanding of complex, unstructured data found in legal documents. How Supio’s Legal AI Platform Works Supio’s platform is specifically designed for personal injury law, a sector often burdened by vast amounts of documentation. Their Legal AI solution connects directly to law firms’ existing file systems, offering crucial assistance with case management. A key focus for Supio is ensuring accuracy, a critical concern when deploying AI in sensitive legal contexts. Zhou highlighted their approach to mitigating AI-introduced errors: “We employ ‘human verification’ to combat AI-introduced errors and ensure reasonable accuracy.” He further elaborated on their technical strategy, stating, “We focus deeply on specialized [AI] model and quality control at the document and data layer.” This commitment to quality is essential for building trust among legal professionals. The platform’s versatility is also a strength, with Zhou noting, “Our Legal AI supports over 114 case types and that number is growing in partnership with our customers.” This adaptability allows Supio to cater to a wide range of personal injury cases. Proven Success and Future Trajectory Supio has demonstrated impressive traction over the past year. According to Zhou, the company has seen its Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) grow 4x, paralleled by a 4x increase in its customer base. Their growing list of clients includes prominent personal injury and mass tort law firms such as Huges & Coleman, Daniel Stark, Thomas Law Offices, and Whitley Law. To support this rapid expansion and prepare for future growth, Supio has strategically strengthened its leadership team, appointing new heads of sales, customer success, and marketing and advertising. This organizational scaling is vital for managing increased demand and enhancing customer relationships. Zhou’s perspective on the broader impact of AI on the legal field is clear: “AI has created a major inflection point for the legal industry as a whole.” He believes that every firm, regardless of its sub-vertical, is contemplating how to reinvent itself for the AI era. Drawing a historical parallel, he concluded, “If Excel transformed finance 30 years ago, AI will do the same for legal knowledge workers.” This perspective underscores the potentially profound impact of solutions like Supio’s on the efficiency and effectiveness of legal practice. Conclusion: The Impact of AI Legaltech Supio’s significant $60 million funding round is more than just a financial milestone; it’s a strong validation of the potential for AI Legaltech to revolutionize the legal industry. By automating tedious tasks like document review and analysis, platforms like Supio enable legal professionals to focus on higher-value work, ultimately improving efficiency and potentially access to justice. As AI Adoption continues to rise and Legal AI technologies become more sophisticated and trusted, the landscape of AI in Law is set for continued, rapid transformation, with companies like Supio leading the charge.

In an April 30 filing in the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS), lawyers for Coinbase argued that a First Circuit Court of Appeals decision set a “dangerous precedent” for crypto users, potentially allowing the government to “trace users’ every crypto transaction in the past and monitor every crypto transaction in the future.” The appeal to the Supreme Court stemmed from petitioner James Harper, a Coinbase user, who took legal action against the IRS after the crypto exchange was forced to turn over transaction data to the government using a sweeping “John Doe” summons in 2017. “This case directly affects Coinbase’s interest in protecting the privacy rights of its users and in the correct application of this Court’s doctrine on constitutional guarantees against warrantless government demands for third-party service providers to surrender users’ personal information,” the brief reads. “If the First Circuit’s ruling is allowed to stand, the Fourth Amendment will give no protection to millions of law-abiding Americans who routinely share intimate personal information with the third parties that ubiquitously store, transmit, or provide services based on that data,” it added. April 30 Coinbase amicus brief. Source: US Supreme Court An amicus brief is a filing in support of a plaintiff by an entity that is not directly involved. The case before the court has the potential to set significant precedents for digital privacy rights for crypto users and how the IRS will be allowed to gather data on taxpayers. Both the US District Court for the District of New Hampshire and the First Circuit have ruled against Harper’s petition, leaving the Supreme Court as his last option for an appeal. Related: IRS crypto tax reporting rules threat to industry — Coinbase legal chief “We believe in tax compliance, but this goes far beyond a narrow and tailored request and far beyond crypto,” said Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal, in an April 30 X post. “This applies to banks, phone companies, ISPs, email, you name it [...] you should have the same right to privacy for your inbox or account as you have for a letter in your mailbox. “ It’s unclear whether the court will take up the case. SCOTUS typically releases its opinions to the public in June. Since first being filed in 2020, many industry advocates have filed similar amicus briefs in support of Harper, including social media company X and the DeFi Education Fund.

While spot Bitcoin ETFs have captured significant attention, a different kind of investment vehicle is now stepping into the spotlight: the Grayscale Bitcoin Adopters ETF (ticker: BCOR). This new fund from Grayscale, a leading digital asset manager, aims to provide investors with a unique angle on the market by focusing on companies that are actively embracing and integrating Bitcoin and blockchain technology into their operations. What is the Grayscale Bitcoin Adopters ETF (BCOR)? According to an announcement shared by economic news account Walter Bloomberg on X, Grayscale has officially launched the BCOR ETF . Unlike a traditional spot Bitcoin ETF that holds actual Bitcoin, or a futures ETF that tracks Bitcoin futures contracts, the Grayscale Bitcoin Adopters ETF takes a different approach. Its strategy is centered around investing in Bitcoin companies – specifically, publicly traded companies that are actively involved in the Bitcoin adoption ecosystem. This could include a variety of businesses, such as: Companies holding significant amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. Businesses providing infrastructure or services for the Bitcoin network (e.g., mining, exchanges, payment processors). Firms developing applications or technologies leveraging Bitcoin or the broader blockchain landscape. The exact holdings of the BCOR ETF have not yet been publicly disclosed, but the focus is clearly on capturing the growth potential of companies that are driving or benefiting from the increasing integration of Bitcoin into the global economy. Why Focus on Bitcoin Adoption? The rationale behind creating an ETF focused on Bitcoin adoption is compelling. While direct investment in Bitcoin provides exposure to its price movements, investing in companies involved in the ecosystem offers a different type of exposure. These companies’ performance can be influenced by factors beyond just the price of Bitcoin itself, such as their business models, innovation, market share, and operational efficiency within the growing crypto space. This approach allows investors to potentially benefit from: Ecosystem Growth: As more individuals, businesses, and institutions adopt Bitcoin, the demand for services and products offered by these ‘adopter’ companies could increase. Innovation: Companies actively integrating Bitcoin are often at the forefront of technological innovation within the financial and tech sectors. Diversification within Crypto: It offers a way to invest in the crypto theme without solely relying on the direct price performance of Bitcoin itself. The launch of the Grayscale Bitcoin Adopters ETF signifies a maturing investment landscape for digital assets, moving beyond simple asset holding to focusing on the underlying economic activity and infrastructure being built around Bitcoin. How Does BCOR Compare to Other Crypto ETFs? Understanding where the BCOR ETF fits within the broader landscape of crypto ETFs is crucial for investors. Here’s a simple comparison: ETF Type Underlying Asset/Strategy Potential Exposure Spot Bitcoin ETF Holds actual Bitcoin Direct price exposure to Bitcoin Bitcoin Futures ETF Invests in Bitcoin futures contracts Exposure to Bitcoin price via derivatives; may have tracking differences Blockchain Equity ETF Invests in companies involved in broader blockchain technology (may or may not be Bitcoin-specific) Exposure to companies across the blockchain ecosystem Grayscale Bitcoin Adopters ETF (BCOR) Invests in companies actively adopting or integrating Bitcoin/blockchain Exposure to the business and operational side of the Bitcoin ecosystem The BCOR ETF carves out a specific niche by targeting companies whose core activities are tied to the practical use and integration of Bitcoin, offering a more direct play on the operational side of the Bitcoin adoption trend compared to a general blockchain fund. Potential Benefits of Investing in Bitcoin Companies via BCOR For investors considering adding crypto exposure to their portfolio, investing in Bitcoin companies through an ETF like BCOR offers several potential advantages: Accessibility and Familiarity: ETFs trade on traditional stock exchanges, making them easily accessible through standard brokerage accounts. This is familiar territory for many investors who might find navigating crypto exchanges less intuitive. Diversification: The ETF holds a basket of stocks, providing immediate diversification across multiple companies within the Bitcoin ecosystem, reducing single-stock risk. Professional Management: The fund is managed by Grayscale, a firm with significant experience in the digital asset space, handling portfolio selection, rebalancing, and operational complexities. Liquidity: As an ETF, BCOR is expected to offer good liquidity, allowing investors to buy and sell shares easily throughout the trading day. Targeted Exposure: It provides a focused way to invest in the theme of Bitcoin adoption , targeting companies directly involved in the ecosystem’s growth. These benefits make the BCOR ETF a potentially attractive option for both retail and institutional investors looking for regulated and accessible ways to participate in the crypto market’s expansion. What are the Potential Challenges and Risks? While the opportunity is significant, investing in Bitcoin companies and the broader crypto ecosystem comes with risks. Investors considering the Grayscale Bitcoin Adopters ETF should be aware of: Market Volatility: The performance of companies involved in the Bitcoin ecosystem is often highly correlated with the price volatility of Bitcoin itself. Significant price swings in Bitcoin can heavily impact the stock prices of these companies. Company-Specific Risks: Beyond crypto market risk, investors are exposed to the individual business risks of the companies held within the ETF (e.g., management issues, competition, technological disruption specific to their niche). Regulatory Uncertainty: The regulatory landscape for cryptocurrencies and related businesses is still evolving in many jurisdictions, which could impact the operations and profitability of these companies. Competition: The Bitcoin and blockchain space is highly competitive, and companies within the ETF face risks from new entrants and technological changes. Specific Holdings Risk: Since specific holdings are not yet disclosed, investors initially buy into the ETF based on its stated strategy rather than a known list of companies. As with any investment tied to a rapidly developing technology and market, thorough research and understanding of the associated risks are paramount. Who Might Consider Investing in the BCOR ETF? The Grayscale Bitcoin Adopters ETF could appeal to several types of investors: Investors who believe in the long-term trend of Bitcoin adoption and want exposure to the companies facilitating this growth. Those seeking a regulated and traditional investment vehicle (ETF) to access the crypto ecosystem, rather than directly buying cryptocurrencies. Individuals looking to diversify their existing crypto holdings by adding exposure to the operational and business side of the market. Investors interested in technology and financial innovation, seeing Bitcoin and blockchain integration as a key future trend. It’s important for potential investors to assess how this ETF fits within their overall investment strategy, risk tolerance, and financial goals. The Future of Investing in Bitcoin Companies The launch of the BCOR ETF highlights a growing sophistication in how investors can approach the crypto market. As Bitcoin adoption continues to expand globally, the ecosystem of companies providing services, infrastructure, and integration solutions is likely to grow and evolve. Funds like BCOR offer a curated way to gain exposure to this specific segment of the market. While direct Bitcoin investment remains popular, focusing on the companies building the rails and applications for its use provides a complementary investment thesis. The success of BCOR will likely depend on its ability to effectively identify and track the performance of leading companies that are genuinely driving meaningful Bitcoin and blockchain integration. Conclusion: Unlocking Opportunity in Bitcoin Adoption The launch of the Grayscale Bitcoin Adopters ETF (BCOR) marks an exciting development for investors interested in the cryptocurrency space. By focusing on companies actively integrating Bitcoin and blockchain technology, BCOR offers a unique and regulated way to gain exposure to the growth of the Bitcoin adoption ecosystem. While risks inherent in the crypto market and individual company performance exist, the ETF provides accessibility, diversification, and professional management for those looking to invest in the operational side of this transformative technology. As the crypto market matures, vehicles like BCOR provide investors with more granular options to align their portfolios with specific trends within the digital asset revolution.

44000722,https://cryptopotato.com/?p=394442,1746049347,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/27/44000722.jpeg,Bitrace Report Flags $649B in Risky Stablecoin Flows,https://cryptopotato.com/bitrace-report-flags-649b-in-risky-stablecoin-flows/,"A new report by blockchain compliance firm Bitrace has revealed that $649 billion in stablecoin transactions passed through high-risk addresses in 2024. The figure accounts for slightly more than 5% of all stablecoin activity for that year, which, while a slight decline from 2023’s numbers, remains alarmingly higher than levels seen in 2021 and 2022. The Dominance of USDT and the Rise of USDC in Illicit Activity At the heart of the Bitrace findings is a detailed breakdown of illegal activity across platforms based on Ethereum and Tron, where stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC are dominant. According to the report , USDT on TRON maintained its grip as the main vehicle for risky transfers, with Ethereum-based stablecoins also seeing increased activity. Much of the alleged misuse stemmed from the booming online gambling industry, which processed $217.8 billion in stablecoin inflows in 2024. This was a 17.5% increase from the previous year. Fraud-related inflows also exploded to $52.5 billion, surpassing the cumulative total of previous years, which amounted to $2.13 billion in 2021, $4.28 billion in 2022, and $12.88 billion in 2023. Meanwhile, money laundering accounted for $86.3 billion, a $31 billion drop from its 2023 level of $118.02 billion, but on par with 2022’s $84.96 billion. The report suggested that the decline was likely due to growing regulatory scrutiny and enforcement actions in the last two years. Centralized exchanges such as OKX also saw a dip in their share of laundering-related inflows, possibly indicating a tightening of their compliance protocols. Interestingly, despite being issued by a U.S.-regulated company, USDC’s share in these flows also more than doubled, jumping from 5.22% in 2023 to 13.36% in 2024. Still, to their credit, Tether and Circle reportedly froze more than $1.3 billion in illicit stablecoins last year, twice the amount they managed to withhold between 2021 and 2023. Stablecoins Are Going Mainstream The release of the Bitrace report comes at a time when stablecoins are making headlines for entirely different reasons. Just recently, Mastercard unveiled its new “end-to-end stablecoin payment system,” promising seamless global transactions through integrations with major platforms like OKX, Crypto.com, and Circle. The initiative will allow users to spend stablecoins like USDC at over 150 million merchants around the world, highlighting the level at which digital currencies are becoming embedded into both mainstream and crypto-native economies. Legislative wheels are also turning, with the STABLE Act passed through the U.S. House Financial Services Committee earlier in the month. The bill is designed to more rigorously regulate stablecoin issuers by requiring banking charters and stricter oversight. If it becomes law, it would establish a long-desired regulatory framework for an industry that has often operated within a legal gray zone.

The company also set more favorable chances of approval for other altcoin ETFs, including proposed funds holding XRP ( XRP ) and Dogecoin ( DOGE ), Bloomberg analyst Eric Balchunas said in an X post. The estimates reflect an improved outlook from Bloomberg analysts. In a February analysis , Bloomberg pegged the odds of a Solana ( SOL ) ETF approval at only 70%. They ascribed a 65% and 75% chance of approval to funds holding XRP and DOGE, respectively. As of April 30, six asset managers — including Grayscale, VanEck and 21Shares — are awaiting clearance from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to list ETFs holding the Solana blockchain network’s native cryptocurrency.

New Letter To SEC Makes A Case For Staking Sans Regulation Signed by more than 30 crypto organizations, the letter urges the SEC to publicly acknowledge staking as a “technical process” as opposed to an “investment activity.” 2/ Staking isn’t niche—it’s the backbone of the decentralized internet. It secures networks, supports decentralization, and empowers builders to create the next generation of applications on PoS blockchains. — Crypto Council for Innovation (@crypto_council) April 30, 2025 Additionally, the Crypto Council for Innovation is urging the government agency to lay out clear guidelines for staking while avoiding “overly prescriptive rules that could freeze market structures and stifle innovation in the staking space.” “Staking isn’t niche—it’s the backbone of the decentralized internet,” The Crypto Council for Innovation said in a Wednesday X post. “It secures networks, supports decentralization, and empowers builders to create the next generation of applications on PoS blockchains.” “Every serious legislative and regulatory conversation about crypto (including stablecoins) touches staking,” the organization added. “So we have to get it right.” Defining Staking Staking occurs when an investor locks up their crypto with a blockchain validator while receiving rewards for participating in the service itself, effectively helping to validate transactions and secure the respective network. The Crypto Council for Innovation largely argues that since rewards come directly from the blockchain protocol itself , staking does not constitute securities transactions. The crypto organization is also requesting that the SEC provide clear guidelines for key players in the staking space to follow akin to the agency’s recent statement on proof-of-work mining. “The industry has stepped up with one voice to make a clear case: staking is not a securities activity, and trying to regulate it as such would only hinder network security, stifle innovation, and undermine U.S. competitiveness in the digital asset space,” the letter concludes. With rapidly changing crypto policy, it may only be a matter of time before the SEC reclassifies the reward-earning process.

For cryptocurrency enthusiasts, understanding these broader economic and political currents is crucial, as digital assets are increasingly sensitive to macroeconomic shifts and investor sentiment. Recently, former U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on the state of the markets, specifically addressing the ongoing volatility and the US Market Slump . His comments, reported by Walter Bloomberg on X, attributed the downturn not to his own past policies or potential future actions like tariffs, but squarely to the current administration’s leadership. This statement highlights the persistent political debate surrounding the Trump Biden Economy and its real-world consequences for investors. The Political Punch: Trump Points Finger at Biden According to the report, Donald Trump asserted that the prevailing stock market conditions are a direct reflection of President Biden’s policies. This move effectively distances himself from any responsibility for the downturn, a common tactic in political discourse, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. Trump also specifically dismissed the notion that tariffs, a hallmark of his previous trade policy and a potential tool he might use again, were contributing factors to the current market weakness. He noted that such tariffs, if planned, have not yet been implemented, thus couldn’t be the cause. This framing sets up a clear narrative: the economic challenges and the US Market Slump are a consequence of the current administration’s economic agenda. But how much truth is there to this, and what factors are truly at play? Is it Biden’s Economy? Unpacking the Policy Debate The question of whose policies are responsible for the state of the economy is complex and often debated fiercely along party lines. When we talk about the Trump Biden Economy , we’re looking at two distinct approaches: Trump’s Approach: Characterized by tax cuts (specifically the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act), deregulation, and a focus on trade protectionism through tariffs. Supporters argue these policies spurred business investment and growth. Critics point to rising national debt and trade tensions. Biden’s Approach: Focuses on significant government spending (infrastructure, clean energy, social programs), increased regulation in certain sectors, and a different stance on international trade alliances. Supporters claim these investments build long-term growth and address inequality. Critics argue they fuel inflation and increase the national debt. Attributing a complex phenomenon like a market slump solely to one set of policies is challenging. Markets react to a confluence of factors, both domestic and international, short-term and long-term. Beyond the Blame: Core Causes of the US Market Slump While political rhetoric is loud, market analysts point to several fundamental macroeconomic factors contributing to the recent US Market Slump : Key Factors Contributing to the Slump: Inflation: Persistently high inflation has eroded purchasing power and corporate margins. Federal Reserve Policy: Aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed to combat inflation increase borrowing costs and reduce liquidity, making riskier assets less attractive. Global Supply Chain Issues: Lingering disruptions continue to affect production and costs. Geopolitical Instability: Conflicts and international tensions create uncertainty, impacting energy prices and global trade. Recession Fears: The combination of high inflation and rising rates has increased concerns about a potential economic recession, leading investors to become more cautious. These factors operate independently of, though they can be influenced by, specific administration policies. The debate is often about how effective (or detrimental) current policies are in *responding* to these challenges. The Ripple Effect: Economic Policy Impact on Markets Understanding the broader Economic Policy Impact is vital for investors. Policies enacted by the government and central bank directly influence the environment in which businesses operate and investments perform: How Policies Influence Markets: Policy Area Mechanism of Impact Potential Market Effect Monetary Policy (Fed) Interest Rates, Money Supply Higher rates can decrease stock valuations (especially tech), increase bond yields, strengthen currency. Lower rates have opposite effect. Fiscal Policy (Govt. Spending/Tax) Government Spending, Taxation Levels Increased spending can stimulate economy but risk inflation. Tax cuts can boost corporate profits or consumer spending. Affects specific sectors based on focus. Trade Policy (Tariffs/Agreements) Import/Export Costs, Market Access Tariffs can hurt companies reliant on imports/exports, cause trade wars, disrupt supply chains. Trade agreements can open new markets. Trump’s focus on tariffs, for instance, falls under Trade Policy. While he argues they aren’t currently impacting the market because they aren’t implemented *now*, the *threat* or *discussion* of future tariffs can certainly influence investor sentiment and corporate planning, demonstrating the nuanced Economic Policy Impact . When Words Move Markets: Political Rhetoric Market Sensitivity Beyond concrete policies, the Political Rhetoric Market sensitivity is a significant, albeit harder to quantify, factor. Statements from influential political figures can: Create Uncertainty: Conflicting messages or unexpected announcements can make investors hesitant. Shift Sentiment: Positive or negative framing of economic conditions can influence overall market mood (bullish vs. bearish). Signal Future Policy: Rhetoric can sometimes hint at upcoming policy changes, allowing markets to price them in preemptively. Increase Volatility: Markets dislike uncertainty, and strong, divisive rhetoric can exacerbate price swings. Trump’s comments blaming Biden fall squarely into this category of Political Rhetoric Market influence. While they don’t change immediate economic fundamentals, they contribute to the ongoing political narrative that can shape public perception and investor confidence. What Does This Mean for Crypto? A Crypto Market Analysis So, how does this political blame game and the underlying economic turbulence affect the digital asset space? A thorough Crypto Market Analysis reveals that while initially seen as uncorrelated, cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, have shown increasing correlation with traditional risk assets like tech stocks. Factors like high inflation and rising interest rates, which contribute to the US Market Slump , also negatively impact crypto. When borrowing costs rise, investors tend to move away from speculative or growth assets (like tech stocks and crypto) towards safer investments (like bonds). Furthermore, discussions around the Trump Biden Economy and potential future policies, including regulation, are closely watched by the crypto community. Impact on Crypto: Risk-Off Sentiment: Macroeconomic headwinds leading to the traditional market slump often translate to a risk-off mood, pressuring crypto prices. Regulatory Uncertainty: Political rhetoric can highlight potential future regulations, which are a major concern for the crypto industry. Inflation Hedge Narrative Tested: While some view Bitcoin as an inflation hedge, its price action during recent inflationary periods has challenged this, showing its sensitivity to the same factors affecting other assets. Therefore, staying informed about the broader Economic Policy Impact and the dynamics of the Political Rhetoric Market is essential for anyone conducting a Crypto Market Analysis . Actionable Insights for Navigating Volatility Given the complex interplay of political rhetoric, economic policy, and market dynamics, how can investors, especially those in the crypto space, navigate this environment? Distinguish Rhetoric from Policy: Understand that political statements often serve strategic purposes and may not immediately translate into concrete policy changes. Focus on actual legislation and central bank actions. Stay Informed on Macroeconomics: Pay attention to key economic indicators (inflation, employment, GDP) and central bank decisions (interest rates). These often have a more direct and predictable Economic Policy Impact than political commentary alone. Understand Crypto’s Evolving Correlation: Recognize that crypto markets are not isolated. Their increasing link to traditional finance means they are susceptible to the same macroeconomic forces driving the US Market Slump . Focus on Long-Term Strategy: Volatility driven by news cycles and rhetoric is often short-term. A well-researched, long-term investment strategy based on fundamentals and risk tolerance is usually more effective than reacting to every political soundbite. Diversify and Manage Risk: Ensure your portfolio is diversified and aligns with your risk tolerance, considering the potential impacts of both traditional market movements and crypto-specific factors highlighted in a Crypto Market Analysis . Summary: The Blame Game Continues Amidst Complex Market Forces Donald Trump’s recent comments placing blame for the US Market Slump squarely on President Biden’s policies are a clear example of how political narratives intersect with economic realities. While such Political Rhetoric Market dynamics can influence sentiment, the actual downturn is a result of multifaceted global and domestic economic factors, including inflation, interest rate hikes, and supply chain issues. Understanding the true Economic Policy Impact requires looking beyond the political blame game and analyzing the underlying forces at play in the Trump Biden Economy debate. For those in the digital asset space, a diligent Crypto Market Analysis must incorporate these broader macroeconomic and political considerations, as they increasingly shape the volatile landscape of cryptocurrencies.

Traders are semi-agnostic to negative US economic data as they expect the Federal Reserve to resume easing and rate cuts at some point in the future. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price knocks on the door of $95,000 after starting the NY trading session with a slight sell-off to $92,910 following alarm-raising US GDP data, which showed the economy shrank in Q1 2025. The move mirrors a similar recovery seen in the DOW and S&P 500, which bounced 0.35% and 0.15% respectively at the closing bell. The quick recovery in Bitcoin price highlights the strong bid by a variety of market participants, and it lines up with the view that the April 30 GDP data could be a one-off event resulting from businesses ramping up their imports ahead of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on about 90 countries. While a shrinking economy and record-low consumer confidence are valid concerns for TradFi investors, the threat of a US recession also plays into crypto traders investment thesis which predicts that a variety of negative economic events will eventually force the Federal Reserve to cut rates and issue more dollars — a maneuver which historically has benefitted Bitcoin price.

Ripple $4B-$5B bid to purchase Circle rejected — Report Blockchain payments firm Ripple has reportedly bid up to $5 billion in an effort to acquire stablecoin issuer Circle, but the offer was rejected. According to an April 30 Bloomberg report, Ripple put in a bid of $4 billion to $5 billion as part of an attempted takeover of Circle, which was rejected as being too low. Ripple hasn’t considered whether to make another bid to purchase the stablecoin issuer. The reported acquisition attempt came less than 30 days after Circle applied for an initial public offering (IPO) in the US. Cointelegraph reached out to representatives of Circle and Ripple for comment, but had not received a response from either at the time of publication. Ripple reportedly had an $11 billion valuation in 2024, an estimate CEO Brad Garlinghouse called “outdated” as of January. The blockchain company purchased prime broker Hidden Road for roughly $1.2 billion in April, claiming the move would help scale activity for XRP and XRP Ledger. $330 million Bitcoin social engineering theft victim is elderly US citizen An elderly US individual is reportedly the victim of a devastating $330 million Bitcoin heist, now ranked as the fifth-largest crypto hack in history. The attacker used advanced social engineering tactics to gain access to the victim’s wallet, onchain investigator ZachXBT said in an April 30 update on X. The hack took place on April 28, 2025, when ZachXBT flagged a suspicious transfer involving 3,520 Bitcoin ( BTC ), valued at $330.7 million. Following the transfer, the stolen stash was quickly laundered through over six instant exchanges and swapped into privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero ( XMR ). Onchain data shows that the victim had held over 3,000 BTC since 2017, with no prior history of large-scale transactions. ZachXBT confirming the victim of the hack. Source: ZachXBT Once stolen, the attacker wasted no time laundering the Bitcoin using a peel chain method — a common obfuscation technique in which large sums are broken into smaller, harder-to-trace chunks. “$330M in BTC was received in two transactions, then immediately distributed via peel chains,” Yehor Rudytsia, onchain researcher at Hacken, explained to Cointelegraph. “Funds started to flow into multiple instant exchanges / mixers with small amounts, then mixers were distributing funds across multiple new wallets. The biggest funnelling chain is now consists of 40+ wallets.” OFAC can’t restore Tornado Cash sanctions: Judge The US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control can’t reimpose sanctions against the crypto mixing service Tornado Cash , Austin federal court judge Robert Pitman has said in an April 28 judgment. He added OFAC’s sanctions on Tornado Cash were unlawful and that the agency was “permanently enjoined from enforcing” any further sanctions. OFAC added Tornado Cash to its Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list in August 2022, accusing the protocol of helping launder crypto stolen by the North Korean hacking collective, the Lazarus Group. An excerpt from Judge Robert Pitman’s ruling. Source: CourtListener Tornado Cash users led by Joseph Van Loon then sued the Treasury, arguing the sanctions were “not in accordance with law.” The agency dropped the platform from the sanctions list on March 21 and argued that the matter was “moot” after a court ruled in favor of Tornado Cash in January. It also argued last month that there was no need for a final court judgment in the lawsuit. SEC punts decisions on XRP, DOGE ETFs The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has postponed deciding on whether to greenlight two proposed cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds (ETFs) holding Dogecoin and XRP, filings show. The US regulator has delayed its deadline for ruling on the proposed ETF listings until June, according to two filings reviewed by Cointelegraph. The filings were responses to March requests from US exchanges NYSE Arca and Cboe BZX Exchange to list Bitwise’s Dogecoin (DOGE) ETF and Franklin Templeton’s XRP (XRP) ETF, respectively. They came on the same day that Nasdaq, another US exchange, asked for permission to list a 21Shares Dogecoin ETF . Dogecoin is the world’s most heavily traded memecoin, with a market capitalization of around $26 billion as of April 29, according to data from CoinGecko. XRP is the native token of the XRP Ledger blockchain network. It has a market capitalization of approximately $133 billion, CoinGecko data shows. The SEC has delayed its deadline for reviewing Franklin's XRP Fund.

Recent data reveals a stark reality for cryptocurrency holders and projects: crypto hacks are escalating at an unprecedented rate in 2025. If you’re involved in the crypto space, understanding these threats and bolstering your DeFi security is more critical than ever. Crypto Hacks: A Troubling Trend in 2025 According to a report from Web3 security firm Immunefi, the total losses from crypto hacks and scams have already surpassed a staggering $1.7 billion in 2025. This figure is particularly concerning as we are only partway through the year, yet it already exceeds the total losses of $1.49 billion recorded throughout the entirety of 2024. This dramatic increase signals a significant challenge for the industry. The report highlights a particularly bad month: April 2025. During this single month, hackers successfully stole $92 million across 15 distinct attacks targeting decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. This represents a concerning 124% increase in losses compared to March 2025, indicating a rapid acceleration in successful exploits. What’s driving this surge? Several factors appear to be contributing: Sophistication of Attacks: Hackers are employing more advanced techniques to exploit vulnerabilities. Focus on DeFi: Decentralized protocols, while innovative, often present new and complex attack surfaces. State-Backed Actors: Reports suggest that some state-sponsored groups are increasingly targeting crypto assets. Major Exploits: Significant breaches targeting platforms like UPCX and KiloEx have accounted for a large portion of the reported losses. Why is DeFi Security Particularly Vulnerable? Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is designed to remove intermediaries, offering greater accessibility and innovation. However, this also means that smart contracts and protocol logic become central points of failure. Unlike traditional finance where institutions have established security layers, DeFi protocols often rely solely on the code itself and the underlying blockchain security . Common vulnerabilities exploited in DeFi attacks include: Smart Contract Bugs: Errors or loopholes in the code that govern DeFi protocols. Flash Loan Attacks: Exploiting protocol logic by taking out uncollateralized loans that are repaid within the same transaction. Oracle Manipulation: Feeding incorrect price data to protocols to manipulate asset values. Private Key Compromise: Direct theft of funds due to compromised user or protocol keys. Rug Pulls: Malicious developers abandoning a project and stealing users’ funds, often associated with new DeFi protocols. The interconnected nature of DeFi protocols also means that a vulnerability in one protocol can potentially have ripple effects across the ecosystem. Understanding the Landscape of Web3 Security Threats The term Web3 security encompasses more than just DeFi. It includes security challenges across NFTs, gaming, metaverses, and other decentralized applications. The rising tide of crypto scams and hacks is a broad issue affecting the entire Web3 space. Threat actors range from individual hackers to organized cybercrime syndicates and even state-backed groups. Their motivations vary, from financial gain to geopolitical objectives. The global and pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrency transactions can make tracing stolen funds and apprehending perpetrators incredibly challenging. Here’s a simplified look at the types of losses: Loss Type Description Primary Target Hacks Unauthorized access and theft from protocols or platforms. DeFi protocols, Exchanges, Bridges Scams Deceiving users into sending funds or revealing private keys. Individual users, New projects (rug pulls) While both contribute to the overall loss figures, hacks often involve exploiting technical vulnerabilities, whereas scams typically rely on social engineering or deceptive marketing. Strengthening Your Blockchain Security and Protecting Assets Given the escalating threat landscape, how can individuals and projects enhance their blockchain security and mitigate risks? It requires a multi-layered approach. For Users: Use Hardware Wallets: Store your private keys offline. Be Skeptical of Links/Offers: Avoid clicking suspicious links or participating in unrealistic giveaways (common crypto scams ). Research Projects Thoroughly: Before interacting with a DeFi protocol or investing in a new token, do extensive due diligence. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Use it on all exchanges and platforms. Understand What You’re Signing: Be cautious when approving transactions, especially in DeFi. For Projects: Regular Security Audits: Conduct comprehensive audits of smart contracts and protocol code by reputable firms. Bug Bounty Programs: Incentivize white-hat hackers to find vulnerabilities. Implement Multi-Signature Wallets: For treasury and critical operations. Continuous Monitoring: Use security tools to monitor protocol activity for anomalies. Incident Response Plan: Have a clear plan in place in case of an exploit. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Risks The high volume of crypto hacks in 2025 serves as a stark reminder that the crypto space, while innovative, is not without significant risks. Staying informed is your first line of defense. Follow reputable Web3 security firms and news sources to understand the latest threats and vulnerabilities. For developers and project teams, prioritizing security from the design phase is paramount. Security should not be an afterthought. Investing in rigorous testing, audits, and ongoing monitoring is essential for building trust and protecting users’ funds. For users, adopting a cautious and proactive approach to managing your digital assets is non-negotiable. Treat your private keys like the keys to a physical vault. Be wary of promises that sound too good to be true – they often are the basis of crypto scams . Summary: The Urgent Need for Enhanced Security The trajectory of crypto hacks in 2025, with losses already exceeding the previous year’s total and a significant spike in April’s DeFi attacks, underscores the urgent need for enhanced Web3 security measures. While innovation in DeFi continues to push boundaries, the accompanying security risks are substantial and require immediate attention from both projects and users. By understanding the vulnerabilities, implementing robust blockchain security practices, and staying vigilant against crypto scams , the community can collectively work towards a safer decentralized future.

Crypto analyst and YouTuber Lark Davies recently highlighted this point, explaining to his hundreds of thousands of subscribers that the digital asset’s market cap surpassed $90 billion in 2021 despite lacking smart contract functionality. This achievement suggests that the blockchain’s current development phase could lead to even more significant value creation. According to Davies, the community needs to think bigger. JUST IN: Lark Davis says "" #Cardano $ADA went to $90B without smart contracts last cycle. Think bigger."" pic.twitter.com/8kloTjyKZK — Angry Crypto Show (@angrycryptoshow) April 28, 2025 Growing Developer Engagement in Cardano The Cardano ecosystem has witnessed a notable increase in smart contract deployments, with data from TapTools showing that over 130,000 contracts have now been launched on its mainnet. This surge in activity indicates that developers are actively building decentralized applications (dApps) across various sectors. The expansion of smart contract usage is expected to enhance Cardano’s utility, driving higher transaction volumes and increasing the total value locked (TVL) within its DeFi ecosystem, essential metrics for assessing blockchain economic strength. With recent developments like Midnight , which allow for zero-knowledge smart contracts, the ecosystem could grow further. Protecting sensitive user information could attract developers looking to create more complex dApps and users looking for an ecosystem they can trust. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Network Reliability Remains a Core Strength Cardano’s reputation for stability and reliability further bolsters its appeal. Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, has emphasized that the blockchain has maintained uninterrupted operation since its inception in 2017, without missing a single block. This level of consistency is notable, especially given the extensive code updates Cardano has implemented over the years. Such resilience positions Cardano as a dependable platform for developers and users, distinguishing it from other networks like Solana that have experienced outages or technical issues. Increasing Market Optimism The possibility of a spot ADA exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval has also contributed to a more optimistic outlook for Cardano. The appointment of Paul Atkins as chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has sparked increased speculation about forthcoming crypto ETF approvals. Supporting this sentiment, prediction market data from Polymarket reveals that the chance of an ADA ETF approval in 2025 has climbed to nearly 46%. While this is lower than other prominent assets like XRP with an 83% chance , it is still notable and has excited many market participants. Cardano seems to be on the brink of a massive rally, and all these positive developments could help push the asset to new heights in 2025.

44001518,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=154247,1746051044,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Revealed: Wikipedia’s Exciting AI Strategy Empowers Human Editors,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/wikipedia-ai-human-editors/,"In the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, many in the tech world, including those interested in cryptocurrencies and decentralized systems, are watching closely to see how major platforms integrate this powerful technology. Wikipedia, a cornerstone of online knowledge, recently shared its approach, outlining its Wikipedia AI strategy for the next three years. This plan offers a refreshing perspective: AI will serve as a tool to enhance the work of its dedicated community, not replace them. How Will Wikipedia Use AI? Wikipedia’s plan centers on using AI to support its network of editors, moderators, and volunteers. The goal is to build new features that simplify tasks and remove technical hurdles. Instead of AI taking over content creation, it will provide tools that allow humans to achieve their goals more easily, without needing deep technical knowledge. The organization intends to deploy generative AI and other AI technologies in specific areas where they can automate tedious tasks. This includes: Automating Workflows: Creating AI-assisted processes for repetitive actions. Improving Discoverability: Making it easier for editors and readers to find information. Automating Translation: Assisting with translating content across different languages. Assisting Onboarding: Helping new volunteers get started and integrated into the community. This approach aims to free up human editors’ time, allowing them to focus on critical tasks like deliberation and building consensus, which are essential for maintaining the quality and neutrality of Wikipedia entries. Why is Human Deliberation Key in Wikipedia’s AI Strategy? Chris Albon, Director of Machine Learning at the Wikimedia Foundation, highlighted that their approach is guided by core values like privacy, human rights, and transparency. A human-centered approach is paramount, prioritizing human agency in the editing process. The rise of generative AI , while powerful, has also brought challenges, notably the tendency for models to make mistakes or ‘hallucinate’ information. Wikipedia’s mission to maintain a reliable knowledge base becomes even more crucial in this context. By keeping humans at the center of the editing process, Wikipedia ensures that critical thinking, fact-checking, and nuanced understanding remain the foundation of its content. The organization also emphasizes using open-source or open-weight AI models and maintaining transparency in how AI is used. Furthermore, they plan to take a nuanced approach to multilinguality, recognizing it as a fundamental aspect of Wikipedia’s global reach. Machine Learning Powers Assisting, Not Replacing The foundation of Wikipedia’s AI tools will likely rely heavily on machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can identify patterns, process large amounts of text, and perform tasks like suggesting edits, flagging potential issues, or facilitating translations. However, the critical decision-making, content creation, and conflict resolution will remain firmly in the hands of the human community. This model serves as an interesting example for other industries grappling with AI integration. It demonstrates that AI can be a powerful augmentative tool, making human work more efficient and effective, rather than a replacement for human expertise and judgment. What Does This Mean for Human Editors? For the vast community of Wikipedia volunteers, this AI strategy is positive news. It means they will gain access to tools that streamline their efforts, reduce drudgery, and potentially make contributing to Wikipedia more accessible to new volunteers. The focus remains on leveraging AI’s strengths in automation and data processing while preserving the essential human element of curation, verification, and community governance that makes Wikipedia unique. In conclusion, Wikipedia’s announced AI strategy is a deliberate, values-driven plan to integrate artificial intelligence as a supportive technology. By focusing on enhancing workflows, improving information discovery, and assisting with tasks like translation and onboarding, Wikipedia aims to empower its invaluable community of human editors, ensuring the platform remains a reliable and collaboratively built source of knowledge in the age of AI.
