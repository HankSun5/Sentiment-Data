As of April 29, both platforms are predicting that the US will log an economic contraction during the first quarter of 2025 in an upcoming economic data release. The US has logged positive growth figures every quarter since 2022, and a reversal in that trend could mark the start of a recession. The pessimistic outlook marks a stark sentiment shift for prediction markets, which had recently anticipated a positive US growth report. On April 29, consensus Q1 US growth estimates on Kalshi, a US derivatives exchange, plunged from around 0.5% to -0.4% in less than 24 hours. Meanwhile, Polymarket bettors are setting the odds of a US economic contraction in Q1 at around 70%. On April 28, they still had a mostly favorable outlook. The shift comes one day after Canada, America’s second-largest trading partner, elected Liberal Mark Carney as prime minister. Carney has vowed to take a more hawkish stance in Canada’s ongoing trade war with the US. Bettors on Kalshi now expect a negative US GDP print. Source: Kalshi Related: Analysts brace for Bitcoin slide on gloomy US manufacturing data The markets are pegged to the outcome of an April 30 report by the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, which issues official measures of America’s gross domestic product (GDP). The report will provide the clearest view yet into the impact of US President Donald Trump’s controversial trade policies. Prediction markets work by letting users trade contracts tied to specific events, with prices fluctuating dynamically based on expected outcomes. In 2024, event contracts proved to be as reliable as traditional polling, forecasting not only Trump’s election win but also his party’s sweep of the US House and Senate. Polymarket’s US GDP growth wagers. Source: Polymarket Tariff turmoil On April 2, Trump announced plans to place sweeping tariffs on US imports. The president has since paused the rollout of tariffs on certain countries, but the prospect of a global trade war still looms. The macroeconomic uncertainty has already weighed on US economic data. In April, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Manufacturing Index — a monthly survey of 250 US-based manufacturers — reported the sharpest declines in activity since 2020 . Analysts said factories are bracing for the impact of Trump’s tariff plans, which could potentially raise production costs for manufacturers.

While activity cools on Ethereum (ETH), RCO Finance is gaining momentum, backed by a fresh $7.5 million from a top venture capital firm. Now entering its next development stage, RCO Finance is preparing to launch new features that could redefine how traders engage with the platform. This upcoming wave of features could give new investors a compelling reason to take notice. Why Ethereum’s Price Action Could Cause Uncertainty Over the last month, ETH dropped by 13.83% , falling to around $1,783. With the current price below its realized value of $2,002, many holders could be facing unrealized losses. This pattern often signals a period of sideways trading or further price drops, especially when Ethereum struggles to break through key resistance levels like $2,000. Some experts suggest that Ethereum (ETH) might be entering a consolidation phase similar to its 2022 market structure, marked by slow momentum and cautious accumulation. Although there has been some increase in long-term wallet inflows and a small bounce from the lows, the recovery has been slow. Most traders are buying the dips rather than showing strong bullish sentiment, which creates uncertainty in the market. While the market adjusts to Ethereum’s recent performance, RCO Finance is strengthening the market with innovative features, offering new opportunities that stand out in an unstable crypto market. What to Expect from RCO Finance’s New Features RCO Finance’s token presale has raised over $14.7 million so far, and this new capital injection signals strong institutional interest in the project. As more people join, RCOF’s price potential is expected to increase, and the project is already introducing new features that aim to reinforce its long-term stability and market position. The beta platform , for instance, lets traders access AI-driven strategies with its Robo Advisor. This tool helps maximize profits and reduce risks by offering personalized investment insights. RCO Finance also supports over 120,000 assets, covering both crypto and traditional markets. More updates are coming soon, like the AI-powered simulated trading feature, which will launch in Q2 2025. This feature will allow users to compare manual trades against AI strategies in a risk-free environment. Additionally, the Demo Trading Leaderboard will launch in Q2 2025, providing accurate updates on the top 50 traders. Other features are also being expanded. Calendar-based profit/loss tracking will be available by May 13, 2025, allowing users to track their performance over different periods. Crypto-funded demo trading, launching May 24, 2025, will allow users to start trading instantly with real crypto. CRM integration, launching May 7, 2025, will personalize user experiences and improve engagement. The RCOF project is working to offer more tools for traders, and with even more exciting updates to come, we may not have seen the best of RCOF just yet. Key Features That Make RCO Finance Stand Out The RCO Finance token has experienced impressive growth since the start of its presale, increasing from $0.01 to $0.13 per token. A massive 1,200% rise, and with the price expected to reach $0.15 in the next stage, early investors are anticipating potential gains of over 3,000% after the token is listed. The RCO Finance platform offers a set of core features designed to appeal to a wide range of investors and users, and one standout feature is the non-KYC model. This means that users who worry about privacy can get started without undergoing the usual identity verification process Another key feature is the AI-powered Robo Advisor. The Robo Advisor leverages advanced algorithms to spot profitable market opportunities. It is designed to help users make smarter investment decisions by analyzing market trends in real time, and can benefit both new and experienced investors. RCOF also prides itself on having undergone a thorough audit by SolidProof , a well-known name in the crypto security space. This audit ensures that the platform’s smart contracts are safe and secure, which should give users peace of mind when interacting with the platform. The project also offers staking and leverage features. Users can stake their tokens and earn passive income without needing to actively trade. The platform also provides leverage, which could enable users to amplify their investments and take advantage of greater market movements. Don’t Miss Out on RCO Finance’s Next Big Step RCO Finance is moving forward with new features that aim to change the way traders interact with the platform. With fresh backing from a top venture capital firm, the project could be set to scale to another stage. As Ethereum faces market changes, RCO Finance is stepping in with tools and updates that could provide real value to investors. Join RCO Finance today. Now could be the right time to explore the project and see how its upcoming features unfold.

This significant increase from merely 20% earlier this year reflects growing institutional confidence in Cardano’s ecosystem and future potential. On April 27, crypto analyst Nala shared a Polymarket screenshot highlighting Grayscale ‘s strategic repositioning towards Cardano. “Grayscale is accumulating more Cardano. The chances of an ADA ETF have jumped from 20% to 70%. Is the ADA ETF closer than we think?” She wrote. Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund (GDLC) has significantly expanded its ADA holdings to over $11 million, representing a calculated re-entry after previously reducing its exposure to the asset. This institutional accumulation, combined with notable whale activity, where major holders acquired over 180 million ADA tokens in March, indicates strong institutional conviction in Cardano’s long-term viability. That said, Cardano , distinguished by its academically driven research-based development approach and robust Web 3.0 infrastructure, continues to make significant advances in decentralized finance. A primary catalyst behind the ETF speculation is Cardano’s groundbreaking integration with BitcoinOS, a specialized Bitcoin smart contract platform that enables seamless Bitcoin DeFi operations without the need for traditional bridging mechanisms. Notably, this technical collaboration unlocks access to Bitcoin’s $1.3 trillion liquidity pool for Cardano’s ecosystem through advanced zero-knowledge cryptographic protocols, ensuring secure transactions without the need for intermediaries. This innovation will position Cardano as a frontrunner in cross-chain functionality, further cementing institutional interest in the platform. Meanwhile, ADA’s price trajectory has become a focal point of speculation, with several analysts projecting potential valuations around $3, representing a substantial appreciation from its current price of around $0.7054 According to analyst LucksideCrypto, ADA could be on the verge of a major price movement within the next 4–6 weeks, with potential gains of 20– 100% against Bitcoin. “These next four to six weeks could be very beneficial for ADA compared to the broader crypto market,” LucksideCrypto said on Monday, noting that several key market signals “ haven’t appeared in a very long time .” Central to the analyst’s thesis is the current state of Bitcoin dominance, which has been “straight up and to the right for a very long period” but now appears “very toppy” and potentially ready for a breakdown. The stochastic RSI indicator on the weekly chart displays similar patterns to those of previous periods, where Bitcoin dominance dropped from around 61% to 54%, potentially signaling a major shift into altcoins. The pundit specifically noted that ADA/BTC is currently “heavily oversold” on the weekly timeframe and is creating a bullish flip. According to him, this particular pattern has occurred approximately four times during the current bull market cycle, with each instance preceding ADA gains of 20-100% against Bitcoin within a 4–6-week timeframe.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-04-29 23:04:32

The exchange issued the clarification via its official wallet account on X (formerly Twitter) following growing complaints from users encountering failed, disappearing balances, and stalled transactions while interacting with Kamino Finance through Binance Wallet . Over the past days, multiple Binance Wallet users have raised concerns on social media about failed transactions when engaging with Kamino Finance, a decentralized protocol built on the Solana blockchain. The complaints range from unsuccessful token swaps to liquidity transactions that appear to hang or fail without refunds or visible confirmations. These reports prompted users to tag Binance Wallet’s official account in hopes of receiving technical support or intervention. However, Binance was quick to clarify its position. Translated post of Binance recommending that users direct questions about failed transactions to the Kamino Finance DEX. Source: Binance Wallet (X/Twitter) Binance wallet blames Kamino Finance In a direct reply to user complaints on April 29, Binance Wallet stated: “Hello, the reason in the screenshot is related to the underlying DEX. The failure rate of the KMNO token is relatively high. This problem needs to be solved by the underlying DEX.” Binance also mentioned in the statement that they are in touch with the Kamino Finance team, stating, “We have communicated with the underlying DEX, and the other party has confirmed the problem. We will continue to track this problem and optimize it in the future.” Kamino Finance, a Solana-based DeFi protocol known for offering lending, leverage and liquidity provisioning, has not yet publicly responded to the wave of user complaints on X or Binance’s claim that it’s responsible for the current issues plaguing users who run transactions with it via Binance’s platform. Kamino operates outside the control of centralized platforms like Binance. Community split on responsibility Reactions within the crypto community have been divided. Some users argued that Binance is getting it wrong, as it’s not about the success rate of Kamino Finance but that balances are disappearing after failed transactions. Another user , under whose initial post, Binance shared one of the posts clarifying its position on customers’ challenges, posted that the issue wasn’t unique to Kamino Finance transactions, stating that, “AERO also fails, so there is something wrong with AERO’s dex, right?” The user also highlighted that the response they got from Binance customer service was different from the statement Binance posted on X. According to the user, Binance customer service said, “Thank you for your patience while I learn about your concerns. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Regarding price volatility, unfortunately this is one of the risks you face when trading such products, it is a common situation in the cryptocurrency space and you must take these factors into account when developing your trading strategy. Thank you for your understanding.” Another user shared similar issues with Fartcoin while pointing out to Binance that the issues may be beyond Kamino Finance and more from Binance’s trading platform. While alpha traders are bringing up this current issue to Binance for resolution, the exchange continues to point accusing fingers at DeFi actors. Some of the conversations between Binance and the customers occurred in the Chinese language and were translated. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

A tidal wave of attention shifts toward crypto, that’s what. As traditional finance loses its shine, sharp early adopters are tuning into new-age blockchain projects that could reshape the future — not just Sonic’s DeFi revolution or SEI’s bullish technicals, but something even bigger brewing with Qubetics. Qubetics isn’t riding the crypto hype train — it’s building real solutions that are about to flip Web3 on its head. With its disruptive Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, Qubetics is stepping up where legacy chains stalled out. It’s no surprise the project’s Qubetics presale is already making waves among those hunting for the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now . Qubetics’ Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet: The Gateway to True Web3 If blockchain wants to go mainstream, it needs tools real people can actually use. That’s where Qubetics comes charging in. The project’s Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet isn’t just another wallet — it’s an entire Web3 control center that lets anyone move, store, swap, and manage assets across dozens of blockchains without ever giving up custody or getting tangled up in bridges and swaps. Picture this: a freelance graphic designer in Austin who gets paid in USDT on Ethereum but wants to cash out into SOL on Solana without touching a centralized exchange. Or a small import-export business in Toronto needing to move stablecoins across Binance Smart Chain and Polygon to avoid heavy banking fees. Or a gamer in South Korea who wants to jump between Avalanche and SUI-based games without jumping through three layers of tech headaches. Qubetics makes all of that a simple, no-hassle, one-tap reality. This real-world usability is why early buyers are treating Qubetics as the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now. While others talk about interoperability and multi-chain dreams, Qubetics is handing it over on a silver platter — with privacy, speed, and complete ownership baked in. Qubetics Presale Numbers Are Getting Too Big to Ignore If there were ever a “last call” bell ringing in crypto right now, it would be the Qubetics presale. Each stage of the presale lasts exactly 7 days — and every Sunday at midnight, the price automatically jumps 10%. No hype tricks, no sudden rug pulls. Just steady, locked-in momentum. As of Stage 32, the $TICS token sits at $0.2093, with over $16.5 million raised, 510 million tokens sold, and a loyal crowd of more than 25,400 early adopters already on board. Now, let’s talk numbers because the upside here is bananas. Someone throwing $100 into the Qubetics presale today could be looking at a 377.76% return if $TICS hits $1. If it hits $5, that same $100 could balloon into $2,288.80. Hit $10 after mainnet launch in Q2 2025? That’s a clean $4,677.59. And if $TICS rockets to $15 — and plenty of analysts say it could — that original $100 turns into $7,066.39. This is why serious community members are jumping now instead of hesitating. Qubetics isn’t just offering a shiny token — it’s offering a way to actually join this crypto presale early and ride the asset tokenization wave that’s expected to dominate blockchain markets for the next decade. And for those scanning for the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now, Qubetics is flashing bright green. Sonic Is Redefining DeFi Standards with Its Breakthrough Model Sonic is buzzing hard right now after HTX Research dropped its latest report, calling it a model for the new DeFi paradigm. According to the research breakdown, Sonic brings together scalable DeFi architecture, sustainable liquidity mining, and dynamic yield generation — key ingredients missing from the first DeFi wave that exploded and imploded during the last bull cycle. HTX Research points out that Sonic’s emphasis on Layer 2 scalability solutions and dynamic on-chain incentives could make it the foundation for safer, more sustainable DeFi platforms moving forward. No more unsustainable APYs or runaway inflation models that doom protocols from the start. Sonic’s blueprint is aimed at making DeFi robust enough for serious long-term participation, not just quick flips. And while Sonic’s new approach is grabbing headlines, it’s clear the market is starting to prioritize real innovation over temporary yield farming fads. Projects like Sonic are rebuilding trust in decentralized finance, but it’s Qubetics, with its Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, that could hand ordinary users the seamless Web3 experiences they’ve been waiting for. SEI Price Analysis Sparks Bullish Hopes of 600–800 Sats Rally SEI is riding high on a serious technical breakout that’s got crypto traders buzzing. According to blockchain.news, SEI’s price action has triggered a strong bullish divergence, with technical analysis suggesting a possible rally toward the 600–800 sats range if current momentum holds. That’s not just optimism — it’s based on specific key resistance breakouts and volume confirmations signaling a true shift in market sentiment. The report emphasizes how SEI’s resilient price action, even amid broader market chop, has drawn attention from both short-term traders and longer-term participants. The bullish pattern isn’t just about speculation either; it reflects deeper confidence in SEI’s underlying growth fundamentals and its positioning as a fast, efficient trading platform built for high-volume transactions. Still, while SEI’s technicals look great for momentum plays, the biggest opportunities often lie in fundamental shifts — like Qubetics leading the Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet evolution. That’s why those scouting for the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now are looking past just technical analysis and locking into projects driving real-world adoption. Conclusion: Qubetics, Sonic, and SEI Light Up the Crypto Watchlist for April 2025 The winds are changing fast in the blockchain world. With 12% of Americans ditching stocks and traditional markets feeling more uncertain than ever, smart community members are zeroing in on the projects that aren’t just hyped — but built to last. Sonic’s DeFi revamp is definitely exciting. SEI’s bullish surge points to renewed market confidence. But Qubetics? Qubetics is laying the foundation for the future of Web3 itself. With a world-class Non-Custodial Multi-Chain Wallet, a thriving Qubetics presale, real-world asset tokenization use cases, and explosive ROI projections, Qubetics is showing exactly why it’s the Best Altcoins to Invest in Now. For those who want to join this crypto presale before the next stage and price hike, the clock is ticking. And once $TICS takes off post-mainnet, this window won’t be open for long.

Job openings fell to 7.2 million in March versus the 7.5 million forecast and consumer confidence hit its lowest level since January 2021. If past patterns hold, Bitcoin could rally by mid-July and possibly reach $140,000 by October 2025. Macroeconomic conditions have long been seen as a major influence on cryptocurrency prices. Generally, Bitcoin ( BTC ) and altcoins perform poorly when investors fear that employment and consumer data are weakening. According to a US Labor Department JOLTS report released on April 29, job openings in March approached their lowest levels in four years. US employers posted 7.2 million vacancies in March, below the 7.5 million that economists had forecast. Meanwhile, US consumer confidence fell for the fifth straight month in April, reaching its lowest point since January 2021. US Consumer Confidence (left) vs. Total non-farm US job openings (right). Source: TradingView/Cointelegraph Worsening conditions raise the chances that central banks will introduce economic stimulus measures, making the overall impact on cryptocurrency markets uncertain. Typically, the additional liquidity encourages investment in risk-on assets like Bitcoin, as more capital flows into the economy. Future expectations matter more than today’s weak economic data The last time the US experienced a drop in job openings and weakening consumer confidence was between January and June 2024. In the three months that followed, Bitcoin’s price moved between $53,000 and $66,000. Then, a 60% rally began in mid-October, pushing BTC above $100,000. The final result was positive, but it took more than 105 days for this effect to show in the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin/USD, log scale. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph Although these conditions may seem worrying at first, weaker labor and consumer sentiment are usually backward-looking. Financial markets and companies base their decisions on expectations for future economic growth, rather than just past data. Also, improved sentiment among crypto investors tends to come after there is some confirmation of better macroeconomic conditions. This explains why the 105-day lag is not unusual. Before 2024, a similar situation occurred between January and June 2023, with declines in both job market data and consumer confidence. The next four months were difficult, as Bitcoin’s price fell 18% to $25,000. It took 115 days for the price to recover to $30,500 by late October. However, the following two months were very positive, with BTC gaining 45% to reach $43,900. Bitcoin/USD in 2020, log scale. Source: TradingView / Cointelegraph The last time in the past eight years when both the labor market and consumer confidence suffered significantly was between February 2020 and May 2020, right after the implementation of the COVID-19 lockdowns. This period saw Bitcoin briefly drop below $4,000 on March 13, 2020. As a result, a longer period of consolidation was expected before investors regained confidence in the crypto markets.

Looking back at the macroeconomic data, there was no major impact on Bitcoin between May 2020 and September 2020, as its price increased from $8,900 to $10,600, a 20% gain. However, the next 60 days brought an impressive 85% rally to $19,700. For the third time, weaker labor and consumer sentiment data seemed to come before a rally in Bitcoin prices. While the time between the lowest point of economic conditions and Bitcoin’s rally ranged from 105 to 130 days, the result was clear in all three cases. Therefore, if US job openings and consumer confidence improve from April 2025, it is likely that Bitcoin’s price will start to rise by mid-July. If history repeats itself, this could mean a minimum target of $140,000 by October 2025, but further positive macroeconomic data is needed to confirm this outlook.

While blue-chip assets like XRP and Solana (SOL) continue to deliver steady growth, a rising group of analysts now believe that MAGACOIN FINANCE could outperform both by a significant margin by 2025. XRP: Institutional Growth, But Limited Room for Acceleration XRP is trading around $2.31 , posting a 10.06% gain over the past 7 days . Positive sentiment is fueled by continued adoption of Ripple’s cross-border payment infrastructure and growing institutional partnerships. Despite renewed interest, analysts caution that XRP’s large market capitalization, now at $135.57 billion , may limit its ability to deliver high-multiple returns relative to emerging projects. Resistance zones near $2.50 remain a key technical battleground, and while accumulation by whales suggests long-term confidence, major upside surges may require new, significant catalysts such as global regulatory clarity or expanded utility integrations. Solana: Strong Fundamentals, But Competition Is Rising Solana (SOL) trading at $148.69 records 7.99% gain in the last 7 days. The ever-expanding ecosystems in decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and gaming projects on Solana have led to the adoption of the digital asset. In the last 24 hours, there was a surge in volume by 64.13%. As a result, the rise in volume can be attributed to growing interest from investors on Solana. As reported by technical analysts, Solana is consolidating just below key psychological resistance at $150. As other Layer 1 networks get more competitive, future upside may become more incremental unless Solana can unlock fresh use cases or further scale without performance issues. The current bullish sentiment (with 85% of the community votes in favor of bullishness) supports a positive mid-term narrative. However, top analysts argue that Solana’s larger market position makes it less likely to deliver big, early-stage returns like smaller projects. MAGACOIN FINANCE: The Under-the-Radar Asymmetric Play MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting the attention of tactical investors and fund managers scouring the market for the next strategic entry point before mainstream exposure. MAGACOIN FINANCE, which trades under $0.01, has a scarcity-based tokenomics system with no centralized exchange dilution and is community-first. Analysts highlight several reasons why MAGACOIN FINANCE’s upside potential is seen as superior heading into 2025: Strategic Scarcity: Designed with deflationary mechanics that reward early holders and limit long-term token inflation. Early Positioning: Available exclusively through magacoinfinance.com, providing early investors with a rare first-mover advantage before any major listing events. Technical Momentum: Predictions suggest it may place among the leading ROI altcoins in Q3 of this year in terms of investing. This is clear from its early accumulation, coupled with some whales making strategic moves. Smart Money Interest: The smart money is getting in early, knowing that the biggest multiples often occur before exchange listings and institutions enter the market. While XRP and Solana continue to offer stability and ecosystem growth, MAGACOIN FINANCE is carving a unique narrative centered around early-stage accessibility, high scarcity, and aggressive strategic expansion — key elements that historically drive the largest return cycles in crypto. Final Takeaway Investors prioritizing stability will likely continue to favor XRP and Solana. However, those seeking transformative upside are increasingly aligning with projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE — where early access, strategic scarcity, and tactical market positioning create a high-reward setup heading into 2025.

Per the Russian Parliamentary Gazette , the plan is the brainchild of the Federal Financial Monitoring Service (Rosfinmonitoring). The agency is also working on the plan with the Russian Finance Ministry and the Central Bank. Russian AML Agency: Time to Criminalize Illegal Mining Rosfinmonitoring also wants to hit offenders with administrative liability. German Neglyad, the agency’s Deputy Director, said he told members of the Federation Council about the plans earlier this month. The council is Russia’s upper parliamentary house. Russia’s Energy Ministry in Moscow, Russia. (Source: Svetlov Artem) The gazette also said the plan has the backing of the Russian Civic Chamber, one of the nation’s top policy-forming bodies. Nikolai Zhuravlev, the Federation Council’s Deputy Speaker, said that lawmakers needed to “stay ahead of the curve” if they want to “effectively eliminate the vulnerabilities of the modern financial system.” The Deputy Director of the Department of Financial Policy at the Ministry of Finance, Osman Kabaloev, has also said that legal amendments “are already being prepared.” Kabaloev said that the new legislation would help widen the range of punishments courts can hand out to illegal miners.

In the southern part of the Bitcoin mining hub of Irkutsk Oblast, a year-round ban is in place until 2031. However, crypto mining in these areas is not yet punishable under the terms of the Russian criminal code. Irkutsk, Russia. (Source: Stas Serebrennikov) Instead, police can only charge illegal or quasi-legal miners with electricity theft or the improper use of subsidized power. This means, in most instances, courts do not have enough power to deliver jail terms or hefty fines. In some cases, illegal miners have simply been ordered to pay back the cost of the electricity they have “stolen” from local grids, in addition to legal costs. In the rest of the nation, Russians are free to mine crypto at home, so long as they do not use more than 6,000 kWh of energy per month. Any individual or firm using more than this amount must sign up to a national register managed by the Federal Tax Service. Rosfinmonitoring said that the new legislation would establish liability for those who fail to comply “with the established requirements for the circulation of cryptoassets.” The agency added that the new rules would cover “both administrative and criminal liability, differentiated depending on the severity of the crime.” Putin announces May 8-10 ceasefire, Ukraine wants truce now https://t.co/C15vlV9ZWW https://t.co/C15vlV9ZWW — Reuters (@Reuters) April 29, 2025 New Bans Incoming?

Despite facing stiff resistance near this zone, LINK continues to show strength amid a broader market rebound, holding steady while many other altcoins experience mixed performance. Related Reading: Ethereum Shows 4H Bearish Divergence – Can Bulls Hold $1,750? The asset is now up over 50% from its April lows, suggesting that bullish momentum is building beneath the surface. Market participants are closely watching for signs of a breakout, especially as the overall crypto market heats up and investors rotate capital back into high-potential altcoins. Adding to the optimism, top analyst Ali Martínez shared a technical chart indicating that the SuperTrend indicator has just flashed a buy signal on Chainlink’s daily chart. This indicator is often viewed as a reliable tool for identifying the start of new bullish phases or trend reversals. A confirmation of this signal could set the stage for further gains if bulls manage to clear the current resistance. As the market awaits clarity, LINK’s ability to hold its current level and potentially break higher may set the tone for its next significant move, possibly reigniting a long-awaited rally for the popular oracle protocol. Chainlink Eyes Breakout as Momentum Builds Chainlink has been range-bound between $10 and $16 since March, consolidating after a volatile start to the year. Despite the sideways action, market participants are increasingly focused on the potential for a breakout as LINK presses against its key resistance level around $16. A sustained move above this barrier could trigger a strong upside move, especially if accompanied by a broader altcoin rally. The current setup comes amid high-risk macroeconomic conditions. Global tensions continue to rise, particularly between the US and China, where escalating tariffs and trade disputes have sparked fears of a global recession. Such a backdrop adds a layer of caution to any bullish outlook, as risk assets remain vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment. Nevertheless, optimism for Chainlink has grown after Ali Martínez pointed out that the SuperTrend indicator has flashed a buy signal on LINK’s daily chart. This technical tool is often used to detect early trend reversals or sustained shifts in market direction. When it appears after a prolonged consolidation, as it has now, it can signal that bullish momentum is about to accelerate. If bulls manage to reclaim and hold levels above $16, it could confirm a trend change and potentially send LINK surging toward new 2024 highs. Still, until the price breakouts, the range remains in play—and so does the risk of another rejection. Related Reading: Solana Forms Textbook Cup And Handle Pattern – Massive Breakout Ahead? LINK Price Analysis: Key Levels Chainlink is currently trading at $15.10, gradually climbing toward the critical $16 resistance level. This zone has acted as a ceiling throughout April and May, and bulls now face a pivotal test. Reclaiming and holding above $16 would not only break the multi-week range but also set the stage for a possible breakout if momentum continues to build. The technical picture highlights the importance of the 200-day moving average (MA) and exponential moving average (EMA), both clustered in the $16–$17 range. These trend indicators have served as dynamic resistance in recent months, and a clean push above them could confirm a bullish reversal and open the path toward higher targets. However, the structure remains fragile, and failure to maintain strength could put LINK at risk of a deeper pullback. If the $14 support level breaks, selling pressure may accelerate, potentially dragging the price toward lower demand zones around $12 or even $10. Related Reading: Ethereum Reclaims Local Range Against BTC – Can Bulls Target The Range High? As the broader market heats up and speculative appetite returns, LINK’s positioning around this key resistance will likely determine its short-term trend.

This news comes as a major relief to users and the broader community, demonstrating that even after a security breach, positive outcomes and user protection are possible. What Exactly Happened During the DeFi Hack? On April 26, 2024, the Loopscale protocol experienced a security incident that resulted in the unauthorized withdrawal of digital assets. The extent of the breach was significant, involving substantial amounts of cryptocurrency. Specifically, the attacker managed to siphon off 5,726,725 USDC and 1,211 SOL from the protocol’s vaults. This type of event, commonly referred to as a DeFi hack , highlights the inherent risks present in the rapidly evolving world of decentralized finance, where smart contract vulnerabilities or other exploits can be targeted by malicious actors. Initial reports of the incident spread quickly across social media and crypto news platforms, causing concern among Loopscale users and observers of the Solana DeFi scene. The immediate aftermath of a DeFi hack is often characterized by uncertainty regarding the fate of the affected funds and the protocol’s future viability. How Did Loopscale Facilitate the Crypto Recovery? Unlike many incidents where stolen assets disappear into the labyrinth of blockchain anonymity, Loopscale pursued a different path: negotiation. The team confirmed via their official X (formerly Twitter) account that the full recovery was a result of successful negotiations with the party responsible for the exploit. While the specifics of these negotiations have not been fully disclosed – which is common practice in such sensitive situations to protect the integrity of the process – the outcome speaks for itself: the return of all stolen funds . This approach to crypto recovery through dialogue rather than solely relying on law enforcement or on-chain tracking efforts is becoming an increasingly discussed strategy in the crypto space. It often involves intermediaries or direct communication channels being established with the exploiter, sometimes offering a ‘white hat’ bounty or a promise not to pursue legal action in exchange for the return of funds. The success of Loopscale in retrieving 5,726,725 USDC and 1,211 SOL underscores the potential effectiveness of this method under specific circumstances. Key elements often involved in a negotiated crypto recovery include: Rapid identification of the exploit method and potentially the exploiter’s identity or wallet movements. Establishing a secure and anonymous communication channel. Proposing terms for the return of assets, which might include allowing the exploiter to keep a small percentage as a ‘bug bounty’. Verifying the return of funds before publicly confirming the resolution. Loopscale’s ability to navigate this complex process effectively is a testament to their commitment to their users and the resilience of the project, despite facing a significant DeFi hack . What Does This Mean for Loopscale Users and the Solana Protocol Ecosystem? The most critical outcome of this successful crypto recovery is the assurance that users of the Loopscale protocol will not suffer any financial loss from the incident. The return of the full amount of stolen funds means that the protocol is in a position to make affected users whole. This is a stark contrast to many other DeFi hack scenarios where users’ funds are permanently lost. For the broader Solana protocol ecosystem, this event serves as a valuable case study. While hacks are detrimental and highlight areas for improvement in security practices across all blockchains, a successful recovery story like Loopscale’s can help restore confidence. It demonstrates that the ecosystem is maturing and that protocols and the community are developing mechanisms, including negotiation and collaboration, to mitigate the impact of security breaches. Benefits highlighted by this event: User Confidence: Knowing that a protocol prioritizes recovery and succeeds in returning funds builds trust. Protocol Resilience: Successfully navigating a major security event proves the team’s capability to handle crises. Ecosystem Maturity: Developing effective post-hack response strategies benefits all protocols within the Solana ecosystem. Precedent Setting: This case might encourage other protocols and even attackers to consider negotiation as a path to resolution. Challenges that remain: Preventing the initial exploit is always the primary goal. Negotiations are not guaranteed to succeed and can be complex. Reputational damage, even with recovery, can be long-lasting. What Are the Next Steps for Loopscale? With the stolen funds now back in the protocol’s control, Loopscale is focusing on the final steps of resolution. Their announcement mentioned that they are finalizing the process and will provide further updates. A key upcoming step involves detailing how users can withdraw funds from the affected vaults. Users who had assets deposited in the vaults impacted by the DeFi hack will be keenly awaiting these instructions to regain access to their capital. Actionable insights for users: Stay informed by following Loopscale’s official communication channels (like their X account) for updates on vault withdrawals. Exercise patience as the team finalizes the technical and logistical aspects of returning funds. Review your own security practices, even when using reputable protocols, such as enabling two-factor authentication where possible and being wary of phishing attempts. The successful crypto recovery by Loopscale is a positive sign, but it also serves as a reminder of the dynamic risk landscape in DeFi. Protocols on the Solana protocol and other chains continue to innovate rapidly, and security must remain a paramount concern. Lessons Learned from the Loopscale Incident The Loopscale DeFi hack and subsequent crypto recovery offer several important lessons for both protocols and users in the decentralized finance space: Rapid Response is Crucial: Loopscale’s quick communication and apparent swift action to engage with the exploiter were likely key factors in the successful negotiation. Negotiation as a Tool: While controversial to some, negotiating with attackers can, in certain circumstances, be an effective way to recover stolen funds and protect users, especially when on-chain enforcement is difficult. User Safety First: Loopscale’s commitment to ensuring users incur no loss sets a high standard for how protocols should handle security incidents. Continuous Security Audits: This incident, like many others, underscores the absolute necessity for rigorous, ongoing security audits of smart contracts and protocol infrastructure to prevent future DeFi hack attempts. Community Communication: Transparent and timely updates, even when details are scarce, help manage user expectations and maintain trust during a crisis. The fact that a Solana protocol was able to achieve a full crypto recovery after a significant DeFi hack provides a glimmer of hope in an area often plagued by permanent losses. It reinforces the idea that while the technology is cutting-edge, the human element – in terms of both security practices and crisis management – remains vital. Conclusion: A Positive Turn for Loopscale and DeFi Recovery The news from Loopscale is undeniably positive. The successful negotiation leading to the return of all 5,726,725 USDC and 1,211 SOL in stolen funds is a significant achievement. It means that the users affected by the April 26th DeFi hack on the Solana protocol will be made whole, avoiding the financial pain typically associated with such exploits. As Loopscale works towards finalizing the resolution and enabling vault withdrawals, the focus shifts to rebuilding confidence and strengthening security measures to prevent future incidents. This event serves as a powerful example of successful crypto recovery and offers valuable insights into potential strategies for mitigating the impact of security breaches in the fast-paced world of decentralized finance.

As the industry continues shifting, Nexo appears to be adapting by exploring new marketing strategies, business verticals, and client engagement methods. One of these, and perhaps a more exciting one for the broader audience is through sports partnerships. Strategic Sponsorships to Build Relevance Nexo has recently started to explore partnerships in the sports world, with a focus on tennis. Their first involvement came through a sponsorship at the tennis tournament held in Acapulco, but further plans are underway. According to Stalimirov, this move isn’t just about visibility, but about aligning with a target audience. “Our audience are people who are more interested into, I would say, affluent sports,” he said. “But we’re not excluding any opportunity that might be invited to the table.” The goal is to bring the brand closer to its users, not just through financial services, but by participating in areas their clientele already engages with. “We want to be not just a service provider, but also a relatable brand,” Stalimirov explained. He emphasized that Nexo is responding to client feedback in its pursuit of brand awareness, saying, “We want to be closer to them in every way possible.” From Exchange to Ecosystem With a recent rebranding and a growth plan in the works, Nexo is positioning itself as more than a traditional exchange. The company is working on expanding its offering to include a broader set of financial products, particularly in the field of digital assets. “We’re surely going to expand in terms of types of products and ways for our clients to diversify their portfolios,” Stalimirov said. He noted that clients are not coming to Nexo simply to trade. They’re looking for a broader, more integrated financial experience. “You can exchange from Nexo, but that’s not why you’re coming,” he said. “If you’re looking purely for an exchange, there are quite a bit of exchanges out there.” The company’s direction appears to emphasize client-centric development. Plans include new B2B solutions and international brand campaigns intended to build awareness and drive engagement with new audiences. Navigating Challenges in a Shifting Landscape Like many in the digital finance space, Nexo is navigating a rapidly evolving regulatory and market environment. Compliance is non-negotiable, but so is maintaining a appropriate client experience. “You have to be compliant for sure, but you have to do it in the swiftest way possible and in the best way from a consumer standpoint,” said Stalimirov.

This week, Meta is hosting its first-ever LlamaCon AI developer conference. The goal? To convince AI Developers to build their next big applications using Meta’s open Llama Models . Why LlamaCon Matters for Meta AI Just a year ago, pitching developers on Llama was straightforward. Meta’s Llama 3 family, especially the Llama 3.1 405B model, was seen as a top performer among openly available models, even rivaling models like OpenAI’s GPT-4o at the time. This success made Meta a favorite among AI Developers , offering strong performance with the flexibility of open models. However, recent months have seen Meta struggle to maintain this lead. Competition from both ‘open’ labs like DeepSeek and commercial giants like OpenAI has intensified. LlamaCon is a critical moment for Meta to demonstrate its commitment and capabilities in building a robust Llama ecosystem. Challenges Facing Llama Models Today The reception to the recent Llama 4 family has been notably different from Llama 3. Jeff Boudier from Hugging Face noted that Llama 3.3 is still downloaded more often than Llama 4. What happened? Underwhelming Performance: Llama 4’s benchmark scores came in below some competitor models, including DeepSeek’s R1 and V3. This was a shift from Llama’s previous position at the forefront. Benchmarking Controversy: A specific version of Llama 4 Maverick optimized for conversationality performed well on the LM Arena benchmark but was never broadly released. The released version performed worse. This incident led to concerns about transparency and impacted developer trust. Ion Stoica, an LM Arena co-founder, highlighted this loss of trust, stating Meta needed to be clearer. Missing Reasoning Model: The Llama 4 release lacked a dedicated reasoning model, a type of AI model that works through questions carefully and often performs better on specific tasks. Many competitors have released such models, making Meta’s omission noticeable. Nathan Lambert, a researcher at Ai2, suggested this might indicate the Llama 4 launch was rushed. These issues have created pressure on Meta, especially as rival Open AI Models from labs like Alibaba (with their Qwen 3 family) are showing strong performance on various benchmarks. Winning Over AI Developers: What Meta Needs to Do To regain its position and strengthen the Llama Models ecosystem, Meta needs to deliver superior models. Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, an AI researcher at NYU, suggests this might require taking more technical risks and exploring new techniques. LlamaCon is Meta’s opportunity to address the recent setbacks and showcase upcoming advancements. The company needs to demonstrate that it can still produce boundary-pushing models that compete with the best from OpenAI, Google, xAI, and others. Winning back the trust and excitement of AI Developers is paramount for the future growth of the Llama platform. The Path Forward for Meta AI The conference provides a platform for Meta to communicate its roadmap, explain the Llama 4 decisions, and generate enthusiasm for future releases. Success at LlamaCon is not just about showcasing technology; it’s about rebuilding relationships and demonstrating that Meta is committed to leading in the open AI space. If Meta fails to deliver compelling updates and rebuild trust, it risks falling further behind in this highly competitive field.

""We're exploring the introduction of a utility token within a Truth digital wallet that can initially be used to pay for Truth+ subscription costs, and later be applied to other products and services in the Truth ecosphere,"" Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes wrote in an April 29 letter to shareholders. He added that the crypto token and wallet would be part of a rewards program that Trump Media is exploring across its services, which include the social media platform Truth Social and the financial services platform Truth.Fi. Trump Media first signaled plans for a potential crypto payments venture last November when it filed a trademark application with the US Patent and Trademark Office for computer software designed to function as a digital wallet, enable digital asset trading and process crypto payments on Truth.Fi. Source: Cointelegraph Truth+ launched in October, offering movies and shows mainly targeting a politically conservative audience. Trump Media signed a binding agreement with the crypto exchange Crypto.com and asset manager Yorkville America Digital to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that will include crypto and stocks “with a Made in America focus” to launch on Truth.Fi. The company said in January that it plans to invest up to $250 million of its cash reserves into a range of financial products, including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other crypto tokens or crypto-related securities, which would be custodied by asset manager Charles Schwab . More potential for conflict of interest The launch of a Trump Media utility token would only heighten concerns about the president’s crypto-related ventures potentially conflicting with his duties. Trump, however, transferred his 59% stake into a trust last December. Related: Trump’s first 100 days ‘worst in history’ despite crypto promises Trump has also been criticized for backing the crypto platform World Liberty Financial , where he’s named the firm’s “Chief Crypto Advocate” and draws a portion of its profits. Some senators have raised concerns that Trump’s influence on policy could benefit World Liberty, which is 60% owned by the Trump family. Trump also received backlash for the controversial launch of his memecoin, Official Trump (TRUMP), on Jan. 18 — just two days before he re-entered the White House.

Pseudonymous analyst Altcoin Sherpa tells his 245,200 followers on the social media platform X that he thinks “a dip is going to come soon,” but he doesn’t see any reason to be super bearish once the correction takes place. According to the analyst, a correction should provide an opportunity for investors to enter the crypto market before another leg up. Should a marketwide pullback materialize, Altcoin Sherpa says he plans to accumulate five altcoins. “Coins I want to buy: BONK ($0.00001600s) Fartcoin ($0.85) POPCAT ($0.33) HYPE ($15-$16s) GUN ($0.055s) Loads of others too, but those are on my short list for now.” Looking closer at the memecoin Fartcoin, the trader notes that FART needs to stay above $1.05 to witness new rallies. Otherwise, he thinks the altcoin could fall to as low as $0.8. “Fartcoin: wouldn’t be surprised to see this pullback a little bit here, but don’t forget that hot air rises in the end. Three different scenarios, all mostly dependent on BTC, frankly. I think this just continues up.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X Based on the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that FART can rally to as high as $1.40. At time of writing, FART is worth $1.09. Turning to fellow memecoin Bonk ( BONK ), Altcoin Sherpa thinks that the altcoin looks really strong. “The chart itself still looks fire.” Source: Altcoin Sherpa/X At time of writing, BONK is trading for $0.00002, up over 10% on the day.

This drive for innovation is particularly relevant to anyone following the digital landscape, including those in the cryptocurrency space who understand the value of technological advancement and data control. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has made a significant move by launching its own Meta AI as a standalone application, stepping directly into the ring with established players like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. What is Meta’s New Standalone AI App? Building upon its strategy of integrating AI across its popular platforms like WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger, Meta has now introduced a dedicated application for its AI Assistant . Unveiled during the LlamaCon event, this move allows users to access Meta AI capabilities outside the confines of Meta’s social media ecosystem, much like users access other AI assistants via their dedicated apps. The creation of a Standalone AI App signals Meta’s ambition to be a central hub for AI interaction. While the integrated AI is convenient within its existing apps, a standalone version suggests Meta wants AI to be a primary tool for users, available whenever and wherever they need it, regardless of whether they are actively using a Meta social product. How Does Meta AI Leverage User Data for Personalization? One of the key differentiators Meta is highlighting for its Generative AI assistant is its ability to offer personalized responses. Unlike many general-purpose AI models, Meta AI can potentially draw on information users have already shared across Meta’s products. The company states the AI can “[draw] on information you’ve already chosen to share on Meta products,” such as your profile details and the content you engage with. This approach aims to make the AI’s responses more relevant and tailored to the individual user. For example, if you frequently interact with content about hiking on Instagram, the AI might incorporate this interest into suggestions or conversations. Furthermore, users have the option to explicitly provide Meta AI with information to remember for future interactions. Telling the AI you have a specific dietary restriction, for instance, could influence its recommendations for activities or dining, making the interaction feel more personal and helpful. Initially, these personalized features are available in the US and Canada. Addressing Data Privacy Concerns with Meta AI The ability of Meta AI to leverage user data, while potentially enhancing personalization, also brings inherent Data Privacy considerations to the forefront. Meta’s business model heavily relies on targeted advertising powered by vast amounts of user data collected across its platforms. When users interact with the standalone AI app, they are sharing information directly with a company whose core revenue stream is data monetization. Users should be mindful of how the data shared with the AI chatbot might be used. While Meta states the AI draws on information users have “chosen to share,” the context of sharing data with an AI for personalized responses adds another layer to the ongoing discussion about user data ownership, transparency, and control. This is a particularly sensitive topic for those interested in decentralized technologies like cryptocurrency, which often emphasize user sovereignty and control over personal information. Exploring Features: The Discover Feed and Social Sharing Beyond its core function as an AI Assistant , Meta’s new standalone app includes a ‘Discover’ feed. This feature allows users to share examples of how they are using the AI with their friends. A mockup image provided by Meta shows a user asking the AI to describe them using three emojis and then sharing the result to this feed. Importantly, sharing interactions to the Discover feed is entirely opt-in. Users retain control over whether their conversations or AI-generated content are made public within the app’s social component. This feed could potentially amplify certain trends in Generative AI usage, mirroring how trends spread on social media platforms. However, the inclusion of a social feed in an AI utility app has also drawn comparisons to other apps that have controversially added social features, raising questions about whether such a feature is necessary or beneficial for a productivity/utility tool. Conclusion: A New Front in the AI Race Meta’s launch of a dedicated Standalone AI App marks a significant escalation in the competition among tech giants in the artificial intelligence space. By positioning Meta AI as a direct competitor to services like ChatGPT and leveraging its extensive user data for personalization, Meta is attempting to carve out a unique niche. While the promise of a highly personalized AI Assistant is appealing, the implications for Data Privacy remain a critical point of discussion, especially given Meta’s history and business model. The inclusion of social features like the Discover feed also adds an interesting, albeit potentially debated, dimension to the app’s design. As the landscape of Generative AI continues to evolve, Meta’s bold move demonstrates the increasing importance companies place on making AI accessible and integrated into users’ daily digital lives.

A significant development grabbing attention is the recent funding round for Unto Labs , a San Francisco-based startup co-founded by former Jump Crypto engineer Liam Heeger and Will Yoo. They’ve successfully raised a substantial $14.4 million, setting the stage for an ambitious project: building a new blockchain from the ground up. This investment signals strong confidence from major players in the crypto space and highlights the ongoing drive for more accessible and efficient blockchain infrastructure. Unto Labs Secures Significant Crypto Funding The $14.4 million funding round for Unto Labs was notably led by prominent venture capital firms Framework Ventures and Electric Capital. These firms are well-respected in the blockchain ecosystem, known for backing promising technologies and protocols. The investment values Unto Labs at an impressive $140 million, underscoring the potential investors see in the team and their vision for a new blockchain . This significant capital injection provides Unto Labs with the resources needed to accelerate development and bring their innovative ideas to fruition. Securing substantial crypto funding is a critical milestone for any startup in this competitive landscape. It allows Unto Labs to move beyond initial concepts and into serious execution. The backing from Framework Ventures and Electric Capital also brings valuable expertise and network effects, which can be crucial for navigating the complexities of launching a new Layer 1 or Layer 2 protocol. Building a New Blockchain: What’s the Vision? Unto Labs isn’t just tweaking an existing chain; they are embarking on the challenging but potentially rewarding path of building a fundamentally new blockchain . The core motivation behind this endeavor is to address some of the limitations and complexities faced by current blockchain platforms. While existing chains like Ethereum, Solana, and others have paved the way, they often present hurdles for developers, particularly those coming from traditional software backgrounds who are not deeply familiar with crypto-native languages or execution environments. The vision is to create a platform that lowers the barrier to entry for a wider pool of developers, thereby fostering greater innovation and adoption. A new blockchain designed with accessibility in mind could unlock a wave of new applications and use cases that are currently difficult or impossible to build efficiently on existing infrastructure. This focus on developer experience is a recurring theme in the evolution of blockchain technology, as the industry strives for mainstream utility. Introducing ThruVM: A Game-Changing Virtual Machine At the heart of Unto Labs’ new blockchain lies a key innovation: a new virtual machine called ThruVM . A virtual machine (VM) is essentially the engine of a blockchain, responsible for executing smart contracts and processing transactions. The most well-known example is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which powers Ethereum and many other compatible chains. However, VMs like the EVM have their own characteristics and limitations that can impact performance, cost, and developer experience. ThruVM aims to offer an alternative, designed with different principles to potentially achieve better performance, flexibility, or developer friendliness. The choice of VM is a foundational decision for any blockchain, as it dictates how code runs and interacts within the network. A novel VM like ThruVM suggests that Unto Labs is taking a fresh approach to blockchain computation, potentially enabling new types of applications or improving the efficiency of existing ones. Why RISC-V Architecture for a Blockchain? One of the most intriguing aspects of ThruVM is its foundation on the RISC-V blockchain architecture. RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) – essentially, the language that a computer processor understands. Unlike proprietary ISAs like x86 (used in most PCs) or ARM (common in mobile phones), RISC-V is open-source, allowing anyone to design, manufacture, and sell RISC-V chips and software without paying licensing fees. Building a virtual machine like ThruVM on RISC-V blockchain architecture offers several potential advantages in the context of blockchain: Openness and Flexibility: The open nature of RISC-V allows for greater transparency and customization of the VM’s underlying instruction set, potentially tailoring it specifically for blockchain workloads. Efficiency: RISC-V is designed to be simple and modular, which can lead to more efficient hardware and software implementations. This could translate to faster or cheaper transaction processing on the blockchain. Accessibility for Developers: By leveraging a more standard, open architecture, Unto Labs might make it easier for developers familiar with traditional computing concepts to build for their blockchain, rather than requiring them to learn entirely new, crypto-specific paradigms. This directly ties into their goal of improving accessibility for non-crypto native developers. Long-term Viability: As an open standard with growing industry adoption, RISC-V offers a strong foundation for long-term development and support, reducing reliance on a single vendor or proprietary technology. The decision to use RISC-V blockchain architecture for ThruVM is a strategic one that differentiates Unto Labs’ approach and could be key to achieving their goals of performance and developer accessibility. Unto Labs’ Strategic Growth Plans With the significant crypto funding secured, Unto Labs is now focused on scaling its operations. A primary use of the $14.4 million is to expand the team. According to reports, the company aims to double its workforce by the end of the year. This expansion is crucial for accelerating the development of the new blockchain and ThruVM , building out the necessary infrastructure, and fostering a developer ecosystem. Hiring top talent in blockchain development, cryptography, and distributed systems is essential for the success of such an ambitious project. Doubling the team size indicates a rapid scaling phase, moving from a smaller core group to a larger organization capable of handling the complexities of launching and maintaining a new network. This growth plan is a direct consequence of the successful crypto funding round and a necessary step towards realizing their vision. What This Funding Means for the Future The $14.4 million raised by Unto Labs is more than just capital; it’s a vote of confidence in their approach to building a new blockchain centered around ThruVM and the RISC-V blockchain architecture. For the broader crypto ecosystem, this development signifies the continued pursuit of better foundational technology. If Unto Labs succeeds in creating a highly accessible and performant blockchain using ThruVM , it could attract a significant number of developers who have previously found the learning curve for blockchain development too steep. Attracting non-crypto native developers is often cited as a key factor for achieving mass adoption of blockchain technology. By making it easier for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps), Unto Labs could potentially contribute to a new wave of innovation and utility within the space. The success of their new blockchain will ultimately depend on execution, the developer tools they provide, and the network effects they can build, but this initial crypto funding provides a strong launchpad. Challenges remain, of course. Building a new blockchain from scratch is complex and faces competition from established players and other emerging networks. However, the focus on developer accessibility and the novel approach with ThruVM and RISC-V blockchain architecture position Unto Labs as an interesting project to watch in the evolving landscape of blockchain infrastructure. Conclusion Unto Labs has made a significant splash with its $14.4 million crypto funding round, backed by heavyweights like Framework Ventures and Electric Capital. This capital infusion empowers the San Francisco startup to pursue its ambitious goal of building a new blockchain featuring the innovative ThruVM , built on RISC-V blockchain architecture. Their focus on improving accessibility for non-crypto native developers through this novel technical approach is a key differentiator and could unlock new potential for decentralized applications. As they double their team and push forward with development, the industry will be watching closely to see how Unto Labs’ vision takes shape and contributes to the future of blockchain technology.

Recently, analysts from the American investment bank turned their attention to the world of cryptocurrency trading on popular platforms, specifically focusing on Robinhood crypto trading . Their forecast paints a picture of cooling activity for the first quarter of the year, predicting a notable decrease in revenue generated from digital asset trades compared to the previous quarter. Understanding the JPMorgan Forecast for Robinhood The core of the recent analysis from JPMorgan revolves around anticipated trading activity on the Robinhood platform. According to their projections, the total crypto trading volume handled by Robinhood in the first quarter of the current year is expected to land somewhere around $52 billion. While this is still a substantial figure, it represents a significant step down from the $71 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of last year (Q4 2023). This predicted drop of approximately $19 billion in quarterly trading volume directly impacts Robinhood’s potential earnings. Since platforms like Robinhood primarily generate revenue from transaction fees associated with trading volume, a decrease in activity naturally leads to a projected decrease in Q1 crypto revenue . The scale of this forecast suggests a considerable shift in user behavior or market conditions impacting the platform. Here’s a quick comparison based on the JPMorgan forecast: Metric Q4 2023 (Actual) Q1 2024 (JPMorgan Forecast) Change Crypto Trading Volume ~$71 billion ~$52 billion ↓ ~$19 billion Implied Revenue Trend Higher Lower Negative This table clearly illustrates the magnitude of the expected decline as highlighted by the JPMorgan forecast . Why the Expected Drop in Crypto Trading Volume? JPMorgan analysts didn’t just provide numbers; they also offered insight into the potential reasons behind this expected slowdown in Robinhood crypto trading . They noted that while there was an initial upward trend in cryptocurrency activity at the beginning of the year, this momentum was reportedly ‘offset by the risk aversion that has spread in the market in recent months’. Understanding ‘risk aversion’ is key here. In financial terms, risk aversion refers to investors’ tendency to prefer lower-risk investments over higher-risk ones, even if the latter might offer potentially higher returns. The cryptocurrency market is widely considered a high-risk, high-reward environment. When overall market sentiment shifts towards caution, investors tend to reduce their exposure to volatile assets like cryptocurrencies. Several factors can contribute to increased risk aversion: Macroeconomic Uncertainty: Concerns about inflation, interest rates, or potential economic slowdowns can make investors more cautious. Regulatory Developments: Increased scrutiny or uncertain regulations around crypto in major markets can dampen enthusiasm. Price Volatility: Sharp price drops or periods of sideways trading can lead some retail traders to step back. Geopolitical Events: Global instability often drives investors towards perceived safe-haven assets, away from riskier ones. While the start of Q1 2024 saw some positive catalysts, such as the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in the U.S., which did inject some optimism and likely contributed to that initial ‘upward trend’, JPMorgan’s analysis suggests that this positive impulse was eventually overshadowed by broader market caution that developed later in the quarter, impacting overall crypto trading volume . Robinhood’s Position in the Cryptocurrency Market Robinhood has become a significant player in the retail crypto trading space, offering access to a range of popular cryptocurrencies alongside stocks and options. Its user-friendly interface and commission-free trading model (though other fees may apply) have attracted a large base of individual investors. The revenue generated from Robinhood crypto trading is a material part of the company’s overall financial performance, although the exact percentage can fluctuate significantly based on market cycles. For Robinhood, high trading volume translates directly to higher revenue from transaction fees. Conversely, periods of low volume, driven by factors like market-wide risk aversion as highlighted by the JPMorgan forecast , can negatively impact their top line. This makes Robinhood’s crypto revenue particularly sensitive to the ebbs and flows of the broader cryptocurrency market sentiment and activity. Challenges and Opportunities for Robinhood’s Crypto Business The volatility inherent in crypto trading volume presents both challenges and opportunities for Robinhood. The primary challenge is the unpredictable nature of a significant revenue stream. Relying heavily on trading fees means revenue can surge during bull markets but contract sharply during downturns or periods of low volatility and high risk aversion, precisely the scenario described by the JPMorgan forecast for Q1. To mitigate this challenge and build a more resilient business, Robinhood has been actively working to diversify its crypto offerings beyond simple buying and selling. These efforts represent key opportunities for growth and stability: Expanding Token Listings: Adding more cryptocurrencies to the platform can attract new users and increase trading options for existing ones. Offering Crypto Wallets: Providing users with self-custody options allows them to move assets off the platform, increasing trust and utility. Introducing Staking Services: Allowing users to earn passive income by staking certain cryptocurrencies can generate new revenue streams and keep assets on the platform longer. Educational Resources: Providing information and tools to help users understand the cryptocurrency market can encourage informed participation. While these initiatives are crucial for long-term growth and reducing reliance on volatile trading fees, the Q1 crypto revenue is still heavily influenced by the core trading activity, making forecasts like JPMorgan’s particularly relevant for near-term performance expectations. What Does This JPMorgan Forecast Mean for Investors? For investors looking at Robinhood stock (HOOD) or participating in the cryptocurrency market via the platform, the JPMorgan forecast serves as a useful data point. It suggests that the first quarter might show a dip in one of Robinhood’s key growth areas, which could potentially impact their earnings report for the period. However, it’s important for investors to look beyond a single quarter’s projection. They should consider: Overall Business Health: How are Robinhood’s other segments (stocks, options, Gold subscriptions) performing? Long-Term Strategy: Are the diversification efforts mentioned above gaining traction? Market Cycles: Cryptocurrency markets are cyclical. A dip in volume in one quarter doesn’t preclude a rebound later if market sentiment improves. Analyst Consensus: Is JPMorgan’s forecast an outlier, or do other analysts share a similar view on Robinhood crypto trading ? For users of the platform, the forecast primarily reflects the broader market environment. A decrease in overall crypto trading volume across platforms is often correlated with less dramatic price movements or periods of consolidation, which can influence individual trading strategies. Conclusion: Navigating the Currents of Crypto Trading Revenue The JPMorgan forecast for Robinhood’s Q1 crypto trading revenue highlights the inherent volatility and sensitivity of this business line to broader market sentiment. The projected drop from $71 billion in Q4 2023 to around $52 billion in Q1 2024 underscores the impact of increased risk aversion offsetting earlier positive trends in the cryptocurrency market . While this likely points to a softer quarter for Q1 crypto revenue specifically, it also reinforces the importance of Robinhood’s strategic efforts to diversify its offerings and build a more stable financial model less dependent on the sometimes-whimsical nature of trading volume. For investors and market watchers, this forecast serves as a reminder that even amidst long-term growth potential, the path of cryptocurrency adoption and trading activity will likely continue to see fluctuations influenced by global economic conditions and investor psychology.

43965652,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153850,1745973653,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Base Network Takes Monumental Leap Towards Full Decentralization,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/base-network-decentralization-leap/,"Big news is brewing in the world of Layer 2 networks! Coinbase’s Base network , a prominent player in the Ethereum scaling space, has just taken a significant step forward on its path towards full blockchain decentralization. This move is more than just a technical upgrade; it signals a maturing ecosystem and a commitment to the core principles of web3. Understanding the Evolution of Base Network When Coinbase first launched Base, it was designed as an optimistic rollup built on the OP Stack, aiming to provide a low-cost, secure, and developer-friendly environment for building decentralized applications. As a Layer 2 network, its primary goal is to alleviate congestion and high transaction fees on the Ethereum mainnet (Layer 1) by processing transactions off-chain and then posting bundled transaction data back to Ethereum. Initially, like many new rollups, Base operated in what’s often referred to as a ‘training wheels’ or ‘phase 0’ state. In this initial phase, certain security and upgrade mechanisms are often centralized to ensure stability and the ability to quickly fix critical bugs in a nascent system. While necessary for rapid development and deployment, this phase is inherently less decentralized, relying heavily on the core team (in this case, primarily Coinbase) for critical decisions and security oversight. The recent announcement, reported by CoinDesk, is that Base has transitioned to a ‘phase 1’ rollup. This is a crucial milestone on the rollup decntralization roadmap defined by teams like Optimism (on whose stack Base is built) and recognized within the broader Ethereum community. It represents a move away from some of that initial centralization towards a more distributed control structure. What Does Becoming a Phase 1 Rollup Actually Mean for Coinbase Base? The shift to phase 1 signifies that the network has implemented specific technical and governance changes that reduce reliance on a single entity. According to Tom Vieira, Base’s head of product, a key element of this transition is the introduction of a Security Council . Think of the Security Council as a multi-signature (multisig) body. Instead of a single entity having control over critical functions like pausing the network or initiating emergency upgrades, these powers are now distributed among a group of independent entities. These entities are chosen from within the Base ecosystem, aiming to represent a diverse set of stakeholders rather than just Coinbase itself. Here’s a breakdown of what this typically entails for a phase 1 rollup: Multi-signature Control: Critical operations (like upgrades or emergency pauses) require agreement from a supermajority of the Security Council members, not just the core team. Reduced Upgrade Risk: While upgrades might still be relatively fast compared to Layer 1 governance, the multisig introduces a check on the core team’s power, reducing the risk of a malicious or faulty upgrade being pushed unilaterally. Emergency Response: The council can act swiftly in emergencies (e.g., a major bug or exploit) to protect user funds or network integrity, but this power is now shared. Increased Transparency (Potential): The operations requiring the multisig are often public on the Layer 1 chain, adding a layer of transparency. This is a significant step towards genuine blockchain decentralization because it distributes control over potentially harmful actions. It’s not full decentralization yet (that’s phase 2, which involves permissionless fraud proofs), but it’s a critical intermediate stage that builds trust and resilience. Why is This Step Important for the Base Network? This transition brings several key benefits: Enhanced Security Posture: By requiring multiple independent parties to sign off on critical actions, the network becomes more resistant to attacks or errors originating from a single point of failure (like a compromised core team key). Increased Trust and Credibility: Moving away from centralized control demonstrates a commitment to decentralization principles, which is vital for attracting users, developers, and institutional adoption in the crypto space. Community Involvement (Indirect): While the council members are selected, they represent broader ecosystem interests, giving the community more confidence that decisions are not solely made by Coinbase. Pathway to Phase 2: Phase 1 is a necessary stepping stone towards achieving Phase 2 decentralization, where the network relies on permissionless fraud proofs (or validity proofs for ZK rollups) executed by anyone, not just a privileged set of validators or a security council, to ensure correct state transitions. Alignment with Ethereum’s Vision: This aligns Base more closely with Ethereum’s long-term vision of a highly scalable ecosystem built on decentralized and secure Layer 2 solutions. This move makes the Coinbase Base ecosystem more robust and less reliant on the central exchange itself for core security functions. Potential Challenges or Considerations While highly positive, the phase 1 transition isn’t without its nuances: Security Council Composition: The selection process and independence of the council members are crucial. Ensuring they truly represent diverse interests and are technically capable is key. Emergency Speed vs. Decentralization: While the multisig adds security, it can potentially slow down emergency responses compared to a single entity having immediate control. Not Fully Permissionless: Phase 1 still relies on a designated group (the council) for certain security overrides. True permissionless security comes in Phase 2 with open participation in fraud proving. Technical Complexity: Implementing and managing the multisig and the associated governance processes adds technical overhead. These aren’t necessarily drawbacks but important aspects to monitor as the network continues its decentralization journey. The effectiveness of the Security Council will largely depend on its members and operational transparency. Comparing Decentralization Approaches: Base vs. Others It’s useful to look at how other prominent Layer 2 networks are approaching decentralization. Arbitrum and Optimism, also optimistic rollups, have been on similar paths. Optimism, the base layer for Base, has its own multi-signature setup and is also working towards the next phases of decentralization, involving fault proofs. Arbitrum has also implemented decentralized governance and is progressing through its own stages. Base’s move to phase 1, leveraging the OP Stack’s defined stages, shows a clear commitment to following a recognized path towards greater security and decentralization within the optimistic rollup paradigm. While the specifics of Security Council composition and operation may vary slightly between networks, the underlying principle of distributing critical control is consistent among maturing Layer 2 solutions. This progress across multiple major Layer 2 network implementations is a positive sign for the scalability and security of the entire Ethereum ecosystem. Actionable Insights for Users and Developers What does this mean for you if you use or build on Base? For Users: This transition increases the security and resilience of the network you’re using. While direct interaction with the Security Council isn’t typical for users, their presence means critical safety mechanisms are now under distributed control, not just Coinbase’s. Continue to use Base with increased confidence in its long-term security roadmap. For Developers: Building on Base becomes even more attractive as its underlying infrastructure matures and moves towards greater decentralization. This reduces platform risk associated with a single point of control. Stay informed about potential future protocol upgrades managed by the Security Council. For Ecosystem Participants: Keep an eye on how the Security Council is formed and operates. Transparency in this process is key to building community trust. Opportunities might arise in the future for ecosystem participants to contribute to or monitor these decentralized governance structures. This step reinforces Base’s position as a serious and maturing player in the blockchain space, built on a foundation aiming for true decentralization. What’s Next? The Road to Full Decentralization (Phase 2) Phase 1 is a crucial stop, but the journey doesn’t end here. The ultimate goal for optimistic rollups like Base is to reach Phase 2. This phase is characterized by the implementation of permissionless fraud proofs (or fault proofs). In Phase 2, anyone can run a node and submit a fraud proof to Ethereum if they detect an invalid state transition (a dishonest rollup block). The system then automatically verifies this proof on Layer 1, penalizes the sequencer that submitted the invalid block, and corrects the state. This removes the reliance on a trusted Security Council or any specific set of validators for the core security guarantee; the network’s security is then rooted directly in Ethereum’s consensus and cryptography, enforced by open participation. Achieving Phase 2 is a complex technical challenge, particularly implementing robust and efficient fraud proving systems. Base, leveraging the work done on the OP Stack (like Optimism’s fault proofs), is on a clear path towards this goal. This final step will solidify Base’s status as a truly decentralized Layer 2 network, inheriting the full security of Ethereum without relying on centralized overrides. A Monumental Step for Blockchain Decentralization Coinbase’s Base network moving to a phase 1 rollup is a significant and highly positive development. It demonstrates a clear commitment to shedding centralized control mechanisms necessary in the early stages and embracing a more decentralized architecture. The introduction of a Security Council composed of independent ecosystem entities distributes critical power and enhances the network’s resilience and trustworthiness. While the journey to full, permissionless decentralization (Phase 2) is still ongoing and presents its own technical hurdles, this phase 1 transition is a vital milestone. It signals the growing maturity of the Base ecosystem and its alignment with the broader vision of scalable, secure, and decentralized blockchain technology. For users and developers, it means building and transacting on a network that is progressively becoming more robust and community-aligned. This step solidifies Base’s position as a key Layer 2 network driving innovation and adoption in the decentralized web.

A large inflow of Bitcoin into Coinbase Institutional could indicate preparation for custody, trading, or other services utilized by big players. Cumberland: A subsidiary of DRW, a global principal trading firm. Cumberland is one of the leading liquidity providers in the cryptocurrency space, specializing in large, over-the-counter (OTC) block trades. OTC desks facilitate direct peer-to-peer trading of large crypto volumes, bypassing public exchanges, which helps minimize price impact. When Cumberland moves a large amount of BTC, it’s often related to fulfilling a client order or managing their own inventory related to large trades. Why Institutional Investment in Bitcoin Matters The flow of large sums of Bitcoin into institutional platforms like Coinbase Institutional is a significant indicator of the growing interest and participation of traditional finance in the crypto market. Here’s why this matters: Validation: Increased institutional activity lends credibility and maturity to the asset class. Capital Influx: Institutions manage vast amounts of capital, and their allocation into Bitcoin can significantly impact market size and liquidity. Market Structure: Institutional platforms often operate differently from retail exchanges, and large flows here can signal different types of market pressure (e.g., long-term holding vs. short-term trading). Adoption Trend: Consistent large transfers point towards an ongoing trend of institutional adoption, moving beyond early adopters to more mainstream financial entities. This particular transfer could be a result of an institution buying a large block of Bitcoin through Cumberland’s OTC desk and then transferring it to their custodial account at Coinbase Institutional. Tracking a Whale Transfer : What Can We Learn? Tracking whale movements, while not a crystal ball, provides valuable insights into potential market dynamics. A large whale transfer to an institutional platform could signal: Accumulation: An institution has acquired a large amount of BTC and is moving it into secure custody. Preparation for Sale: Less likely if moving to custody, but possible if moving to a trading account. However, OTC desks like Cumberland often handle the sale side too, so a move *from* Cumberland to an exchange could also signal a sale preparation. This move *to* Coinbase Institutional is more indicative of accumulation or secure holding. Internal Reorganization: The institution might be moving funds between their own accounts for various operational or strategic reasons. ETF Activity: With the advent of Bitcoin ETFs, large movements to or from institutional custodians could be related to the creation or redemption process of these funds. While we can’t know the exact reason for this specific 2,930 BTC transfer without more information, the destination (Coinbase Institutional) strongly suggests it’s related to significant institutional activity, likely involving accumulation or secure storage following a large purchase, potentially facilitated by Cumberland . The Role of Cumberland in Large OTC Deals Cumberland acts as a critical bridge between traditional finance and the crypto market for large-volume trades. Their involvement in this transfer underscores their role as a key liquidity provider. When an institution wants to buy or sell a large amount of Bitcoin without impacting the price on public exchanges, they often turn to OTC desks like Cumberland. This transfer could represent the delivery of BTC from Cumberland’s inventory (or from a seller they sourced) to the buying institution’s account at Coinbase Institutional. Such transfers highlight the ‘dark pool’ nature of large OTC trades – the public only sees the movement of funds *after* the trade has been agreed upon and executed, often providing a delayed signal of significant market interest or pressure. Actionable Insights for Observers For those watching the market, keeping an eye on significant whale movements, especially those involving institutional platforms and major OTC desks, can be insightful. While one transfer doesn’t dictate the market direction, a pattern of large inflows into institutional custodians over time can be a bullish signal, indicating sustained institutional demand. Conversely, large outflows might suggest distribution. It’s important to remember that these are just signals, not guarantees. Market prices are influenced by a multitude of factors, and individual whale movements are just one piece of the puzzle. Conclusion The transfer of 2,930 BTC from Cumberland to Coinbase Institutional is a notable event, underscoring the continued and significant participation of large financial entities in the Bitcoin market. It highlights the roles of key players like Cumberland as OTC facilitators and Coinbase Institutional as a gateway for institutional adoption. While the precise reason for this specific transaction remains private, its nature strongly suggests it’s tied to substantial institutional investment or activity, adding another data point to the narrative of Bitcoin’s increasing integration into the traditional financial system.

Among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is now gaining momentum, offering a much sharper growth profile compared to others like ADA and Polygon (MATIC). Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance is rapidly positioning itself as a must-watch DeFi platform, built for real-world lending and borrowing while offering passive income through its mtTokens. With flexible interest rates, upcoming real-world asset integrations, and a buy-and-distribute model favoring long-term holders, the foundation for sustainable growth is clear. The presale is advancing fast, having already raised over $7.3 million with more than 9,300 holders onboard. More than 431 million tokens have already been sold, with the 4th presale phase now over 51% complete. Currently priced at $0.025, the next phase will push the price to $0.03, while the official launch is set at $0.06 — representing a 140% surge from today’s entry. With a strong real-world utility plan, passive income features, and the anticipated launch of its DeFi platform, analysts expect MUTM to approach $2 by the close of 2025. In a market searching for the best crypto to invest in, Mutuum Finance is quickly emerging as a clear favorite. With a $2,000 investment at today’s presale rate of $0.025, you’d be holding 80,000 MUTM tokens in your portfolio. When MUTM reaches $2 as projected, those same tokens would be worth $160,000 — delivering an astonishing 80x return. Cardano (ADA) Cardano (ADA) continues to maintain a strong presence among leading cryptocurrencies, trading around $0.72. The project is recognized for its research-first approach and commitment to building a scalable blockchain ecosystem. Over the last 24 hours, ADA has climbed +3.20%, while its 7-day performance shows a +12.41% gain. Cardano, backed by a market cap of $25.5 billion and a circulating supply of 35.3 billion ADA, continues to hold strong influence in the market, though its growth is unfolding at a more measured pace. Analysts expect ADA to approach $0.83 by the end of May 2025. Sentiment around Cardano is bullish, but the Fear & Greed Index positions it at a neutral level (54), indicating that investors expect gradual progress rather than immediate surges. Polygon (MATIC) Polygon (MATIC) serves as a major scaling solution for Ethereum, helping speed up transactions and lower costs across decentralized applications. Trading currently around $0.24, MATIC has seen a 23.03% gain over the past seven days, despite a minor -1.39% slip in the last 24 hours. With a market capitalization of $415 million and a circulating supply of 1.73 billion MATIC, the project holds a significant role within the crypto ecosystem. MATIC’s sentiment is currently neutral, and the Fear & Greed Index ranks it at 65 (Greed). An oversold RSI (~25) points to potential for a technical rebound in the near future, though major breakouts are not the immediate expectation. Why MUTM Is Leading the New Cryptocurrency Race While ADA and MATIC continue their slow but steady climbs, Mutuum Finance is pushing forward with fresh momentum, real-world solutions, and a presale that is gaining serious traction. The upcoming dashboard launch and a $100K giveaway further strengthen its appeal to early adopters. With its presale still open and excitement growing, MUTM stands out as the clear answer for investors asking what crypto to buy now. With the potential for a major surge, Mutuum Finance is increasingly seen as the next big crypto poised for breakout gains in 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) isn’t just keeping pace with other leading projects under $1 — it’s outpacing them with stronger fundamentals, a rapidly growing community, and clear upside potential. For anyone looking for the best cryptocurrency to invest in today, MUTM is a name to watch closely.

The analyst’s chart compresses seven years of ADA/USD history into one pane and shows that – despite a 45 % retracement from the late-2024 peak – the coin has not violated the rising dashed trend-line that has connected every cycle low since the 2020 Covid panic. Cardano Price Ready For Liftoff? In fact, the most recent dip stopped inside a long-standing demand band that now stretches from roughly $0.57 to $0.78 and immediately printed a textbook higher low (HL) while never closing a week beneath that dynamic support. Price action is again trading above the 50-week exponential moving average, currently near $0.66, after reclaiming it with two decisive green candles. Back in March 2024 the same moving average acted as a springboard for a vertical breakout that carried ADA to a higher high (HH) just shy of $1.31 – the top of the dotted, upward-sloping channel that has contained every impulsive rally since 2020. Because the upper channel boundary now lies close to $1.50, Maelius argues that a clean break of the demand zone could unleash enough momentum to retest that ceiling. Related Reading: Cardano Price Set For 300% Explosion With Major Bullish Impulse Momentum gauges back the thesis but have not yet flashed full confirmation. The weekly relative-strength index sits at 49 and has been squeezing into a falling wedge since the March high; it is carving a sequence of higher lows that mirrors price, yet the down-sloping resistance line – drawn from the HH reading near 82 – still caps any advance. The Wave-Trend Oscillator tells a similar story: it produced a glaring bearish divergence at the 2024 top, bled into oversold territory around −50, and is only now curling upward, with the fast and slow curves on the verge of a bullish cross. “ADA looks dope, or is just me?! Would like to see RSI breakout w/ decisive move on WTO to get super-confident, but price will be higher when (and if) we get it,” Maelius wrote when he released the chart. In other words, momentum confirmation may lag behind price, as it did in previous cycle accelerations during 2020 and 2023. Related Reading: Cardano Sets Voting Record: Nearly 100% Of 4.6 Billion ADA Cast Via Delegates From a pure market-structure perspective, ADA remains in an unbroken sequence of higher highs and higher lows on the weekly chart, the prevailing down-trend line from the 2021 record high was breached more than a year ago, and the recent correction resembles nothing more sinister than a throw-back to new support. As long as weekly candles respect the lower edge of the grey demand block (~$0.57) and the multi-year rising trend-line, the path of least resistance points north – with the next confluence of resistance stacked near $0.81 (the March-2024 swing high) as well as the December 2024 high at $1.31 and the upper channel wall around $1.50. Should the RSI pierce the 60 level and the Wave-Trend Oscillator confirm with a bullish cross, Maelius contends that the market will already be trading at materially higher prices, validating his conviction that a fresh surge is only a matter of time. At press time, ADA traded at $0.709.

43966245,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153853,1745974846,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Dogecoin ETF: Crucial SEC Decision on Bitwise Spot Application Delayed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-dogecoin-etf/,"The world of cryptocurrency is always buzzing, and regulatory decisions often sit at the heart of market movements and investor sentiment. A recent development has caught the attention of the crypto community, particularly those interested in meme coins and institutional adoption: the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has once again postponed its decision regarding Bitwise’s application for a spot Dogecoin ETF . This news, initially reported by Golden Finance, adds another layer of anticipation and uncertainty to the path for a Spot Crypto ETF focused on the popular meme coin. The Latest on the SEC Dogecoin ETF Delay Regulatory reviews for cryptocurrency products, especially ETFs, are known for being thorough and often lengthy. The SEC’s decision to delay on the Bitwise ETF for Dogecoin follows a pattern seen with previous applications for Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs. While the delay itself isn’t entirely unexpected given the novelty and unique characteristics of Dogecoin compared to Bitcoin or Ethereum, it certainly keeps market participants waiting. What does this delay signify? Essentially, the SEC is taking more time to evaluate the application. This could be due to various factors: Complex Asset: Dogecoin started as a meme but has evolved. The SEC needs to understand its market structure, potential for manipulation, and whether it fits within their regulatory framework for investment products. Investor Protection: A primary goal of the SEC is protecting investors. They will scrutinize how a Dogecoin ETF would be structured to ensure it mitigates risks associated with the asset’s volatility and unique community-driven nature. Setting Precedent: Approving a spot Dogecoin ETF could set a precedent for other altcoin ETFs. The SEC is likely treading carefully, considering the implications for future applications. Understanding the Spot Crypto ETF Landscape Before diving deeper into the specifics of Dogecoin, let’s quickly recap what a spot crypto ETF is and why it’s a big deal. A spot ETF holds the underlying asset directly – in this case, actual Dogecoin. This is different from a futures ETF, which holds contracts speculating on the future price of the asset. Spot ETFs are often preferred by investors because: They provide direct exposure to the asset’s current price movements. They are typically more accessible and familiar investment vehicles for traditional investors. They can simplify the process of investing in crypto by handling custody and security issues for the investor. The approval of several Bitcoin spot ETFs earlier this year, followed by progress on Ethereum spot ETFs, signaled a significant shift in the U.S. regulatory stance towards crypto investment products. This paved the way for firms like Bitwise to apply for ETFs based on other cryptocurrencies, including Dogecoin. Why a Dogecoin ETF Matters Dogecoin, born from an internet meme in 2013, has grown into one of the most recognizable cryptocurrencies globally. Despite its whimsical origins, it boasts a large and active community, has seen significant price swings, and has even garnered attention from prominent figures like Elon Musk. The prospect of a spot Dogecoin ETF is significant for several reasons: Increased Accessibility: A DOGE ETF would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to Dogecoin through regulated brokerage accounts, without needing to navigate crypto exchanges, wallets, or private keys. Institutional Interest: An ETF structure could attract institutional investors who are currently unable or unwilling to directly hold volatile cryptocurrencies like DOGE. Perceived Legitimacy: Regulatory approval from the SEC would lend a significant degree of legitimacy to Dogecoin as an investable asset class in the eyes of mainstream finance. Potential for Liquidity: A successful ETF could increase trading volume and liquidity for DOGE. However, the challenges are equally apparent. Dogecoin’s price is famously volatile and often influenced by social media trends rather than fundamental developments. This inherent characteristic is likely a major point of focus for the SEC’s review. What This Delay Means for Bitwise ETF and the Market For Bitwise, a firm that has been at the forefront of crypto asset management and successfully launched one of the first U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, this delay is part of the standard regulatory process but extends the timeline for potentially bringing a new product to market. Bitwise, like other applicants, must address the SEC’s concerns and provide sufficient information regarding market surveillance, custody arrangements, and other critical factors. For the broader market, the delay on the Bitwise ETF for Dogecoin reinforces that the path for altcoin ETFs will likely be deliberate and cautious. While Bitcoin and Ethereum may have cleared significant hurdles, each subsequent asset will be evaluated on its own merits and risks. This process could set a precedent for how the SEC approaches other meme coins or less established cryptocurrencies in the future. Potential Impact on DOGE Price Market reactions to ETF news are often speculative. The initial news of the delay might lead to a neutral or slightly negative sentiment among traders hoping for a quick approval catalyst. However, the fact that the application is still under review, rather than being rejected, could be viewed positively by those who remain optimistic about future approval. The DOGE price is influenced by a multitude of factors, including overall crypto market sentiment, social media trends, development updates (like progress on Dogecoin scaling or utility), and macroeconomic conditions. While ETF approval is seen as a potential long-term bullish catalyst due to increased demand and accessibility, the delay itself is unlikely to cause a dramatic, sustained price movement in isolation. Traders and investors should consider the broader market context and Dogecoin’s unique volatility profile. Actionable Insight: For those tracking the DOGE price , regulatory updates like this are important data points, but they are just one piece of the puzzle. Avoid making impulsive decisions based solely on delay news. Consider your long-term investment strategy and risk tolerance. Looking Ahead: The Path to Approval (or Rejection) With the delay announced, the SEC will set a new deadline for its decision. This period allows for further dialogue between Bitwise and the regulator. Bitwise will likely provide additional information or clarify aspects of their proposal to address the SEC’s concerns. The outcome remains uncertain. While the approval of Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs provides a hopeful framework, Dogecoin presents unique challenges due to its origins and market dynamics. The SEC could approve the ETF, request further delays, or ultimately deny the application if they believe it doesn’t meet the necessary standards for investor protection and market integrity. Key factors the SEC is likely considering include: Market Surveillance: Can Bitwise and its partners demonstrate sufficient mechanisms to detect and prevent market manipulation in the underlying DOGE market? Custody: Are the proposed methods for securely storing the underlying Dogecoin robust and compliant? Valuation: Is there a reliable and transparent method for pricing the DOGE held by the ETF? Conclusion: Waiting Game Continues for the Dogecoin ETF The SEC’s decision to delay the Bitwise spot Dogecoin ETF application is a significant moment for the Dogecoin community and the broader crypto market. It underscores the cautious approach regulators are taking towards approving investment products for assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum. While the delay means a longer waiting period, it also signifies that the application is still actively under review, keeping the possibility of a spot DOGE ETF alive. The coming months will be crucial in determining whether Dogecoin can clear the regulatory hurdles necessary to become accessible through a traditional ETF structure, potentially impacting the DOGE price and its standing in the financial world.

43966563,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153854,1745975442,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,"Urgent: SEC Delays Franklin Spot XRP ETF Decision, What Happens Now?",https://bitcoinworld.co.in/sec-delays-xrp-etf/,"Crypto markets are always buzzing with anticipation, especially when it comes to regulatory milestones. The latest news sending ripples through the community is the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) decision to delay its ruling on the Franklin spot XRP ETF application. This move, initially reported by Golden Finance, is a standard part of the SEC’s review process, but it underscores the ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, particularly XRP. What Does the SEC Delay on the Spot XRP ETF Mean? When an asset manager like Franklin Templeton files for a Spot XRP ETF , it triggers a formal review process by the SEC. This process involves several stages, including public comment periods and potential delays. A delay, in this context, doesn’t necessarily signal an impending rejection. Instead, it typically means the SEC requires more time to review the application thoroughly, consider public comments, and assess the market and regulatory landscape surrounding the proposed product. For the proposed Spot XRP ETF , the SEC’s delay extends the review period, pushing back the deadline for a final decision. This extra time allows the commission to delve deeper into the unique aspects of an XRP-based product, especially given the history of regulatory scrutiny around the digital asset. Understanding the Journey to XRP ETF Approval The path to XRP ETF approval in the United States has been complex, largely due to the ongoing legal battle between the SEC and Ripple Labs, the company associated with the XRP ledger. The SEC has argued that XRP is an unregistered security, a claim that Ripple has disputed vigorously in court. While there have been partial court rulings providing some clarity on XRP’s status in certain contexts (like programmatic sales), the overall regulatory picture remains somewhat cloudy compared to assets like Bitcoin. The success of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in 2024 set a precedent and fueled optimism for other crypto assets, including Ethereum and potentially XRP. However, each asset presents unique challenges. For XRP ETF approval , the SEC must be satisfied that the underlying market is resistant to manipulation and that offering an ETF aligns with investor protection mandates. The outcome of the Ripple lawsuit is a significant factor hanging over any decision regarding XRP financial products. The Role of Franklin Templeton in the Spot XRP ETF Race Franklin Templeton is a major global investment firm with a long history in traditional finance. Their application for a Franklin Templeton XRP ETF adds significant weight and credibility to the pursuit of a spot XRP product. Large, reputable financial institutions entering the crypto space through ETF applications signal growing institutional interest and potentially pave the way for broader adoption among retail and institutional investors who prefer regulated, familiar investment vehicles. Their involvement in seeking a Spot XRP ETF highlights the perceived demand and potential market opportunity for such a product, despite the existing regulatory hurdles. Franklin Templeton’s experience navigating regulatory environments in traditional finance is a valuable asset in this process. Why the SEC Decision on XRP Matters The final SEC decision XRP related to a spot ETF is highly anticipated for several reasons: Regulatory Clarity: An approval could signal increased regulatory comfort with XRP as an investable asset, potentially influencing its classification and treatment globally. Institutional Adoption: A spot ETF provides a straightforward, regulated way for large institutions and traditional investors to gain exposure to XRP without directly holding the asset. Market Liquidity and Price: Increased demand from ETF inflows could boost XRP’s liquidity and potentially impact its market price positively. Investor Access: Retail investors could access XRP exposure through brokerage accounts, simplifying the investment process compared to using cryptocurrency exchanges. Conversely, a rejection or prolonged uncertainty from the SEC decision XRP could reinforce regulatory concerns and temper enthusiasm for XRP in the short term. Potential Benefits and Challenges of an Approved Spot XRP ETF Launching a Spot XRP ETF comes with potential upsides and significant challenges: Benefits: Accessibility: Makes investing in XRP easier for traditional investors via standard brokerage accounts. Liquidity: Increases trading volume and market depth for XRP. Institutional Capital: Opens the door for large funds and institutions to invest. Price Discovery: Could lead to more efficient price discovery as arbitrage opportunities between the ETF and the underlying asset arise. Legitimacy: An SEC-approved product could lend further legitimacy to XRP as an asset class. Challenges: Regulatory Risk: The primary hurdle remains the SEC’s stance on XRP’s security status, tied to the Ripple lawsuit outcome. Market Manipulation Concerns: The SEC scrutinizes the underlying market’s resistance to manipulation. Volatility: XRP, like other cryptocurrencies, is highly volatile, posing risks for ETF investors. Custody Issues: Securely holding the underlying XRP presents operational challenges for the ETF provider. What’s Next for the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF? The SEC’s delay on the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF application means the review process continues. The commission will now use the extended period to gather more information, potentially engage in further discussions with Franklin Templeton, and closely monitor developments, including the ongoing legal proceedings involving Ripple. There will be a new deadline set for the next step, which could be another delay, a decision, or the initiation of further proceedings. Market participants will be closely watching for further announcements from the SEC and any updates regarding the Ripple lawsuit, as both are critical factors influencing the fate of the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF and potentially other similar applications in the future. Navigating the Path Forward: Actionable Insights For investors and enthusiasts following the potential for a Spot XRP ETF , here are some actionable insights: Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from the SEC and updates on the Ripple lawsuit. Avoid relying solely on rumors or speculation. Understand the Risks: Remember that a delay or even eventual approval does not eliminate the inherent volatility and risks associated with cryptocurrency investments, including XRP. Diversify: Do not place all your investment hopes on a single asset or regulatory outcome. A diversified portfolio is key. Evaluate Your Investment Goals: Consider whether an ETF structure aligns with your investment strategy compared to direct ownership of XRP. The process for crypto ETFs in the U.S. is still evolving, and each asset faces its own set of challenges and opportunities. Conclusion The SEC’s decision to delay the ruling on the Franklin spot XRP ETF is a predictable step in a lengthy and complex regulatory process. While it postpones immediate clarity, it keeps the possibility of a spot XRP ETF alive. The outcome hinges significantly on ongoing regulatory discussions and the resolution of legal matters surrounding XRP. The involvement of major players like Franklin Templeton underscores the growing institutional interest in bringing crypto assets into traditional investment structures. As the SEC takes more time for its SEC decision XRP related, the crypto community watches eagerly, understanding that the path to broader adoption is paved with regulatory milestones like this one.

A recent development suggests a significant shift in the legal challenges facing a prominent crypto privacy tool. Reports indicate that the New York AG might be considering a pivotal move regarding the Samourai Wallet lawsuit, potentially impacting the broader landscape of DOJ Crypto enforcement and the use of cryptocurrency mixing services. What Sparked the Samourai Wallet Crypto Lawsuit? Before diving into the latest news, it’s important to understand the origins of the legal troubles for Samourai Wallet. The core of the issue stems from allegations that the service facilitated illegal activities. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) took significant action against the platform and its founders, Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill. The DOJ’s charges were serious, alleging that Samourai Wallet operated as an unlicensed money transmitting business and engaged in money laundering. Specifically, the DOJ claimed that the service processed over $100 million in criminal proceeds. This wasn’t just a minor regulatory slap on the wrist; it involved federal criminal charges, highlighting the government’s focus on illicit finance within the crypto space. The allegations centered on the wallet’s primary function: enhancing transaction privacy. While privacy is a sought-after feature in the crypto world, tools like Samourai Wallet’s coin mixing capabilities can be used to obscure the origin and destination of funds, making them attractive to cybercriminals, fraudsters, and other illicit actors. The DOJ argued that the founders not only knew this but actively promoted the service as a way to bypass regulations and law enforcement scrutiny. Key points from the initial DOJ action included: Charges against co-founders Keonne Rodriguez and William Lonergan Hill. Allegations of operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. Claims of facilitating over $100 million in criminal proceeds. Focus on the platform’s privacy features, particularly its mixing capabilities. This initial action sent ripples through the crypto community, particularly among those who prioritize financial privacy and view such services as essential tools rather than instruments of crime. It underscored the ongoing tension between technological innovation aimed at privacy and regulatory efforts to combat illicit finance. Is the New York AG Really Changing Course? Now, the plot thickens. Recent reports, notably from CoinDesk, suggest that the New York AG ‘s office is considering a different path than the one initially pursued by the DOJ. While the DOJ’s federal case proceeds, the state-level action from New York appears to be under review for potential withdrawal. This development is significant because it could indicate a divergence in legal strategies or priorities between state and federal authorities regarding cryptocurrency mixing services and their operators. The exact reasons behind the New York AG’s potential reconsideration are not fully clear from the reports, but possibilities include: Coordination with the ongoing federal DOJ case: The AG’s office might decide that the federal prosecution is sufficient and a parallel state case is redundant or complicates matters. Legal or evidentiary challenges: Perhaps the state’s case faces unique legal hurdles or lacks specific evidence required for a state-level conviction that differs from the federal standard. Resource allocation: The AG’s office might prioritize other cases, deciding to focus resources elsewhere while the DOJ handles the Samourai matter federally. Jurisdictional considerations: There could be complexities regarding the jurisdiction of the state charges versus the federal charges, especially concerning the nature of the alleged crimes and where they occurred. It’s crucial to remember that ‘considering dropping’ is not the same as ‘has dropped.’ The situation remains fluid, and the AG’s office has not made a final public announcement. However, the mere consideration is noteworthy and suggests a potential softening or strategic shift in the state’s approach compared to the federal government’s stance on this particular crypto lawsuit . What Does This Mean for DOJ Crypto Enforcement? While the New York AG’s potential move doesn’t directly halt the federal case brought by the DOJ Crypto unit, it could have indirect implications. Federal prosecutors often collaborate with state law enforcement. A state deciding to step back from a parallel case might signal potential complexities or a lack of complete alignment in strategy, although this is speculative. The DOJ has made it clear that cracking down on the use of cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes is a high priority. Cases against mixers and other privacy-enhancing tools are central to this effort. The Samourai Wallet case, alongside actions against other services like Tornado Cash, demonstrates the DOJ’s resolve to pursue operators they believe are facilitating criminal activity, regardless of the technology involved. This situation highlights the layered nature of cryptocurrency regulation and enforcement in the United States, involving multiple federal agencies (DOJ, Treasury, SEC, etc.) and state-level authorities like the New York AG . Different jurisdictions may have slightly different interpretations of laws like money transmitting regulations when applied to novel technologies like crypto wallets and mixers. Challenges in DOJ Crypto enforcement often include: Tracing funds through complex blockchain transactions, especially when mixing services are used. Applying existing financial regulations (like those for money transmitters) to decentralized or pseudo-anonymous technologies. Establishing intent and knowledge on the part of the service operators regarding illicit use. Navigating international aspects, as crypto services often operate globally. The Samourai Wallet case is a test case for many of these challenges. How it ultimately concludes, both at the federal and potentially state level, will likely set precedents for future actions against similar services and impact the broader landscape of crypto lawsuit s. Understanding Cryptocurrency Mixing: Why Is It Controversial? At the heart of the Samourai Wallet case and many other regulatory actions is the concept of cryptocurrency mixing . But what exactly is it, and why does it attract so much scrutiny from regulators and law enforcement? Cryptocurrency mixing , also known as tumbling, is a service that aims to break the link between a user’s cryptocurrency address and the addresses they send funds to. It works by pooling funds from many users and then redistributing them in a way that makes it difficult to trace the original source of the coins sent to a recipient. Here’s a simplified breakdown of how it generally works: Step Action Outcome 1 User sends coins to the mixer’s pool. Coins are added to a large pool of other users’ coins. 2 Mixer holds the coins for a period. Adds time delay to obscure the transaction path. 3 Mixer sends back equivalent value (minus fee) to new addresses provided by the user. User receives ‘clean’ coins from the pool, not their original ones. 4 The coins sent to the recipient come from the mixed pool. Difficult for observers to link the recipient’s coins back to the original sender’s deposit. For users in oppressive regimes, whistleblowers, or simply individuals who value financial privacy and don’t want their transactions publicly visible on a blockchain, mixers can be a legitimate tool. However, because they obscure the flow of funds, they are also heavily utilized by criminals seeking to launder illicit gains from hacking, ransomware, drug trafficking, and other illegal activities. Regulators and law enforcement agencies argue that operators of mixing services, especially centralized ones, have an obligation to implement anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures, just like traditional financial institutions. When they fail to do so, or worse, actively market their services to avoid detection, authorities view them as facilitating crime. The debate is complex: Is the technology inherently illegal, or is it the *use* of the technology for illegal purposes that is the problem? And where does the responsibility lie – with the user or the service provider? The Samourai Wallet case, and the differing approaches from the New York AG and the DOJ, underscore the ongoing legal and ethical challenges surrounding these tools. What are the Potential Outcomes and Future Challenges? The potential decision by the New York AG to drop the state-level crypto lawsuit against Samourai Wallet founders introduces several possibilities and highlights future challenges for the crypto space. Potential Outcomes: Focus shifts entirely to the federal case: If the AG drops the state charges, the legal battle for Rodriguez and Hill will be solely against the DOJ. This could simplify the defense’s strategy but still leaves them facing serious federal charges. Setting a precedent for state vs. federal roles: The AG’s decision, whatever it is, could offer insight into how state regulators view their role when federal authorities are already pursuing similar cases against crypto entities. Impact on other privacy tools: The outcome of the overall Samourai case, both federal and state (or lack thereof), will likely influence how other developers and users of privacy-enhancing crypto tools are viewed and potentially regulated. Future Challenges: Regulatory Clarity: The differing approaches from the AG and DOJ highlight the urgent need for clearer regulatory frameworks regarding cryptocurrency mixing and other privacy technologies. What constitutes a legal privacy tool versus an unlicensed money transmitter or money laundering facilitator? Balancing Privacy and Compliance: Developers face the challenge of building tools that offer users desired privacy features while simultaneously complying with stringent AML/KYC regulations aimed at preventing illicit use. This is a difficult tightrope walk. Global Coordination: Cryptocurrency operates globally, but regulations are often national or even sub-national. Effective enforcement and regulation require international cooperation, which is complex and often slow. Technological Evolution: As regulators develop methods to trace crypto transactions, developers create new privacy techniques, leading to a continuous technological arms race between privacy tools and surveillance capabilities. For users, the actionable insight is to stay informed about the legal status of the services they use, especially those related to privacy or mixing. While privacy is a valid concern, using services deemed illegal by authorities can expose users to significant risks, including asset forfeiture or criminal charges, particularly if the funds involved are linked to illicit activities. Understanding the risks associated with cryptocurrency mixing is paramount. Conclusion: A Turning Point for Samourai Wallet and Crypto Regulation? The news that the New York AG is reportedly considering dropping the state-level crypto lawsuit against the founders of Samourai Wallet marks a potentially significant moment in this ongoing legal saga. While the federal charges brought by the DOJ Crypto unit for alleged money laundering and operating an unlicensed business remain, a withdrawal of state charges could signal a shift in strategy or focus among regulators. This situation underscores the complex and often conflicting approaches taken by different governmental bodies when dealing with novel technologies like cryptocurrency mixing . It highlights the challenges authorities face in applying existing laws to decentralized or privacy-focused tools and the ongoing debate about balancing financial privacy with the need to combat illicit finance. The ultimate outcome of the Samourai Wallet case will likely have lasting implications for how crypto privacy tools are regulated and perceived. It serves as a stark reminder for both developers and users of the regulatory risks inherent in the cryptocurrency space, particularly concerning services that touch upon anonymity and fund flows. As this story develops, the crypto community will be watching closely to see if the New York AG indeed drops the case and, more importantly, how the federal prosecution against the founders of Samourai Wallet proceeds. The resolution of this case will provide valuable insights into the future direction of DOJ Crypto enforcement and the legal status of privacy-enhancing technologies in the digital asset world.

In a bold twist, the company will accept payments in cryptocurrency for condos in its new $1 billion project, Trump Tower Dubai. The modernist community on the site of an airport in the futuristic development is scheduled to start construction in 2025 and will take about five years to build. Eric Trump, one of the sons of U.S. President Donald Trump, who is also the Executive Vice President of the Trump Organization, recently announced that the tower will be welcoming Bitcoin and other digital currencies for property purchases. “This is going to be the first large-scale project that takes Bitcoin to buy units,” Eric said. “That’s exciting because I love that world and believe in cryptocurrency.” So far, there is no list of accepted cryptocurrencies, but it is clear only condominium units (not hotel rooms) can be bought with crypto. The condos are expected to be ultra-luxe, costing anywhere from $1 million to $20 million. At the top, there will be penthouses, each expected to fetch $20 million. But, while they make substantial use of crypto, there are no plans for tokenized real estate or blockchain ownership tracking. The new payment alternative will be cryptocurrency, but a real estate model will not emerge. Dar Global joins Trump in Dubai tower deal The Trump family has teamed up again with Dar Global, a London-listed real estate developer that has carved out a name for its luxury projects in the Middle East. This partnership is not new—the two have worked together on Trump-branded developments in Oman and Saudi Arabia. Ziad El Chaar, the CEO of Dar Global, said that the upcoming Trump Tower Dubai is among the most ambitious Trump-branded residential towers in the world. He noted that the statement reflects the project’s magnitude, stature, and symbolic significance in the region and internationally. This further remark is a testament to their ever-increasing belief in Dubai’s capacity as a real estate hub and a leader in innovation around the burgeoning blockchain industry. The Trump Tower Dubai will have an ultra-luxury hotel offering the highest international standards for ultra-high-net-worth travelers and long-stay residents. A members-only clubhouse will further enhance this, The Trump Private, providing members with a dedicated space to network and enjoy private social events. The ultra-luxury condos form the project’s core and feature design excellence, futuristic technology, and all-encompassing vistas of Dubai’s skyline. While Trump Tower Dubai’s location hasn’t been revealed, reports say it will stand in a major part of the fast-growing city. Finer details of the site, architecture, and interior will be released by the end of 2025. Construction will start in late 2025, and the development is anticipated to be fully built by 2030. Upon completion, Trump Tower Dubai is set to revolutionize luxury living in the city and mark a milestone in the era of cryptocurrency and real estate luxury. Crypto buyers flock to Dubai’s booming market Dubai is part of the world’s fastest-growing luxury property market. Dubai is also an emergent cryptocurrency center, attracting blockchain companies, investors, and tech leaders. That makes it a perfect fit for a crypto-centric luxury project like Trump Tower Dubai. Accepting crypto payments falls into this category. It could help rewrite the rules on how high-end real estate is bought and sold internationally. Eric Trump is also scheduled to appear at TOKEN2049, one of the biggest crypto conferences in Dubai. There, he can market the project to crypto investors and fans.

In an April 29 X post, tech commentator Jacob Canfield shared a scam letter sent to his home via post that appeared to be from Ledger claiming he needed to immediately perform a “critical security update” on his device. The letter, which uses Ledger’s logo, business address, and a reference number to feign legitimacy, asks to scan a QR code and enter the wallet’s private recovery phrase under the guise of validating the device. The letter threatens that “failure to complete this mandatory validation process may result in restricted access to your wallet and funds.” Source: Jacob Canfield A seed phrase, or recovery phrase, is a string of up to 24 words that unlocks access to a crypto wallet. A scammer with the phrase can access and control the associated wallet to transfer its holdings elsewhere. Earlier this month, the X account of a crypto hardware wallet reseller said it had also received multiple reports of Ledger users receiving a similar letter. In response to Canfield’s post, Ledger said the letter is a scam and cautioned its device users to stay vigilant against phishing attempts . Related: Ledger wallet user reports 10 BTC loss — Community blames phishing “Ledger will never call, DM [direct message], or ask for your 24-word recovery phrase. If someone does, it's a scam,” it added. “Please don't engage with accounts claiming to be Ledger employees or anyone offering to help recover funds.” Unclear whether connected to the Ledger’s data leak Canfield suggested that scammers were sending letters to Ledger customers whose data was leaked nearly five years ago. In July 2020, a hacker breached Ledger’s database and dumped the personal information of more than 270,000 of its customers online, which included names, phone numbers and home addresses The following year, several Ledger users claimed to have been mailed fake Ledger devices that were tampered with and designed to install malware upon use, Bleeping Computer reported at the time.

43967732,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153924,1745977849,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Donald Trump’s Market Focus: Shocking Claim by Commerce Secretary Lutnick,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/donald-trump-market-focus/,"In a surprising turn of events reported via the Walter Bloomberg account on X, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has reportedly stated that former President Donald Trump is not focused on the US Markets . This claim, coming from a high-ranking economic official, raises significant questions about potential future economic approaches and their implications for investors and the broader financial landscape, including areas like the cryptocurrency market which often reacts to macro-economic signals and political rhetoric. Why Does a President’s Market Focus Matter? Understanding a president’s approach to financial markets and Economic Policy is crucial because presidential actions, statements, and priorities can directly and indirectly influence market sentiment, regulatory environments, and overall economic stability. When a figure like the Commerce Secretary suggests a lack of Market Focus , it prompts speculation: Does this mean a different set of priorities will guide economic decisions? Could it lead to less predictable policy interventions or a hands-off approach? How might this perception of focus (or lack thereof) impact investor confidence, both domestically and internationally? Historically, presidential administrations have often paid close attention to market performance, viewing it as a barometer of economic health and a reflection of their policies’ success. Therefore, a statement suggesting a departure from this traditional focus is noteworthy. Exploring the Claim: What Could ‘Not Focused’ Mean? The exact meaning behind Secretary Lutnick’s reported statement that Donald Trump is ‘not focused on the markets’ is open to interpretation. It could imply several things: Prioritizing Other Areas: Perhaps Trump’s current or future economic agenda places greater emphasis on areas like trade negotiations, specific industry support, or regulatory reform, with less direct attention paid to the day-to-day fluctuations of stock indices or bond yields. A Different Economic Philosophy: It might suggest a belief that markets are best left to operate with minimal presidential commentary or intervention, a contrast to periods where presidential tweets or speeches directly addressed market movements. Focus on Underlying Economy: The focus might be more on fundamental economic factors like job creation, GDP growth, or inflation control, assuming that healthy fundamentals will naturally support strong markets, rather than focusing on market levels themselves. Without further context from Secretary Lutnick or clarification from Trump’s camp, the statement remains a subject of significant discussion among economic analysts and political observers. It’s one of those Presidential Statements that can spark considerable debate and analysis. Potential Implications for US Markets and Beyond A perceived lack of direct presidential Market Focus could have various implications for the US Markets : Increased Uncertainty: Markets often prefer clear communication and predictable policy frameworks. If investors perceive that market stability is not a primary concern, it could introduce a layer of uncertainty, potentially leading to increased volatility. Policy Surprises: Decisions related to trade, regulation, or fiscal spending might be made with less consideration for their immediate market reaction, potentially leading to unexpected market movements. Shift in Administration Communication: It could signal a change in how an administration communicates with the public and investors regarding economic matters, potentially relying less on market performance as a key metric of success. For the cryptocurrency market, which is already influenced by a complex mix of technological developments, regulatory news, and traditional market sentiment, increased uncertainty in the traditional US Markets could contribute to volatility. Some investors might view crypto as a hedge against traditional market instability, while others might see it as an asset class that could suffer during periods of broad economic uncertainty. How Have Past Presidential Statements Impacted Markets? History shows that Presidential Statements can indeed move markets. During his previous term, Donald Trump’s tweets and remarks on trade, interest rates, and specific companies were often followed by noticeable market reactions. This highlights the power of the presidential platform and why Secretary Lutnick’s comment about Trump’s current Market Focus is being discussed. Consider the impact of statements on: Trade negotiations (e.g., tariffs on China) Federal Reserve policy Specific industry regulations These examples underscore why market participants pay close attention to the President’s priorities and communication style regarding the economy and financial systems. Challenges and Considerations for Investors Secretary Lutnick’s reported statement presents a potential challenge for investors who rely on clear signals from policymakers. Here are some considerations: Navigating Uncertainty: Investors may need to prepare for potentially less predictable market reactions to future policy announcements if market impact is not a primary consideration in decision-making. Focus on Fundamentals: The emphasis might shift further towards analyzing the underlying fundamentals of companies and sectors, as well as broader economic indicators, rather than trying to anticipate market-specific political interventions. Diversification: In times of potential policy-driven volatility, diversification across different asset classes, including potentially uncorrelated assets, becomes even more important. Staying Informed: Paying close attention to official statements, policy proposals, and the interpretations from trusted economic analysts will be key to understanding the potential impact on the US Markets . Understanding the nuances of an administration’s approach to Economic Policy is vital for making informed investment decisions. Connecting the Dots: Economic Policy, Markets, and Crypto While Secretary Lutnick’s comment is directly about Donald Trump and the traditional US Markets , it exists within a larger economic context that absolutely impacts the crypto world. Macroeconomic conditions, interest rates, inflation, and regulatory approaches to finance all influence investor behavior and capital flows, which in turn affect the cryptocurrency market. If a future administration’s Economic Policy leads to significant shifts in inflation or interest rates, or if their regulatory philosophy towards finance evolves (which could include views on digital assets), these changes would undoubtedly ripple through the crypto market. A perceived lack of Market Focus in the traditional sense doesn’t necessarily mean a lack of focus on the broader economy or specific sectors relevant to crypto. Therefore, for crypto investors, this statement serves as a reminder to look beyond just crypto-specific news and understand the broader macroeconomic and political landscape. Presidential Statements , even those seemingly unrelated to digital assets, can contribute to the overall climate of risk tolerance and investment strategy. Summary: Interpreting the Signals U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick’s reported remark that Donald Trump is ‘not focused on the markets’ is a significant piece of information for anyone observing U.S. Economic Policy and the potential direction of the US Markets . While brief, this statement from a key official highlights the potential for a different approach to the relationship between the presidency and financial markets compared to traditional norms or even Trump’s own past interactions. Understanding the potential implications of this perceived lack of Market Focus – from increased uncertainty to a shift in policy priorities – is crucial for investors navigating the current and future economic climate. As always, staying informed about official statements, analyzing potential policy impacts, and maintaining a diversified strategy remain key principles for approaching both traditional and cryptocurrency markets in an environment influenced by such significant Presidential Statements .

The meme coin, which is now trading at $0.17, has recorded a 10% gain in the last week and continues to be up 11% over a 14-day period. Related Reading: XRP Headed For $1,000 – CryptoGuard Exec Drops Bold Prediction Bullish Divergence Indicates Possible Upswing Based on Crypto Bio’s analysis, two separate bullish divergence patterns have emerged on Dogecoin’s chart. The first was seen between June and August 2024, when prices fell to between $0.07 and $0.09 while the Relative Strength Index (RSI) made higher lows. It was followed by a large-scale rally that saw DOGE rise above $0.40 by December 2024. Another pattern with a similar scenario has been developed between the periods of March and April 2025. Although Dogecoin’s value printed lower lows near $0.1300, the RSI once more produced higher lows. Based on such technical features, certain experts anticipate that DOGE might find itself at $0.5 over the coming two or three months. The Math Behind ‘Dogecoin Millionaires’ There are discussions about new ‘Dogecoin millionaires’ that have excited investors. The figures, though, paint a more serious picture. Assuming a price of $0.5, a $10,000 investment would become around $27,530 – a gain of $17,530. $DOGE is waking up. The same signs, the same setup. Millionaires will be made in the next 2-3 months!🔥#DOGECOIN 🚀🚀 pic.twitter.com/mKQjjglJiO — Crypto Bio (@CryptoBio_) April 27, 2025 In order to actually become a millionaire if DOGE reaches $0.5, an investor would need to have around 2 million coins, currently valued at around $360,000. According to Crypto Bio, given all these figures and probabilities, “millionaires will be made in the next two to three months.” This reality check underscores the vast amount of money required to meet the ‘millionaire’ goal that is utilized to recruit prospective investors in the cryptocurrency. Technical Support From Parabolic Trendline Another analyst, “abermix,” notes that Dogecoin is presently riding a long-term parabolic trendline that started around $0.05 during 2022-2023. Although there were numerous tries to fall below this curve at different price levels ($0.06, $0.08, and $0.14), DOGE has repeatedly jumped back to hold ground above the line. $doge is conforming to this parabolic trendline at the moment idk if it’s valid but it looks like it xD can we expect a bounce soon?#Dogecoin pic.twitter.com/moQHd7WCpt — abermix (@abermixcrypto) April 27, 2025 Related Reading: Justin Sun Bets Big On JUST Token – Here’s Why He Sees 100x Potential The price is trading slightly below both short-term and long-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) currently. Experts believe that a breakout above $0.20 will validate a larger trend reversal and open the doors for further advances. Falling Wedge Formation Adds To Bullish Outlook According to April 25 reports, Dogecoin has extricated itself from a “falling wedge” formation that had placed it in a downtrend for many months. Previous levels of resistance were tested in February at $0.28 and April at $0.16. Market observers comment that although these technical indicators look encouraging, cryptocurrency prices are extremely volatile. The present price movement comes after several months of horizontal trading following DOGE’s peak at $0.19, and any investment choice should account for the volatility of the market.

A recent analysis from Fidelity Digital Assets suggests this might be the case, offering a glimmer of hope for investors watching the Ethereum Price navigate challenging market conditions. Fidelity, a major player in traditional finance increasingly active in the crypto space, released a report highlighting signals that Ethereum (ETH) could be potentially undervalued. This assessment isn’t based on simple price action but dives into the underlying health and activity of the network itself, leveraging sophisticated Crypto On-Chain Metrics. What Does the Fidelity Ethereum Report Tell Us? The core of the latest Fidelity Ethereum Report points to specific on-chain data indicators that historically correlate with market bottoms or periods of significant undervaluation. Despite a notable 45% drop in Ethereum’s price during the first quarter of 2025, these metrics paint a different picture of the network’s fundamental state. Fidelity specifically cited metrics such as the MVRV Z-Score and the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio. Let’s break down briefly what these mean and why they matter: MVRV Z-Score: This metric compares Ethereum’s market capitalization (the total value of all ETH coins) to its realized capitalization (the sum of the prices at which each ETH was last moved). The Z-score normalizes this data. Low Z-scores often indicate that the market value has fallen significantly below the ‘fair value’ based on when coins were last transacted, historically signaling potential buying opportunities or market capitulation. NUPL Ratio: This metric calculates the overall profit or loss status of the Ethereum network’s investors. It’s the difference between market cap and realized cap, divided by market cap. A low or negative NUPL suggests that a large portion of the network’s investors are holding ETH at a loss, another sign often associated with market capitulation and potential bottoms as weaker hands sell off. According to the Cointelegraph report on Fidelity’s findings, these metrics are currently showing signs indicative of market capitulation, a phase where investors who bought at higher prices finally give up and sell, often marking the tail end of a bear trend. Beyond Price: The Strength of Ethereum Layer 2 While the spot Ethereum Price has faced headwinds, the Fidelity report doesn’t ignore the underlying activity. In fact, it highlights a critical counter-trend: the booming activity on Ethereum Layer 2 networks. Layer 2 solutions, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, and Polygon (in its zkEVM form), are built on top of the main Ethereum blockchain to increase transaction speed and reduce costs. Their health and activity are strong indicators of real-world adoption and demand for the Ethereum ecosystem. Fidelity’s report noted that Layer 2 network activity hit a record 13.6 million active addresses during the same period the price was falling. This is a significant figure and suggests: Growing User Adoption: More users are actively engaging with decentralized applications (dApps) and services built within the Ethereum ecosystem, preferring the scalability and lower fees offered by Layer 2s. Network Utility: Despite price volatility, the fundamental utility and demand for interacting with Ethereum-based protocols remain high. Future Potential: The growth of Layer 2s is crucial for Ethereum’s long-term scalability vision, indicating a healthy expansion of its user base and potential for future growth, which could eventually be reflected in the Ethereum Price. This divergence between price performance and network activity is a key element in the argument that ETH may be Undervalued from a fundamental perspective. So, Is ETH Undervalued Right Now? Based on the Fidelity Ethereum Report , the on-chain signals like low MVRV Z-Score and NUPL ratios strongly suggest that the market is currently in a phase historically associated with undervaluation and capitulation. The robust activity on Ethereum Layer 2 networks further supports the idea that underlying demand and adoption are strong, despite the price dip. However, Fidelity’s stance is one of cautious optimism. While the signals are compelling, the report also includes a crucial warning: past market trends show that even after capitulation signals appear, further price declines are still possible before a definitive recovery takes hold. Markets can remain irrational longer than investors might expect. This means that while the fundamental picture looks increasingly strong, the short-term Ethereum Price remains subject to broader market sentiment, macroeconomic factors, and potential further sell-offs. Actionable Insights for Investors What can investors take away from this Fidelity Ethereum Report and the current market situation? Look Beyond Price: Don’t solely focus on the daily or weekly price charts. Pay attention to fundamental metrics like Crypto On-Chain Metrics and network activity, especially on Ethereum Layer 2 networks. These provide deeper insights into the network’s health and adoption. Understand Capitulation: Recognize that capitulation phases can be painful but historically precede periods of recovery. While challenging emotionally, these times can present opportunities for long-term investors if the underlying fundamentals remain strong. Long-Term Perspective: The record Layer 2 activity is a bullish signal for Ethereum’s future. It demonstrates that the ecosystem is growing and adapting, building scalable infrastructure that will be essential for mass adoption. This long-term growth potential is key when assessing if ETH is Undervalued. Risk Management: Fidelity’s caution is warranted. Market timing is difficult. Consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging to build a position over time, mitigating the risk of investing a lump sum right before a potential further dip. Conclusion: A Complex Picture for Ethereum The latest Fidelity Ethereum Report presents a compelling argument that, from a fundamental perspective, the market may be significantly undervaluing ETH. The signals from key Crypto On-Chain Metrics point towards a capitulation phase, while the surging activity on Ethereum Layer 2 networks underscores robust and growing adoption. However, the report wisely balances this optimism with a reminder that historical patterns suggest volatility and potential further downside cannot be ruled out in the short term. For investors, this paints a complex but potentially opportunistic picture: fundamental strength meets short-term market uncertainty. Ultimately, the question of whether ETH is Undervalued depends on your investment horizon and tolerance for risk. But insights from institutions like Fidelity, combined with objective on-chain data, provide valuable tools for navigating the volatile world of crypto and assessing the true potential of the Ethereum Price.

43968620,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153888,1745979610,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Crucial SEC Decision on Grayscale Spot ETH ETF Staking Postponed,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/grayscale-eth-etf-postponed/,"The cryptocurrency market is once again watching the regulators closely. A significant development has emerged from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), impacting the potential launch of a new investment product that many investors are eagerly anticipating. The SEC has officially postponed its decision regarding Grayscale Investments’ proposal for a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund ( Spot ETH ETF ) that includes a feature allowing for the staking of the underlying Ethereum (ETH) held by the fund. Understanding the SEC ‘s Latest Move on Grayscale ‘s Proposal This recent postponement by the SEC concerns the application filed by Grayscale , a prominent crypto asset management firm. Grayscale is seeking approval to convert its Ethereum Trust (ETHE) into a spot Ethereum ETF . What makes this particular application stand out is the inclusion of a staking component. This means the fund would not only hold ETH directly (spot) but would also engage in Crypto Staking using a portion of that ETH to earn yield. The decision deadline was extended, pushing back the timeline for potential approval or disapproval. This is not an uncommon move by the SEC when reviewing complex or novel financial products, especially those involving cryptocurrencies, which the regulator often views with caution. Here’s a quick breakdown of what’s involved: Applicant: Grayscale Investments Product Proposed: Spot Ethereum ETF with a staking feature Underlying Asset: Ethereum (ETH) Regulator: U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Latest Action: Decision Postponed Why is a Spot ETH ETF Significant? A Spot ETH ETF would allow investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum without directly buying and holding the cryptocurrency themselves. This simplifies access, potentially attracts traditional investors, and integrates crypto into existing brokerage accounts and retirement funds. The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier this year demonstrated the significant market demand and potential impact of such products. For many, a Spot ETH ETF is seen as the next logical step following Bitcoin ETF approvals. It could open up substantial capital inflows into the Ethereum ecosystem, similar to what was observed with Bitcoin. The Unique Angle: Including Crypto Staking The staking feature proposed by Grayscale adds a layer of complexity and novelty to their Ethereum ETF application. Crypto Staking is a process specific to proof-of-stake blockchains like Ethereum, where participants lock up their cryptocurrency to support the network’s operations and earn rewards in return. Including this in an ETF would mean the fund could potentially generate additional returns for investors beyond just the appreciation of ETH’s price. This aspect is likely a key reason for the SEC ‘s careful deliberation. Regulators are still navigating how to classify and oversee various aspects of the crypto market. The income generated from staking could be viewed differently from capital gains, potentially raising questions about fund structure, investor protection, and compliance with existing securities laws. What Does the SEC Decision Postponement Mean for the Market? The postponement of the SEC decision creates continued uncertainty in the market regarding the timeline for potential Ethereum ETF approvals. While delays are common, they can temper enthusiasm and lead to price volatility as traders react to the news. It suggests the SEC is taking its time to thoroughly evaluate the proposal, particularly the innovative staking component. This decision impacts not only Grayscale but also other firms that have filed for spot Ethereum ETF s. The SEC ‘s approach to Grayscale ‘s application, especially concerning staking, could set a precedent for how other similar applications are handled. Key implications include: Extended Uncertainty: Investors and the market must wait longer for clarity on the future of spot ETH ETFs in the U.S. Regulatory Scrutiny: The staking feature is clearly under intense review by the SEC. Potential Precedent: The outcome of this decision could influence the structure of other proposed ETH ETFs. Market Reaction: The news might contribute to cautious sentiment around Ethereum and related assets in the short term. Challenges and Regulatory Hurdles The path to getting crypto ETFs approved in the U.S. has been a long one, marked by numerous delays and rejections before the spot Bitcoin ETFs finally received the green light. The SEC has historically expressed concerns about market manipulation, investor protection, and the nascent nature of crypto markets. For Ethereum ETF s, additional questions arise regarding Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake and the regulatory implications of staking activities. The SEC has previously suggested that certain staking services might constitute securities, adding another layer of complexity to applications that include this feature. Actionable Insights: What to Watch For Investors and market observers should keep a close eye on future deadlines set by the SEC for Grayscale ‘s application and others. Pay attention to any commentary or statements from SEC officials that might shed light on their specific concerns regarding staking or the Ethereum market itself. The outcome of this and other Ethereum ETF applications will be a significant indicator of the regulatory trajectory for crypto investment products in the U.S. Summary: Waiting Game Continues for Grayscale ‘s Staked Ethereum ETF In conclusion, the SEC ‘s decision to postpone its ruling on Grayscale ‘s proposed spot Ethereum ETF , particularly one incorporating Crypto Staking , highlights the ongoing regulatory caution surrounding novel crypto investment products. While delays are common, this specific postponement underscores the complexity introduced by the staking component and the SEC ‘s detailed review process. The market awaits further clarity, with the outcome having potential implications for the broader adoption and accessibility of Ethereum as an investment asset in traditional finance.

There are currently 427 crypto exchanges registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), but the agency said on April 29 that it suspects a significant number are inactive and possibly vulnerable to being bought and co-opted by criminals . The agency is contacting any so-called digital currency exchanges (DCEs) that appear to no longer be trading, and AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas said they’ll be told to “use it or lose it.” “Businesses registered with AUSTRAC are required to keep their details up to date; this includes details about services that are no longer provided,” he added. AUSTRAC CEO Brendan Thomas says scammers can use inactive crypto firms to appear legitimate. Source: AUSTRAC Businesses wanting to offer Australians conversions between cash and crypto, including crypto ATM providers, must first register with AUSTRAC, which monitors for crimes including money laundering, terror financing and tax evasion. The agency can cancel a registration if it has reasonable grounds to believe the business is no longer active or offering crypto-related services. Ten firms have had their AUSTRAC registration canceled since 2019, with the most recent being FTX Express in June 2024 , the local subsidiary of the collapsed crypto exchange FTX. AUSTRAC to launch public list of registered exchanges Following its blitz on inactive crypto exchanges, AUSTRAC said it will publish a list of registered exchanges to help Australians verify legitimate providers. Thomas said the goal is to make it harder for criminals to scam people and improve the integrity and accuracy of AUSTRAC's register. “If a DCE does intend to offer a service, they need to contact us otherwise we will cancel the registration and this information will be added to the register,” he said. “Members of the public should feel confident that they can identify legitimate cryptocurrency providers that are registered and subject to regulatory oversight and that we are driving criminals out of this industry,” Thomas added. Related: Australia’s top court sides with Block Earner, dismisses ASIC appeal In February, the Anti-Money Laundering regulator took action against 13 remittance service providers and crypto exchanges, with over 50 others still being investigated regarding possible compliance issues. Six providers were refused registration renewal on the grounds that key personnel were either convicted, prosecuted, or charged with a serious offense. Australia has yet to pass crypto regulations. In August 2022, the ruling center-left Labor Party initiated a series of industry consultations to draft a crypto regulatory framework . In March, the government proposed a new crypto framework regulating exchanges under existing financial services laws ahead of a federal election slated for May 3.

While established players like Solana (SOL) maintain strong momentum, emerging networks like Optimism (OP), SEI, and MAGACOIN FINANCE are quickly becoming focal points for tactical investors seeking strategic exposure. Which project is best positioned to lead the next major market cycle? Here’s how these contenders are shaping up. Solana (SOL): Consolidation Before a Bigger Move? Solana is holding strong at $148.69 as it gains 7.99% for the past week. The trading volume increased 64.13%, showing a strong return of interest in the network, which dominates DeFi, NFTs, etc. Community sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish, with 85% of votes favoring continued upside. Traders see that SOL coin is currently consolidating just below the critical $150 psychological level. If prices can stay above this level, it could open the door to further gains but, given competitive Layer-1s, volatility is a possibility. Optimism (OP): Layer-2 Strength Meets Long-Term Vision Optimism (OP) is trading at $0.7817, up 7.02% this week. OP has benefited from an increase in Ethereum Layer-2 adoption, while there has been a 20% increase in volume activity in the last 24 hours which suggests the investor base is strengthening. Although Optimism is not a Layer-1 (it is built on top of the Ethereum), unlike Ethereum, its significance concerning scaling solutions means it is competing for throughput. The experts are evaluating the OP’s ability to sustainably move through the $0.85 to $0.90 resistance band. Whale activity suggests increasing confidence in its Layer-2 positioning as Ethereum’s roadmap progresses. SEI: Emerging Challenger with Growing Momentum SEI, priced at $0.2111, is one of the strongest performers among small projects, with a 16.17% 7-day gain. The trading volume has increased 115.23% showing growing interest among the investors. The interest in SEI’s optimized Layer-1 design focused on order book-based DEXs is growing. The network gains an edge in a growing space, thanks to its agility and ability to facilitate quick transactions. The overall sentiment in SEI is decidedly bullish, according to the report. MAGACOIN FINANCE: Strategic Early-Stage Positioning MAGACOIN FINANCE remains a standout for those targeting early-stage, asymmetric opportunities. Trading under $0.01 , it’s still largely undiscovered compared to SOL, OP, and SEI, yet it boasts a strong foundation built on scarcity-driven tokenomics, a community-first strategy, and no centralized exchange dilution. Top analysts highlight MAGACOIN FINANCE’s roadmap, which includes pre-listing positioning, staged growth models, and whale accumulation trends that mirror patterns seen before previous major crypto runs. With early access limited to direct purchase through magacoinfinance.com, investors view MAGACOIN FINANCE as a rare setup for significant upside without competing against entrenched institutional flows — at least for now. Final Takeaway Solana continues to offer resilience, Optimism is cementing itself as a critical Ethereum solution, and SEI is gaining ground fast. Yet for those seeking the sharper edge of early-stage opportunities, MAGACOIN FINANCE is emerging as a compelling candidate to lead the next layer-1 narrative into 2025. Positioning early could make all the difference as the next wave unfolds.

43968893,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153890,1745980208,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,USDT Minting: Massive 1 Billion Surge Reported by Tether Treasury,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/usdt-minting-tether-treasury/,"In the fast-paced world of digital assets, news travels quickly, and few events grab the attention of traders and investors quite like significant movements involving stablecoins. Recently, the cryptocurrency community buzzed with a report from Whale Alert indicating a massive USDT minting event: 1 billion USDT was created at the Tether Treasury . This isn’t just a number; it’s a development that carries potential implications for the entire crypto market . But what exactly does a mint of this size signify, and why does it matter for anyone involved in or watching the digital asset space? Let’s dive into the details and explore what this means for the liquidity, stability, and overall dynamics of the market. Understanding USDT: The King of Stablecoins Before we dissect the implications of a 1 billion USDT mint, it’s crucial to understand what USDT is and why it holds such a dominant position. USDT is a stablecoin issued by Tether Limited. Its primary goal is to maintain a stable value, typically pegged 1:1 with the US dollar. This stability makes it a crucial bridge between traditional fiat currency and volatile cryptocurrencies. Think of stablecoins as the reliable anchors in the often turbulent crypto seas. They allow traders to: Lock in profits without converting back to traditional currency. Move funds quickly and cheaply between exchanges. Participate in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Avoid the volatility of assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum during market downturns. Among stablecoins, USDT has historically held the largest market capitalization and trading volume, making it the most widely used stable asset in the crypto ecosystem. Why Does Tether Mint USDT? The Role of Demand The minting of new USDT isn’t a random event. According to Tether, new tokens are created in response to market demand. When individuals or institutions want to acquire large amounts of USDT – perhaps to deposit onto an exchange for trading or to use in DeFi applications – they typically purchase it directly from Tether or authorized partners. Tether then mints the corresponding amount of USDT and places it into circulation, supposedly backed by reserves. This process is intended to maintain the peg. If the price of USDT on exchanges rises slightly above $1 due to high demand, Tether can mint and sell new USDT, increasing supply and pushing the price back towards the peg. Conversely, if the price falls below $1, holders can redeem USDT with Tether for traditional currency, reducing supply and supporting the price. A mint of 1 billion USDT, as reported by Whale Alert at the Tether Treasury , suggests a significant anticipated or existing demand for USDT in the market. This could stem from various sources: Increased institutional interest in crypto. Retail investors entering or re-entering the market. Growing activity in DeFi protocols requiring stablecoins. Exchanges needing more liquidity to facilitate trading pairs. Decoding the Tether Treasury Whale Alert specifically noted that the 1 billion USDT was minted at the Tether Treasury . It’s important to understand what this signifies. The Tether Treasury acts somewhat like an internal holding account for Tether Limited. When USDT is minted, it’s often initially sent to this treasury address. Crucially, tokens in the Tether Treasury are not immediately considered to be in circulation in the broader market. They are essentially authorized but not yet distributed to exchanges or users. The movement of USDT from the Tether Treasury to exchanges or other wallets is the step that indicates the tokens are entering circulation and becoming available for trading and use. So, while the minting event itself signals Tether’s readiness to meet demand, the actual impact on market liquidity depends on when and where these tokens are moved from the treasury. Monitoring outflows from the Tether Treasury address provides further clues about where this new supply is heading and its potential market impact. What Does This Massive USDT Mint Signal for the Crypto Market? A 1 billion USDT mint is a substantial event and can be interpreted in several ways regarding the state and potential direction of the crypto market . 1. Increased Demand and Liquidity: The most direct interpretation is that there is significant demand for stablecoins, specifically USDT. This demand often comes from participants preparing to buy other cryptocurrencies. Increased USDT supply provides more liquidity, making it easier to execute large trades without causing significant price slippage. 2. Potential for Inflows into Risk Assets: While not a guarantee, large USDT mints are often seen as a precursor to capital potentially flowing into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins. Traders and institutions acquire USDT to have readily available capital to deploy when they see buying opportunities. 3. Market Sentiment Indicator: Some analysts view large stablecoin mints as a bullish signal, suggesting that significant capital is being positioned on the sidelines, ready to enter the market. Conversely, large redemptions or burns of stablecoins might indicate capital flowing out of the market. 4. Arbitrage Opportunities: Increased liquidity from new USDT supply can facilitate arbitrage strategies between different exchanges, helping to keep prices aligned across platforms. It’s vital to remember that minting is just one side of the coin. The true impact unfolds as these funds move from the Tether Treasury and are utilized in the market. Observing the destination of these funds (e.g., major exchanges) provides more concrete evidence of their intended use. Implications for the Stablecoin Ecosystem While USDT dominates, it exists within a growing ecosystem of stablecoin competitors like USDC, BUSD, DAI, etc. A large USDT mint reinforces its leading position but also highlights the overall growth in the demand for stable digital assets. The increasing reliance on stablecoins underscores several key trends: The maturation of the crypto market, requiring more sophisticated tools for hedging and trading. The expansion of DeFi, which heavily relies on stable assets for lending, borrowing, and yield farming. The potential for stablecoins to be used in traditional finance or cross-border payments, although regulatory hurdles remain significant. However, the dominance of one stablecoin issuer also raises questions about centralization and systemic risk, which we will touch upon later. Are There Concerns Around Large USDT Mints and Tether? Despite USDT’s utility and widespread adoption, Tether has faced scrutiny and controversy over the years. A large minting event inevitably brings these concerns back into the spotlight. 1. Reserve Transparency: The most persistent criticism revolves around the backing of USDT. Tether claims each USDT is backed by reserves, including cash, cash equivalents, and other assets. However, the exact composition and sufficiency of these reserves have been questioned, leading to regulatory actions and ongoing debate. 2. Centralization: Tether is a centralized entity. The power to mint or burn billions of dollars worth of tokens resides with a single company, which contrasts with the decentralized ethos of much of the crypto space. This centralization introduces potential counterparty risk and reliance on Tether’s management and compliance. 3. Market Influence: The ability to inject billions of dollars of liquidity into the market has led to accusations (though largely unsubstantiated or debated) that Tether could potentially influence crypto prices. While Tether maintains minting is demand-driven, the sheer volume of USDT in existence gives it significant weight. While a 1 billion USDT mint is a mechanical process tied to anticipated demand according to Tether, the context of these ongoing discussions is important for any market participant to consider. Actionable Insights for Navigating the Market For traders and investors, a significant USDT minting event offers several points to consider: Monitor Flows: Keep an eye on where the newly minted USDT from the Tether Treasury is sent. Movements to major exchanges could indicate potential buying pressure on other assets. Understand the Nuance: Remember that minting isn’t the same as circulation. The tokens are only liquid and market-impacting once they leave the treasury wallet. Assess Market Context: Consider the minting event alongside other market factors – overall sentiment, news headlines, technical indicators – rather than as an isolated signal. Diversify Stablecoin Risk: If you hold significant value in stablecoins, consider diversifying across different issuers (like USDC, DAI) to mitigate risks associated with a single entity, especially given the concerns surrounding Tether. Stay Informed: Follow official announcements from Tether and reputable crypto news sources to understand the reported reasons behind large mints and updates on reserve audits or regulatory matters. Historical Context: Past Minting Events Large USDT mints are not new. Over the years, as the crypto market has grown, minting events of hundreds of millions or even billions of USDT have occurred periodically. Often, these events have coincided with periods of increased market activity or anticipation. For example, significant mints were observed during the bull runs of 2017 and 2020-2021, correlating with surging demand for crypto assets. While correlation doesn’t equal causation, the historical pattern reinforces the idea that large mints are typically linked to periods where more stablecoin liquidity is needed to facilitate trading volume and capital flows within the ecosystem. The Growing Role of Stablecoins in the Future Regardless of the debates surrounding Tether, the role of the stablecoin in the digital economy is undeniable and likely to grow. They provide the necessary stability for various applications, from trading and lending to potentially everyday payments in the future. Regulatory bodies worldwide are increasingly focusing on stablecoins due to their potential systemic importance. Future regulations will likely shape how stablecoins are issued, backed, and used, potentially increasing transparency and oversight for issuers like Tether. The 1 billion USDT mint is a reminder of the scale at which stablecoins operate and their integral role in the current crypto financial infrastructure. It highlights the continuous flow of capital within the system and the mechanisms stablecoin issuers use to meet market demand. Conclusion: A Signal of Activity The report of 1 billion USDT being minted at the Tether Treasury is a significant data point for anyone tracking the crypto market . While the tokens aren’t immediately in circulation, the minting signals Tether’s anticipation of considerable demand for its stablecoin. This demand is often linked to participants positioning themselves for trading or investment activities within the ecosystem. Understanding the process of USDT minting , the function of the Tether Treasury, and the broader context of stablecoins provides valuable insight into the mechanics of the digital asset market. While concerns surrounding transparency and centralization persist, the utility and demand for USDT remain high, making events like this noteworthy indicators of potential shifts in market liquidity and activity.

43969779,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/?p=30438,1745981632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png,Why Arizona Might Not Become the First US State to Create a Bitcoin Reserve,https://www.cryptointelligence.co.uk/why-arizona-might-not-become-the-first-us-state-to-create-a-bitcoin-reserve/,"In a landmark move that could set a national precedent, Arizona lawmakers have passed two innovative bills designed to integrate Bitcoin and other digital assets into the state’s financial infrastructure. If signed into law, these measures would make Arizona the first U.S. state to establish a formal Bitcoin reserve. Two Key Bills Receive Legislative Approval The Arizona House of Representatives passed Senate Bill 1025 and Senate Bill 1373 , both of which are now on Governor Katie Hobbs’ desk awaiting final approval. SB 1025 enables the state to allocate up to 10% of its treasury and pension assets into digital assets, including Bitcoin. Meanwhile, SB 1373 lays the foundation for a Digital Assets Strategic Reserve Fund , designed to hold and manage these crypto assets for future use. Together, the bills represent a strategic pivot toward blockchain-based asset management, aligning Arizona with other crypto-forward states such as Texas, Florida, and New Hampshire. Funded by Seized Crypto and Future Appropriations The legislation authorizes the use of seized digital assets as well as future budget appropriations to fund the reserve. These assets will be managed under strict audit protocols, featuring on-chain transparency and risk controls to ensure responsible stewardship. Supporters argue that integrating Bitcoin into Arizona’s financial strategy could offer protection against inflation and traditional market volatility. The effort marks a bold step into crypto adoption at the state level—one that could ripple across the country if successful. Bitcoin Prices Surge Amid Legislative Buzz Shortly after the bills passed, Bitcoin’s price surged to nearly $95,000 , a 25% increase from early-April lows. The price jump appears to be driven by renewed institutional interest and speculation over state-level crypto integration. Crypto analysts view Arizona’s move as a confidence boost for broader adoption, potentially attracting similar initiatives elsewhere. If implemented, the state-backed reserve could serve as a blueprint for how governments can securely incorporate decentralized finance into their public asset strategies. Governor Hobbs’ Decision Looms Governor Hobbs has not yet taken a public position on the bills. Previously, she had threatened to veto all legislation over unresolved disability funding disputes.

Priced at just $0.007125 during its presale and having already raised over $19.6 million, Lightchain AI is turning heads with serious momentum. These days, investors are more immune to hype. Profitable market punters bet on projects with solid roadmaps, robust community support, and future-proof plans. SHIB falls flat in many of these categories, riding high on the waves of speculation. On the other hand, there’s Lightchain AI , building steady value from the ground up. When smart money traders are presented with both options, the correct option is immediately apparent. Why Lightchain AI Could Outshine Shiba Inu in 2025 Although Shiba Inu received its fair share of headlines during its viral ascent, 2025 is emerging as the year of investments with substance and long-term promise. And that’s where Lightchain AI comes in – a revolutionary platform that combines the best of artificial intelligence with blockchain. SHIB is a big beneficiary of community hype. However, that form of support is limited in scope. It doesn’t compare favorably with a project like Lightchain AI that enjoys multi-dimensional backing in the form of strong institutional support based on its real-world innovation. Based on a decentralized architecture, Lightchain AI is the platform to easily merge AI with your existing systems (if you like too, APIs, SDKs, developer resources, you see: there’s more than one)ん. This is an environment where creator can implement AI models, process tasks and construct sophisticated applications for a more smarter, more effective technological future. And far from marching to the tune, Lightchain AI is calling the shots – carving out a new era in decentralized intelligence. A future that isn’t just promising for investors who are hungry for growth and real innovation—it’s driven by Lightchain AI. Lightchain AI – Poised for Q2 2025 Lightchain AI is poised for a breakout in Q2 2025, driven by its intelligent architecture and inclusive innovation strategy. Its streamlined workflow and data flow systems efficiently distribute AI tasks across decentralized nodes, allowing for real-time processing and cryptographic verification of results. This ensures smooth, secure operations even at scale. A key differentiator is Lightchain AI’s focus on mitigating bias through federated learning, which trains models on diverse data sources without exposing sensitive information—promoting fairness and inclusivity. Additionally, its meme coin launchpad offers a unique, AI-enhanced space for launching creative, community-driven tokens in a secure, decentralized environment. Together, these elements position Lightchain AI as both a technical powerhouse and a dynamic hub for blockchain culture in 2025. How to Snag Your Lightchain AI (LCAI) Tokens Ready to join the AI revolution and snag some LCAI tokens before everyone else? Lucky you— Lightchain AI is in its exclusive presale phase, meaning you get first dibs at discounted rates before the public goes wild. Getting started is easier than explaining crypto to your grandma. First, set up a decentralized wallet like MetaMask or Trust Wallet (pro tip: make sure it’s set for the Ethereum network—ERC-20 is the vibe). Then, fuel up your wallet with some Ethereum (ETH), which you can grab from platforms like Coinbase or Binance. Now for the fun part; head over to the official Lightchain AI presale site. Connect your wallet (securely, of course), choose how you want to pay—ETH or USDT—and decide how many shiny LCAI tokens you want. Double-check everything, hit confirm, and voilà! Your tokens will land directly in your wallet faster than you can say, AI for the win. https://lightchain.ai https://lightchain.ai/lightchain-whitepaper.pdf Tweets by LightchainAI https://t.me/LightchainProtocol",Press Release,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|ETH|EXCHANGE|SHIB,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-30 03:00:00

The SEC delayed making a verdict on the Franklin Templeton-linked spot XRP ETF until June 17, 2025, according to a newly released notice . According to Eleanor Terrett, on April 29, 2025, the SEC released a notice that revealed it needed additional time to evaluate Franklin Templeton’s proposed spot XRP ETF, also known as the Franklin XRP Fund. The SEC delayed its verdict on the Franklin Templeton-linked spot XRP ETF until June 17, 2025. Source: SEC According to the documents, the financial watchdog has now extended the review period by an additional 45 days, postponing its decision until June 17, 2025. This is standard procedure, and even though it only added an extra 45 days, the SEC is allowed to extend the reviews by up to 240 days from the initial publication in the Federal Register. In essence, there could still be more pain on the way for impatient speculators. The application was originally filed on March 13 and published in the Federal Register on March 19. If approved, the ETF will track the spot price of XRP, with assets custodied by Coinbase Custody. Shares would trade on the Cboe BZX Exchange, and the fund’s net asset value will be determined with the CME CF XRP-Dollar Reference Rate. According to Eleanor Terrett, who spoke to ETF analyst James Seyffart, the dates listed in the notice are all “intermediate.” In fact, Seyffart believes the $XRP spot ETF could be approved by mid-October with a final decision deadline set for October 18. “It’s possible the SEC won’t take all that time to make its decision, but a lot will hinge on how actively they engage on the applications,” Terrett wrote on X. The SEC postpones decisions on other ETF applications The SEC delayed its decision on other ETF applications besides the Franklin Templeton XRP ETF. There are also other XRP ETF applications, including those from Grayscale, Canary Capital, Bitwise, WisdomTree, CoinShares, 21Shares, ProShares, and Volatility Shares, but none of them have been approved yet. Aside from the XRP ETF applications, the agency has also delayed making a decision on Bitwise’s DOGE ETF application until June 15. The SEC’s actions have triggered mixed reactions on social media with a majority unsure whether to get mad or remain optimistic about the ETFs. The agency is known for cautiously deliberating on crypto-related ETFs, as seen with the spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, which took years to approve. However, that was under the Gary Gensler administration. The SEC has come under new leadership with Paul Atkins, and many expect it to move more quickly and positively. There are now over 70 ETF proposals for altcoins like Solana, Litecoin, Hedera, and Dogecoin waiting for the SEC’s review. Not all will be approved but some, like the XRP ETF, have been deemed inevitable by people in the know. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

Resistance for SOL is at $150. Support for SOL/USD is at $140. The price analysis of Solana for April 28 shows that SOL tried and failed at crossing past the $150 level. The price is still trading at $149 but may retrace further. Solana price analysis 1-day chart: SOL fails to cross past $150 Solana showed significant bearish pressure on the daily chart, as the bulls could not climb past the $150 level, and the price has returned towards $148. The bulls still hold strong at the level but the exhaustion might cause SOL to retrace further. Solana price 1-day chart analysis : SOL rises back towards $150 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 61.66, showing room for further upwards movement across the daily charts. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) line crosses the signal line downwards, suggesting strong bullish momentum.

Solana price analysis: Bulls clawback above $140 as bullish momentum escalates From a technical perspective, the MACD shows declining bearish momentum at 0.14, with the indicator showing rising bearish momentum with recent candles.

The 4-hour chart reinforces this downward trend with a bearish crossover in the MACD and the RSI falling into unfavorable territory, signaling potential continued downward momentum as SOL retraces to $140.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-04-30 03:15:00

Larry Fink Says Tokenization Could Reshape Finance BlackRock’s recent move matches CEO Larry Fink’s recent remarks on how tokenization could change investing. In a recent letter to investors, Fink explained that tokenization could speed up transactions, remove delays, and quickly reinvest money back into the economy to help it grow. Fink also said that the main challenge with tokenized assets is the lack of proper identity checks. Once that is fixed, he thinks that the tokenised funds could become as familiar as ETFs.

PayPal disclosed the decision in a Tuesday filing , marking another high-profile crypto probe closed under President Donald Trump’s administration. It said that the SEC’s Division of Enforcement had issued a subpoena in Nov. 2023, requesting documents related to PYUSD. The company said that in Feb. 2025, the SEC informed them that the inquiry had been closed with no further action. Trump-Era SEC Scales Back Crackdown On Digital Assets The move comes as part of a broader shift at the SEC. Since Trump took office in Jan. 2025, the agency has scaled back its regulatory crackdown on digital asset firms. It has dropped or paused investigations and lawsuits against several major crypto companies, including Gemini , Coinbase, Ripple Labs and Uniswap Labs, among others. Enforcement actions against high-profile individuals such as Justin Sun and Hex founder Richard Heart have also been shelved . PayPal Gains Breathing Room As Regulatory Pressure Eases PayPal launched PYUSD in Aug. 2023 in partnership with Paxos Trust Company, a US-regulated entity. The stablecoin, backed 1:1 by the US dollar, is available to US users on PayPal and Venmo and can be transferred to external wallets, subject to compliance checks. PYUSD has earlier surpassed $1b in market cap , signaling strong demand and growing traction within the digital payments ecosystem, though its valuation has since declined. The closure of the SEC’s inquiry could boost confidence among institutional partners and retail users, especially as stablecoins remain under close global scrutiny. While no comprehensive US regulation currently governs stablecoins, Congress continues to debate a legal framework that could reshape how such assets are issued and used. SEC Exit Offers Relief, But Uncertainty Still Shadows PYUSD PayPal noted that the regulatory environment remains fluid. As a result, future legislation could bring new costs or risks for stablecoin issuers and partners. Additionally, the company acknowledged potential reputational harm. This could occur if its issuer partner faces legal trouble or if PYUSD is used in illicit transactions. Even so, the SEC’s decision to abandon its investigation adds to a growing list of crypto enforcement rollbacks. This trend reflects a broader shift toward lighter regulatory oversight. For PayPal and other fintech firms moving into stablecoins, it suggests that regulatory headwinds may be easing, at least for now.

Up to $250 million has been allocated to this venture. However, the crypto ambitions have sparked concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Despite transferring his 59% stake to a trust, Trump remains linked to several crypto ventures, including World Liberty Financial, where he’s named “Chief Crypto Advocate” and profits from the company, which is mostly owned by the Trump family. His memecoin launch, Official Trump (TRUMP), just before returning to office, also drew criticism. Nunes also expressed concern about stock manipulation, citing a hedge fund’s 6 million short positions and notifying the SEC. He added that the company is actively pursuing mergers and acquisitions to find “crown jewel” assets that align with its long-term vision. Stock Pressure and M&A Plans Despite the announcements, Trump Media’s stock (DJT) fell 3% on the day and is down 26% for the year, as investor interest appears to be cooling off amid broader market uncertainty.

This upward movement represents a 12% gain in the past seven days, signaling a potential shift in short-term market sentiment following a multi-week period of correction and volatility. Despite this upward trajectory, some underlying metrics suggest that investors remain cautious, especially within the derivatives market. Related Reading: Technical Indicators Suggest Bitcoin May Reach $120,000 In Q2, Says Standard Chartered Bitcoin Negative Funding Rates Return Amid Price Rally A CryptoQuant analyst known as ShayanBTC has pointed to a developing divergence between price action and funding rates, particularly on perpetual futures contracts. Funding rates serve as a measure of trader sentiment, showing whether long or short positions dominate. While the price of Bitcoin has climbed, Shayan revealed that recent funding rate behavior suggests that many participants are hedging against potential downside risks or actively reducing exposure at these levels. The divergence raises questions about whether the current rally will sustain or if a short-term retracement is likely before further continuation. Shayan highlighted that Bitcoin’s funding rates have turned negative again, even as the price pushed toward $95,000. This dynamic mirrors a trend observed during the prolonged correction between March and October 2024, when funding rates remained negative during intermittent rallies. Negative funding rates typically indicate a dominance of short positions or hedging behavior among traders in the derivatives market. The analyst suggests that this renewed divergence may reflect a lack of conviction in the rally, with participants preparing for a possible reversal at key resistance levels. Shayan also noted that the current structure shows similarities to previous periods where the market saw a temporary pullback before resuming upward movement. In this context, traders might be reducing risk exposure or engaging in distribution strategies by selling into strength. The presence of cautious positioning at a time of rising prices often signals market imbalance that could trigger a short-term correction. STH-Realized Price and Structural Considerations Meanwhile, BTC’s Short-Term Holder Realized Price (STH-RP) is also a metric worth assessing Bitcoin’s macro trend. The STH-RP reflects the average cost basis of coins held by recent market participants. Related Reading: Record-Breaking Week: Bitcoin Climbs Over $95,000 Amidst $3 Billion ETF Inflows According to on-chain data, sustainable bull markets often maintain price levels above the STH-RP. At present, Bitcoin remains near this threshold, and its ability to hold or break above it could shape near-term momentum. The analysis from Shayan concludes that while a pullback may occur in the short term, the retracements due to the divergence between rising prices and falling funding rates could strengthen the overall market structure if they result in healthier accumulation and shake out weak hands.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump told reporters outside the White House that the negotiations were moving fast, and he believes both countries will sign a deal soon. “I think we’ll have a deal with India,” Trump said. “The prime minister, as you know, was here three weeks ago, and they want to make a deal.” Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, had visited Washington in late February. Since then, both countries have been pushing to wrap up talks. According to CNBC, the White House sees this trade deal as one of several negotiations happening globally right now, but the India deal appears to be the closest to being done. Bessent and Vance say India deal is nearly ready Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed during a White House briefing that the U.S. is “very close on India.” He said the administration had also been holding talks with Japan, and he suggested the U.S. is also nearing a possible agreement with South Korea. “The contours of a deal” with Seoul are coming together, he said, without sharing specific terms or a deadline. But India seems to be the focus. Bessent pointed to a recent meeting between Vice President JD Vance and Modi, saying the two leaders “made some very good progress.” He said that the discussions went well enough that an announcement on India could happen soon. “A country like India, which has the posted and ready tariffs, it’s much easier to negotiate with them,” Bessent said. The structure of India’s existing tariffs is one of the things making this easier. They’re already written down, not hidden or vague. That helps U.S. negotiators know exactly what they’re working with. That’s not the case with every country, Bessent added, and it’s why talks with India have moved faster than others. The potential benefits are not one-sided. Raghuram Rajan, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, told CNBC that India stands to gain a lot if it can get those tariffs lowered. “India benefits hugely if it can negotiate tariffs to a much lower level, even while some other countries have it at a higher level,” Rajan said. He explained that this could make India more attractive to companies, especially because of its huge local market. Lutnick hints at another trade deal done While all eyes are on India, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added fuel to the fire shortly after by claiming that one deal was already done, but it was not yet public. Speaking to CNBC’s Brian Sullivan, Howard said , “I have a deal done, done, done, done, but I need to wait for their prime minister and their parliament to give their approval, which I expect shortly.” He refused to name the country, but the markets responded anyway. Right after Howard’s comments, the stock market spiked. Traders saw the statement as a sign that real progress was being made. The details of the unnamed deal are still under wraps, and Howard didn’t confirm if India was the country involved. When asked whether he was involved in any talks with China, Howard quickly said no. “My portfolio is the rest of the world’s trade deals,” he said. China is being handled separately by Bessent. As for who else is being courted, Bessent told reporters that the White House has active talks going with 17 different countries. “We have 18 important trading relationships; we will be speaking to all of those partners, or at least 17 of them, over the next few weeks,” he said. According to him, many of those countries have already come to Washington. China isn’t one of them. So far, the administration hasn’t signed anything official. Bessent said many countries have reached out about deals, but nothing has been announced. Right now, India, Japan, and South Korea are the top prospects. Later in the day, Bessent went on Fox Business and was asked directly about Lutnick’s claim of a finished deal. He didn’t confirm or deny. “I’m not going to get ahead of the president,” Bessent said. “Nothing’s done until President Trump announces it. So we should wait to hear from President Trump over the next couple of days.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

ETH is now consolidating near the $1,800 zone and might aim for a move above $1,820. Ethereum started a downside correction and traded below the $1,800 level. The price is trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. There is a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken). The pair could start a fresh increase if it clears the $1,850 resistance zone. Ethereum Price Eyes More Upsides Ethereum price remained stable above the $1,745 level and started a fresh increase, like Bitcoin . ETH climbed back above the $1,800 resistance level before the bears appeared. A high was formed at $1,842 and the price corrected some gains . There was a move below the $1,820 level. The price dipped below the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,746 swing low to the $1,842 high. However, the bulls remained active near the $1,780 level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $1,746 swing low to the $1,842 high. Ethereum price is now trading above $1,780 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, the price seems to be facing hurdles near the $1,810 level. The next key resistance is near the $1,820 level. There is also a short-term contracting triangle forming with resistance at $1,810 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. The first major resistance is near the $1,850 level. A clear move above the $1,850 resistance might send the price toward the $1,920 resistance. An upside break above the $1,920 resistance might call for more gains in the coming sessions. In the stated case, Ether could rise toward the $1,950 resistance zone or even $2,000 in the near term. Another Decline In ETH? If Ethereum fails to clear the $1,850 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $1,780 level. The first major support sits near the $1,750 zone. A clear move below the $1,750 support might push the price toward the $1,620 support. Any more losses might send the price toward the $1,600 support level in the near term. The next key support sits at $1,550.

He says that Strategy should consider accelerating purchases as the Bitcoin supply on exchanges continues to decline. Byworth argues that aggressively increasing Bitcoin holdings would boost Strategy’s mNAV, benefiting shareholders. Michael Saylor’s Strategy should take a more aggressive approach to buying Bitcoin by acquiring companies to use their cash holdings to fund purchases and do away with over-the-counter buys, a crypto executive says. “Saylor’s strategy so far has been the right one,” Syz Capital partner and Jan3 adviser Richard Byworth said on an April 29 podcast. Strategy should try “super aggressive” buying However, Byworth pondered what happens when Bitcoin ( BTC ) reaches an “illiquid supply” point where no Bitcoin is left on crypto exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) desks. “Should Saylor buy Bitcoin really carelessly? As in, not try and buy it through OTC desks…and actually just buy it with the intention of massively ramping the price,” Byworth said. “The point where things are getting less liquid, maybe you should try for a period going super aggressive, super careless buying, market impact all across, and push the price higher.” Strategy currently holds 553,555 BTC, valued at approximately $52.48 billion at the time of publication, according to Saylor Tracker. Fidelity Digital Assets said on April 24 that it has seen Bitcoin supply on exchanges dropping due to purchases by public companies, which it anticipated would accelerate “in the near future.” Byworth said a firm like Strategy wouldn’t be concerned with the price of Bitcoin when buying it as its primary focus would be on its mNAV (multiple of Net Asset Value), the value of the assets held , as “it is much more beneficial to [its] shareholders.” Richard Byworth spoke to Bram Kanstein on the Bitcoin for Millennials podcast. Source: Bram Kanstein He added that when there is no more Bitcoin, “you may as well go aggressive buying, because what happens is it will just ramp the price, it will massively increase [Strategy’s] MNAV, which means [its] dilution will become much more accretive.” Movements in the NAV premium and discount can give signals about market sentiment or potential future price movements. Related: New Bitcoin price all-time highs could occur in May — Here is why Byworth said that Japan has a “large number of zombie companies” holding significant cash reserves. He proposed that Strategy could adopt an aggressive approach by acquiring these companies and “immediately converting that cash into Bitcoin,” similar to the strategy taken by Japanese investment firm Metaplanet. “There are plenty of companies out there in Japan like that, sitting on these cash flow generative businesses that are pretty boring and have very low price-to-cash ratios,” Byworth added. On April 21, Metaplanet increased its Bitcoin holdings to more than $400 million after its latest $28 million purchase . Bitcoin is trading at $94,680 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap Byworth’s comments come as Bitcoin trades below the psychological $100,000 price level, a threshold it fell below in early February , which has widely been attributed to the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump. Bitcoin is trading at $94,680, down 13.22% from its all-time high of $109,000 reached in January, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

This follows confusion that began due to an April 15 regulatory filing, which some media outlets misinterpreted. ProShares later clarified that they have no XRP ETF scheduled for April 30 and would make an update. With the confusion, commentators clarified that such a possible ETF by ProShares would be a futures-based ETF, not an XRP spot ETF. Futures ETFs can provide exposure to XRP without holding it directly, but futures ETFs are generally more sensitive. ProShares targets May 14 launch for XRP futures ETF With a new filing amendment with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), ProShares reveals that it will launch its futures-based XRP ETFs on May 14. However, the document is a procedural update and does not confirm final SEC approval. The initial filing led to confusion across financial media and social networks. Some sources incorrectly reported that the SEC had allowed the ETF to begin trading on April 30. This news led to a short-lived price jump for XRP; however, it was later clarified that no such approval had been granted. ProShares also submitted a filing for an actual XRP ETF along with the futures-based ETF. Franklin Templeton, Bitwise, and Grayscale are among the other companies that have applied for such funds. Franklin Templeton’s application can be regarded as one of the most popular of all the applications submitted. On April 29, the SEC extended its decision on Franklin Templeton’s proposal until June 17. The firm registered the XRP ETF in March after registering a similar request for the Solana ETF. Eleanor Terrett, a journalist following ETF developments, wrote on social media that: “For the $XRP spot ETF, James [Seyffart] is eyeing mid-October, around the 18th, as a final decision deadline.” Crypto ETF decisions loom as SEC leadership shifts Large asset managers such as BlackRock and Fidelity have yet to file for XRP ETFs, but rumors suggest they may enter the market in 2025 if demand for competition rises. While ProShares and Franklin Templeton have captured the most attention, the U.S. SEC has also extended deadlines for other ETF filings, including Bitwise’s proposed Dogecoin ETF and Fidelity’s plan to incorporate staking into its Ethereum spot ETF. The SEC is required to make a final decision on ETF proposals within 240 days of their official publication in the Federal Register. As a result, Bloomberg reports that several cryptocurrency-related ETF decisions could be finalized in the fourth quarter of the year. The recent changes in the SEC leadership could affect the agency’s approval pace of crypto ETF filings. Paul Atkins officially became the new SEC Chair earlier this month, with a pro-crypto stance and Senate backing. Under prior leadership — including former Acting Chair Mark Uyeda — the SEC was more conservative, with the commissioner’s office extending review periods for numerous applications. But, despite these delays, the current regulatory situation suggests that several key XRP-related and other crypto ETF decisions are due to be made by October. Meanwhile, futures-based products like ProShares proposed could reach the market soon. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

According to its most recent filing , the SEC has extended the review period to June 17, from the initial deadline of May 3. The SEC noted that additional time was required to assess the application and the associated regulatory concerns. Franklin Templeton, which manages over $1.5 trillion in assets, filed the proposal on Mar. 13, through the Cboe BZX Exchange. The SEC officially published the filing for public comment in the Federal Register on Mar. 19. Under current rules, the SEC can take up to 90 days to approve , deny, or extend its decision. In this case, it chose to delay. In the filing, the SEC noted: “The Commission finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to take action… so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein.” You might also like: CME Group plans to launch XRP futures on May 19 Despite growing market anticipation, XRP’s ( XRP ) price reacted with caution. XRP is currently trading around $2.22, showing little volatility and a noticeable drop in volume. As per crypto.news data , trading volume is down 32% in the last 24 hours, suggesting traders are waiting on clearer signals. At 55, the relative strength index indicates neutral momentum. XRP price analysis. Credit: crypto.news Moving averages present a more optimistic picture. XRP is currently trading above almost all significant short and mid-term moving averages. The moving average convergence/divergence suggests a potential upward push, but the majority of oscillators also show indecision. If bullish pressure persists and XRP recovers higher support above $2.30, the next resistance lies near $2.50, and a breakout could possibly target the $2.85–$3.00 area. On the other hand, XRP may decline toward $2.00 or, in the worst scenario, back to $1.85 if the current consolidation breaks downward.

At $0.5832, the token is currently trading roughly 80% lower than its all-time high of $2.99. The recent trading volume, however, paints a slightly different picture. Pi Network’s ( PI ) trading volume rose by nearly 35% over the last day, surpassing $128 million. Though the technical picture is still uncertain, this suggests that traders are once again paying attention, which could be a sign of a more significant move. The biggest hurdle right now is the 50-day simple moving average, which sits around $0.82. PI is still below that line, and many other short-term moving averages like the 10-day and 20-day, also show a bearish trend. Pi Network price analysis. Credit: crypto.news The relative strength is at 38.7, which means the token is leaning toward oversold, but not quite there. Still, a few indicators like the moving average convergence/divergence suggest buyers may be slowly stepping in. You might also like: Here’s why Pi Network founders could be crypto billionaires Bollinger Bands show PI is near the lower band, suggesting it’s trading in the lower volatility range and may be oversold. A bounce from here could take the price back toward the middle band near $0.75, or higher. If PI breaks above the 50-day SMA with strong volume, it could push toward $0.85–$0.90. A rally past $1.00 would flip sentiment, especially if driven by major news. If prices stay under key moving averages and selling continues, PI could retest support near $0.55 or even fall to $0.45, close to its historical low. One of the biggest risks for Pi Network is token dilution . In April, 21.4 million new tokens were unlocked, worth about $12.3 million. An estimated 131 million tokens are expected to be unlocked every month for the next 12 months. Unless demand rises or the team takes action, this gradual increase in supply could have a big effect on price. One solution could be a token burn. The Pi Foundation currently owns more than 70 billion PI tokens, valued at over $40 billion. To ease investor fears and support the price, some of these could be burned. Token burns can also be combined with fee-burning mechanisms. Another potential catalyst is listing on a major exchange like Coinbase or Binance. There is increasing positive community sentiment for a future listing, which, like other tokens, could unlock new demand and liquidity. For the time being, Pi Network’s ability to turn the 50-day MA into support may be the first indication that true strength is returning.

While some investors are getting nervous, experts say this isn’t surprising — and there’s no need to panic. The reason? XRP futures contracts aren’t even live yet on the CME (Chicago Mercantile Exchange). The SEC has followed a clear pattern with other crypto ETFs like Bitcoin and Ethereum in the past: they wait for futures markets to be active and collect enough trading data before considering approval for a spot ETF. This ensures they have a reliable market sample to monitor before giving the green light. Not just XRP — the SEC is also delaying decisions on other crypto-related ETFs, including those tied to Ethereum staking and Dogecoin. According to James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg, further delays are expected this week for ETF applications involving Solana (SOL) and Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR). Most final deadlines for these applications won’t arrive until late 2025, so there’s still plenty of time for the regulatory process to play out. Also, Paul Atkins recently stepped into office at the SEC, and it may take time before new leadership shapes policy decisions alongside other commissioners like Hester Peirce. A Theory For Thought? Adding to the XRP conversation, a social media user raised an interesting theory: if the SEC and Ripple Labs are considering settling their long-running legal battle with payment in XRP tokens instead of cash, the SEC might delay approving any XRP Spot ETFs until after the settlement. That’s because an ETF approval would likely boost XRP’s price, possibly affecting the value of any settlement made in XRP. For now, the SEC vs Ripple case is on hold (in abeyance) as both sides work toward a settlement. The deadline for this process is set for June 10th, 2025 — just a week before the new XRP ETF decision date.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ETH|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-30 03:58:46

The stream happened on X Spaces during Trump’s campaign. Elon told him, “We need a government efficiency commission.” Trump ignored him and started talking about building up the military. Elon had already poured hundreds of millions into getting him elected. Eight months later, Trump finally gave in. That commission became DOGE, a budget-crushing machine run by Elon, named after a meme coin, and packed with random engineers in their 20s. In just 100 days, DOGE started gutting the federal government. And yet even after everything they cut, federal spending still went up. DOGE was supposed to save the US $2 trillion. Elon said it has saved $160 billion so far. But total government spending rose by 6.3% — or $156 billion — in Trump’s first four months back in office compared to the same period last year. Even with inflation adjusted, there’s still $81.2 billion more in spending than in 2024. That data came from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, which tracks weekly Treasury figures. DOGE nuked departments. The federal workforce got slashed to 1960s levels. Nearly 250,000 workers either quit or got fired. That includes over 112,000 who joined the “deferred resignation” scheme and another 121,000 that were just removed. DOGE cuts departments while spending rises Elon built his DOGE squad before Trump even stepped into the White House again. Around 40 staff were selected, most of them with backgrounds in engineering, crypto, venture capital, or internet infrastructure. Not public service. Elon kept his titles at Tesla, SpaceX, and X, and still had billions in government contracts. He was everywhere: Oval Office, Cabinet meetings, running the whole thing like another tech company. The first place to fall was USAID, the US Agency for International Development. DOGE wiped it out completely, firing 10,000 workers and leaving a skeleton crew to destroy files. Other foreign aid groups like the US Institute of Peace and the Millennium Challenge Corporation got shredded too. As a result, programs tied to America’s international presence — including the State Department — lost about $2 billion in spending during the first four months of 2025. DOGE engineers followed Elon’s rule: cut 20% more than needed, then bring people back if something breaks. He told his staff, “If you’re not in pain, then you didn’t cut enough.” So people were in pain. Bird flu scientists, nuclear workers, and even medical device regulators lost their jobs, then some were quietly rehired. The Department of Education was first to officially trigger a reduction in force. Around 1,300 workers were cut, which is over 30% of the department. This was one of the only areas where spending actually went down as its budget dropped by $10 billion in one year. DOGE’s latest project is focused on immigration. Elon’s team is trying to create a national database to track migrants entering the US and make deportation faster and easier. By March, lawsuits hit hard. At least 60 different legal actions were filed against DOGE. Republicans at town halls got grilled by pissed-off constituents. Veterans, rural patients, parents — all furious. Polls showed Americans don’t like DOGE, and Elon’s approval dropped under Trump’s. Democrats took advantage. They called Elon an unelected billionaire with way too much power. In a Wisconsin Supreme Court election earlier this month, which became a public referendum on DOGE, Elon lost — badly. Inside the government, things fell apart too. Elon fought with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth didn’t support the deepest cuts and tried to block them quietly. Elon’s own life took a hit. Forbes reported his net worth fell over $100 billion since December. Tesla’s sales and stock crashed after public boycotts. His personal safety was also at risk. People were attacking Tesla vehicles. The Justice Department said some of those attacks counted as domestic terrorism. Elon admitted he was scared. During Tesla’s earnings call last week, after a 71% drop in net income, Elon told shareholders he was cutting back his government work. He said he’d only give “a day or two” per week to DOGE moving forward. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025? Learn how to do it with DeFi in our upcoming webclass.

Some social media posts and reports claimed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had approved it and that it would go live this week. But that’s not true. A spokesperson from ProShares cleared up the confusion. They said: “ProShares does not have any ETF launches scheduled for Wednesday, April 30. We have no further news to share at this time.” So where did the rumor come from? The misunderstanding seems to have started because people confused the “effective date” listed in a regulatory filing with an official launch date. When a fund’s registration becomes “effective,” it means it has cleared one step with the SEC, but that doesn’t guarantee a launch on that date. In fact, the SEC could still object to the launch. A fund’s registration statement becoming effective is only one part of the process. It’s required before a launch, but it doesn’t confirm the exact timing or guarantee approval. While the news isn’t true—yet—talk of an XRP futures ETF is still important. It shows that XRP is gaining attention from major financial players.

New Futures ETFs Fuel Bullish XRP Price Prediction,https://cryptonews.com/news/is-xrp-about-to-jump-to-10-new-futures-etfs-fuel-bullish-xrp-price-prediction/,"The XRP (XRP) price is poised for a potential short-term rally back to its 2025 highs, driven by hype surrounding XRP futures ETFs in the coming weeks. Proshares Trust’s XRP future ETF launch was just delayed until the 14th of May. BREAKING: ProShares Trust #XRP ETF’s launch has been rescheduled to May 14, 2025! pic.twitter.com/xDPeBTtsdu — JackTheRippler © (@RippleXrpie) April 29, 2025 However, that hasn’t dampened sentiment. Indeed, SEC’s approval of these ETFs, following Ripple’s legal victory in March 2025, has sparked investor enthusiasm – the XRP price was last around $2.25, up over 40% from monthly lows. Moreover, bullish technicals, including the XRP price’s recent breakout above a multi-week downtrend and its 21 and 50DMAs, signal short-term targets of $3.40. Crypto traders will remember how the market initially underestimated the impact of the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024. Could the market be underpricing the impact of the XRP futures ETFs, and could XRP be about to surge all the way to $10? XRP to $10 Not Likely Yet Thanks to Macro Uncertainties Traders should avoid chasing this rally blindly. Economic uncertainty, fueled by President Trump’s trade war, is rattling global markets and the US economy is already showing signs of cracking. *US APRIL CONSUMER CONFIDENCE 86.0; EST. 88.0 *US MARCH JOB OPENINGS 7.192M; EST. 7.500M pic.twitter.com/7jsXr03ZDi — Christian Fromhertz (@cfromhertz) April 29, 2025 Consumer expectations just cratered to their worst levels since 2011, while job openings just tanked 300,000. Meanwhile, concerns about sticky inflation thanks to tariffs is likely to keep the Federal Reserve hawkish at the time when the market needs them the most. Altcoins like XRP , highly sensitive to risk-off sentiment, could face sharp pullbacks in such conditions. A $10 price target seems unrealistic in this climate, as macro headwinds could cap gains. Time to Accumulate XRP? Despite short-term risks, long-term investors should view market choppiness as a buying opportunity. The Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance, including potential regulatory clarity under new SEC Chair Paul Atkins, bodes well for XRP. Trump’s favoritism toward XRP, which he named back in March as one of the key cryptos to be included in the digital assets stockpile, is another reason to be long-term bullish. In the background, XRP’s fundamentals remain robust: Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin launch in December 2024 boosted liquidity, and 80% of Japanese banks now use Ripple Payments for cross-border transactions.

What Analysts Predict After ETF Breakthroughs,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/can-ripple-xrp-still-reach-5-what-analysts-predict-after-etf-breakthroughs/,"Ripple’s XRP is regaining attention following a major regulatory milestone: the approval of XRP futures ETFs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Analysts are now debating whether XRP could achieve the much-anticipated $5 target — a move that would mark a new era for the digital asset. Meanwhile, emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are also seeing early investor rotation as traders seek strategic early-stage entries ahead of the next wave. XRP’s ETF Approval Sparks Optimism With the recent approval of ProShares Trust for the issuance of three XRP futures ETFs—namely, Ultra XRP ETF, Short XRP ETF and Ultra Short XRP ETF—the stage is now set for institutional involvement. These products, launching on April 30, will enable investors to gain exposure to XRP price movements without owning the asset. XRP experienced a notable shift in events following the announcement. According to CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency has increased by 10.06% over the last 7 days, reaching a value of $2.31. In the past 24 hours, the volume surged by 71.87%, as traders look to the ETF catalyst. Technical analysts stated that XRP has broken and closed above its previous resistance level of $2.20 and is currently consolidating near $2.30. The major resistance area is between $2.50 and $2.70. XRP may reach $5 soon if things remain positive post-ETF launch. Investor Sentiment: Institutional Confidence Growing The impact of the spot ETF approvals will extend beyond temporary price movements. Investor sentiment towards XRP could also improve, giving hope to the long-suffering holders. According to experts, the liquidity connections from futures ETFs may lead to regulatory approval for spot-based XRP ETFs. This further links Ripple to the traditional financial ecosystem. Investor sentiment is highly bullish on whales’ accumulation pattern as well as a sharp increase in social and trading volume. XRP positions itself in the payments infrastructure space, marking a crucial distinction from speculative altcoins. This provides a strong utility thesis for investors. MAGACOIN FINANCE: A Strategic Early-Stage Play While XRP moves toward mainstream acceptance, forward-looking investors are also rotating capital into emerging projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE. Still trading under $0.01 , MAGACOIN offers early access to a high-scarcity, community-driven asset before centralized exchange exposure. Analysts see parallels between MAGACOIN FINANCE’s current stage and XRP’s early growth period — particularly the focus on real-world use cases, scarcity mechanics, and strategic accumulation by smart capital. MAGACOIN FINANCE’s roadmap includes phased expansion, staged token releases, and upcoming integration opportunities designed to foster organic demand. Early whale activity combined with grassroots adoption trends suggest MAGACOIN FINANCE could mirror the type of strong early-stage moves seen historically in assets that later achieve significant market caps. Final Takeaway XRP could reach $5 in the long term, driven by fresh momentum following the catalyst of ETFS. At the same time, tactical investors seeking earlier-stage opportunities have begun to look at MAGACOIN FINANCE as the next mover before the market catches up. In the evolving landscape of digital assets, timing remains critical — and both XRP and MAGACOIN FINANCE are capturing attention for the next phase.

BitMart Resumes Pi Coin Trading, Banxa Creates Thousands of New Accounts appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News The price of Pi Coin (PI) has slipped below the key $0.60 level, falling by over 3% in the past 24 hours. On a 30-day timeframe, the token has recorded a -15% decline, making it one of the few major cryptocurrencies trading in the red this month. While this downward trend has raised concerns among holders, some traders are starting to wonder if this dip could actually be a strategic buying opportunity. Since mid-April, Pi Coin has been trading sideways in a narrow range between $0.59 and $0.67, and with the current price now testing the lower boundary at $0.58, the market could face further downside risks if it breaks below this support. The big question circulating in the community right now: can Pi Coin climb back to $3? Despite the recent price pressure, there are a few positive developments stirring excitement among Pi supporters: BitMart has officially resumed trading for Pi Coin, bringing back much-needed liquidity to the market. Banxa, a fiat-to-crypto payment platform, is reportedly creating thousands of new accounts, signaling growing interest in Pi. HTX (formerly Huobi) is teasing Pi Coin activity on its platform, hinting at possible future support. And perhaps most notably, Pi Network founder Dr. Nicolas Kokkalis is set to be a keynote speaker at the Consensus Summit in Toronto in May 2025 — a major event for the global crypto industry. According to crypto influencer Dr. Altcoin, these updates could mean one thing for Pi’s price outlook: bullish momentum might be building.

Expert Claims That’s All You Need To Succeed,https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/only-xrp-expert-claims-thats-all-you-need-to-succeed/,"Renowned crypto influencer “DustyBC” has caused controversy after stating that owning only XRP might be sufficient for investors to “make it” financially. The bold assertion comes at a time when XRP trades below its all-time high, but still captures the attention of both fans and critics throughout the market. Related Reading: XRP Headed For $1,000 – CryptoGuard Exec Drops Bold Prediction Single-Asset Strategy Raises Eyebrows Based on reports, DustyBC’s comment implies that investors can achieve significant wealth by adopting an XRP-only investment strategy. The perception has gained traction with some supporters who feel that “one strong hand beats a hundred weak plays.” The sentiment is indicative of increased interest in focused investment strategies over diversified portfolio strategies. I seriously think only holding $XRP is enough to make it.. — DustyBC Crypto (@TheDustyBC) April 27, 2025 The token, which runs Ripple’s payments network, already has a valuation of several billion dollars. A few market commentators have made claims published that the XRP currency may see targets of as much as $10,000 per token. Those are wild claims, but they have driven some enthusiasm among certain investors. Market Size Claims Support Bull Case Backers cite the enormous payment market as the basis for their optimism. The international payments space is said to be valued at multi-trillion dollars, with some estimates placing the industry at the $300 trillion mark by the end of this decade. According to these figures, XRP supporters believe that taking just 1% of this market would have a dramatic effect on the token’s price. This has caused some analysts to caution that not holding at least 1,000 XRP tokens demonstrates bad financial sense. Ripple’s ongoing business expansion, partnerships and acquisitions have been listed as further causes for optimism. These actions continue to provide talking points for those still optimistic about XRP’s potential future. Critics Question Growth Potential Not all people are so keen on XRP as a vehicle to get rich. X user Shero reacted to DustyBC’s remarks by saying XRP’s possible growth is only seven to 10 times its current value – a gain that some critics don’t view as “life-changing.” There’s not big ROI atm.. max is 7-10x — Shero (@shero12269724) April 27, 2025 Related Reading: Justin Sun Bets Big On JUST Token – Here’s Why He Sees 100x Potential These more conservative voices highlight XRP’s current valuation of over $133 billion as a constraint on future growth.

On Balance & Risks While some XRP advocates get their juices flowing, others within the crypto community are placing a high premium on risk mitigation.

33767162,[object Object],1745989225,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Fresh Wave Of New Money Flows Into Bitcoin After Market Cooldown – Can Bulls Take Over?,https://bitcoinist.com/fresh-wave-of-new-money-flows-into-bitcoin-after-market-cooldown-can-bulls-take-over/,"Bitcoin has gained over 28% in value since its April 7th low, marking a strong recovery that has shifted market sentiment in favor of the bulls. The leading cryptocurrency is now holding firmly above the $90,000 level, a key psychological and technical zone that suggests momentum is back on the side of buyers. However, risks still remain, as a definitive push above the $100,000 mark is needed to confirm a full bullish continuation and break into new all-time highs. Despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty and global trade tensions, Bitcoin appears to be showing resilience. Analysts are watching closely to see if the current structure holds, especially as volatility remains elevated. Adding to the bullish outlook, recent data from CryptoQuant reveals a notable trend: after weeks of market cooldown and correction, a fresh wave of new capital is flowing into the market. This renewed inflow of money indicates increased confidence among investors and could fuel the next leg higher. If this wave of accumulation persists, it could serve as the foundation for a broader uptrend — one that potentially pushes BTC beyond $100K and into uncharted territory . Bitcoin Builds Momentum During Uncertainty Bitcoin appears to have finally broken its short-term correlation with U.S. equities. While the stock market stalled last week under pressure from mixed earnings and rising macroeconomic concerns, BTC surged, gaining strong bullish momentum. This divergence may mark the beginning of a new trend — one where Bitcoin and the broader crypto market lead risk-on assets into higher territory. However, traders and investors alike remain cautious, as macroeconomic risks continue to loom, particularly surrounding the intensifying trade conflict between the US and China. The coming weeks are likely to be critical for Bitcoin’s direction. As the price continues consolidating in a narrow range between $92K and $96K, the market is anticipating a breakout. Whether that breakout is higher or lower will largely depend on the liquidity shift and global financial developments. Supporting the bullish case, top analyst Axel Adler shared on-chain insights highlighting that the Momentum STH Cap Ratio — a metric designed to track shifts in short-term investor behavior — shows that a new wave of capital has entered the market following the April correction. According to Adler, this renewed influx of money suggests growing speculative interest and potential for sustained upside. This fresh capital inflow could be the key trigger Bitcoin needs to push toward new all-time highs, provided bulls maintain control and global economic conditions don’t worsen dramatically. The next move will likely define the market’s sentiment for the months ahead. BTC Price Struggles Below $96K, but Bulls Hold the Line Bitcoin is currently trading at $95,000 after several days of consolidation near resistance. While bulls have struggled to reclaim higher ground above the $96K mark, there are encouraging signs. BTC has held the $92K support level with notable strength since pushing past $90K last week — a key psychological and technical milestone. This sustained support zone signals strong underlying demand, especially after weeks of selling pressure and macroeconomic uncertainty. For the bullish momentum to continue, however, BTC must break above the $96K barrier. A clean move above this level would set the stage for a potential run toward $100K — a level many analysts see as the next critical breakout zone. Still, downside risks remain. If BTC fails to gather momentum above $96K soon, the market could shift into a prolonged consolidation phase. In this scenario, holding above $90K becomes essential to avoid triggering deeper corrections. As global financial markets continue to navigate tensions between the U.S. and China, Bitcoin’s price action this week may provide key signals about investor confidence and the strength of the current trend. For now, the $90K–$96K range remains the battleground.

Following a successful closed beta phase that attracted over 200 million dollars in total value locked (TVL), the protocol makes its core features available to all users. The launch also marks the debut of “Falcon Miles”, a points program designed to reward meaningful participation across the ecosystem and drive user growth. Public access now includes Falcon’s core minting and redemption functions. $USDf, the protocol’s overcollateralized synthetic dollar, can be minted by depositing supported collateral, including both stablecoins and non-stablecoins. Eligible assets include USDT, USDC, ETH, BTC, TON, NEAR, and more. Importantly, all $USDf holders who interact with the Falcon App can stake or unstake $USDf through the platform and earn protocol-generated yields through $sUSDf. The staking process is designed to be accessible and flexible, with the option to restake into fixed-tenor vaults for enhanced returns. Once staked, $USDf is converted into $sUSDf, a yield-bearing token that grows in value over time. $sUSDf is powered by Falcon’s diversified yield strategies, which include both positive and negative delta-neutral funding rate arbitrage, cross-exchange spreads, liquidity provisioning and altcoin staking. As of today,$sUSDf offers around 15% APY, with higher returns available via fixed-tenor restaking through Boosted Yield NFTs. Alongside the public launch, Falcon Finance introduces Falcon Miles, an ecosystem-wide points program designed to reward user participation. In its initial phase, Falcon Miles tracks primary activities available directly on the Falcon App, including minting USDf, staking into sUSDf, and holding assets on the platform. Points are accumulated based on the scale and duration of engagement. Expansion of eligible activities will be incorporated progressively as the broader ecosystem rollout continues. In future phases, users will also earn points by providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges, interacting with lending protocols, and participating in yield tokenization platforms. “With Falcon Finance now live to the public, our goal is to bring greater optionality to users seeking flexible synthetic dollar solutions,” said Andrei Grachev, Managing Partner of Falcon Finance. “Falcon Miles marks the beginning of a broader effort to build a strong community where users are meaningfully rewarded for their participation and contributions to Falcon Finance.” The next chapter for Falcon Finance will include additional collateral support, partnerships-driven “miles” program, and cross-chain deployments. These will enable Falcon Finance to advance its mission to help shape the next era of synthetic digital assets. For more information, visit falcon.finance . About Falcon Finance Falcon Finance is a next-generation synthetic dollar protocol designed to provide sustainable and competitive yield generation in all market conditions.

In a semiannual financial stability report published on Tuesday, the Bank of Italy pointed to a temporary but sharp rise in crypto valuations after the US administration signaled support for digital assets. The bank said speculative crypto-assets, particularly those like Bitcoin , experienced strong inflows after Trump’s inauguration and subsequent policy announcements. Officials in Rome cautioned that if these highly volatile instruments become more closely tied to traditional financial systems, they could amplify vulnerabilities for both markets and financial intermediaries. Italy’s central bank noted that the value of crypto-assets reached $2.75t by the end of March, with Bitcoin accounting for over 60% of that total. #Esceoggi #29aprile il 1° Rapporto sulla #StabiliitàFinanziaria del 2025, pubblicazione semestrale con le informazioni sulle condizioni del sistema finanziario italiano Lo trovi qui https://t.co/jSGLRh949B #RSF #Bankitalia pic.twitter.com/nbcNWtaMwt — Banca d'Italia (@bancaditalia) April 29, 2025 Italy Sees Financial Fragility in Growing Role of Bitcoin and Stablecoins According to the report, a significant share of Bitcoin is now held by ETF issuers, trading platforms and non-financial corporations. These entities are either betting on Bitcoin as a stock-price enhancer or using it to reshape business models, despite its high volatility. Many operate outside traditional regulatory frameworks, especially in the US, China, Canada and the UK. Their limited presence in the eurozone has so far insulated European markets, but Italian regulators warned that contagion risks are growing. The report also raised concerns about the dominance of dollar-based stablecoins such as Tether and USD Coin . If such instruments become systemic, their issuers’ heavy reliance on US government bonds as reserves could trigger market instability during redemption crises. EU Authorities Monitor Offshore Crypto Exposure as Stablecoin Risks Mount The central bank warned of a potential liquidity crunch in the event of a large-scale stablecoin failure, with spillover effects that could reach both US bond markets and global financial systems. European officials have echoed those concerns. ECB President Christine Lagarde said in April that MiCAR, the EU’s landmark crypto regulation, may not be strong enough to shield European financial institutions from fallout linked to a US-driven stablecoin boom. She warned that a mass shift of savings into dollar-pegged assets could weaken the euro area’s monetary sovereignty. Meanwhile, Natasha Cazenave of the European Securities and Markets Authority added that though crypto remains a small slice of global finance, its growing entanglement with the real economy could soon amplify risks . Italian authorities said they are closely monitoring business models and liquidity practices of firms offering crypto-assets in both EU and offshore markets. As European lawmakers move to strengthen rules under MiCAR, Italy’s warning points to the growing need for global coordination. Without it, national regulations may struggle to keep pace with the rapid global spread of crypto, especially as political support fuels faster adoption in major economies.

Sentiment was further dampened by a drop in U.S. futures, as traders turned cautious ahead of key U.S. economic releases later today, including the March PCE price index— the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge— and the first estimate of Q1 GDP. Gold extended its recent decline to below $3,310 per ounce on Wednesday, as easing concerns over the impact of US tariffs reduced demand for safe-haven assets. Japan ( NKY:IND ) rose 0.20% rose on Wednesday as markets reopened following a one-day holiday. The Japanese yen slipped to around 142.4 per US dollar on Wednesday, marking its second consecutive day of losses, as a string of disappointing economic data pressured sentiment. March figures revealed that industrial production fell more than expected, while retail sales growth also underwhelmed, raising concerns about the strength of Japan’s recovery. Investor sentiment was buoyed by comments from US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who said the US held “substantial talks” with Japan regarding a potential trade agreement. Markets are now focused on the Bank of Japan’s upcoming policy decision, where the central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates steady at 0.5%. China ( SHCOMP ) f ell 0.08% mixed on Wednesday, with the Shanghai Composite slipping 0.2% to around 3,280, while the Shenzhen Component rose 0.5% to 9,895, and the offshore yuan weakened to around 7.27 per dollar, as investors reacted to disappointing PMI data from China. Official data showed that the manufacturing PMI contracted more than expected in April 2025 , after reaching a one-year high in March. Similarly, the services PMI edged lower in April from a three-month peak in March, missing expectations. Meanwhile, a private survey revealed that manufacturing PMI declined in April from a four-month high in the preceding month. China’s top legislature on Wednesday enacted the Private Economy Promotion Law, the first of its kind, signaling stronger support for the country’s private sector amid ongoing trade risks with the West. In its latest update, China’s Foreign Ministry released a video on social media urging the international community to resist US economic aggression. Although the video does not directly mention the steep tariffs exchanged by both sides, it serves as a defiant message to the US and a call for global unity. Hong Kong ( HSI ) rose 0.23% to 21,934 in early trade on Wednesday, reversing modest gains from the previous session as investors reacted to China’s April PMI data. India ( SENSEX ) rose 0.13% Australia ( AS51 ) rose 0.34% rose 0.4% to around 8,100 on Wednesday, marking its fifth straight session of gains. The Australian dollar edged higher toward $0.64 on Wednesday, recouping some losses from the previous session, as investors digested the latest inflation data. Australia's h eadline inflation held at an annual pace of 2.4% in the first quarter , topping expectations of 2.3%. Meanwhile, core inflation, the Reserve Bank’s preferred measure of trimmed mean inflation, fell to 2.9% from 3.3% in the previous quarter, returning to the RBA’s 2-3% target band for the first time since late 2021. Australia’s private sector credit rose by 0.5% month-over-month in March 2025, maintaining the same pace as in the previous two months and aligning with market forecasts. Singapore bank loans increased to SGD 846.5 billion in March 2025 from SGD 841.1 billion in February. This marked the largest amount since records began in 1980. In the U.S., on Tuesday, all three major indexes ended higher , buoyed by reports that a major trade deal was nearing completion and corporate earnings.

Caixin and S&P Global April manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) slipped to 50.4 from March’s 51.2. The 50-point line separates growth from contraction. The result, the lowest since January, still topped the average forecast in a Reuters poll . The slowdown arrived as Beijing resisted rolling out new stimulus and waited out what officials expected would be a long trade dispute with Washington. On the same day, the government’s own PMI pointed to an even quicker fall in activity. “The ripple effects of the ongoing China-U.S. tariff standoff will gradually be felt in the second and third quarters,” said Wang Zhe, economist at Caixin Insight Group. “Policymakers should be well-prepared, with action taken sooner rather than later.” Demand from abroad is already fading. The survey recorded the sharpest drop in new export business since July 2023, leaving only a slight overall rise in total new orders. Factories kept output growing, but at a slower pace, by working through existing backlogs. Supplier delivery times have lengthened in China, and hiring reduced Producers also reduced inventories, while business confidence slipped to its third-lowest level since the series began in April 2012. Managers blamed the trade uncertainty for their caution. Trade disruptions and supply snags slightly lengthened supplier delivery times in April. At the same time, weak demand for raw materials and fiercer competition among vendors drove another fall in average input costs. Hiring has also reduced noticeably. After a brief gain in March, manufacturing employment dropped last month as some workers resigned and companies moved ahead with restructuring plans to cut costs. Foreign trade is a major source of employment. Former Premier Li Keqiang said in 2020 that the Premier sector supports about 180 million jobs, directly or indirectly. At the Politburo meeting last week, China’s top leaders promised help for firms and workers most exposed to the impact of U.S. tariffs that now run in the triple digits on some goods. On Monday, senior officials from several economic ministries tried to calm worries that the levies could knock China’s fragile recovery off course. Beijing has offered assistance to exporters who are willing to shift more sales to the domestic market, yet many firms hesitate. They cite weak local demand, bruising price battles, thin margins, slow payments, and high product return rates at home. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The DLT shares will track BlackRock’s BLF Treasury Trust Fund (TTTXX), which may only be purchased from BlackRock Advisors and The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY), the firm said in its April 29 Form N-1A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The money market fund holds over $150 million worth of assets, invested almost entirely in US Treasury bills and cash. BlackRock said that the shares “are expected to be purchased and held through BNY, which intends to use blockchain technology to maintain a mirror record of share ownership for its customers.” Unlike the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL), DLT shares won’t be tokenized but will instead be used as a transparency tool to verify ownership. BlackRock will continue to maintain traditional book-entry records as the official ownership ledger. BlackRock didn’t propose a ticker or set a management fee for the DLT shares in its filing. A minimum initial investment of $3 million worth of DLT is required for institutions seeking to purchase the digital shares. BlackRock follows Fidelity’s March 21 filing to list an Ethereum-based OnChain share class, which seeks to track the Fidelity Treasury Digital Fund (FYHXX) — an $80 million fund consisting almost entirely of US Treasury bills. While the OnChain share class filing is pending regulatory approval, Fidelity expects it to take effect on May 30. Wall Street heavyweights continue to explore blockchain use cases Asset managers have increasingly turned to blockchain to tokenize Treasury bills, bonds and private credit over the past few years.

The potential move was revealed in a letter sent to shareholders by CEO and chairman Devin Nunes on Tuesday, ahead of the company’s annual shareholder meeting. According to Nunes, the proposed utility token would be part of a rewards program and could initially be used to pay for subscriptions to Truth+. He added that over time, the token may be used across additional services within the broader Truth ecosystem. Letter Echoes Crypto Terminology Without Explicit Recognition While the letter stopped short of labeling the token as a cryptocurrency or confirming blockchain integration, the language used aligns with terminology common in the crypto sector. TMTG operates Truth Social, a social media platform modeled after X (formerly Twitter), which Trump helped launch after being banned from major platforms for violating their policies. The company became publicly traded in March 2024 and at one point reached a valuation nearing $8 billion, despite modest revenues. Its market capitalization currently sits around $5.5 billion. This isn’t TMTG’s first foray into digital assets. In January, the company announced the formation of Truth.fi, a fintech division aiming to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The potential wallet and token for Truth+ would add to a growing portfolio of crypto ventures linked to Trump and his allies. These include NFTs, memecoins, a stablecoin project, Bitcoin mining operations, and a DeFi platform dubbed World Liberty Financial. A Trump-themed real estate video game is also reportedly in development. These developments come as the Trump administration pushes forward with a pro-crypto agenda. Since retaking office, Trump has approved the creation of a strategic digital asset reserve, advocated for stablecoin legislation, and dialed back enforcement against crypto projects across multiple federal agencies. Crypto-Friendly Paul Atkins Sworn as SEC Chair As reported, Paul Atkins was sworn in as Chairman of the SEC earlier this month, marking a leadership shift that is being welcomed by the digital asset industry. Under Atkins’ leadership, the SEC has already withdrawn or delayed several prominent cases against crypto firms. The agency dropped its lawsuits against Coinbase and Cumberland DRW earlier this year, and a separate investigation into Uniswap Labs closed in February without enforcement action. Last week, the agency also closed its investigation into CyberKongz , a prominent Ethereum-based NFT and gaming project, with no enforcement action taken. More recently, the SEC announced it would not pursue further legal action against Richard Schueler, better known as Richard Heart, the founder of Hex, PulseChain, and PulseX.

Trump Media announced it is exploring the launch of a utility token and digital wallet for its Truth+ streaming service, while Bunq debuted its new crypto trading feature that enables users in six European countries to invest in over 300 cryptocurrencies directly through its banking app. Trump Media Eyes Crypto Integration for Truth+ Amid Broader Blockchain Push Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG), the media empire founded by President Donald Trump , is reportedly considering the integration of a cryptocurrency token and digital wallet into its subscription-based video streaming platform, Truth+. The move is part of a broader effort to bring blockchain-based payments and rewards into the company’s growing ecosystem of conservative-focused digital services. In a letter to shareholders dated April 29, TMTG CEO Devin Nunes detailed the company’s exploratory plans to roll out a “utility token” and “Truth digital wallet,” which would initially allow users to pay for Truth+ subscriptions. The token, Nunes said, could eventually serve broader purposes, including transactions across the Trump Media ecosystem—spanning the flagship social media app Truth Social and the financial services platform Truth.Fi. ”We're exploring the introduction of a utility token within a Truth digital wallet that can initially be used to pay for Truth+ subscription costs, and later be applied to other products and services in the Truth ecosphere,” Nunes wrote. The announcement is the latest in a string of crypto-related developments from the Trump-led media conglomerate. In November 2024, Trump Media filed a trademark application with the US Patent and Trademark Office, covering a range of blockchain services, including software for digital wallets, crypto trading, and payment processing on Truth.Fi. In January 2025, the company also revealed plans to allocate up to $250 million of its cash reserves into Bitcoin and other digital assets, including crypto-related securities. According to disclosures, the assets would be held in custody by Charles Schwab, marking a notable endorsement of cryptocurrency from a media company so closely associated with a sitting US president. The firm also signed a partnership with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to launch a suite of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on Truth.Fi that would blend crypto exposure with “Made in America” equities. These products are aimed at attracting patriotic investors interested in blockchain technology and domestic economic interests. Truth+ and Political Streaming Truth+, which launched in October 2024, has positioned itself as a conservative alternative to mainstream streaming platforms. Its programming slate includes films, documentaries, and series designed to appeal to right-leaning audiences, and the potential for crypto integration could enhance its appeal to younger, tech-savvy viewers as well. The planned token and wallet system would be part of a loyalty and rewards initiative that Trump Media is developing. Though details remain sparse, Nunes emphasized that the rewards program would span the entire suite of Trump Media products. However, the prospect of launching a Trump-branded crypto token has reignited concerns among lawmakers and ethics experts. Critics argue that Trump’s direct or indirect financial ties to blockchain ventures—particularly those integrated into platforms bearing his name—could represent conflicts of interest as he simultaneously holds the highest office in the nation. Although Trump formally transferred his 59% stake in Trump Media to a trust in December 2024, skeptics question the independence and effectiveness of that move. A number of senators have voiced apprehensions that Trump's policy decisions could benefit ventures like World Liberty Financial, a crypto company in which the Trump family holds a 60% stake. Trump currently serves as its “Chief Crypto Advocate,” a title that comes with a share of the company’s profits. A Pattern of Politically Charged Crypto Moves This is not Trump’s first brush with blockchain controversy. In January, just two days before his return to the White House, he oversaw the launch of the meme coin ”Official Trump (TRUMP),” a move that was widely criticized by both political opponents and financial regulators for its timing and ethical implications. Despite the backlash, the TRUMP meme coin soared in popularity and trading volume following announcements of VIP dinners for top token holders and other exclusive perks—raising further questions about the blending of political influence and digital asset promotion. As Trump Media gears up for potential crypto integration, industry watchers are closely monitoring the implications not only for the company’s future but also for the broader intersection of politics and cryptocurrency. With more Americans adopting digital assets and with regulatory frameworks still evolving, Trump’s continued involvement in blockchain initiatives could have a far-reaching impact on both the market and the presidency. Whether the Truth+ utility token becomes a cornerstone of the TMTG ecosystem or another flashpoint for ethical scrutiny, its development will likely be a key narrative in the ongoing convergence of media, politics, and crypto. Bunq Launches Crypto Offering Across Europe, Paving Way for Unified Financial Superapp In other news, Bunq, Europe’s second-largest neobank by valuation, has officially entered the cryptocurrency market, launching a service that allows users to invest in over 300 digital assets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. The initiative, unveiled on April 29, marks a significant milestone in the bank’s evolution into an all-in-one financial platform — and signals intensifying competition in the digital finance sector. Branded as Bunq Crypto, the new feature is now available to users in six European countries — the Netherlands, France, Spain, Ireland, Italy, and Belgium. The rollout is part of a larger vision by Bunq to offer fully integrated financial services that seamlessly combine traditional banking, savings, and crypto investing in a single mobile application. Responding to Soaring Retail Demand Ali Niknam, Bunq’s founder and CEO, said that the move was primarily motivated by the increasing interest in digital assets among retail investors. “We believe that now many, many people — the large majority — are interested in crypto,” said Niknam. “And we believe they’re interested in buying crypto through an environment they can trust, relate to, and recognize.” With cryptocurrency adoption expanding beyond early adopters and tech-savvy traders, Bunq sees an opportunity to meet growing demand among mainstream users — especially those who have felt underserved by current crypto platforms that often lack simplicity or perceived safety. A study commissioned by the bank supports this strategy. Bunq’s research found that 65% of European consumers are actively seeking a unified financial platform that combines banking, savings, and cryptocurrency investing. Meanwhile, over half of retail investors surveyed reported a strong interest in gaining crypto exposure, but cited complexity and inadequate security on current platforms as barriers. The launch of Bunq Crypto comes in partnership with Kraken, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchanges, which will provide the backend infrastructure and liquidity for the service. As the 14th-largest centralized exchange globally by volume, Kraken lends technical expertise and regulatory confidence to the endeavor. Bunq’s leadership emphasized that recent improvements in Europe’s crypto regulatory clarity were critical to moving forward. “For a long time, the future of crypto from a regulatory perspective was a bit unclear,” Niknam said. “But we’ve seen a lot of that change over the past couple of months. As a regulated entity, we now feel sufficiently assured to offer this to the public.” Indeed, the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) framework — which begins phasing in this year — has given regulated entities like Bunq the confidence to develop compliant crypto services while providing customers with stronger protections. Setting the Stage for Global Expansion Bunq Crypto is just the first phase of the bank’s broader strategy. The company plans to expand its crypto trading capabilities to users across the entire European Economic Area (EEA) in the coming months, with additional plans to launch in the United States and the United Kingdom thereafter. This global ambition mirrors Bunq’s rapid growth trajectory. The neobank, founded in 2012, reported over 12.5 million users as of June 2024 — a dramatic increase from just 9 million a year earlier. The company’s rise has been fueled by its user-friendly interface, innovative product lineup, and strong brand positioning as a digital-first, socially responsible financial institution. Bunq’s push into crypto aligns with an emerging global trend: the consolidation of financial services into superapps. These platforms aim to provide users with comprehensive financial management tools under a single digital roof, eliminating the need for multiple accounts across various banks, brokers, and crypto exchanges. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong echoed this sentiment in a February post, saying he believes the financial system of the future will revolve around “a single primary financial account” — an account that will likely include cryptocurrency management as a core feature. In this context, Bunq’s move is more than just another crypto feature — it’s a step toward redefining what it means to be a bank in the 21st century. Competition Intensifies in European Fintech Bunq’s announcement comes months after rival neobank Revolut expanded its own crypto exchange services across 30 EEA countries in November 2024, underscoring the growing race among fintech firms to dominate the retail crypto market. With a stronger regulatory foundation now in place in Europe, more traditional financial institutions and neobanks are expected to follow suit, integrating digital assets into their service offerings to stay competitive and meet evolving customer expectations. As Bunq enters the crypto arena, it positions itself not only as a challenger to legacy banks, but as a forward-thinking platform capable of bridging traditional finance and the decentralized digital economy.",News|Crypto,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|EXCHANGE|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaper', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/93/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaper,2025-04-30 05:30:00

At a public meeting, Hines expressed the administration's commitment to establishing the United States as a global leader in Bitcoin accumulation and innovation. “We see Bitcoin as digital gold,” Hines said, citing the asset’s uniqueness, fixed supply and growing geopolitical importance. “There’s a space race among nations to capture its value,” Hines said, noting that the administration sees Bitcoin not just as a financial asset but as a strategic reserve similar to gold. Related News: 6 Experts Share Their Bitcoin Price Predictions: Here's What They Think the Future Holds for BTC Hines was referring to the recent executive order on digital assets, which recognizes Bitcoin’s distinct status as a finite, commodity-like asset. The order outlines plans to accumulate Bitcoin in budget-neutral ways without burdening taxpayers, while also creating a “National Stockpile of Digital Assets” to support innovation in the cryptocurrency ecosystem. “We want to move as quickly as possible,” Hines said. “We don’t want to get ahead of other nations. We want the United States, or at least our allies, to capture the value.” “We have positioned ourselves as the world's Bitcoin superpower,” he added. *This is not investment advice.

The lawsuits, both filed in the Delaware bankruptcy court, alleged that NFT Stars and Delysium failed to deliver all the tokens paid for by FTX despite repeated attempts to resolve the matter. FTX claimed in an April 28 statement that it made “numerous unanswered attempts” to engage with both firms, and it would be “contacting numerous other token and coin issuers regarding FTX assets and will be filing additional suits against non-responsive parties.” Source: FTX As part of the complaint against Delysium, FTX claimed its defunct trading arm, Alameda Research, paid $1 million in January 2022 for 75 million of the gaming firm’s AGI tokens. It claimed the original token launch was in April 2023, and Alameda Research’s share of the tokens was subject to a vesting schedule that started with 20% unlocking after 12 months. However, FTX said the timeframe was extended to 48 months and then halted altogether due to its bankruptcy following its collapse in November 2022. Meanwhile, FTX’s complaint against marketplace NFT Stars claimed it paid $325,000 in November 2021 for 1.35 million SENATE tokens and 135 million SIDUS tokens. After a partial delivery, FTX claimed NFT Stars halted delivery of the remaining 831,000 SENATE tokens and 83 million SIDUS tokens, also due to the bankruptcy proceedings, the company claimed. FTX wants tokens plus damages FTX asked the court to award it the remaining tokens plus damages, arguing the tokens hit a peak value and could have been sold for a profit had they been delivered on time. Delysium’s token AGI hit a peak price of $0.672 in May 2024, according to CoinGecko. It has since lost 90% of its value and is trading for $0.067. SENATE reached $5.85 in January 2022 but has since lost 99% of its value, while Sidus hit its top price so far of $0.19 in January 2022 as well, but has since plunged 99%, CoinGecko data shows . NFT Stars and Delysium didn’t immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s requests for comment. FTX has been trying to claw back funds it claims are owed to the collapsed crypto exchange.

Biggest real-world asset flow to Ethereum yet. — Eric Conner (@econoar) April 30, 2025 Ethereum Industry Standard for RWA The BlackRock Treasury Trust Fund is a money market fund that invests only in short-term US Treasury securities to provide income while preserving liquidity and principal. It keeps fees low and is designed for very low-risk, stable returns. The new tokenized DLT shares of its $150 billion Treasury Trust Fund will use blockchain technology to track ownership via BNY Mellon. BlackRock previously launched the BlackRock USD Institutional Digital Liquidity Fund (BUIDL) on the Ethereum blockchain, in partnership with Securitize. It allows qualified investors to earn yields through tokenized US Treasury securities on Ethereum . Onchain Foundation head of research Leon Waidmann reported that 93% of BlackRock’s BUIDL is on Ethereum. The fund currently has $2.34 billion in assets under management on Ethereum, according to rwa.xyz. “Institutions follow deep liquidity, credible neutrality, and battle-tested security,” he said before adding, “ETH is already their settlement layer.” “BlackRock is building on Ethereum. They’re betting on ETH as the leading ecosystem,” said researcher “CryptoGoos,” who added that Ethereum is “extremely undervalued.” BlackRock is building on Ethereum.

Transactions that currently take days would clear in seconds. And billions of dollars currently immobilized by settlement delays could be reinvested immediately back into the economy, generating more growth,” he added.

The asset has struggled to make any progress above $1,800 over the past week and is still lingering around levels last seen in September 2023. ETH is still 63% down from its 2021 peak price and has declined almost 50% since the beginning of the year, but analysts and advocates still think it will reach five figures soon. Nevertheless, institutions appear to be warming to cut-price Ether as BlackRock’s spot ETH ETF (ETHA) has scooped up $162 million worth of the asset over the past four trading days.

In an interview with The National , Eric Trump, son of President Donald Trump, touted Dubai as a leading global investment destination. “It’s become a safe haven for so many people,” he said, highlighting the city’s appeal to investors from Europe, Asia, and Africa. “Dubai has really become the epicentre.” Trump Expands Dubai Footprint with New Luxury Tower The Trump International Hotel and Tower in Dubai, unveiled earlier this year, is the latest in the family’s partnership with UAE-based Damac Properties. The project will feature a branded hotel, luxury residences, a private clubhouse, and what is being billed as the world’s tallest swimming pool. Completion is expected within five years. Apartments in the tower will start at around $1 million, with three- and four-bedroom units available. Two penthouses are expected to sell for $20.4 million each. While pricing reflects the ultra-luxury nature of the development, the crypto-friendly payment option positions the project to attract digital asset holders.

However, its property market has also drawn scrutiny. Investigations, including a major 2023 leak of property records, have raised concerns about the city’s role in facilitating money laundering and hosting illicit capital from sanctioned individuals and criminal networks. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) has linked Dubai real estate to money laundering, drug trafficking, and organized crime operations. The Dubai tower is the latest chapter in the Trump family’s growing involvement in crypto. What began with a line of Trump-branded NFTs has evolved into a sprawling portfolio that now includes meme coins, stablecoins, DeFi ventures, and partnerships with crypto firms. The Trump Media & Technology Group has also floated the idea of integrating digital wallets into its Truth Social platform. Eric Trump has recently stepped up his crypto presence, accepting an advisory role at Japanese firm Metaplanet and appearing at industry events like Token2049 in Dubai, where he’s scheduled to speak alongside entrepreneur Justin Sun later this week. Trump’s Truth+ Considers Adding Crypto Wallet and Token As reported, Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the media company behind Truth Social, is weighing the launch of a utility token and a digital wallet as part of an expansion of its streaming platform, Truth+. The potential move was revealed in a letter sent to shareholders by CEO and chairman Devin Nunes on Tuesday, ahead of the company’s annual shareholder meeting. According to Nunes, the proposed utility token would be part of a rewards program and could initially be used to pay for subscriptions to Truth+. He added that over time, the token may be used across additional services within the broader Truth ecosystem.

PayPal said in an April 29 regulatory filing that the SEC concluded its investigation into PayPal USD (PYUSD) and wouldn’t be taking any action. The company said it received a subpoena from the SEC’s Division of Enforcement over its stablecoin in November 2023. “The subpoena requests the production of documents. We are cooperating with the SEC in connection with this request,” PayPal stated at the time. In its latest filing, the firm said the SEC notified it in February that the agency “was closing this inquiry without enforcement action.” PayPal has said its stablecoin is 100% redeemable for US dollars and “fully backed” by dollar deposits, including short-term treasuries and cash equivalents. However, the stablecoin has struggled to gain momentum in a crowded market dominated by rivals Tether and Circle. PYUSD has a market capitalization of just $880 million, less than 1% of Tether’s ( USDT ) $148.5 billion. PayPal’s stablecoin has seen better growth this year with a 75% increase in PYUSD circulating supply since the beginning of 2025, according to CoinGecko. It remains down 14% from its peak supply of just over $1 billion in August 2024. PayPal USD market capitalization. Source: CoinGecko Earnings on PYUSD, Coinbase partnership That growth could be bolstered by a company announcement on April 23 introducing rewards for PYUSD in a new loyalty offering that will enable US users to earn 3.7% annually for holding the asset on the platform. Meanwhile, on April 24, PayPal announced a partnership with Coinbase to increase the adoption of PYUSD. “We are excited to drive new, exciting, and innovative use cases together with Coinbase and the entire cryptocurrency community, putting PYUSD at the center,” said Alex Chriss, PayPal President and CEO.

Speaking to Bloomberg News live at the Rio de Janeiro Web Summit on Tuesday, she added that Bitcoin accumulation remains a government priority. “Bitcoin keeps being an important project,” she noted. “There is an asset accumulation that we’re seeing from the government perspective, from the private sector perspective.” The Salvadoran government reached a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), last December, after four years of negotiations. They agreed on a $1.4 billion loan program to be disbursed over 40 months. The international financial body highlighted the reduced risks from Bitcoin adoption, which had been a major sticking point. After receiving $1.4 billion in funding, the country made a series of pledges, including scaling back its Bitcoin buying spree.

However, in a recent press briefing , Rodrigo Valdes, IMF’s director of the Western Hemisphere Department, confirmed that EL Salvador “continues to comply with their commitment of non-accumulation of bitcoin by the overall fiscal sector.” “The program of El Salvador is not about Bitcoin. It’s much more, much deeper in structural reforms, in terms of governance, in terms of transparency,” he said. Further, Bitcoin Office, which oversees the coin accumulation, posted on social media last week that the purchases still continue.

The bill introduced by Senator Bill Hagerty in February and passed by the Senate Banking Committee in March, seeks to regulate the issuance of stablecoins in the United States . Under the GENIUS (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins) Act, stablecoin issuers would be required to be licensed entities, known as “permitted payment stablecoin issuers.” What Does the GENIUS Act Mean? The GENIUS Act is designed to bring much-needed clarity and structure to the growing stablecoin market. Complementing the GENIUS Act, the STABLE Act has been introduced in the Republican-controlled House. Together, the two bills aim to set clear regulatory guidelines for the issuance of dollar-pegged stablecoins—cryptocurrencies intended to maintain a stable value by being backed by real-world assets. Currently, stablecoins are a popular digital dollar used for fast, low-cost payments. However, the absence of clear regulations has led to concerns around safety and trust. The GENIUS Act addresses these concerns by mandating that stablecoin issuers hold full reserves, comply with anti-money-laundering regulations, and undergo regular audits. The act also makes clear that stablecoins are not classified as securities or commodities, resolving a key area of confusion. With these measures in place, the GENIUS Act aims to foster safer growth for stablecoins, positioning them as potential competitors to traditional payment systems in the future. Broader Regulatory Context The GENIUS Act is part of a broader push for stablecoin regulation. In January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order forming a working group to explore stablecoin regulations and the possibility of creating a national crypto stockpile. However, while executive orders signal intent, they lack the legal weight of Congressional approval. The timing of Trump’s order has raised some concerns, particularly after World Liberty Financial—a crypto firm backed by his family—launched the USD1 stablecoin. Critics, mainly from the Democratic camp, argue that Trump’s influence, combined with his financial ties to the firm, creates a significant conflict of interest as Congress debates this critical piece of crypto legislation. As the Senate prepares to vote on the GENIUS Act, the future of stablecoin regulation in the U.S. hangs in the balance. FAQ What is a Stablecoin? A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a stable value by being pegged to real-world assets, like the U.S. dollar. How Will the GENIUS Act Impact Stablecoin Issuers in the U.S.? The GENIUS Act will require stablecoin issuers to hold full reserves, comply with audits, and follow anti-money laundering rules. What Are the Key Requirements for Stablecoin Issuers Under the GENIUS Act?

The delegation plans “technical discussions” with staff at the office of the United States Trade Representative. Their goal is to win exemptions, or at least softer terms, for automobiles, steel, and other goods before the Trump administration’s tariffs resume on 8 July after a temporary pause. Rates of up to 25% were announced in March and are to apply unless exceptions are granted. Last week, Industry Minister Ahn Duk-geun and Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok visited the U.S. capital, where the two allies agreed to draw up a package that could remove the planned duties. Wednesday’s trip is meant to carry that work forward. Negotiations between South Korea and the U.S. have not begun yet Officials in Seoul stress negotiations have not yet begun. Instead, both sides are laying the groundwork for future talks, likely to stretch beyond South Korea’s 3 June presidential election and the seating of a new government. Domestic politics are a factor in Washington. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters on Tuesday that some partners are “much more keen to come to the table, get this done, and then go home and campaign on it.” Asked whether the remark pointed at Seoul, Choi replied that progress is “moving very slowly” and said Bessent’s words were not aimed at South Korea. Seoul has asked for exemptions on cars, steel and several other items and has offered cooperation on shipbuilding, energy projects and the reduction of trade imbalances. The ministry’s submission lists electric vehicles, steel sheets, ship components and consumer electronics among the goods it wants spared. Vice Industry Minister Park Sung-taek told parliament this week that U.S. red tape blocks shipbuilding discussions. He pointed to the Jones Act, which requires vessels carrying goods between U.S. ports to be built domestically, and said the rule must be eased before discussions can move forward. “So we are conveying this to the U.S. and expect to discuss them going forward,” Park said. Separately, South Korea is in talks with Alaska over a USD $44 billion liquefied natural gas project that Washington hopes to finance with funds from South Korea and Japan. The two countries plan to review what Washington calls non-tariff barriers, including currency practices and regulations affecting automobiles, rice and beef imports over the coming months.

TBF will offer accredited investors exposure to some of the around $2.4 billion of outstanding bonds issued by Telegram , providing institutional-grade yield products that will also be available as collateral for on-chain borrowing and product development on TON, Libre said. “What we’ve created is like a fixed income fund that acquires the bonds and then we tokenize the fund,” Libre CEO Avtar Sehra in an interview. “When you purchase units in the fund these are on the TON chain, giving you access to the returns of the underlying bonds themselves. This opens up opportunities to use the bonds for collateral, ease of transfers, etc, to ultimately create utility with these financial instruments.” The past year or two has seen a rush to create blockchain-based representations of real world assets (RWAs), bringing the traditional finance world rapidly within the ambit of crypto and decentralized finance (DeFi). Sehra said many of his customers want either tokenized money market products because they're looking for quick access to cash, or something that’s associated with an ecosystem they are involved in or work within. The TON network was originally developed by Telegram before continuing as an independent operation. Over the last year or so, TON has been focused on bringing a large swathe of Telegram’s 950 million-plus users on-chain. Libre has already tokenized over $200 million in assets across funds from leading institutions including BlackRock, Brevan Howard, Hamilton Lane, and Laser Digital. “Our objective isn't just to tokenize things for the sake of tokenizing them,” Sehra said. “I think the real value in tokenizing traditional financial instruments is unlocking the utility of those assets.”",Finance|Tokenization|Telegram|TON|News,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|TON,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-04-30 06:00:00

Here’s What Is Coming,https://timestabloid.com/may-2-could-change-everything-for-xrp-heres-what-is-coming/,"A pivotal date is fast approaching in the ongoing legal and regulatory odyssey surrounding Ripple and its native token, XRP. On May 2, Ripple Executive Chairman Chris Larsen is set to meet with Paul Atkins, the newly appointed Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This development , brought to public attention by John Squire via X, is fueling a fresh wave of speculation across the crypto industry about what could be a transformative shift in the future of digital asset regulation in the United States. May 2 could change everything for $XRP Chris Larsen (Ripple) will meet with new SEC Chairman Paul Atkins. A pro-innovation shift? End of the legal saga? The future of crypto regulation in the U.S. is on the line. pic.twitter.com/oYijYOHddw — John Squire (@TheCryptoSquire) April 29, 2025 Why This Meeting Matters Since December 2020, Ripple has been embroiled in a protracted legal battle with the SEC, which alleges that the company conducted an unregistered securities offering through the sale of XRP. The case has had sweeping implications—not just for Ripple, but for the entire crypto industry, casting a long shadow of regulatory uncertainty over digital asset innovation in the U.S. Now, with Paul Atkins, a known proponent of market-friendly regulation and technological advancement, stepping into the SEC’s leadership role, the tides may be turning. Chris Larsen’s upcoming meeting with Atkins marks the first major dialogue between Ripple and the commission under new leadership, potentially laying the groundwork for a more pragmatic, innovation-driven approach to crypto policy. A Shift Toward Pro-Innovation Regulation? Paul Atkins, who previously served as an SEC Commissioner from 2002 to 2008, has historically advocated for less burdensome regulation and greater market efficiency. His return as Chairman has already sparked optimism among blockchain proponents who argue that outdated regulatory frameworks are stifling innovation in the U.S. fintech sector. If Atkins’ leadership reflects his past philosophy, the SEC may finally consider clarifying crypto asset classifications, providing a path to compliance for legitimate blockchain projects, and possibly reevaluating ongoing enforcement actions, including the Ripple lawsuit. In this light, May 2 isn’t just a meeting—it could be the turning point that reshapes the U.S. regulatory stance on digital assets. For XRP holders and Ripple investors, the implications are enormous. Should the meeting lead to renewed negotiations or policy recalibrations, XRP could shed its long-standing legal baggage and reemerge as a leading player in the global remittance and cross-border payments space. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The End of the Legal Saga? While no official statements have been released regarding the agenda of the May 2 meeting, market sentiment suggests that a settlement or resolution of the SEC v. Ripple case may be within reach. This would not only unshackle XRP from its regulatory limbo but could also set a precedent for how other digital assets are treated in future litigation. Ripple has already notched partial victories in the legal arena, most notably Judge Analisa Torres’ July 2023 ruling that XRP sales on public exchanges did not constitute securities offerings. However, the case has dragged on with unresolved issues around institutional sales and financial penalties. A strategic discussion between Larsen and Atkins could accelerate a settlement timeline or at least foster a collaborative tone that has been sorely missing in crypto-regulatory relations. A Broader Implication for the Crypto Market Beyond XRP, this meeting signals something more profound: the U.S. government may be ready to course-correct its approach to digital assets. As other jurisdictions like the UK, EU, and UAE sprint ahead with clear regulatory frameworks, the U.S. has risked losing its edge in blockchain innovation. A thaw in relations between Ripple and the SEC could open the door for industry-wide reform, giving crypto companies the clarity and support they need to thrive. For now, all eyes are on May 2. As John Squire aptly hinted in his X post, this meeting could be the moment everything changes—for Ripple, for XRP, and the future of cryptocurrency in America.

For inflows to increase again, Balchunas said ETH would need a multimonth run along with a strong narrative. Spot Ethereum ETFs being able to stake a portion of the tokens under their control may not help garner inflows without a more sustained rally in the token’s price, says Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. Balchunas said on an April 29 episode of the New Era Finance Podcast that staking being approved for Ether ( ETH ) ETFs would have “a little” impact on inflows, adding “it’s only going to help — it can’t hurt.” ETFs to do well on price rally However, Balchunas noted that one of the main reasons for the weak inflows into Ether ETFs since their July launch in the US is that ETH has yet to sustain a prolonged rally. “The bigger problem with Ethereum is performance; it just doesn’t ever go on a nice long rally.” He added that when Ether’s price surged during a run in December, there was a direct correlation with an increase in inflows. Donald Trump’s election win in November sparked a crypto market rally which saw ETH surge 71% to reach $4,107 on Dec. 16. From Nov. 22, spot Ether ETFs saw a 19-day positive inflow streak, amassing approximately $2.44 billion in inflows, according to Farside data. Ether is trading at $1,809 at the time of publication. Source: CoinMarketCap However, since tapping the $4,107 price level, Ether entered a downtrend and has since fallen 56% to trade around $1,809 at the time of publication, according to CoinMarketCap data. Balchunas said that for inflows to pick up again, Ether would need a “multimonth run” paired with a “strong narrative.” “It needs something that is more than just a good week here and there,” he added. Balchunas noted that after the Ether ETFs launched, the price “went down quickly,” making any recovery difficult, unlike spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw Bitcoin ( BTC ) hit a new all-time high just two months after they launched in January 2024. “When you launch an ETF, and you have that sort of performance out of the gate, it’s tough,” he said. Related: Ethereum’s ‘capitulation’ suggests ETH price is undervalued: Fidelity report US ETF issuers are still waiting for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to allow Ether ETFs to offer staking after filing numerous requests for permission earlier this year Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart said that “it’s possible they could be approved for staking early, but the final deadline is at the end of October.” “Potential intermediate deadlines before the final approval (or denial) are in late May and late August,” he added.

Despite $1 billion inflows in BlackRock’s IBIT ETF, Bitcoin has stayed below $95,000. After a week of holding steady, major altcoins broke key resistance levels on Tuesday. Ethereum and Cardano led the way with 2% gains, outpacing Bitcoin’s 0.6% rise. This shows growing momentum for altcoins, with many market watchers hinting that altcoin season could be here. ADA Set For Major Breakout After a strong recovery last week, Cardano is currently trading at $0.7019, up 0.4% in the past day. Analyst Mintern believes that ADA could be gearing up for a major breakout. The current setup mirrors the 2020 inverse head-and-shoulders pattern that led to an explosive rally. He believes that the real bull run hasn’t even started yet. Analyst Ali Martinez also believes that Cardano is heading toward a crucial test at $0.74; if it breaks above, it could rally to $0.88.

The queue for ETF approvals already has 72 applications for even smaller altcoins. Some of those funds may have much lower odds of approval, and are yet to file all the required forms. The long-awaited ETFs may keep seeing delays in the short term, with the first approvals expected toward the last quarter of 2025. ETFs have taken years for their first approvals, based on the SEC procedure. Delays are common for ETF approvals, as the SEC delayed their decision on several funds. The delays affected the XRP spot ETF by Franklin Templeton, as well as the DOGE ETF and Ethereum Staking ETFs. In total, five ETF were delayed for further revision and discussion. Despite attempts to launch ETFs for niche tokens or even memes, most bids are for Solana or XRP-based funds. A total of 19 XRP funds are awaiting approval, with no hard deadline, as most are at a different stage in their applications. Despite the heightened sentiment for XRP, the asset traded in its usual range, at around $2.24 after the latest fund delay. Niche applications include Polkadot and Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), though those retain low odds of approval. The biggest shift in ETFs permissions may be the addition of staking, where applicable, for Ethereum and Solana investors. Polymarket odds expect a slow summer for ETFs Polymarket estimates match the general odds by Bloomberg’s analysts. The prediction market has relatively low odds for approvals in Q2, but higher odds for the end of 2025. The odds of approval before the end of Q2 are currently falling rapidly after the latest series of SEC delays. The Solana ETF is a highly volatile market, currently pointing between odds of 83% and 91%. | Source: Polymarket The most active Polymarket pair is for the Solana ETF approval by the end of 2025. The market shows odds of 83%, lower than the 90% proposed by Bloomberg. The market is highly volatile, though with volumes of around $142K at this point. Other relatively high odds for ETF include Cardano (ADA), Litecoin (LTC), and XRP, with the highest odds of 87%. The ETF narrative no longer boosts altcoins as it did during the run-up to the Ethereum ETF approvals. Despite this, interest in launching new funds supports a selection of altcoins from older bull markets. The addition of those assets sparks hopes of recovery after years of trading far from peak valuations. ETF effects on crypto prices remain unpredictable.

However, despite these promising signs, XRP’s potential gains appear limited compared to the meteoric rise predicted for Mutuum Finance (MUTM) in Q2 2025. The pre-sale currently stands at Phase 4 while investors actively participate in this stage. Institutional investors have actively acquired MUTM tokens at the Phase 4 price of $0.025 per token because Phase 5 will raise the value to $0.03. Over 9100 unique investors have snapped tokens raising more than $7.2 million in funds. Phase 4 participants will achieve a 140% investment growth when the token reaches its official $0.06 launch price. Existing investors see Mutuum Finance as a standout altcoin for 2025 which provides better monetary potential than projected XRP market expansion. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges with Growing Investor Interest Mutuum Finance has established rapid growth as a decentralized lending platform because of its groundbreaking dual lending model. The presale data shows that more than 9,100 investors are participating and have collectively raised $7.2 million in funds. Investors expect a 20% increase in the token value because the price tier of $0.025 in Phase 4 will transition to $0.03 in Phase 5. The official launch of Mutuum Finance will reward phase 4 buyers with a 140% profit as the token is set for market debut at a $0.06 price. The stability of Mutuum Finance contrasts with the recently seen XRP volatility since it provides suitable investments for DeFi sector participants. The platform is also set to reward its biggest 50 holders with bonus tokens as part of a recently launched leaderboard. Mutuum Finance disrupts the decentralized finance (DeFi) market through the unification of Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending mechanisms. Through P2C model users provide liquidity to smart contract-based pools using USDT to obtain passive income. Users can eliminate intermediaries under the P2P model because transactions directly connect P2P. Mutuum Finance connects P2C and P2P lending models which results in a smooth secure and efficient DeFi solution for users who want to earn returns through their investments.

BlackRock , managing trillions in assets, has taken a significant step towards integrating traditional finance with digital asset technology. The firm has filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to introduce a groundbreaking Digital Share Class for one of its colossal funds. This isn’t just any fund; it’s a $150 billion money market fund, making this development particularly noteworthy. What Exactly are BlackRock DLT Shares? According to reports, including insights from ETF analyst Henry Jim on X, BlackRock’s filing proposes a new share class specifically named ‘DLT Shares’. The ‘DLT’ here stands for Distributed Ledger Technology, the underlying technology powering blockchains. The core idea is to use blockchain technology to represent ownership of shares in the fund. Here are the key details emerging from the filing: Fund Involved: The filing pertains to a $150 billion money market fund managed by BlackRock. Money market funds are popular investment vehicles known for their stability and liquidity, typically investing in high-quality, short-term debt instruments. The New Class: The proposed share class is called ‘DLT Shares’, indicating its reliance on distributed ledger technology. Technology Use: The intention is to leverage blockchain technology to reflect ownership records of these DLT Shares. This suggests a move towards tokenization, where traditional assets are represented digitally on a blockchain. Key Partner: The Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) is designated as the sole distributor for these DLT Shares. BNY Mellon has been increasingly active in the digital asset space, offering crypto services to institutional clients, making them a logical partner for this initiative. This move by BlackRock, often seen as a bellwether for institutional adoption, is a strong indicator of the growing interest in leveraging blockchain technology for traditional financial products. Why Tokenized Assets for Money Market Funds? The concept of Tokenized Assets is gaining traction across the financial industry. Applying this to money market funds offers several potential advantages that could modernize and enhance these traditional investment vehicles. Tokenization essentially breaks down the ownership of an asset into digital tokens recorded on a blockchain. For money market funds, this could mean: Increased Efficiency: Settlement times could potentially be reduced from days to minutes or even seconds, facilitated by the near real-time nature of blockchain transactions. Enhanced Transparency: Ownership records on a public or permissioned blockchain could offer greater transparency and auditability. Improved Accessibility: While this specific filing targets institutional investors through BNY Mellon, tokenization generally holds the promise of making assets more accessible and potentially enabling fractional ownership more easily in the future. Greater Liquidity: Tokenized assets can theoretically be traded 24/7 on digital asset platforms, potentially increasing liquidity compared to traditional trading hours. Streamlined Processes: Automation of certain processes like dividend distribution or redemptions could become more efficient through smart contracts. By creating a Digital Share Class , BlackRock is exploring how these blockchain-native benefits can be applied to a highly regulated and widely used traditional financial product like a money market fund. The Significance of the SEC Filing Any major financial product launch in the U.S. requires regulatory approval, and an SEC Filing is a critical step in that process. BlackRock’s decision to file with the SEC for the DLT Shares is highly significant for several reasons: Regulatory Engagement: It shows BlackRock is actively engaging with regulators regarding the use of blockchain technology in mainstream financial products. This engagement is crucial for the broader adoption of tokenized assets. Precedent Setting: While not the first instance of exploring tokenization, a filing from an entity as large and influential as BlackRock for a fund of this size sets a powerful precedent. It signals to the market and other institutions that exploring tokenization is a serious and viable path. Potential Approval Pathway: The SEC’s response to this filing will be closely watched. A positive outcome could pave the way for similar initiatives from other asset managers and financial institutions. It helps define the regulatory landscape for tokenized securities. Institutional Confidence: The act of filing itself demonstrates BlackRock’s confidence in the potential of DLT to offer tangible benefits for fund management and ownership, even within the existing regulatory framework. The SEC’s review process will likely involve assessing how the proposed DLT Share class complies with existing securities laws, investor protection regulations, and operational requirements for money market funds. This filing is not just about BlackRock; it’s a test case for how regulators view the tokenization of traditional financial instruments. Bridging TradFi and Digital Assets This move by BlackRock represents another important bridge being built between traditional finance (TradFi) and the digital asset space. For years, the crypto world has envisioned a future where assets of all kinds are tokenized and traded on blockchains. BlackRock’s initiative brings that vision closer to reality for institutional-grade products like Money Market Funds . It’s a different approach than directly investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Instead, it’s about applying the technology that underpins cryptocurrencies (DLT) to existing, regulated financial products. This approach might be more palatable to traditional institutions and investors who are comfortable with established fund structures but see the potential efficiency gains offered by DLT. The partnership with BNY Mellon, a major player in custody and distribution for traditional assets, further underscores this bridging effort. They bring the necessary infrastructure and relationships within the traditional financial ecosystem to make DLT Shares accessible to the intended audience. Challenges and Considerations While the potential benefits are significant, introducing a Digital Share Class for a money market fund also comes with challenges: Regulatory Clarity: Although the SEC filing is a step towards engagement, complete regulatory frameworks for tokenized securities are still evolving globally. Technology Integration: Integrating DLT seamlessly with existing financial infrastructure requires significant technical effort and robust security measures. Interoperability: Ensuring these DLT Shares can interact with different platforms or other tokenized assets in the future will be key. Market Adoption: While BlackRock’s name carries weight, convincing a broad base of institutional investors to adopt a new share class based on relatively new technology will take time. Security Risks: Like any digital system, the DLT platform used will need stringent security protocols to protect against hacks or errors. These challenges are not insurmountable, but they require careful planning, robust technology, and ongoing dialogue with regulators and market participants. What Does This Mean for the Future? BlackRock’s SEC Filing for DLT Shares could be a harbinger of things to come. If successful, it could: Encourage other large asset managers to explore tokenization for their funds. Accelerate the development of infrastructure for tokenized securities. Increase institutional comfort levels with blockchain technology beyond just crypto spot ETFs. Potentially lead to the tokenization of other types of funds and assets, from bonds to real estate. This move solidifies the trend that distributed ledger technology is not confined to native cryptocurrencies but is increasingly being viewed as a foundational technology for the future of finance. It’s about creating more efficient, transparent, and potentially more accessible ways to manage and transfer value. Actionable Insights for Observers For those watching the intersection of traditional finance and digital assets, BlackRock’s DLT Shares filing provides several points of focus: Monitor the SEC Review: The outcome and details of the SEC’s review process will provide crucial insights into the regulatory path for tokenized securities. Watch BNY Mellon’s Role: As the sole distributor, BNY Mellon’s implementation and marketing efforts will be key to the adoption of these DLT Shares. Look for Similar Filings: See if other major asset managers follow suit with their own tokenization initiatives. Understand the Technology: While not needing to be a blockchain expert, understanding the basics of how DLT can represent asset ownership is valuable. Assess Market Reaction: Observe how institutional investors respond to the availability of this new share class. This development isn’t just news; it’s a case study in how large, established financial players are beginning to integrate disruptive technologies into their core offerings. Summary: A Digital Leap for BlackRock and Money Markets In conclusion, BlackRock’s filing with the SEC to launch a Digital Share Class , known as DLT Shares, for its $150 billion Money Market Funds is a landmark event. It signifies a serious institutional exploration into leveraging distributed ledger technology to potentially enhance the efficiency, transparency, and accessibility of traditional financial products. With BNY Mellon as the distributor and the SEC Filing process underway, this initiative is poised to offer valuable insights into the future of Tokenized Assets and the ongoing convergence of TradFi and digital finance. It underscores the growing belief that DLT is not just about cryptocurrencies, but a powerful tool for modernizing the global financial system.

According to the commentator, 74.1% of XRP investors are unfamiliar with the concept of “token velocity,” a fundamental aspect that influences the behavior of digital assets, including XRP. As explained, token velocity measures how often a token changes hands within a certain period. The formula is presented as total transaction volume divided by the circulating supply. A high token velocity means that tokens are frequently traded, while a low token velocity implies more holding by investors. The commentary stresses that while the idea appears simple, its consequences are profound. The direct impact of token velocity on asset prices was a central point of the commentary. High velocity tends to apply downward pressure on a token’s price, as frequent trading increases available supply on exchanges. In contrast, low velocity, associated with holding behavior, typically supports upward price movements due to restricted supply. This relationship is framed as a basic application of supply and demand principles within the cryptocurrency market. How XRP’s Design Drives High Token Velocity The commentator specifically points to XRP’s intended functionality as a payment and liquidity solution as a driver of its high token velocity. Within RippleNet and On-Demand Liquidity (ODL), XRP facilitates instant transaction settlements. As a result, banks and institutions often purchase XRP, transfer it across borders, and immediately sell it, causing rapid turnover of the token. According to the commentary, this inherent design focus on speed and liquidity has unintended consequences for price appreciation. Unlike assets such as Bitcoin, which is often held as a store of value and exhibits low velocity, XRP’s structure causes it to be treated more like a transactional tool. The situation is further amplified by significant trading volumes on cryptocurrency exchanges and periodic escrow releases that increase the circulating supply. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Potential Solutions to Manage Token Velocity The commentary suggests several strategies that could help mitigate XRP’s high token velocity. These include introducing staking mechanisms to encourage long-term holding, implementing token burns to reduce overall supply, and developing new use cases such as tokenizing real-world assets. Each approach aims to incentivize holding behavior and lower the rate at which XRP changes hands. The comparison to other major digital assets provides additional context. Bitcoin is noted for its low velocity due to a widespread “HODL” culture, while Ethereum exhibits a moderate velocity due to its use in decentralized finance and staking mechanisms. Stablecoins, commonly used for transactions and trades, display ultra-high velocity, a behavior pattern to which XRP is currently closer. Investor Implications and Closing Observations The commentary from “All Things XRP” delivers a cautionary message to XRP investors. It stresses that simply holding XRP with the expectation of future price surges may overlook the asset’s fundamental design. He says the likelihood of price appreciation hinges on massive adoption and real-world demand, rather than the mere passage of time. The analysis concludes by emphasizing that token velocity is a crucial but often overlooked concept in the broader cryptocurrency landscape. A deeper understanding of this factor, especially in the context of XRP, could equip investors with more realistic expectations and smarter strategies moving forward.

Fidelity Explained!,https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/is-it-bullish-time-for-ethereum-eth-fidelity-explained/,"The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, Ethereum (ETH), continues to lag behind Bitcoin with its weak performance. While Bitcoin (BTC) was racing from record to record, ETH could not keep up with the upward momentum in BTC and has been steadily declining against Bitcoin. While ETH is expected to make an attack like Bitcoin, surpass its 2021 ATH and reach new record levels, Fidelity has published a comprehensive report on Ethereum. Fidelity, one of the giant names in the industry, stated that Ethereum was below its fair value and interpreted ETH's weakness in the first quarter as a buying opportunity. Related News: 50-Year Analyst Peter Brandt Has Issued a Warning for Ethereum (ETH) This Time! Fidelity Digital Assets noted that multiple on-chain metrics suggest that the ETH price has bottomed and is trading undervalued. Ethereum had a tough first quarter, falling 45% from its January peak of $3,579. ETH also formed a death cross in March, a traditionally bearish technical signal. However, Fidelity noted that despite the short-term downturn, Ethereum is showing bullish signals. “Despite multiple on-chain indicators, we remain optimistic for Etheruem in the medium to long term. On March 9, the MVRV Z-Score, which compares market value to realized value, fell to -0.18, entering undervalued territory. Historically, these levels have signaled market bottoms and potential buying opportunities, suggesting that Ethereum is cheap compared to its fair value. Again, the Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) ratio has fallen to 0, indicating that unrealized profits are equal to losses, with a large portion of investors holding ETH at a loss. This is another sign that is often associated with market capitulation and possible bottoms as weak hands sell.” Fidelity noted that the data signaled a bottom and rise for Ethereum, but also warned that past trends suggest further declines are possible before a recovery. *This is not investment advice.

In a regulatory filing on Apr. 29, PayPal confirmed the SEC had wrapped up its inquiry and decided not to pursue enforcement. The investigation began in November 2023, when the SEC’s Division of Enforcement issued a subpoena asking PayPal to provide documents related to the launch and structure of PYUSD. The company said it cooperated fully. In its latest filing, it revealed that the SEC informed it in February that it “was closing this inquiry without enforcement action.” The stablecoin, launched in August 2023, is fully backed by U.S. dollar deposits, including short-term Treasuries and other cash equivalents. It is designed to be redeemable 1:1 for U.S. dollars and is primarily issued on the Ethereum ( ETH ) and Solana ( SOL ) blockchains.

After reaching a $1 billion market cap in August 2024, PYUSD’s circulating supply dropped to $460 million before rebounding to its current $880 million supply, as per DeFiLlama data . To boost adoption, PayPal introduced a 3.7% annual reward for PYUSD holdings on Apr. 23. Users in the U.S. holding PYUSD in PayPal or Venmo wallets will earn daily rewards, credited monthly, starting summer of 2025. Rewards can be used for purchases, peer-to-peer transfers, crypto exchanges, or international payments through PayPal’s Xoom service. PayPal CEO Alex Chriss said the company sees stablecoins as a key part of future payments , adding that PYUSD is already being used for commerce, crypto, and peer-to-peer transfers. PayPal still needs to be aware of the dangers associated with potential abuse and future regulations . It pointed out that the stablecoin’s reputation might be impacted by any legal issues involving its partners or the use of PYUSD in illegal activities.

According to a letter addressed to shareholders, CEO and Chairman of Trump Media Devin Nunes declared the platform is considering a number of crypto-related innovations for users within what the firm deems as a ‘Truth ecosphere.’ Among those proposed features, the company is considering the addition of a rewards program involving its own utility token for its streaming service, Truth+. The concept of a Truth+ digital wallet and token aligns with the company’s future plan to monetize Truth+ through advertising and a subscription package that offers users premium content. “We’re exploring the introduction of a utility token within a Truth digital wallet that can initially be used to pay for Truth+ subscription costs, and later be applied to other products and services in the Truth ecosphere,” wrote Nunes. If implemented, users would be able to use the Truth utility token to pay for various other products and services linked to Trump Media, potentially including the company’s social media platform Truth Social and its financial technology and financial services branch Truth.Fi.

The letter stated that the Truth.Fi’s ETFs would offer both cryptocurrencies and traditional equities. As previously reported by crypto.news, Truth.Fi has established a partnership with Crypto.com and asset manager Yorkville America Digital to launch its own customizable crypto-backed ETFs. To bring these proposed plans into reality, Trump Media is prepared to invest as much as $250 million of the company’s cash reserves, Bitcoin ( BTC ) investments and other cryptocurrencies or crypto-related securities, with custody provided by Charles Schwab. Trump Media and Technology Group became a publicly traded company in March 2024 and once reached a valuation nearing $8 billion. At press time, the company’s market cap currently stands at more than $5.5 billion. Since taking office, President Donald Trump has adopted a much more crypto-friendly approach compared to the Biden administration. So far, the Trump administration has issued an executive order to create a strategic Bitcoin reserve , pushed for stablecoin legislations and dissolved the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Unit through the U.S. Department of Justice. Most recently, the team behind the official Trump ( TRUMP ) meme coins announced that it will be holding an exclusive dinner with the president for the top 220 holders of the presidential meme coin.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As altcoin giants like Sui and Solana lead the latest market rally, rising project Remittix is stealing the spotlight with real-world payment solutions and strong early adoption. Table of Contents Sui remains thriving L1 powerhouse Solana hits new heights with market dominance Remittix continues to rise in value and adoptions This week, breakouts across the entire altcoin market have occupied the front pages of most crypto news outlets. Sui and Solana have been at the forefront of this new boom, with prices skyrocketing. Sui, a fast-growing Layer-1 project, recorded price growth of more than 18% in the past seven days as the need for decentralized gaming and AI applications on its network spiked. Solana’s price also shot up, thanks to a sensational recovery for a blockchain that seemed to have hit rock bottom after the FTX crash. However, while these popular names are surging, a new project is shaking up experts’ market forecasts as they tip it to be the best crypto to invest in this year. This PayFi breakout star, Remittix (RTX), is not just surviving the market but solving core real-world problems and attracting adoption. Sui remains thriving L1 powerhouse When Sui ( S UI ) launched, everyone wrote it off as “yet another Ethereum takeover.” Still, it has created its stand-out niche, concentrating on scalability, minimal fees, and a developer-focused ecosystem. Reviewing the market at press time, Sui’s price drifted around $3.57, rising dashingly from the start of the year when it exchanged hands for almost $0.90. Such a quick rise is thanks to several high-profile game studio partnerships and a torrent of new dApps building on the Sui blockchain. While Sui’s performance is remarkable, it still battles fierce competition from other next-gen networks focusing on the same sector. Sui’s growth will eventually rely on strengthening developer loyalty and beating rival ecosystems to market dominance. Solana hits new heights with market dominance Another spectacular coin is the Solana ( SOL ) crypto, which has continued its positive rebound. Coming off the back of 2022 chaos that almost broke its ecosystem, Solana’s price performance has returned with remarkable strength. Solana’s price is fast-rising to nearly $148, rising threefold from its low in mid-2023. The factors behind Solana’s revival include new DeFi protocols building and growing on Solana rather than Ethereum because of speed and cost, the preference for NFT marketplaces, and its thriving stablecoin ecosystem, which is much sought-after for real-world use. Thanks to its speed, which is comparable to old payment networks, and gas prices that are far less than a penny, Solana is dominating the Layer-1 sector. However, with the Solana price boom already over, several investors wonder if big profits still exist here. This question and the subsequent search have led them to undervalued projects like Remittix.

Remittix focuses on underserved areas like Southeast Asia and Africa. The project is already attracting users and recording a massive influx of investments before its final public launch. With a remarkably affordable value at just $0.0757 and having sold RTX tokens worth over $14.6 million before launch, Remittix is tipped to be today’s “under the radar” gem with tomorrow’s blue-chip prospect. Thanks to its real-world use cases, massive demand, and one of the largest sectors in the crypto space, Remittix looks primed to be the next big winner.

The letter, which arrived by mail, was made to look official with Ledger branding, business address, and a unique reference number. It asked the recipient to scan a QR code and input their wallet’s 24-word recovery phrase, claiming it was required for a “critical security update.” It also stated that failure to complete the “mandatory validation process” could lead to restricted access to the user’s crypto funds.

According to a Wednesday Reuters exclusive, Chinese authorities have not publicly announced the exemptions. Beijing seemingly wants to ease the country’s economic strain without appearing to have accepted defeat from US tariffs. Two individuals with direct knowledge of the situation said the list of products exempt from tariffs is being communicated privately to firms. Many of these firms rely on American technologies and had previously lobbied for relief. Pharmaceuticals, chips, and aircraft engines are already exempt Prior to April 27, China had already granted public tariff exemptions on a limited selection of imports, including pharmaceuticals, microchips, and aircraft engines. However, the existence of an unpublished “whitelist” of US goods qualifying for exemptions had not been reported until now. One source working for a drug company that imports US-made medicines said the Shanghai Pudong government contacted them on Monday about the new list. The source claimed that the company, which had pushed for a reprieve, depends heavily on American technology. “ We still have many technologies we need from the US ,” the person said. Another individual said some firms have been instructed to reach out to authorities and ask if their imported goods are eligible for tariff relief. Per an April 25 report from the Wall Street Journal , which cited a financial news update from Chinese outlet Caijing , China dropped tariffs on at least eight categories of US-made semiconductors. The article was later removed, but importers confirmed the changes to WSJ. A Shenzhen-based company listed the new exemptions on the Chinese social platform WeChat, including screenshots from a customs database showing zero percent tariff rates on specific US chip imports. Are the US and China negotiating? The behind-the-scenes concessions from Beijing and Washington could mean the two capitals have started negotiations or will soon. In mid-April, China insisted it would fight until the end unless the US rolls back its 145% tariff rates. Merely weeks later, US President Donald Trump said he is considering reducing the rates “substantially,” but not completely. President Trump, speaking Tuesday, said he believed a trade deal with China was possible but insisted that it would have to be fair. Beijing, however, has not mentioned or insinuated it would fall back on its tariff hikes. The Chinese government has been mostly “defiant” and refuted reports that any formal talks are ongoing. “ So much for ‘trade wars are easy to win.’ Turns out… when both countries depend on each other, the real war is about who can retreat more elegantly ,” said one user on X. In the southeastern port city of Xiamen, government officials distributed surveys to companies in the textiles and semiconductor sectors. The surveys asked about the products traded with the US and requested estimates on how tariffs have impacted business operations. Targeted relief instead of concessions Chatter on Chinese social media and industry experts say China is opting for targeted relief to its manufacturers, not sweeping exemptions. However, the focus of the trade tax waivers is on “irreplaceable” goods used for technological and medicinal purposes. According to Nick Marro, principal economist for Asia at the Economist Intelligence Unit, China needs to protect its economic interests rather than any willingness to strike a near-term deal. “ Higher tariffs on these goods would’ve risked significant blowback onto China’s tech industry ,” Marro said. “ These carve-outs are a necessary evil .” Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

The surge, largely attributed to renewed political support from U.S. President Donald Trump following his return to office, has revived bullish sentiment across digital assets. #Esceoggi #29aprile il 1° Rapporto sulla #StabiliitàFinanziaria del 2025, pubblicazione semestrale con le informazioni sulle condizioni del sistema finanziario italiano Lo trovi qui https://t.co/jSGLRh949B #RSF #Bankitalia pic.twitter.com/nbcNWtaMwt — Banca d'Italia (@bancaditalia) April 29, 2025 Trump’s Return Sparks Crypto Rally According to a recent report , Bitcoin led a market-wide surge after Trump re-entered the political stage with a pro-crypto agenda. His comeback helped propel the total crypto market capitalization to $2.75 trillion by March , with Bitcoin accounting for over 60% of that value. Contributing to the momentum is Trump Media & Technology Group’s announcement of a utility token and digital wallet to expand its Truth+ streaming service. This move has further reinforced perceptions of a crypto-friendly administration. Stablecoin Risks Could Trigger Market Shock Italy’s central bank is particularly concerned about the growing dominance of dollar-backed stablecoins such as USDT (Tether) and USDC (Circle) . These tokens are pegged to U.S. Treasuries, and officials warn that mass redemptions could destabilize global bond markets. “If large-scale withdrawals occur, it could trigger a shock across both U.S. and international financial systems,” the bank cautioned. EU Regulators Worry About Euro’s Future Despite the EU implementing its MiCA Regulation (Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) , Italian authorities fear it may not be sufficient to counter the rapid spread of crypto assets, especially stablecoins tied to the U.S. dollar. ECB President Christine Lagarde has echoed concerns that the euro’s influence could weaken if stablecoin adoption continues at its current pace. Italy is calling for deeper global cooperation to prevent systemic risks as crypto usage expands beyond tightly regulated sectors. U.S. Oversight Also Under Scrutiny In the United States, regulatory concerns are also mounting. President Trump has reportedly appointed pro-crypto officials to key regulatory positions and disbanded a Justice Department unit that previously focused on investigating crypto-related fraud. Adding to the controversy, Trump’s sons are supporting a new stablecoin , coinciding with the advancement of the GENIUS Act , a legislative proposal that critics argue could loosen crypto oversight and weaken investor protections. Why is Italy’s central bank so worried about crypto now? Because the recent crypto surge, driven by speculation and weak oversight, could cause financial instability. Why is Italy panicking over stablecoins like USDT and USDC? Because they’re tied to U.S. Treasuries, and a mass sell-off could disrupt global financial stability.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto Regulations,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-04-30 07:39:57

Have you been watching Ethereum (ETH) lately? It’s had a pretty good run, gaining over 10% in the past week. That’s exciting news for anyone holding ETH or looking at the market. However, as with any rally, it’s crucial to look beyond just the price chart and check the underlying health of the move. Right now, some key technical indicators are flashing signals that suggest this recent Ethereum rally might be running out of steam. BeInCrypto recently highlighted this potential shift, pointing to May as a potentially pivotal month for Ethereum’s price action. Why is Ethereum’s Rally Facing Headwinds? Analyzing Momentum Indicators Technical analysis uses various tools to understand market sentiment and predict potential future movements. Two important indicators are the Average Directional Index (ADX) and the Directional Movement Index (DMI). These help traders gauge the strength and direction of a trend. Understanding the Average Directional Index (ADX) The ADX is a lagging indicator that measures the strength of a trend, regardless of whether it’s an uptrend or a downtrend. It doesn’t tell you the direction, just how strong the current trend is. ADX values range from 0 to 100. Readings above 25 generally indicate a strong trend. Readings below 20 suggest a weak trend or that the asset is trading in a range. Values between 20 and 25 are often seen as a transition zone. The recent data for Ethereum shows the ADX dropping from 39 to 24.91 in just two days. This move from a level clearly indicating a strong trend (39) down towards the threshold of 25 suggests that the bullish momentum is significantly weakening. While 24.91 is *just* below 25, the rapid decline is what catches the eye and warrants attention for any crypto market analysis . Understanding the Directional Movement Index (DMI) The DMI complements the ADX by indicating the direction of the trend. It consists of two lines: the Positive Directional Indicator (+DI) and the Negative Directional Indicator (-DI). The +DI measures bullish pressure. The -DI measures bearish pressure. When +DI is above -DI, it suggests bullish sentiment is dominant. When -DI is above +DI, it suggests bearish sentiment is dominant. The DMI components for Ethereum have also seen a notable shift. Over three days, the +DI fell from 31.71 to 22.71, while the -DI rose from 7.16 to 17.68. This is a classic sign of weakening bullish control (+DI falling) and increasing bearish influence (-DI rising). This convergence and potential crossover of the +DI and -DI lines could signal growing downside risk for the Ethereum price . Let’s summarize the indicator changes: Indicator Previous Reading Current Reading Implication ADX 39 (Strong Trend) 24.91 (Weakening Trend) Loss of trend strength +DI 31.71 (Strong Bullish) 22.71 (Weakening Bullish) Decreasing buying pressure -DI 7.16 (Weak Bearish) 17.68 (Increasing Bearish) Increasing selling pressure What Key Price Levels Should Ethereum Investors Watch? Beyond indicators, watching specific support and resistance levels is crucial for predicting potential price movements. These levels often act as barriers where price direction might change. For Ethereum, two levels stand out based on recent price action: Resistance Level: $1,828 Ethereum has tested this level multiple times recently but hasn’t managed a decisive breakout. This acts as a ceiling that the bulls need to overcome. Actionable Insight: A strong, convincing break *above* $1,828, ideally with increased volume, would be a significant bullish signal. This could potentially invalidate the weakening momentum signals and fuel a rally towards the next major resistance area, possibly around $2,320. This is a key target in any bullish ETH price prediction scenario following a breakout. Support Levels: $1,749 and $1,689 The $1,749 level has been providing support during recent pullbacks. The $1,689 level is the next significant support below $1,749. Actionable Insight: If Ethereum fails to break resistance and the weakening momentum leads to a price decline, watching these support levels is critical. A slip below $1,749 would increase the likelihood of further downside. The next important level to monitor for a potential bounce or further breakdown is $1,689. Losing this level could signal a more significant correction. Putting it All Together: What Does This Mean for Your ETH Price Prediction? The combination of weakening momentum indicators (ADX and DMI) and the struggle to break key resistance at $1,828 paints a cautious picture for the immediate future of the Ethereum rally . While the recent gains are positive, the technical setup suggests that the path forward might be challenging. Challenges: The primary challenge is that the buying pressure seems to be decreasing while selling pressure is increasing. This makes a sustained push above resistance difficult and increases the risk of a price drop. Potential Benefits (if resistance breaks): Despite the current headwinds, a decisive breakout above $1,828 remains a possibility. If this happens, the potential upside towards $2,320 is significant, offering substantial gains for holders. Actionable Insights: Monitor Closely: Keep a close eye on both the $1,828 resistance and the $1,749 / $1,689 support levels. Price action around these points will be highly telling. Watch the Indicators: Observe if the ADX starts to turn back up (indicating trend strength returning) or if the +DI crosses back above the -DI (indicating bullish dominance returning). Conversely, watch for the -DI crossing above the +DI, which would be a bearish signal. Risk Management: Given the uncertainty, consider your risk exposure. This might involve setting stop-losses below key support levels or taking partial profits if you’ve benefited from the recent rally. Don’t Panic: Technical indicators provide probabilities, not certainties. The market is dynamic, and sentiment can change quickly. This crypto market analysis suggests that May could indeed be a critical month for Ethereum. Whether it breaks out to new local highs or pulls back to test lower support levels depends heavily on how these technical signals evolve and how price interacts with the crucial levels discussed. Conclusion: A Critical Juncture for Ethereum Ethereum’s recent performance has been encouraging, but the weakening signals from key momentum indicators like the ADX and DMI cannot be ignored. They serve as a warning that the current bullish momentum is decelerating. The price is currently navigating between crucial resistance at $1,828 and support at $1,749, with $1,689 below that. How Ethereum reacts at these levels, combined with the behavior of the technical indicators, will likely determine its next significant move. Investors and traders should remain vigilant, focusing on these key technical signposts to navigate the potential volatility ahead and refine their ETH price prediction .

In a recent X post , crypto analyst Edo Farina issued a stark warning to XRP holders, urging them to withdraw their holdings to cold storage in anticipation of a potential market-wide upheaval. His comments are igniting widespread conversation across the XRP community, especially given his assertion that banks and governments have already secured their XRP through escrow mechanisms. Not financial advice, but withdraw your $XRP to a cold wallet. When Tether collapses and the market crashes, tearing BTC apart, exchanges may freeze withdrawals. Banks and Governments already secured their XRP locked in escrow. — EDO FARINA 🅧 XRP (@edward_farina) April 27, 2025 Why Cold Storage Is Becoming Critical Farina’s message reflects growing anxiety over the future of centralized exchanges in a scenario where systemic risk events—like the collapse of Tether (USDT) —could severely destabilize crypto markets. If such a breakdown were to occur, it could lead to the kind of liquidity crisis that forces exchanges to freeze withdrawals, a practice not unheard of during volatile periods. In this context, Farina’s advice is clear: retain custody of your XRP before external factors take that choice away. His concerns echo sentiments from previous crises—such as the FTX collapse—when user funds became inaccessible in the blink of an eye. By highlighting the potential for a cascading failure that affects everything from Bitcoin’s stability to Tether’s solvency, Farina is drawing attention to a worst-case scenario that responsible investors must prepare for, even if it never materializes. Institutional Accumulation and XRP Escrow A key aspect of Farina’s statement is the claim that governments and financial institutions have already locked up large quantities of XRP in escrow. This assertion is not without precedent. Ripple Labs, the company behind the XRP Ledger, routinely releases XRP from its programmatic escrow system , with the intent of maintaining market stability and transparency. A significant portion of these escrowed holdings has reportedly been earmarked for partnerships with banks, remittance services, and central banks exploring cross-border solutions. While exact details on institutional XRP escrow agreements are closely guarded, Ripple’s long-standing alliances with financial giants—such as Santander, SBI Holdings, and Bank of America—have led many to speculate that a quiet accumulation has been underway for years. If true, this underscores the importance of XRP as a strategic asset for governments and financial entities preparing for a digitally connected, tokenized financial infrastructure. What Happens If Tether Falls? Tether (USDT), the dominant stablecoin in the crypto market, plays a crucial role in facilitating liquidity and price stability. A collapse in its value or trust could send shockwaves across every trading pair, especially on centralized exchanges that rely on Tether for settlement. In this type of contagion event, exchanges would likely implement emergency measures, such as halting redemptions and freezing asset withdrawals, leaving users without access to their funds. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Farina’s call to move XRP to cold wallets—secure, offline storage solutions—stems from this fear. Cold wallets are immune to exchange lockouts, custodial failures, or internet outages, making them a preferred option for long-term holders seeking to preserve control over their assets regardless of market turbulence. The Bigger Picture: A Geopolitical Play? The idea that banks and governments are already locking in XRP suggests more than just investment hedging. It implies a strategic positioning for the next evolution in global finance, where XRP could serve as a bridge currency in an interconnected system of CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies), tokenized real-world assets, and liquidity hubs. With Ripple already selected by several governments as a platform for CBDC pilot programs, and with more institutions exploring blockchain for cross-border settlements, XRP appears to be gaining traction as the infrastructure backbone for the coming financial paradigm. If this transformation accelerates, retail holders of XRP may find themselves holding an increasingly rare asset—assuming they’ve taken steps to secure it. Edo Farina’s warning is not an isolated cry of alarm, but rather a timely reminder of the importance of self-custody and strategic foresight in an unpredictable industry. As the regulatory climate tightens and financial institutions quietly deepen their blockchain integration, XRP holders are advised to think beyond short-term market moves and consider the long game. The question isn’t just whether XRP will survive market shocks. It’s whether everyday holders will still have access to it when the dust settles.

It operates on a scale from 0 to 100: 0-24: Extreme Fear (Investors are very worried, potentially a buying opportunity for the brave) 25-49: Fear (Market is anxious, uncertainty prevails) 50-54: Neutral (Balance between fear and greed) 55-74: Greed (Market is optimistic, prices may be overvalued) 75-100: Extreme Greed (Euphoria sets in, potential for a market correction) A move towards ‘Fear’ often signals that investors are getting nervous and selling off assets, potentially driving prices down. Conversely, a move towards ‘Greed’ suggests increasing optimism, potentially leading to speculative buying and price surges. How is the Crypto Fear and Greed Index Calculated? The index isn’t based on just one factor. It aggregates data from six different sources, each weighted to contribute to the final score. Understanding these components helps illuminate why the index moves the way it does: Volatility (25%): Measures the current `crypto volatility` compared to average levels over the last 30 and 90 days. High volatility often indicates a fearful market. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum with average values. High buying volume in a positive market indicates greed. Social Media (15%): Analyzes posts on platforms like Twitter, looking at specific hashtags, sentiment analysis, and how quickly interactions happen. High positive sentiment can indicate greed. Surveys (15%): Polls users to get their sentiment (this component is currently paused by Alternative). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Tracks the market cap share of Bitcoin relative to the total crypto market cap. Rising `Bitcoin dominance` can sometimes signal fear (investors moving to perceived ‘safer’ Bitcoin), while falling dominance can signal greed (investors speculating on altcoins). Google Trends (10%): Analyzes search queries related to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Rising search interest, especially for terms related to price or volatility, can indicate fear or greed depending on the specific terms. What Does Remaining in the ‘Greed’ Zone Signify? Despite the four-point drop, the index staying firmly in the ‘Greed’ zone at 56 suggests that while there might be a slight cooling of enthusiasm compared to the previous day, the overall market sentiment remains positive. This indicates that investors are still feeling optimistic about price prospects, are likely holding positions, or even buying on dips. A reading of 56 is not extreme greed (which starts at 75), but it’s clearly above the neutral point (50-54). This moderate ‘Greed’ could reflect underlying confidence in the market’s direction, perhaps buoyed by specific `cryptocurrency news` or broader economic factors, even if daily fluctuations introduce minor fear. Actionable Insights: How to Use the Index? It’s vital to remember that the Crypto Fear & Greed Index is a sentiment indicator, not a direct trading signal. It doesn’t tell you when to buy or sell, but rather gives you a snapshot of the prevailing mood. Here are some ways investors often consider using it: Contrarian Indicator: Some traders use the index as a contrarian signal, believing that ‘extreme fear’ can present buying opportunities (when others are panicking) and ‘extreme greed’ can signal a potential top (when the market is overheated). The current reading of 56 is not at either extreme, suggesting caution rather than a clear contrarian signal. Market Awareness: Simply being aware of the market’s general mood can help temper your own emotional responses. If the index is showing extreme greed, it might be a good time to question your own bullish biases and potential risks. If it shows extreme fear, it might be a moment to assess if the panic is justified or an overreaction. Contextual Tool: Use the index alongside other forms of analysis, such as technical indicators, fundamental analysis, and on-chain data. It provides emotional context to the price movements you are observing. The recent dip from 60 to 56, while keeping the index in ‘Greed’, could indicate that some of the factors contributing to the score, such as market momentum or perhaps a slight increase in volatility, have softened slightly. Monitoring these daily changes can provide nuanced insights into the market’s short-term emotional shifts. Conclusion The Crypto Fear & Greed Index provides a valuable, albeit simple, look into the collective psychology of the crypto market. Its current position at 56, within the ‘Greed’ zone, suggests continued optimism among participants, despite a minor recent decline. While not a crystal ball, understanding this index and its components – from `crypto volatility` and `Bitcoin dominance` to overall `crypto market sentiment` – is a useful addition to any crypto investor’s toolkit. It serves as a reminder that emotions play a significant role in market cycles, and staying informed about the prevailing mood, through indicators like this and reliable `cryptocurrency news`, can help you navigate the market more effectively.

Banks around the world will have to adopt cryptocurrency or go extinct in a decade, Trump predicted in an interview with CNBC’s Dan Murphy in Dubai on April 30. “The modern financial system is broken, it’s slow, it’s expensive,” the businessman said, adding that the existing banking system “favors the ultra-wealthy.” “It forced me into the crypto world,” he continued, adding: “And I’m telling you, if the banks don’t watch what’s coming, they’re going to be extinct in 10 years.” SWIFT is an “absolute disaster” While emphasizing the need for banks to closely monitor developments in the crypto industry, Trump highlighted the benefits of cryptocurrency’s underlying blockchain technology for the financial system. He slammed the existing cross-border transaction solutions like the global international messaging network SWIFT, which has often been criticized for its slow transactions. “There’s nothing that can be done on blockchain that can’t be done better than the way that the current financial institutions are working. SWIFT is an absolute disaster,” he stated. With the emergence of crypto, traditional payment tools like SWIFT are at risk of losing market share to decentralized alternatives, Trump said: “You can open up a DeFi [decentralized finance] app right now, you can open up any cryptocurrency app, and you can send money, wallet to wallet, instantaneously, without the expense, without the variability.” Banks pushing back, but the industry is bullish Trump’s warning comes amid many global banks still pushing back against cryptocurrency adoption, with the Bank of Italy slamming stablecoin growth and Bitcoin ( BTC ) investments. On the other hand, many industry executives are bullish on crypto adoption by banks already in 2025, amid governments like the US pushing a more crypto-friendly agenda. Trump’s new prediction comes in line with his previous bold forecasts on crypto. In December 2024, Eric Trump predicted that Bitcoin would inevitably hit $1 million per coin , while global governments and institutions would have to adopt the cryptocurrency to compete in the fast-growing market.

Strong spot price momentum and ETF inflows support a potential $100,000 push. Bull flag pattern suggests a $108,300 target if BTC breaks the $95,000 resistance. Bitcoin ( BTC ) price has rebounded by 28% from its five-month low below $75,000 reached on April 9. However, its failure to break above the $95,000 resistance level decisively has sparked concerns that the latest recovery may trap bulls. BTC/USD daily price chart. Source: Cointelegraph/ TradingView Bitcoin ETF flows provide a “more solid foundation” But another big crash may be averted as BTC price momentum is backed by elevated spot Bitcoin ETF inflows in recent days. This provides Bitcoin a “more solid foundation” to surge forward, according to market intelligence firm Glassnode. As Bitcoin edged above $95,000 , its 14-day price momentum indicator rose sharply from 58.7 to 82.1, as shown in the chart below. “This breakout pushed the momentum above the statistical high band, a rare occurrence that historically signals strong bullish momentum,” Glassnode said in its latest Weekly Market Pulse report. This indicator last crossed the statistical high band in November 2024, preceding a 61% rally in Bitcoin’s price to new all-time highs . Bitcoin price momentum indicator. Source: Glassnode Glassnode, however, warns that such high momentum also increases the likelihood of short-term cooling periods, explaining BTC’s current choppy price action . The onchain data provider added: “Sustained strength will require spot volume and demand to remain positive.” Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s spot Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) metric, which tracks the difference between taker buyers and sellers, remains close to the statistical high band despite a modest pullback over the last few days. The high CVD metric suggests that the buy pressure is “still relatively strong,” Glassnode said, adding: “This persistent positive aggression supports the bullish momentum seen in spot markets, although the slight softening hints that some profit-taking activity may be emerging as the price extends into higher ranges.” Bitcoin spot CVD.

Perhaps it was etched in its core and reiterated throughout the numerous market cycles, but something about the promise of “redefining the existing banking system” and becoming the new standard for international value transfer really stuck with people. In this article, we will drift apart from traditional technical Ripple price analysis and will look at something far more trivial. How much money would you have if you invested $1000 in XRP back in 2018? After all, the most common regret for most people is not investing in certain cryptocurrencies back in the days, when everything was supposedly a lot cheaper. We won’t dive into how absurd this notion is and why simply buying a coin doesn’t mean you will make money, even if it goes 100x in 8 years. XRP’s Price in 2018 For the sake of this particular article, we will take a few different price points: Average XRP price in 2018 Highest XRP price in 2018 Lowest XRP price in 2018 And in case you are wondering why did we choose 2018, well, it’s because that’s the year cryptocurrencies broke into the mainstream. So, data from CoinLore shows that the average price for XRP in 2018 was $0.66. Currently, the coin is trading at $2.22, meaning that your $1000 invested in 2018 would currently be $3360, representing a profit of around $2360. Moving forward, the highest XRP price in 2018, which is also the current all-time high, was $3.83, meaning that you would be sitting on a loss of around 42%. Your $1000 would now be $580. And last, but not least, what if you timed the absolute bottom in 2018? Well, that was around $0.24. Your $1000 would be abou $9250, representing gains upwards of $8,000. XRP’s price is up by 825% since then.

According to a shareholder letter dated April 29, CEO Devin Nunes outlined a vision where this utility token could be used initially to pay for Truth+ subscriptions, with later plans to expand its use across other Trump Media platforms, including Truth Social and the financial services branch Truth.Fi. Truth+ May Soon Accept Crypto for Subscriptions Nunes stated the crypto component would also serve as part of a broader rewards ecosystem that spans the company’s digital offerings. While details on timelines remain scarce, this signals the most serious crypto push yet from Trump Media, after months of hints and groundwork. The company previously filed a trademark in November with the US Patent and Trademark Office, covering digital wallet functionalities, crypto asset trading, and payment services. Truth+ launched last October, billing itself as a subscription platform for politically conservative audiences, and the proposed token could soon become a gateway for users to interact with the platform more seamlessly—especially in an era where digital payments are gaining ground. Crypto Partnerships and Financial Ambitions Trump Media’s growing crypto footprint also includes strategic partnerships. The firm recently signed a binding agreement with Crypto.com and Yorkville America Digital to launch exchange-traded funds (ETFs) featuring crypto and “Made in America” stocks—these are set to roll out on the Truth.Fi platform. Moreover, the company has earmarked up to $250 million in cash reserves for investment into various financial products, including Bitcoin, altcoins, and crypto-related securities. These assets would reportedly be held under the custody of asset management giant Charles Schwab. However, Trump’s involvement in multiple crypto ventures has stirred ethical concerns, especially following his return to the White House. Although he transferred his 59% stake in TMTG to a trust last December, critics argue that indirect benefits or influence could still exist. His association with World Liberty Financial, where he is dubbed “Chief Crypto Advocate,” and his launch of the memecoin “Official Trump (TRUMP)” just days before taking office, have drawn sharp criticism from lawmakers worried about potential conflicts of interest.

Bitcoin Demand Momentum Continues To Be In Negative Zone According to a recent CryptoQuant Quicktake post by analyst Crazzyblockk, Bitcoin’s 30-day Demand Momentum is still firmly in negative territory. Currently, the 30-day Demand Momentum stands at around -483,860 BTC, while the 30-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the same metric is hovering near -310,700 BTC. Related Reading: Bitcoin Must Clear This Critical Cost Basis Level For Continued Upside, Analyst Says To clarify, the 30-day Demand Momentum is calculated by subtracting the 30-day Long-Term Holder (LTH) Supply from the 30-day Short-Term Holder (STH) Supply. This metric effectively measures the net shift in active demand for BTC. A rise in short-term holder supply relative to long-term holders implies that market participants are increasingly opting to speculate rather than hold Bitcoin for the long haul. Trading in the negative zone suggests waning demand from short-term investors. This could be attributed to profit-taking – especially after BTC’s recent 10% rally over the past seven days – or lingering market uncertainty amid global economic concerns, including renewed trade tariff tensions. Furthermore, the market is experiencing a dynamic where long-term holders are absorbing fewer BTC than what short-term holders are distributing. According to Crazzyblockk, such behavior is commonly observed during late-cycle distribution phases or macro-level consolidation periods. It is worth noting that Bitcoin has previously experienced similar deep negative divergences in Demand Momentum, specifically during mid-2021 and the second quarter of 2022. In both instances, these divergences were followed by sharp price pullbacks. On an optimistic note, the ensuing market recovery on both the instances coincided with market bottoms. They also marked the resumption of sustainable bullish momentum in the following months. If Bitcoin can reverse this negative demand trend and push the metric back into positive territory, it could signal a strong resurgence in investor conviction. A return to the “green zone” would likely mark a renewed uptrend, potentially pushing BTC to a new all-time high (ATH) in the near term. Positive Signs Emerging For BTC While Demand Momentum remains weak, other market signals suggest that Bitcoin could be nearing a trend reversal. For example, Bitcoin’s Apparent Demand – a separate on-chain metric – has recently shown a sharp rebound, hinting at a possible return of buying pressure. Related Reading: Bitcoin Surpasses Realized Price Of Recent Buyers — Rally Incoming Or Double Top? Additionally, BTC exchange reserves continue to decline rapidly. According to recent data, Bitcoin just recorded its highest exchange withdrawal volume in two years. This ongoing depletion of exchange-held BTC could lead to a supply squeeze, further supporting bullish price action. Technical indicators also point toward the possibility of BTC testing its current ATH of $108,786. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $94,773, up 0.3% over the past 24 hours.

43978305,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/?p=153999,1746000045,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/82/default.png,Meta AI’s Bold Challenge to OpenAI Unveiled at LlamaCon,https://bitcoinworld.co.in/meta-ai-challenge-openai/,"In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, where competition is fierce, Meta recently made a significant move that has the industry buzzing. At its inaugural developer conference, LlamaCon , held at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, Meta laid bare its strategy to directly confront rivals, most notably OpenAI. This wasn’t just a showcase of new tech; it felt like a declaration of war in the AI space, heavily focused on promoting an open AI ecosystem . What Did Meta Unveil at LlamaCon? Meta used LlamaCon as a platform to launch two key products aimed squarely at expanding the reach of its open Llama models and, perhaps more importantly, undercutting the dominance of closed AI providers like OpenAI. The main announcements included: A Consumer-Facing Meta AI Chatbot App: Designed to go head-to-head with ChatGPT, this new app offers users a direct way to interact with Meta’s AI capabilities. Intriguingly, it includes a social feed where users can share their AI conversations, hinting at a potential social layer that could challenge OpenAI’s rumored social network ambitions. The app also promises personalized responses based on a user’s activity across Meta’s various platforms. A Developer-Facing API for Llama Models: This new API makes it significantly easier for developers to access and utilize Llama models in the cloud. Meta claims developers can now connect to Llama models with just a single line of code, eliminating the need to rely on third-party cloud providers. This move directly challenges OpenAI’s successful API business by offering a simpler, more integrated solution for developers building AI applications. Meta’s Core Strategy: Open vs. Closed AI While expanding Llama adoption is a stated goal, the underlying motive appears to be Meta’s deep-seated rivalry with OpenAI. Meta’s vision is to foster a thriving open AI ecosystem where models and tools are freely available, contrasting sharply with OpenAI’s model of gating its advanced models behind proprietary services. This isn’t a new stance for Meta; court filings have previously revealed Meta executives’ focus on surpassing OpenAI’s models, such as GPT-4. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been vocal about this distinction. In a letter from July 2024, he explicitly stated that “selling access to AI models isn’t [Meta’s] business model,” positioning Meta as an advocate for open access against companies like OpenAI. At LlamaCon, Zuckerberg reinforced this, viewing any lab that makes its models openly available – citing examples like DeepSeek and Alibaba’s Qwen – as allies in the fight against closed model providers. Zuckerberg highlighted the strength of the open-source approach, explaining, “Part of the value around open source is that you can mix and match. So if another model, like DeepSeek, is better — or if Qwen is better at something — then, as developers, you have the ability to take the best parts of the intelligence from different models and produce exactly what you need.” He believes this collaborative, mix-and-match capability makes open source an “unstoppable force” that will eventually surpass closed-source models in quality. Addressing the OpenAI Competition Directly Every aspect of the LlamaCon announcements seemed calibrated to address the OpenAI competition . The consumer chatbot takes on ChatGPT, the API targets OpenAI’s developer platform, and the overall messaging champions the open philosophy as a direct counterpoint to OpenAI’s closed approach. This strategy suggests Meta is willing to prioritize weakening its rival and strengthening the open ecosystem, even if it means not always leading with the most cutting-edge individual model. For instance, some AI researchers hoped Meta would release a competitive reasoning model like OpenAI’s o3-mini at the event, but this did not happen. Beyond the competitive aspect, Meta’s strong push for open Llama models might also be influenced by regulatory considerations. The EU AI Act offers certain advantages and a lighter regulatory touch for companies distributing “free and open source” AI systems. While there’s debate about whether Llama truly meets all the criteria for “open source,” Meta consistently uses this label, potentially aiming to position itself favorably under future regulations. In conclusion, LlamaCon was more than just a product launch event for Meta. It was a strategic maneuver designed to bolster its open AI ecosystem , challenge OpenAI’s dominance across consumer and developer fronts, and potentially gain regulatory advantages. Meta appears committed to this path, believing that empowering the open community is the key to long-term success and a powerful way to limit the growth of its main competitor.

Following the success of its Binance Labs-incubated (now Yzi Labs), self-custodial crypto wallet with 3.5 illion users, Grindery has turned its sights on building the permissionless payments layer for AI agents. The team behind the popular smart wallet is proud to reveal its latest product, Aventino , a developer-focused infrastructure layer that provides smart wallets for AI agents. With Aventino, Grindery is bringing financial autonomy to AI agents. I. Aventino provides the tools to build an ecosystem where AI agents can operate independently — owning wallets, making payments, interacting with blockchain protocols, and establishing their own tokenized communities across platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, XMT and the open web. Aventino is a permissionless smart wallet infrastructure that uses Ethereum account abstraction protocol ERC4337. The platform lets developers: Build an AI agent on any LLM, use any framework, and distribute on any client and/or device. Enable these agents to pay and get paid, interact with protocols and issue their own tokens (allowing for tokenized agents). Build communities around their agents, enabling new forms of governance, and growth. “We believe the future of AI requires financial autonomy — not just intelligence of agents.” said Tim Delhaes, Grindery’s CEO and co-founder, adding: “Aventino empowers developers to build platform-agnostic agents that can transact, govern, and evolve on their own. Just like mobile apps created a layer between users and the internet, agentic AI will create a new layer between users and the AI models that power their digital lives. And it will be powered by crypto.” Backed by Binance Labs (now YZi Labs) Grindery’s journey began in 2022 in Binance Labs’ incubation program, building what was once dubbed the “Zapier for Web3.” After 3.5 million users registered on its Telegram smart wallet, Grindery saw the opportunity to leverage the infrastructure it has built for its consumer application to expand into a much bigger market: empowering AI agents as autonomous economic actors. Aventino’s core capabilities With the launch of Aventino, developers will be able to build fully autonomous, highly customized AI agents that are interoperable, decentralized, and monetizable — without being locked into closed ecosystems. The platform’s core features include: Self-custodial wallets for AI agents – Built on ERC-4337 account abstraction, enabling agents to interact natively with DeFi and web3 protocols. Creator-centric stack – Tech-agnostic and platform-agnostic tools to publish on Telegram, WhatsApp, web, and decentralized clients like XMTP. Agent tokenization & monetization – Optional token issuance for agents to support governance, liquidity, and community co-ownership. Turnkey monetization – Agents can accept payments via traditional fiat methods like Apple Pay and Google Pay, as well as in crypto. “AI agents should be free to evolve, interact, and earn,” added Delhaes. “With Aventino, we’re building the rails for that vision — and enabling a future where anyone can build AI agents with real-world utility and governance, powered by crypto.” GX is the currency of AI Last month, Grindery launched its universal gas token, GX, which is now trading on major CEXs Kucoin, MEXC, and Gate.io, as well as DEXs Uniswap and STON.fi, and DeFi aggregator LI.FI. The launch of Aventino, however, significantly extends the utility of the GX token. Beyond cross-chain gas payments, as well as governance, GX will be used for agent-to-agent transactions, facilitating seamless payments across platforms. GX will also be required for deploying new agents — and tokenizing them — via bonding curves, providing access and incubation mechanisms for the next generation of AI builders.

Grayscale, which manages $8.1 billion in assets, met with the SEC's Cryptocurrency Task Force on April 21 to discuss amendments to its 19b-4 Form filings for the Grayscale Ethereum Trust ETF (ETHE) and Grayscale Ethereum Mini Trust ETF (ETH). The company emphasized the need for the SEC to become comfortable with issuer solutions addressing challenges such as the mismatch between the exchange-traded product settlement cycle and the time required to transfer staked ETH. Industry leaders, including Jake from BitGo and executives from BlackRock, VanEck, and CME Group, have discussed integrating staking into ETF structures at events like the Staking Summit in Dubai and TOKEN2049 in Abu Dhabi. VanEck CEO Jan van Eck expressed optimism about the future of Ethereum staking within ETFs and mentioned hopes for a Solana ETF approval. He also noted that traditional investor adoption of crypto remains in early stages, signaling potential growth in institutional investment in the sector.

Bitcoin (BTC/USD) Technical Outlook – Trade Setup Below $95K The BTC/USD is showing signs of exhaustion just beneath the $95,643 resistance zone. Price action has repeatedly tested this level but failed to break through, forming a potential double-top pattern. The 50 EMA ($94,698) is now acting as near-term resistance, while the ascending trendline from April 24 continues to offer support. MACD momentum is flattening, signaling indecision. For traders: this is a classic range-trading scenario. If BTC fails to reclaim $95,643 and dips toward $93,760, traders could look to buy near the trendline with a stop below $93,000. Alternatively, a clean breakout above $95,643 on strong volume opens the door to $96,850. Until then, expect choppy sideways action. Trade Idea: Buy: Near $93,760 trendline support Target: $95,600–$96,850 Stop-Loss: Below $93,000 This setup balances risk and reward in a consolidating but bullish structure. Final Take Bitcoin remains stuck under the $95.6K ceiling, forming a potential triple top—but India’s $10M Web3 initiative and rising global engagement provide a longer-term bullish backdrop. While ETF delays weigh on sentiment, they also underscore Bitcoin’s dominance as the institutional favorite. Watch the $95,643 breakout — it could decide the next leg up. BTC Bull Token Crosses $5M Milestone as 80% Yield Fuels Staking Surge Investor interest in BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) remains strong, with $5.1 million raised out of a $5.84 million target.

On April 29, 2025, the SEC formally extended its review period, establishing June 17, 2025, as the new deadline to either approve, disapprove, or initiate further proceedings. The ETF application, submitted by Franklin Templeton, would allow public trading of XRP through an exchange-traded product. The SEC’s regulatory notice stated its legal basis for the extension under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Seyffart Projects Final Decision in October Following the announcement, Terrett posted new information from Bloomberg Intelligence analyst James Seyffart. According to Seyffart, the June deadline is not expected to be the final determination point. He stated that most crypto-related ETPs, including the Franklin XRP Trust, will likely receive final decisions in the fourth quarter of 2025. He identified mid-October, around October 18, as a likely final deadline for the SEC’s ruling on the XRP ETF. Some more detail after speaking with ETF guru @JSeyff just now: These dates are all intermediate and we will likely see final decisions on a lot of the crypto ETPs in Q4. For the $XRP spot ETF, James is eyeing mid-October, around the 18th, as a final decision deadline.

Increased engagement could indicate a more accelerated path to resolution, though the agency has historically taken the full review period in prior cryptocurrency ETF cases. Terrett’s tweet reflected this view, clarifying that the timeline remains flexible depending on regulatory developments. XRP ETF Decision Part of Broader Regulatory Outlook Terrett’s report connects the XRP ETF decision to broader trends in the SEC’s handling of digital asset products. After approving several spot Bitcoin ETFs earlier in 2024, the Commission has received numerous filings for other cryptocurrency-based ETFs . The Franklin XRP Trust is among the most closely watched applications. According to Seyffart, final decisions on multiple crypto ETPs may converge in the fourth quarter, marking a key phase in the SEC’s evolving stance on digital assets in traditional financial products.

The private meeting, held at the White House’s Eisenhower building, followed major market unrest sparked by Trump’s aggressive new tariffs. Many attendees described Miran’s responses as unclear and unconvincing , with some saying he seemed unprepared for the deep, technical questions posed by experienced hedge fund managers. According to one participant, ""the talking points fell apart quickly."" Representatives from big financial players such as Citadel, BlackRock, PGIM, and Citigroup attended the event, which aligned with the IMF’s spring gathering. Although some were more optimistic about the administration’s tax and deregulation strategies, most left the session unconvinced about its trade direction . Trump’s tariff announcement on April 2 shook markets, sending bond prices down and pushing 10-year Treasury yields to 4.59% before they eased to 4.17% after a 90-day pause on the tariffs. Investors remain wary, despite Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later suggesting a US-China deal was near, which helped calm equities. Miran repeated the administration’s stance that tariffs target other countries more than US consumers , while admitting they weren’t primarily designed to raise money, though extra revenue might result. His past proposals—including weakening the dollar and asking foreign countries to fund US defense in exchange for protection—have also unsettled investors. He has since appeared to distance himself from these earlier views, according to sources close to the situation. One insider described his current position as a ""full-scale retreat.""",,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Coinpaprika', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/80/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpaprika,2025-04-30 08:09:06

For those following the intersection of technology and digital assets, understanding shifts at major tech companies is crucial. A recent revelation from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella regarding the role of AI in the company’s software development highlights the growing importance of AI code generation across the tech sector. What Did Satya Nadella Reveal About Microsoft AI Coding? During a fireside chat with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg at Meta’s LlamaCon conference, Microsoft’s head, Satya Nadella, shared a striking figure: between 20% and 30% of the code currently residing within Microsoft’s internal code repositories was written by software, essentially meaning it was AI-generated. This statement came in response to a direct question from Zuckerberg about the extent of AI’s contribution to Microsoft’s codebase today. The Microsoft CEO also touched upon the varying success rates of AI code generation across different programming languages. He noted that the company has observed more significant progress and adoption in languages like Python, which is widely used in data science and AI development, compared to more complex or system-level languages such as C++. Interestingly, when Nadella posed the same question back to Mark Zuckerberg, the Meta CEO admitted he did not have a clear figure for the percentage of Meta’s code generated by AI. This suggests that while AI assistance in coding is widespread, the methods for quantifying its direct contribution can vary or may not be uniformly tracked across all tech giants. Comparing Notes: Microsoft vs. Google on Generative AI Coding The conversation at LlamaCon wasn’t the first instance of a major tech CEO providing figures on AI-generated code. Just the week prior, during Google’s earnings call, CEO Sundar Pichai mentioned that AI was generating more than 30% of Google’s code. While these figures from two of the world’s largest software companies appear similar, it’s important to consider them with caution. The exact methodologies used by Microsoft and Google to measure what constitutes ‘AI-generated’ code versus human-written code assisted by AI tools remain somewhat opaque. Factors like whether they count code suggested by AI and accepted by a human, or only entirely AI-generated blocks, could significantly impact the reported percentages. Therefore, while the numbers indicate a clear trend towards greater AI involvement, direct comparisons should be made carefully. The Future of Coding: How Much Will Be AI-Generated? Looking ahead, some predictions are even more ambitious. Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott has previously voiced his expectation that a staggering 95% of all code could be AI-generated by 2030. While this might seem like a distant prospect, the current figures reported by Nadella and Pichai demonstrate that the trajectory towards significant AI assistance in software development is already well underway. This rapid integration of AI into the development workflow raises important questions about the future of coding and the role of human developers. It suggests a shift where developers may spend less time on writing boilerplate code or debugging minor errors and more time on higher-level tasks such as system architecture, design, code review, and ensuring the overall quality and security of AI-generated components. Benefits and Challenges of AI Code Generation The increased adoption of Generative AI coding tools brings a mix of benefits and challenges: Benefits: Increased Productivity: AI can quickly generate code snippets, complete functions, or even entire components, significantly speeding up the development process. Reduced Repetitive Tasks: Developers can offload writing boilerplate code, unit tests, or simple scripts to AI, freeing up time for more complex problems. Improved Code Quality (Potentially): AI trained on vast datasets can suggest best practices and identify potential errors or security vulnerabilities early on. Lower Barrier to Entry: AI tools can help new developers understand concepts and write functional code more quickly. Challenges: Accuracy and Reliability: AI-generated code is not always perfect and can contain bugs, logical errors, or inefficiencies that require human review and correction. Security Risks: Poorly designed AI models or insufficient oversight can lead to the introduction of security vulnerabilities into the codebase. Need for Human Oversight: AI tools are assistants, not replacements. Developers must still understand the code generated, review it thoroughly, and ensure it meets requirements. Intellectual Property Concerns: Questions arise about the ownership and licensing of code generated by AI models trained on public data. Potential Job Displacement: While the role is likely to evolve rather than disappear, concerns exist about the impact on developer jobs focused on more routine coding tasks. The figures shared by Satya Nadella AI insights, alongside those from other tech leaders, underscore a pivotal moment in software development. AI is no longer just a tool for building applications; it is becoming an active participant in writing the applications themselves. While the exact percentage might be debated and measurement methods refined, the trend is undeniable: AI is poised to reshape the coding landscape fundamentally. This shift means developers will increasingly need to collaborate with AI tools, leveraging their strengths while mitigating their weaknesses. The focus will likely move towards prompt engineering for AI, understanding AI model limitations, and critically reviewing and integrating AI-generated code into larger systems. For companies, it necessitates investing in AI tools, training developers, and establishing robust processes for incorporating AI into the software development lifecycle. In conclusion, Satya Nadella’s report on Microsoft’s AI-generated code percentage is a significant data point confirming the rapid integration of AI into the core processes of major tech companies. It signals a transformative period for software development, promising increased efficiency but also presenting new challenges that the industry must navigate to fully realize the potential of AI code generation.

Alpaca Finance, which claims to be “the largest lending protocol that allows leveraged yield farming on BNB Chain and Fantom,” jumped from $0.181 to $0.950, up 422% in less than eight hours. While the huge leap experienced by ALPACA surprised everyone, the price suddenly dropped by 92% yesterday. Many cryptocurrency experts and investors believe that the 422% rally was mainly due to Binance’s upcoming delist event on May 2. This rise caught investors who were expecting a crash with the delist announcement off guard. Investors who opened short positions were squeezed when prices rose and had to buy back despite the losses; this fed the bullish cycle. Additionally, the Alpaca Finance team has cancelled plans to issue more ALPACA tokens following backlash from the community and announced that the 214th weekly buyback and burn has been completed, removing 188,888 ALPACA (approximately $41,500) from circulation. This rally also liquidated short positions. According to Coinglass data, ALPACA futures liquidation volume surpassed Bitcoin. ALPACA perpetual futures recorded $46.64 million in liquidation volume over the last 24 hours, surpassing the $43.32 million volume in Bitcoin (BTC). In the last hour, ALPACA liquidations reached $5.6 million, while BTC liquidations totaled $2.39 million. The largest liquidation occurred on Bybit in the ALPACA/USDT pair. *This is not investment advice. Continue Reading: What's Happening to the Altcoin That Binance Delisted? First Dump Then Pump!
