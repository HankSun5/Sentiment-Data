Despite this significant price rally, Bitcoin retail investors remain hesitant to engage the market. In its weekly crypto report on Friday, blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant shared an interesting insight into this low retail activity in the Bitcoin market. Related Reading: Bitcoin Price To See 70%+ Powerful Bull Wave To Push It Over $100,000, How High Can It Go? Bitcoin Retail Investors’ Holding Grows At Historically Slow Pace – Report According to CryptoQuant, retail investors’ holdings have grown by 18,000 BTC valued at $1.2 billion over the last four months reaching a total new value of 1.753 million BTC worth $112.7 billion. While this development demonstrates a rising market interest by these small investors, the analytic firm notes the pace of accumulation is significantly slow compared to historical data as retail investors only acquired a net 1,000 BTC valued at $66.31 million, in the last 30 days. Notably, the retail investor accumulation rate has been on a consistent decline since May 2023, when their holdings rose by 27,000 BTC worth $1.79 billion Therefore, CryptoQuant reports that these Bitcoin individual investors have only increased their investments by 30,000 BTC valued at $1.99 billion in 2024, which pales in comparison to the whale investors whose holdings have grown by 173,000 BTC worth $11.50 billion in the same period. During periods of price gain, low retail investor activity as discussed above can be concerning as it represents decreased market liquidity or even a lack of market confidence in the asset’s ability to sustain its current bullish trajectory. Alternatively, this lack of interest from small-scale investors also presents positive indications. For example, CryptoQuant reports that low retail activity includes these small investors holding onto their Bitcoin rather than selling. The analytics firm notes that Bitcoin transfer to exchange in January 2023 has decreased from a daily average of 2,700 BTC to 1,400 BTC in 2024, thus there is reduced selling pressure on the token. In addition, transfer activity among retail investors remains low, with transaction volume dropping to $326 million on September 21, the lowest level recorded since 2020. While reduced transfer activity may indicate limited market volatility, CryptoQuant states that low retail activity has historically preceded significant price gains for Bitcoin. Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at 66,896 following a 1.11% decline in the last day due to reports of an alleged investigation into Tether, the issuer of stablecoin USDT, and conflict in the Middle East. However, Bitcoin’s daily trading volume is up by 34.29% and is valued at $42.10 billion.

Following weeks of strong bullish momentum, the market has now cooled, and BTC is consolidating just below the crucial $70,000 level. This key threshold is seen as a trigger for intensified buying pressure if Bitcoin manages to break above it. Related Reading: Solana Breakout From Bullish Pattern Could ‘Send SOL To The Moon’ – Crypto Analyst According to CryptoQuant data, there’s still room for further growth, as short-term holder (STH) coins are trading at a 6.2% net asset value (NAV) premium. This premium is often viewed as a gauge of market sentiment, reflecting the optimism of short-term holders who are willing to pay above the current market value to acquire Bitcoin. A higher NAV premium generally suggests that investors expect continued price appreciation and are positioning themselves for future gains. As BTC stabilizes in its current range, all eyes are on the $70,000 mark as a potential breakout level that could pave the way for a fresh rally. With positive market sentiment and supportive data, Bitcoin’s outlook for the coming weeks remains encouraging, fueled by both technical signals and strong buyer interest. Retail Buying Bitcoin (Again) Bitcoin is experiencing growing demand from short-term holders as its price consolidates below key supply levels, close to all-time highs. Analyst Axler Adler recently shared critical insights on X, showing that Bitcoin’s net asset value (NAV) premium among short-term holders has climbed to 6.2%. This 6.2% NAV premium indicates that Bitcoin’s current market price is trading 6.2% above the average acquisition cost for short-term holders. Essentially, these investors are valuing Bitcoin at a premium, suggesting optimism about the potential for further gains. Adler explains that this metric acts as a bullish signal, highlighting room for continued price growth. An NAV premium of 25% or higher typically points to an overheated market, implying that demand has yet to reach excessive levels. According to Adler’s analysis, the NAV premium is an important gauge of market sentiment. A moderate premium like 6.2% reflects healthy demand among short-term holders, aligning with an accumulation phase rather than a peak. This is especially relevant as Bitcoin’s price consolidates under significant resistance levels, potentially setting the stage for a breakout. Related Reading: On-Chain Indicator Signals Bitcoin Cycle Top Is Far Ahead – Data Confirms Bullish Outlook Bitcoin’s consolidation below its key supply levels and rising demand among short-term holders reflects a favorable environment for potential price appreciation. If short-term holder demand continues to grow, it could fuel BTC’s ascent to new highs. The balance between premium demand and manageable NAV levels could signal sustained upward momentum. There is a potential rally on the horizon if buying pressure strengthens at current levels. Technical Level To Watch Bitcoin is trading at $66,900 after establishing solid support around $65,000. The price action signals resilience as it consolidates above this crucial level. This support around $65,000 marks a significant pivot, as holding above it reflects underlying strength and fuels optimism among investors. However, for Bitcoin to keep bullish momentum, a push above $70,000 is essential to confirm the uptrend. If Bitcoin loses the $65,000 level, analysts foresee a retrace toward the 200-day moving average (MA) at $63,274. This level is relevant as a long-term support zone. A pullback to this area could attract new buyers, reinforcing it as a major support if tested. Related Reading: Dogecoin Liquidity Sweep Signals DOGE Is Ready For A Rally Investors view the 200-day MA as a key anchor for Bitcoin’s bullish structure. If BTC can hold above $65,000 and eventually break $70,000, it would indicate a continuation of the current bullish phase. Conversely, a dip below these supports would shift focus to the 200-day MA. Holding above this moving average is crucial to prevent a bearish reversal.

Whale’s Bitcoin holdings have reached 670,000 BTC, the largest accumulation of the digital currency in history. Related Reading: Against All Odds: Solana (SOL) Breaks Past $176 In 3-Month Push Impact Of Whale Accumulation Crypto analysts said that one of the positive impacts of whales buying large volumes of Bitcoin is it helps stabilize the market. As a result, the crypto’s price could go down a little bit or become more stable. Reducing the volume of Bitcoin in the market could possibly make prices less susceptible to volatility. In previous whale accumulations, it was observed that BTC price usually behaves in a specific way, in which on most occasions, BTC goes flat or slightly decreases. This period of BTC accumulation could also signal that whales have no immediate intent to sell their digital assets. It might be an indicator that whales are looking at capitalizing on Bitcoin in the long term so the accumulation phase is a strategic move. Real Indicator Of Bitcoin Growth CryptoQuant said the whale accumulation could be seen as the ‘calm before the storm’ in the long term, saying that Bitcoin prices move sideways or experience a moderate fall during the accumulation phase. However, CryptoQuant noted that there is no doubt that in the long run, this is an ‘optimistic sign.’ Whales’ holdings are at an all-time high “Whales currently hold around 670,000 $BTC, which is the highest value ever. Undoubtedly, this is an optimistic long-term sign.” – By @BaroVirtual Full post 👇https://t.co/MoFLpZ3Rmh pic.twitter.com/7esCP6fVBE — CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) October 24, 2024 The crypto analyst said that the ‘real’ growth in Bitcoin happened after the whales decided to dispose of their holdings and reached a negative percentage change value. According to CryptoQuant, Bitcoin’s price movement during the accumulation phase usually paved the way for significant growth in BTC. “Historically, after whales reduce their holdings and a negative percentage change is reached, a strong surge in Bitcoin prices often follows,” CoinNess Global said in a post.

While the pioneer cryptocurrency has been slowly recovering from bearish trends to reach the $70,000 mark, a rally to $200,000 would mark a historical milestone and a new All-Time-High (ATH) for BTC. Technical Pattern Signals $200,000 Rally Ahead Popular crypto analyst, Mags has unveiled a new technical pattern in the Bitcoin price chart. According to his post on X (formerly Twitter), Bitcoin is currently forming “a massive cup and handle pattern,” indicating a potential for a major rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Flashes Bullish Pennant On Daily Heikin Ashi Chart, What This Means Mags revealed that the Bitcoin price has just moved past the handle portion in the technical pattern, indicating a positive signal for a breakout that could start a bullish phase. As its name suggests, a Cup and Handle pattern is a key technical chart pattern that resembles a cup and handle. In this chart pattern, the cup is in the shape of a U and is considered a bullish signal, while the handle represents a slight downward drift, which indicates a potential buying opportunity to go long. Mags observed that since Bitcoin has just broken past the handle, the next level is to watch the “neckline” which serves as a resistance point. If Bitcoin can break through the neckline, it’s price could surge dramatically or like the analyst says “go vertical.” This bull rally could see Bitcoin’s price driving towards $200,000, marking a new all time high for the cryptocurrency. Currently, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $66,972, reflecting a slight 2.02% decrease in the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. While Mags has projected a $200,000 price increase for Bitcoin, the analyst has also forecasted even higher price targets in previous X posts, suggesting that a $200,000 price level may be conservative for the world’s first and largest cryptocurrency. Bitcoin Price Peak Set At $300,000 In another X post on October 24, Mags disclosed that Bitcoin is about to enter its price discovery, suggesting an imminent breakout to new levels. Price discovery is the process by which an asset’s true market value is determined, and for Bitcoin, it suggests when its price could reach fresh highs. Related Reading: Crypto Analyst Says Ethereum Will Outperform Bitcoin And Solana, Is $12,000 Possible? Sharing a historical Bitcoin price chart, the analyst pinpointed instances where the cryptocurrency entered a price discovery before reaching a peak. In 2014, BTC hit a peak, then bottomed out in 2015 before reaching another price high in 2018. A similar price action occurred between 2019 and 2024, with BTC achieving a bottom in 2019 and peaking in 2021. Following this historical price trend, Mags indicated that Bitcoin hit its bottom in 2023 and is now about to enter its price discovery. Once the cryptocurrency does, it could signal a surge to a new all-time high, which Mags has set at an impressive $300,000.

This sudden pullback, which took ETH as low as $2,380 on Friday, has injected a sense of worry into the market, leaving many to question the strength of its recent rally. However, on-chain data from Santiment reveals an intriguing development—whale activity in Ethereum surged to a six-week high just as the price dipped. Related Reading: Dogecoin Liquidity Sweep Signals DOGE Is Ready For A Rally This spike in large transactions suggests potential accumulation by whales, a pattern often viewed as a bullish signal when occurring near key support levels. Historically, significant whale buying during downturns hints at confidence in a future recovery, as these large holders tend to seek undervalued assets with high potential. The next few days will be critical for Ethereum as investors await signs of stabilization or further decline. A solid hold above recent lows could set the stage for a rebound, while a failure to maintain support may reinforce bearish sentiment. For now, all eyes remain on Ethereum’s price movements, as well as on whale behavior, which could provide insights into Ethereum’s direction in the near term. Ethereum Preparing For A Rally? Despite Ethereum’s recent price retracement, sentiment among investors and analysts remains bullish for the near future. According to key data from crypto analysis platform Santiment, Ethereum’s whale activity reached a six-week high as the price declined to $2,380 on Friday. Historically, such a spike in activity from whales—large stakeholders with substantial capital—signals accumulation. When whales begin to accumulate, it’s often an indicator of renewed confidence, suggesting these key players see long-term value at current prices. While an immediate price rebound isn’t guaranteed, this pattern is encouraging. Major accumulation phases typically happen in periods of price weakness or extended consolidation, laying the foundation for potential upward movement. Ethereum’s price action has been lackluster in recent months, with ETH struggling to break out despite occasional bullish sentiment. Some analysts suggest this may be due to heavy accumulation dynamics led by institutional or “smart money” investors who gradually increase their holdings during periods of low momentum. Related Reading: Number Of Bitcoin Bulls Increases As Funding Rate Shows Steady Growth – Details As whales increase their activity, it’s a potential sign that Ethereum is gearing up for a stronger move once accumulation is completed. With support from high-cap stakeholders, Ethereum’s price may eventually reflect this renewed confidence. For now, investors are closely watching for consolidation near key support levels, which could provide the basis for a breakout. If whale accumulation continues in the coming weeks, it could drive upward momentum, validating the long-term bullish outlook shared by many analysts and investors. ETH Price Action Ethereum is currently trading at $2,466 after a pullback from the $2,550 level, indicating a struggle to maintain bullish momentum. This retracement has brought ETH closer to its recent local lows but still within a sideways pattern, preserving a slightly bullish outlook as it hovers above key support areas. For Ethereum bulls to regain control, a push above $2,550 is critical. Breaking this level would signal renewed strength and allow ETH to target the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA) at $2,783. Achieving this would mark a new local high, potentially reinforcing bullish sentiment among investors. However, if Ethereum’s price fails to rise in the coming days, the likelihood of prolonged consolidation or even a deeper correction increases. Such a scenario would likely introduce additional bearish pressure, with ETH potentially revisiting previous support levels as traders reassess the market’s direction.

Analyst Says No One Will Believe It Until It Happens,https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-price-to-24-analyst-says-no-one-will-believe-it-until-it-happens/,"A crypto analyst has forecasted a massive price surge for Dogecoin (DOGE), predicting that the king of meme coins will hit a whopping $24 in the near term. While this price target may seem ambitious with Dogecoin currently trading below $1, the analyst has remained confident, indicating that a surge to this target would shock skeptics. Related Reading: Shiba Inu Inflows Soar 555% In 3 Months – Will The Momentum Continue? Dogecoin Eyes $24 Price Target The Dogecoin price has been trading below $1 for years now, experiencing significant price fluctuations as it attempts to break out of key resistance levels and move past current bearish positions. In contrast to Shiba Inu (SHIB), its top meme coin competitor which has seen impressive gains recently, Dogecoin has experienced substantial price declines that have left a few investors no choice but to liquidate their holdings. Amidst this bearish trend, a crypto analyst, identified as ‘CEO’ on X (formerly Twitter) has rekindled optimism among Dogecoin community members with a new bullish prediction for the cryptocurrency. The analyst has shared what he describes as the “ultimate Dogecoin chart,” where he projects that the meme coin could reach $24 soon. In the Dogecoin chart, the analyst disclosed the cryptocurrency’s past price movements, highlighting two instances where the meme coin experienced prolonged bearish trends before breaking out into a massive price surge. Based on Dogecoin’s current price action it seems the meme coin is displaying similar historical conditions that suggest that a bull rally might be imminent. And according to the CEO, this potential bull rally could see DOGE hitting $24. Is A $24 Dogecoin Price Increase Possible? Given how lofty a $24 price for Dogecoin might seem, the CEO has acknowledged that many people would doubt such a bullish outcome. Nevertheless, he expressed strong confidence in this prediction, asserting that Dogecoin skeptics will be proven wrong when the meme coin reaches this milestone. With Dogecoin’s price presently trading at $0.13, it’s understandable why many investors would be skeptical of the meme coin reaching a $24 price target. Achieving this ambitious milestone would require the king of meme coins to surge approximately 18,362% from its current price — an extraordinary leap that would likely occur during periods of intense demand and bullish sentiments typically seen during strong bull markets. In addition to this, a $24 price surge for Dogecoin would also require its market capitalization to reach trillions of dollars. As of writing, Dogecoin’s market cap sits at $19.6 billion, meaning it would need to surpass Bitcoin’s market capitalization which is currently $1.3 trillion to hit this price level.

Although the cryptocurrency hasn’t seen a significant push to the upside, its ability to avoid a deeper correction means that Bitcoin remains on track to end October on a bullish note. Related Reading: Against All Odds: Solana (SOL) Breaks Past $176 In 3-Month Push In support of this outlook, a crypto analyst has highlighted an emerging trend in Bitcoin’s UTXO metric, which suggests a looming breakout in the crypto’s price. UTXO In Loss Reaches Highest Point Ever The number of Bitcoin UTXO in losses recently reached a new peak on September 11, 2024, surpassing levels last seen during the COVID-19 crash in 2020 and the September 2023 market bottom. This metric, known as Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO), refers to the amount of Bitcoin that remains unspent in a Bitcoin wallet after a transaction. When UTXO is measured in loss, it reflects the number of Bitcoin holdings that would currently sell at a loss compared to the last transaction price from the Bitcoin wallet. According to Glassnode data, the number of UTXO in losses spiked massively in September to surpass previous numbers, indicating that a significant portion of active Bitcoin addresses are underwater. However, while this may appear to signal bearish sentiment at first glance, history has shown this isn’t the case. As pointed out by crypto analyst CryptoCon, major spikes in UTXO loss don’t come right before terrible price action, but they mostly come at the end of it. Keeping this trend in mind, the new peak in September most likely was an inflection point for Bitcoin’s price action for the rest of the year. What Does This Mean For Bitcoin Price? Past data reveals a consistent pattern: when UTXO in loss reaches extreme highs, Bitcoin’s price is often near a reversal. For instance, during the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, UTXO in loss spiked significantly, followed by a strong rally that led Bitcoin to new all-time highs in the following months. The last time the UTXO in loss spiked massively was in September 2023, serving as the forerunner for the latest bull market cycle which kicked off in October 2023. This run culminated in a new all-time high for Bitcoin in March 2024, effectively showcasing spikes in the UTXO in loss as a signal of positive market momentum. If history were to repeat itself, the September spike in the UTXO loss numbers could also signal a market bottom, which in turn opens up the stage for a rally in the rest of the year.

At the time, Bitcoin was trading around $57,000. Since then, it has experienced a considerable rally, inching closer to the $70,000 price level. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $66,720.

This level is relevant for bulls, as holding above could pave the way for a rally in the coming weeks. Crypto analyst and investor Carl Runefelt recently shared a technical analysis indicating that Solana’s current price action remains bullish as long as it sustains support above this mark. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Activity Spikes To 6-Week High – Smart Money Accumulation? Solana’s ability to turn former resistance into a support base reflects increased demand, which could act as a catalyst for further upward momentum. The market is closely monitoring these movements, and the next few days are expected to be crucial for Solana. If SOL maintains its trajectory above $171, it may spark optimism for an extended uptrend. Investors will likely keep a close eye on Solana’s price dynamics, as any shift below this level could alter the short-term outlook for one of crypto’s most promising assets. Solana Testing Liquidity Top investor Carl Runefelt recently shared his insights on X, highlighting the significance of Solana’s head and shoulders pattern. In his analysis, Runefelt noted that a successful neckline retest would confirm the bullish trend’s strength. Runefelt’s chart analysis further indicates that as long as SOL remains above the neckline, bullish momentum is expected to persist, with his target price set at $202 in the short term. This potential upward movement has caught the attention of both investors and traders who are looking at the $202 level as an achievable target if the current bullish trend continues. Runefelt’s analysis underscores that the neckline acts as a critical support level—one that, if maintained, could drive strong buying interest. However, any break below this neckline could shift the momentum, potentially leading to a more cautious outlook. Related Reading: Bitcoin Bullish Outlook Confirmed By Critical Data – STH Overheating? With the head and shoulders structure forming, Solana’s price action will be crucial in the next few days. A successful retest of the neckline could fuel continued growth, possibly pushing SOL to new highs. SOL Price Action Solana (SOL) is trading at $172, steadily climbing as it targets a higher supply zone. To maintain this bullish momentum, SOL bulls need to push the price above the critical $180 resistance level. This $180 mark acts as a key resistance, and breaking it could potentially trigger a wave of FOMO (fear of missing out) buying, which would drive the price even higher. This psychological level may attract increased interest from traders who see a clear breakout as a signal for more gains. However, maintaining this bullish trend is essential. If SOL cannot maintain support above $171, a retracement to lower demand zones is likely. This move could bring SOL back to test support levels closer to previous lows, possibly slowing down the current momentum. Related Reading: Solana Breakout From Bullish Pattern Could ‘Send SOL To The Moon’ – Crypto Analyst For traders and investors watching closely, the next moves around the $171 and $180 levels are key indicators. A strong push past $180 could suggest continued strength in Solana’s price action. A drop below $171 would signal weakness, indicating a temporary pause or pullback in the recent rally.

The price of the altcoin seems to be recovering nicely after suffering an abrupt decline on Friday, October 26. As of this writing, the value of Toncoin stands around $4.92, reflecting an almost 3% upswing in the past day. However, this single-day action has had minimal impact on the token’s performance on the weekly timeframe. According to data from CoinGecko, the TON price is down by nearly 7% in the past week. What Does The Declining Sharpe Ratio Mean? In a recent Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, an analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost explained the relevance of the “Sharpe Ratio” metric to cryptocurrency price. According to the crypto pundit, the Sharpe Ratio for Toncoin has been in decline in recent weeks, signaling a period of decreased risk. Related Reading: Dogecoin Price Flashes Bullish Pennant On Daily Heikin Ashi Chart, What This Means The relevant metric here is the Sharpe Ratio, which assesses the risk-adjusted returns of an investment. This indicator basically measures how much profit an investment offers per unit of risk (considering risk is quantified by volatility). Typically, a rising Sharpe Ratio signals a higher risk-adjusted performance. On the other hand, when this metric is in a downward trend, it implies that the coin is in a “lower-risk zone” and profits are becoming less significant. According to Darkfost, it appears that both volatility and risk are decreasing for Toncoin, as its Sharpe Ratio continues to fall. With the altcoin showing reduced sensitivity to price fluctuations, it offers a more favorable risk-return balance and a less risky market for investors. A less volatile market condition may be ideal for Toncoin investors to accumulate tokens with less exposure to abrupt price movements. The Quicktake analyst, however, warned investors to approach the market with caution as the “lower-risk zone” may not be completely safe. Darkfost specifically advised investors to still watch out for Bitcoin’s price movements, as the market tends to respond to swings from the premier cryptocurrency. Toncoin To Overtake Ethereum In This Metric Before 2025 In a separate Quicktake post, an analyst has projected Toncoin to overtake Ethereum in terms of adoption before the end of 2024. According to Maartunn, the number of TON holders, which currently stands at 112 million, is expected to surpass ETH holders by December 20, 2024. This projection is based on Toncoin’s recent growth spurt, which has seen the network gain an average of 500,000 new holders daily over the past month. According to the Quicktake analyst, the number of TON holders could exceed that of Ethereum (currently 137 million) if this trend continues. Related Reading: Would Bitcoin Reclaim $70,000 Soon? Key Data Suggests New Investors Hold the Key However, Maartunn noted that this prediction doesn’t account for the potential of a slowdown in TON’s growth rate and the continuous growth of ETH holders. The analyst acknowledged that while these two factors are only variables, they may still influence the projected dates.

After weeks of excitement and upward momentum, the market has cooled off, and BTC is currently consolidating below the critical $70,000 level. This consolidation phase is crucial as traders assess the next potential move for Bitcoin. Related Reading: Ethereum Whale Activity Spikes To 6-Week High – Smart Money Accumulation? Analyst Ali Martinez has shared significant data from Binance, highlighting the high risk for short positions at the $68,500 mark. When such risk levels are present, the price often seeks liquidity, which suggests that it may gravitate toward supply zones. This behavior indicates that the market is potentially targeting areas where sellers may be positioned, which could lead to further fluctuations in price. The interplay between these resistance and support levels will determine Bitcoin’s trajectory. A decisive move above these levels could signal Bitcoin’s next phase, making it critical for investors to remain vigilant. Bitcoin Short Squeeze Looms Bitcoin is reaching a pivotal moment, with the market buzzing with expectations for a potential push toward all-time highs. Martinez recently shared crucial data on X, revealing that a significant number of short positions are at risk of liquidation, particularly around the $68,598 mark. The cumulative short liquidation leverage at this price level is approximately $452.36 million, indicating that a substantial amount of capital could be affected if the price continues to rise. This scenario sets the stage for a bullish outlook, as overleveraged short positions suggest that Bitcoin could find liquidity at supply levels. This could trigger a cascade of buying pressure. When the price breaks above the key $69,000 mark, it could lead to a wave of Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) among traders and investors watching from the sidelines. The liquidation of these short positions could propel Bitcoin’s price higher, strengthening the bullish narrative. Market participants closely monitor this critical threshold, as a decisive break above $69,000 could ignite a surge toward previously untested highs. Related Reading: Solana Breakout From Bullish Pattern Could ‘Send SOL To The Moon’ – Crypto Analyst Maintaining awareness of both market dynamics and key price levels is essential for traders looking to navigate the volatility. The next few days could prove crucial as Bitcoin approaches this significant moment, and how it reacts to these overleveraged positions may determine its trajectory in the coming weeks. BTC Liquidity Levels Bitcoin (BTC) is currently trading at $67,100 after a week marked by volatility and uncertainty. The price has pushed above the $66,000 level, signaling strength and hinting at a potential rally in the coming weeks. This upward movement reflects renewed optimism in the market, as investors look for signs of sustained bullish momentum. However, it’s essential for BTC to maintain its position above the $65,000 mark. If the price fails to hold this level, a sideways consolidation may occur, allowing the market to gather liquidity before making its next move. This consolidation phase could set the stage for a surge in buying activity as traders look to capitalize on potential opportunities.

Commenting on the altcoin’s possible next movements, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has painted a potential trajectory to a new all-time high at $6,000. Related Reading: Ethereum Underperforming, Don’t Blame The Network Or Leadership: Here’s Why Ethereum Now At Critical Support Zone – Here’s Why In an X post on Saturday, Martinez shares that Ethereum is currently testing a key support level at $2,400. Notably, Ethereum slipped to around $2,410 on Friday and has since remained in this price zone following a recent rejection at $2,500. According to Ali Martinez, ETH must maintain support at $2,400 to avoid breaking an ascending channel that stretches as far back as July 2023. #Ethereum is testing a key support zone at $2,400. If this level holds, we might see $ETH aiming for the channel’s upper boundary near $6,000! pic.twitter.com/W8J8WVy5CL — Ali (@ali_charts) October 26, 2024 Based on the analyst’s trading chart, a successful retest at the specified support zone will allow ETH to surge above the $3,000 mark before experiencing a consolidation between $3,350 – $3,750. Thereafter, another price breakout will occur which should push Ethereum’s price to the upper end of its ascending channel around $6,000, indicating a potential 142% gain on the asset’s current market price. However, If Ethereum bulls fail to hold the support at $2,400, the altcoin could fall by 40% finding a new support level at $1,500. To avoid significant losses in this high “risk to reward” situation, Ali Martinez has advised traders to put a stop loss between $2,150 – $2,300.

Coinbase Premium Negative Index Signals Bearish Sentiment For ETH Market In other news, CryptoQuant analyst Darkfost has noted that the Ethereum Coinbase Premium Index is currently at -2 and is highly negative. According to Darkfost, this development indicates that US institutional investors or market whales are currently aggressively offloading their ETH holdings. For short-term traders, this is a strong bearish signal as Ethereum is likely to experience a downtrend in the coming days. However, Darkfost states that long-term traders may want to utilize such price decline as a perfect accumulation opportunity. At the time of writing, ETH trades at $2,473 per unit. While the altcoin might have recorded a minor gain in the past day, a decline of 6.47% and 6.27% in the last seven and thirty days, respectively, still leaves much for investors to desire. In addition, Ethereum’s daily trading volume, valued at $12.22 billion, reflects a 48.27% decline representing a reduced market liquidity and potential heightened price volatility.
