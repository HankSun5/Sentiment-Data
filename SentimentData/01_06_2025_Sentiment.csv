45343071,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69230,1748726109,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s how XRP Could Hit $100 Price Milestone,https://timestabloid.com/heres-how-xrp-could-hit-100-price-milestone/,"The XRP Ledger is beginning to realize its foundational goal of supporting asset tokenization on a large scale. In 2025, the network has witnessed increased traction from institutions seeking to digitize real-world assets, and this trend could become a key factor in propelling XRP to a significantly higher valuation, potentially as high as $100 . Effect of Increased Institutional Adoption XRP’s price movement has historically been influenced by its utility in cross-border transactions, but tokenization may now represent a new growth catalyst. Analysts argue that as more institutions adopt XRPL to digitize real-world assets, such as real estate, private equity, or government bonds, XRP will be in greater demand to facilitate these transactions. Because XRP serves as a bridge asset on the ledger, large-scale tokenization may require institutional participants to hold substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency. This would effectively remove a portion of XRP’s circulating supply from open markets. As demand increases and accessible supply diminishes, market dynamics could shift in favour of higher prices. This scenario, grounded in classic supply and demand theory, suggests that if XRPL’s utility in tokenization continues to expand and institutions continue accumulating XRP, the resulting scarcity could put strong upward pressure on the token’s value. Technological Enhancements Supporting XRPL Tokenization To support these developments, Ripple has implemented multiple updates aimed at making XRPL more suitable for institutional use. In Q3 2024, Ripple introduced the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard. MPTs are designed to function as hybrid tokens, offering both fungible and non-fungible characteristics. They also enable the inclusion of additional data, such as legal terms or asset-specific metadata, making them highly useful for financial institutions. Another critical upgrade came in October 2024, when XRPL integrated Decentralized Identity (DID) capabilities. This feature ensures that tokenized assets on the ledger can comply with regulatory frameworks, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies. These improvements are essential for attracting serious institutional participants seeking regulatory-compliant infrastructure for asset digitization. Practical Implementations Gaining Traction Several initiatives launched in 2025 reflect growing institutional interest in XRPL-based tokenization. One major example is a collaboration between the Dubai Land Department and the Dubai Future Foundation. This partnership resulted in a $16 billion real estate tokenization platform built on XRPL, allowing individuals to invest in property with as little as AED 2,000. The project has already attracted over 3,000 investors and offers reduced transaction costs. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other firms are also exploring the ledger’s capabilities. Aurum Equity Partners has introduced a $1 billion tokenized fund encompassing private equity and debt instruments, while Ripple’s partnership with Ondo Finance aims to bring tokenized U.S. Treasury products to XRPL. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has emphasized the growing role of XRPL in facilitating real-world asset tokenization. His remarks at the Apex 2023 developer summit affirmed that the network is increasingly being viewed as a reliable platform for institutional-grade projects. Market Limitations and Cautionary Notes While the long-term prospects appear promising, there are notable limitations to the idea that XRP could reach $100 in the near term. Such a valuation would imply a market capitalization of approximately $5.9 trillion, far exceeding the current total cryptocurrency market cap, which is around $3.33 trillion. For XRP to attain that value, the entire digital asset market would need to grow substantially. At present, the token is priced at $2.19. Achieving the $100 milestone would require a 4,466% increase, which analysts agree would only be plausible under conditions of explosive industry-wide growth and sustained institutional demand. The XRPL’s expanding role in tokenization and its technological upgrades have positioned it as a viable platform for institutional adoption. If demand continues to rise while the available XRP supply contracts due to increased holding by institutions, upward price movement could follow. However, reaching the $100 target would depend heavily on broader market growth and continued utility-driven adoption.

For new participants in digital assets, choosing the right entry points is crucial. The ideal assets for beginners combine usability, clear utility, and community-driven growth, rather than simply chasing hype or volatility.This week, three standout projects exemplify this principle. Qubetics ($TICS) is emerging as a breakout leader, offering a feature-rich ecosystem that prioritizes accessibility and privacy, notably through its decentralized VPN. Meanwhile, Bittensor (TAO) and Cosmos (ATOM) represent cornerstone protocols with proven infrastructure and network effects. Each serves a distinct role in the blockchain world, but all are considered among the best cryptos for beginners seeking long-term utility and technological credibility. Qubetics (TICS): Redefining Privacy with a Decentralized VPN Network Qubetics continues to attract significant attention as one of the best cryptos for beginners , driven by a practical approach to digital privacy and cross-chain access. Among its most compelling features is the Decentralized VPN (dVPN) built into the Qubetics ecosystem. This innovative infrastructure offers secure, anonymous internet access without relying on centralized VPN providers—effectively eliminating single points of failure, censorship risks, and user tracking. The Qubetics dVPN allows users to route traffic through decentralized nodes, creating a dynamic network that enhances anonymity and resilience. For professionals handling sensitive client data, journalists operating in restrictive jurisdictions, or everyday users accessing geo-restricted content, the Qubetics VPN provides uncompromised security. It also opens new revenue models, enabling individuals to monetize unused bandwidth as node operators—fostering a community-powered privacy economy. Enterprises can integrate this decentralized VPN directly into internal systems, ensuring that employees and departments across geographies connect through secure channels without dependence on legacy providers. For example, a fintech startup managing international transactions can utilize Qubetics’ VPN for encrypted backend operations, reducing vulnerability to surveillance and cyber-attacks. Analysts’ Projections for $TICS In parallel with these utility-driven innovations, Qubetics is executing the most successful crypto presale of 2025. The platform has now entered its 36th stage, selling over 514 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,300 holders, with $17.5 million raised. The current price is $0.3064 per token. Analysts tracking Qubetics have forecasted various growth trajectories depending on user adoption and integration levels. A post-presale valuation of $1 suggests a 226% ROI, while mid-range targets of $5 and $6 offer 1,531% and 1,857% returns respectively. At $10, the return exceeds 3,163%, and at $15 following the mainnet launch, community participants could see up to 4,794% ROI. Qubetics combines essential digital privacy through decentralized VPNs with real-world interoperability and growing early adoption.

Ryan Yi, a former member of Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, thinks that the exchange could still acquire Circle. Coinbase USDC Shares Records Growth According to an X post, Yi suggested that Coinbase would capitalize on USDC’s growing importance by acquiring Circle. The publicly traded company has a share of USDC circulation, and over the years, this share has experienced tremendous growth. In Q1 2025 alone, Coinbase USDC shares increased to 23% of the total supply of the stablecoin, reflecting massive growth. It is, therefore, little wonder that the USD-pegged stablecoin ranks as the second-largest source of Coinbase revenue. On this basis, Yi says that the acquisition of Circle would help the crypto exchange fully capture the revenue around USDC. Coinbase and Ripple in Battle to Acquire Circle Unfortunately, Coinbase is not the only company bidding to take over Circle’s stablecoin system . While the crypto exchange is having informal talks with the USDC issuer, San Francisco-based Ripple offered Circle $5 billion. The firm later rejected this particular offer because it was small. At first, Ripple was unsure whether to try again or walk away from the bid. However, once Coinbase came into the picture, the competition became steep, and the blockchain payment firm more than doubled its offer to $11 billion in cash and XRP. Until now, the terms of Coinbase’s offer remain unknown. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently stated that Ripple’s acquisition of Circle will benefit the broader crypto market. He noted that it could make the industry more open and fair. Circle Files For IPO, Plans to List Shares on NYSE Amidst these acquisition talks, Coinbase is focusing its attention on going public before this year ends. The company officially filed for an IPO just before the end of May , citing that it plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” The firm is targeting an IPO valuation of up to $5.65 billion. This fund will come from the company selling about 9.6 million new shares, while current shareholders will sell another 14.4 million. Circle is looking forward to getting support from some of the biggest names in finance, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and many others. The IPO filing suggests that neither Coinbase nor Ripple will acquire the company.

45343946,https://nulltx.com/?p=150129,1748727765,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Wallet Connect Token Experiences Volatile Price Movements Amid High Trading and Staking Activity,https://nulltx.com/wallet-connect-token-experiences-volatile-price-movements-amid-high-trading-and-staking-activity/,"The Wallet Connect Token (WCT) has been one of the most discussed cryptocurrencies in the past month, exhibiting pronounced price volatility that has caught the attention of traders and investors far and wide. According to a May 20 article on the Binance blog, WCT’s price pumped from a meager $0.35 at the start of the month to a stunning (and suspicious, in retrospect) peak above $1.30 – an approximately 270 percent increase in just two weeks. According to Binance data, WCT surged from $0.35 to above $1.3 over the past month, but in the last two days, WCT has plummeted sharply, halving to around $0.65. In the past 24 hours, South Korea's largest exchange, Upbit, recorded a WCT/KRW trading volume of $558 million,… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 31, 2025 However, WCT’s price promptly plummeted over the weekend, falling back down to around $0.65 by May 21 and thus appearing to have given back about half its earlier gains in what some might call a “get-rich-quick scheme” gone wrong. Even with the actual price movements, we see an ecosystem that is highly active and engaged around WCT. South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, has emerged as a major venue for trading WCT. They account for a large part of the global WCT trading volume right now. And staking with Wallet Connect continues to see robust participation in my opinion; tens of thousands of stakers have locked up millions of tokens for long-term holds. Sharp Price Surge and Sudden Correction WCT’s price moved in surprising ways over the last month. Starting from near $0.35, the token surged ahead, seemingly unanchored by anything other than the rising interest in and adoption of the Wallet Connect protocol. By half-past the month, WCT crossed the $1.3 threshold, making it appear as if WCT might be a solid buy at some point last month. The positive progress of the Wallet Connect ecosystem helped partly to fuel this rally. It has, for one, extended its partnerships to a much greater degree than before. And it is now celebrating an upsurge in the use of its decentralized wallet connection technology. Traders sensibly concluded that the development was an opportunity to invade the exchanges en masse and push prices higher. The euphoria was, however, short-lived. Within just 48 hours, WCT witnessed a sharp turnaround. The token’s price sank to nearly 50%, before recovering to the mid-$0.60 levels. Mid-level market corrections of this nature are not uncommon in the crypto space. But the suddenness and size of this downturn have certainly captured the attention of more than just WCT investors. Market analysts are now casting shared speculative nets over a few probable causes, including: 1. Profit-taking by early investors. 2. Broad market conditions. 3. Concentrated trading on certain exchanges. WCT Upbit Leads with Massive Trading Volume The recent price action has a key element, which is the oversized role that Upbit, South Korea’s largest exchange, has been playing. Just in the last 24 hours, the trading volume clocked by Upbit for WCT/KRW was $558 million. That figure is not just a number; it makes Upbit that much more relevant a player in the WCT space, as this accounts for about 35% of the total global trading volume for WCT. This gives insight into something that had not been in focus, which is the role of South Korean traders in WCT. WCT trading is concentrated at Upbit, which means there is regional interest and liquidity in the token. South Korean crypto investors have been major players in many digital asset markets. For this reason, and because WCT has been trading at a premium on Upbit, we take the above as indications of investor confidence in the long-term performance of this token. Upbit’s trading volume is high. This means that if someone decides to buy a large amount of something and a few people working for the exchange also decide to buy, then by the time you could buy, the price has already gone up. And conversely, if a big sell order comes through, these kinds of price movements can influence the sentiment that others have about the whole market. Wallet Connect Staking Growth Reflects Strong Community Engagement Apart from trading, the staking platform of Wallet Connect portrays an enlightening picture depicting a devoted and burgeoning user base. At present, there exist 47,439 stakers who have collectively committed an excess of 120 million WCT tokens to the staking contract. This sizeable amount of staked tokens bodes well for the sorts of governance and security undertaken by the Wallet Connect network. 47,439 stakers. 120M+ WCT already staked. 119,839 WCT rewards distributed this week alone. Staking takes seconds, secures the network, and puts your WCT to work. Here's how pic.twitter.com/jmhKkh46XR — WalletConnect (@WalletConnect) May 30, 2025 Complementing this image of the platform’s active engagement with the community, it distributed rewards in the past week alone of nearly 120,000 WCT in staking rewards. This ongoing incentive for holders to stake their tokens, thus contributing to a reduced circulating supply, is yet another potential mechanism for price stability over time. Since we started discussing this, by the way, I’ve noticed price actions seemingly toning down as well. The increase in staking activity shows that, in spite of recent price swings, the Wallet Connect ecosystem is growing and allowing us to participate in a way that feels now, as it did in the past, much more intimate. For holders, staking is a way to gain when the protocol gains but also a way to bolster the protocol’s long-term resilience. Looking Ahead: Navigating Volatility and Opportunity The recent surge in price and the subsequent correction of WCT offer a clear view of the challenges and opportunities of moving too quickly in the crypto markets. Not every project is as firmly rooted in a community, and not every project offers as much exposure to future price action as WCT does. But for investors in projects like WCT, this is a lesson to be learned. People in the market will probably keep a close eye on how the token does in the next several weeks—especially since the broader market is changing. For holders who are in it for the long term and for fresh investors, figuring out the imbrication of trading activity, regional markets, and staking will be crucial to making any kind of assessment about WCT’s future. At the same time, the expanding network of Wallet Connect and the continuing staking rewards present a strong and compelling base that may enable the token to ride out its present volatility and possibly command further upward price action in the next several months.

45344009,https://nulltx.com/?p=150128,1748727862,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,FTX Begins Second Phase of $5 Billion Fund Distribution to Creditors,https://nulltx.com/ftx-begins-second-phase-of-5-billion-fund-distribution-to-creditors/,"FTX , the cryptocurrency exchange, has now started round two of sending back funds to its users. The exchange has returned to the convenience class creditors and is considering the next steps for those in the non-convenience class. That means if you traded on the exchange and didn’t send over a passport picture, you might still get some crypto back. To the extent that FTX can return some of these assets, that’s a positive development, said James Murphy, an associate professor at American University’s Washington College of Law. The firm has announced that qualifying customers should see their funds credited to their accounts within one to three business days from the time of the announcement. This is an initial step in what promises to be a rather long recovery for creditors following FTX’s sudden collapse. Understanding the Second Distribution: Who Benefits and What to Expect The second distribution from FTX bankrupt estate marks one of the biggest single-payout moments of the whole bankruptcy case. This time, 5 billion dollars is being handed over in a kind of 50-50 split between two main categories of creditors: the convenient class and the non-convenient class. Now, the convenient class, according to FTX and its lawyers, generally includes smaller account holders with balances below 1 million dollars, while the non-convenient class includes anyone with an account balance above that threshold. So, in the convenient class, we’ve got a bunch of smaller account holders, and in the non-convenient class, we’ve got larger account holders and what seems to be a lot of institutional clients. (1/3) FTX today announced that it has commenced the Second Distribution of more than $5 billion to holders of allowed claims in the Plan’s Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes that have completed the pre-distribution requirements. — FTX (@FTX_Official) May 30, 2025 For creditors to be included in this second distribution, they were required to finish some verification steps and submit the essential documentation that confirms their claims as valid. Payouts only went to accounts that had completed these steps and were therefore eligible for distributions. Meanwhile, FTX’s attorneys and restructuring team have been working intensively behind the scenes to verify as many claims as possible and ensure that the integrity of the process is above board. Cash should arrive in creditors’ accounts within a few days, so lots of folks are apparently seeing movement on their accounts. For most, movement means something along the lines of this tweet from BlackLine customer account recovery director Joe Kavanagh: “@BlackLine has processed and successfully accounted for the cash received from our unsecured creditors. Thank you for your hard work and transparency in this process!” Security Alert: FTX Warns Against Phishing Scams In conjunction with the announcement of the distribution, FTX also issued an essential security reminder. This reminder was aimed at protecting customers from the upsurge of phishing scams and fraudulent websites attempting to mimic official FTX communications. Since the exchange’s collapse, scam actors have exploited the customer uncertainty created by these events. They have done so by sending deceptive emails and creating fake portals that look like FTX’s official platforms. FTX advises users to exercise extreme caution when receiving any email or link purporting to be from the company. The announcement emphasized that all legitimate communications will originate from verified channels, and implored customers not to click on any links that look even somewhat suspicious or to furnish any amount of sensitive information on sites that are not quite as secure as Fort Knox. This warning comes as an especially critical reminder because customers are getting ready to receive large amounts of money back into their accounts. During times of high customer activity, scammers step up their game in trying to steal login info and personal details. Customers can stay a couple of steps ahead of these threats by being on the lookout and confirming that the communications they’re receiving are actually from the companies they do business with. What the Future Holds for FTX Creditors Although the second distribution is a momentous step, it is just one part of what is an all-too-regular appearance of this ongoing, larger process. The appearances may seem familiar, but the plot is not yet resolved. As FTX keeps going with its long, somewhat drawn-out bankruptcy saga, it and we too can expect some more asset-recovery appearances and creditor claim-finalization appearances, with some releases in between. Here is the latest appearance. For a lot of people, this second payment could almost be like a hug. It may be as close to an apology as we get from FTX. And in the absence of such an apology, companies going under historically haven’t been very good at saying sorry. My excuse-making earlier in this piece aside, this payment could almost position FTX as a better actor than the normal Chapter 11 players. Figuring out what happens next requires remembering that FTX is a global company. Meanwhile, clients must keep themselves updated via FTX’s official communication channels, make sure they complete any remaining tasks that concern them, and follow any and all security notifications that come from the exchange. FTX’s promise to be as upfront and engaging with its creditors as possible is, within my view, crucial to the rebuilding of trust that is necessary for any kind of meaningful resolution to occur. This latest distribution marks a crucial step forward in an unprecedented chapter of crypto history. For the thousands affected, it brings hope that the recovery process is tangible and progressing, even as many challenges remain to be addressed in the months to come.

45344060,https://nulltx.com/?p=150127,1748727973,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,NATIX and Bittensor Unite to Pioneer Decentralized AI Mining for Real-World Autonomy,https://nulltx.com/natix-and-bittensor-unite-to-pioneer-decentralized-ai-mining-for-real-world-autonomy/,"A new decentralized AI frontier is forming that combines the gathering of physical data, a distributed machine learning infrastructure, and tokenized incentives to produce even smarter, real-world artificial intelligence. Leading this evolution is NATIX Network, a decentralized sensor platform that is changing how we gather, process, and deploy the kind of data that underpins autonomous driving. NATIX is moving from merely gathering sensor data to using it to train artificial intelligence models in earnest, and it has done this by establishing a dedicated subnet on Bittensor, a decentralized AI compute protocol. This move is nothing less than a leap in the architecture of AI, an evolution that emphasizes the use of real-world data over synthetic “training sets” and, in this case, “rewards” competitive performance with “real” economic value. Street-Level Video Becomes Training Fuel in Subnet 72 This development’s beating heart is Subnet 72, known as StreetVision. It is NATIX’s new home for crowdsourced video data. This data, when raw and freshly captured, comes from a global fleet of a quarter of a million drivers who have signed on to participate in NATIX’s venture. These drivers have mapped over 170 million kilometers. Their trajectory takes them through every conceivable real-world context—from journeys that are unremarkable to those encompassing something really unusual. These are the kinds of adventures that yield traffic signals, construction detours, and other road videos—such as the footage that an American driver made of the unfurling of a tornado while he was inside the funnel cloud. On Subnet 72, decentralized AI participants — often referred to as miners — compete to process the incoming video data, pinpointing aspects of the feed that it is essential to recognize if one is going to navigate the virtual world constructed from this real-world input. Each participant runs a particular model or set of models, usually within the family of AI algorithms known as deep learning, to derive the insights that Bittensor needs to make sense of the data it receives. 1/ Decentralized Physical AI meets AI mining. @natixnetwork ’s new Bittensor subnet transforms crowdsourced street-level video into deployable AI models for autonomous driving and mapmaking. Real-world sensors → decentralized training → smarter AI agents. pic.twitter.com/IXcvFxPzYw — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) May 30, 2025 The continuous feedback loop is created through this process. Data collected from the real world immediately trains and fine-tunes AI models, which are then put back into NATIX’s edge devices. These include intelligent dashcams and the mobile sensors that drivers in the network use. The result is a system where the development of the AI doesn’t happen in some far-off lab but is intimately connected to real-world usage and is tested in the kinds of environments that serve its purpose. Decentralization, Incentives, and Real-Time Deployment What differentiates NATIX’s approach is its devotion to every layer of decentralization—from data acquisition to model training and deployment. Where centralized systems demand proprietary infrastructure and siloed datasets, NATIX and Bittensor rely on open participation and competition to propel innovation. Not only does this structure make AI development accessible for all, but it also democratizes the process when it comes to performance. With miners pitted against one another in a contest to see who can build the best model, the subnet is setting up an incredibly effective incentive to continuously iterate and optimize. The outcome? Better models, better data extraction, and better navigation tools—and then some. It is significant that this procedure does not merely end with the formation of the model. The outputs from the subnet are put to work immediately in real time on the edge device. This means that the AI isn’t just trained on the most recent data; it’s actual learning from it live and using it to continuously shape its own future performance. The implication of this is of massive magnitude: self-updating maps, self-driving cars that can shift with the changing environment, and urban analytics that are created as a kind of continuous performance from street-level devices. Tokenomics Reinforce Long-Term Alignment Driving this innovation is a meticulously designed incentive system. Emissions from the $TAO token power Subnet 72, which compensates AI miners for their work. But NATIX has gone a step further, committing to reinvest emissions back into the ecosystem via buybacks and token burns. This deflationary mechanism adds long-term value to the system and keeps platform growth and token health in alignment. At the same time, parallel liquidity pools for dynamic TAOs help maintain value and stimulate even more participation. These pools are set up to allow the AI miners and participants to have immediate access to liquidity. At the same time, they’re set up to allow long-term staking strategies and reinvestment strategies, which are designed to benefit the network as a whole. The mechanisms work in unison to create a closed economic loop. Data provides the fuel; AI provides the power; insights generate the value. And that value reinforces the system that made it possible. A Glimpse Into the Future of Decentralized AI The collaboration between NATIX and Bittensor shows a daring vision of what decentralized AI can be when it’s based on real-world data, near real-time feedback, and economic incentives. This isn’t just about training better, more intelligent models — it’s about constructing a system that can learn from the real world, get better with every passing moment, and make intelligent use of the contributions that its various denizens make to its workings. This model could completely change our conception of autonomous navigation, and even infrastructure planning, the sorts of things one might be tempted to call maps. NATIX is an AI living system — a loop, not in the lab, but with the streets of an urban world as its setup. Subnet 72 is developing toward something that could well be a new kind of AI: decentralized, deployable, and not driven by confined research-lab innovation but by the kinds of street-level realness that makes everything we talk about with respect to crypto and web3 a potential reality. Where does that leave your average AI researcher? Well, for just a moment, let’s leave the average researcher out of it. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

No more has this been true than on the fresh frontier of Virtuals Genesis, a speculative new zone for on-chain launches. As some virtual projects seek to establish themselves, a handful of contenders has vaulted to the front of the pack, reaping outsized returns on early investments and catching the eye of discerning critics. The front-runners are two tokens: $VIRGEN from the Virgen ecosystem and $SOLACE from Solace Launch. Counting these two as the leading tokens, at their peak, they have rewarded their presale participants with incredible returns, with $VIRGEN delivering a 132x return on investment (ROI) and $SOLACE not far behind at 130x. Top Virtuals Genesis performers as per their ATH ROI's Which one did you participate? $Virgen @virgen_official is the top performer with a 132x return (at peak price) for presale participants, closely followed by $Solace @solacelaunch at 130x Data provided by @WhaleintelAI … pic.twitter.com/MrrECSd6Nd — 100xDarren (@100xDarren) May 31, 2025 Virgen ($VIRGEN): The Best Performer of the Bunch Leading the ROI leaderboard is $VIRGEN, with an impressive peak return of 132x for early investors. In fact, it’s the most successful token launch to date under the Virtuals Genesis framework — a shining example of not just market enthusiasm, but project execution as well. Virgen’s place in the broader ecosystem seems to be hitting all the right notes. It’s a blend of utility, tokenomics, and community that is, at least for now, taking $VIRGEN places. However, it is not just the record-breaking price of $VIRGEN that makes it stand out; it’s also the fact that large stakeholders are consistently and confidently accumulating it. And the on-chain data from last month says it all. In a very clear and unmistakable signal of confidence, the top 100 wallets, holding the largest amounts of $VIRGEN, increased their holdings by a staggering over 254 million tokens in just eight days. That is not a typo. They went from holding a collective approximately 388.45 million tokens on May 22 to now holding a collective approximately 642.86 million tokens as of May 30. $VIRGEN holders are stacking. Over the past 30 days, the top 100 addresses increased their $VIRGEN holdings from approximately 388.45M on May 22 to 642.86M by May 30. That’s a +254M token increase, or +65% growth in holdings. Clear sign: large holders are accumulating. pic.twitter.com/Dk84ndRrzq — Nansen (@nansen_ai) May 30, 2025 This signals a 65% increase in the strength of support held by the largest holders, a group that includes many insiders and also well-capitalized market participants. It is both unusual and praiseworthy for these key holders not to take profits and instead to “double down”—to maintain or increase their positions in what is often a very early- and very superficial-selloff market. Their not taking profits and instead doubling down signals a long-term belief in this project and in the idea that its current path promises to pay off in a way that will make headlines. Solace ($SOLACE): Close Contender with 130x ROI Just behind $VIRGEN in the Virtuals Genesis rankings is $SOLACE, the native token of the Solace Launch platform. With a peak return of 130x for presale buyers, Solace has quickly become one of the most closely observed tokens within its niche. Its success reflects the growing demand for launchpad-driven projects that have well-structured tokenomics, transparent rollout plans, and governance models that put the community first. The allure of Solace is not solely in its stellar finances but in its far-reaching mission to help rebuild a broken system. It adopts a decentralized model, which directly addresses one of the crypto industry’s most pressing problems — access to the very tools and resources that make putting together a new project feasible and safe in today’s perilous climate. Solace is, in effect, acting as a launchpad, but in a way that saves its users from the many hazards en route to achieving lift-off. Although the same level of detail as in $VIRGEN has not been disclosed about specific whale activity concerning $SOLACE, the fact that it almost matched $VIRGEN’s ROI at peak strongly suggests that confidence in the market is quite high. In the coming weeks, it will be important to keep an eye on just how much early adopters are still participating in and engaging with the platform as it begins to scale its launch offerings. What These Returns Say About the Current Market What we see with the $VIRGEN and $SOLACE launches is something extraordinary. Even in today’s market, where many timely projects are having trouble finding post-launch traction, these two do—finding it in a major way. So if you didn’t catch these vibes in real-time, that’s the value of this piece: to put you on to the clear and present value of what are now $VIRGEN and $SOLACE. Furthermore, the accumulation of $VIRGEN by top holders indicates a change in behavior. In a landscape often characterized by short-term flipping and exit liquidity games, seeing major addresses accumulate rather than offload signals a level of strategic conviction not frequently observed in new token launches. This may suggest we are at a point where some sophisticated players are treating certain assets far beyond the speculative realm and as real long-term plays. As the Virtuals Genesis fringes continues to grow, the performance of early leaders like $VIRGEN and $SOLACE sets a high bar — not just in ROI, but in community trust, project delivery, and token holder behavior. Whether this trend continues will depend on market conditions, upcoming launches, and the ability of these projects to scale without losing their early momentum. At present, they have displayed what can occur when nascent crypto comprehends how to behave — and they have significantly elevated the standard every subsequent token must attempt to meet.

Through a set of imaginative applications, the Stellar blockchain is witnessing an upsurge in on-chain activity that, to many observers, seems to signal a fresh wave of adoption by developers and users who are actually diversified in use cases. This also seems to signal an emerging ecosystem of sorts. Although Ethereum and other big chains get most of the publicity, Stellar’s DeFi protocols are asserting themselves in more low-key fashion. They don’t get much in the way of good publicity. Yet, when you take a look at them, and you pull up their statistics, you can see that they’re getting some pretty decent traction. Respectable January volumes have made their way into February. Liquidity Grows Across Aquarius and Soroswap Stellar’s two most active platforms that focus on liquidity — Aquarius and Soroswap — are showing that a solid DeFi infrastructure is building on-chain. Aquarius, which aims to increase the decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity on Stellar, has seen the total volume of swaps reach the $50 million milestone. With the volume of swaps remaining alive and active on a weekly basis, questions are being asked about whether this liquidity is truly deep and sustainable or just temporary flotsam and jetsam. That said, we will give Aquarius the credit it is due for being quite obviously the local automated market maker (AMM) in the Oasis ecosystem when looking across the total landscape. Soroswap, meanwhile, is operating as a full-scale liquidity engine. It has recorded more than $21 million in total swap volume, and the protocol is picking up speed. Weekly pool-specific volume reveals a broadening distribution of liquidity, supporting a much wider range of token pairs. Besides, it has not been in the news, and that’s fine. Soroswap’s is a growth story, and what’s important here is that it’s a quiet one. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗘𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺: 𝗔 𝗦𝗻𝗮𝗽𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 @StellarOrg , the payments powerhouse, is expanding!

Their growth points to an emerging DEX economy that’s maturing with time. Blend and Phoenix Show User Engagement on the Rise Decentralized finance is not simply a matter of where to find liquidity; it concerns users, their wallets, and the interaction they will sustain over time in a given platform or app. Two platforms that show strong signals on this front are Blend and Phoenix. Blend infuses experimental energy into the DeFi universe wowed by Stellar. Similar to a mad scientist in a lab, with a dash of DeFi’s unconventional nature, everything blends, or rather mixes, together. The ingredients are on-chain indicators that matter to users. The big one is wallets. Wallet activity is up, and the addressable surge is likely to help DeFi users address major deficiencies in the current address system. The next ingredient in the address surge is NFTs. Top wallet net flows further illuminate these communities. They demonstrate everything from the amount of liquidity being supplied to the platform to the quantity being yanked out. And in between those two extremes, they’re a pretty good indicator of whether the platform’s user base is made up of true believers who’ve been, like the Blend team, in for the long haul, or short-termers who could be punking out at any moment. At the other end of the spectrum, Phoenix is on the fast track to heating up. Known for its rapid-fire swaps and fiery pool combos, Phoenix is stacking up almost $900K in 30-day volume. Its weekly swap activity also shows signs of a breakout moment, with pairs like USDC-PHO and XLM-USDC leading the charge. Phoenix’s dynamic market share growth among pools signals a rising competitive landscape and shifting user preferences. Both platforms tell a critical story for Stellar: DeFi on this network isn’t just a sit-back-and-watch affair. It’s interactive and even more engaging than before, with users finding new ways to earn, swap, and engage. It’s the future, and it’s happening now. FXDao Brings Debt Markets to Stellar One of the most intriguing developments in Stellar’s DeFi ecosystem is FXDao. This stable debt protocol isn’t just a copy of MakerDAO or any other pre-existing decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for that matter. FXDao has a structure that is both similar to the aforementioned systems and also very different from them in a few key respects. It is a system auditing itself in real-time with the assistance of a few Stellar specialists. FXDao is creating a small but expanding market for overcollateralized loans, with total debt issued exceeding $4.3 million. Users have the option to deposit digital assets and mint stable debt tokens in return. These include USDx, EURx, and GBPx — tokens that collectively offer multi-currency exposure in a decentralized format. The collateral mix indicates that the protocol is attempting to serve a variety of user needs, with backing that comes from both stable and volatile assets. Although the number of active vaults is growing, it is doing so at a rather slow pace. This suggests that Stellar DeFi is still in a niche, but also indicates that there is potential for significant expansion if the conditions in the broader ecosystem improve. FXDao is distinguished by its stability and balance. What we see in FXDao is an experimental approach to DeFi, but one that is firmly grounded in the sorts of practices and patterns that make DeFi work—and not crash, as some in the space do. A Network Poised for Broader DeFi Adoption Altogether, these data points paint a decisive picture: Stellar’s DeFi ecosystem is no longer just a concept in development. It is an increasingly concrete thing, comprised of a mix of liquidity protocols, user-focused platforms, and a nascent debt market, serving up the very infrastructure of a self-sustaining DeFi economy. Even if the overall numbers come up a little short compared to what some of the larger networks are doing, in terms of actual, real-life adoption, Stellar is showing up in some intriguing ways. That’s evident in the apparent Lighthouse navigation of DeFi the network is engaging in. Above all, it seems to me that we’re looking at a quiet DeFi breakout in the Stellar ecosystem.

45344234,https://nulltx.com/?p=150124,1748728338,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Signals: Ethereum and Base Networks Dominate Netflows in Past 24 Hours,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-signals-ethereum-and-base-networks-dominate-netflows-in-past-24-hours/,"On-chain trading and the movement of smart money are diversifying. The past 24 hours have seen a balance of maturity and speculative experimentation. Overall capital flows remain relatively light, but the bulk of smart net buying is concentrated on Ethereum and Base. These two protocols, and the ecosystems therein, are attracting serious attention from high-level wallets and advanced trading ops. Leading the charge of top performers are established DeFi projects like Maker (MKR), Aave (AAVE), and Uniswap (UNI), which directed net inflows on Ethereum toward those assets. Meanwhile, on the Base network, a totally new story is taking shape right now, with AI tokens and meme tokens emerging among the most purchased assets. Ethereum’s DeFi Majors Still Command Respect Smart money activity remains strongly concentrated in Ethereum’s DeFi protocols. Over the past 24 hours, the leading protocol for net buying was Maker (MKR), with net inflows of $100.61K. The project, which is renowned for its decentralized stablecoin DAI, seems to have been stirring up quite a bit of interest from savvy investors looking for stable-yield protocols and some governance exposure. After the Maker protocol, the next highest net buys were Aave (AAVE) with $68.56K and Uniswap (UNI) with $59.04K. These protocols have long reigned as pillars of the DeFi ecosystem, and while the sizes of these flows surely look moderate compared to past market highs, this continued interest probably indicates that some smart traders see value in positioning within trusted, functioning infrastructure. These inflows also underscore a much larger trend of allocating money with caution. In a calmer market, capital seems to be flowing into just a few projects—namely, those that are dependable and useful. Instead of pursuing shiny new trends, the smart money is flowing into the sorts of assets that have long been considered reliable and are, quite literally, in use. Base Network Assets Make a Statement Even though Ethereum is still at the forefront, the Base network is swiftly emerging as a suitable space for trial and niche innovation. Among the 10 cryptocurrencies that had the highest net inflows, four were on Base. The leading inflow came from AIXBT, which had $55.20K in inflows. AIXBT positions itself as an AI-powered trading agent, and its strong showing makes for a very interesting development. Another project based on Base, Solace (SOLACE), launched not long ago and secured its place at the number six spot on the leaderboard with net inflows of $36.13K. Its appearance so soon after launch signals growing confidence in early-stage assets deployed on Base, especially as the Coinbase L2 gains developer traction and user adoption. Completing the top ten for Base were NOICE with net buys of $33.70K and COCORO with $28.28K in net buys. This is a good reflection of something that looks to be a very consistent trend: Base is becoming a hub for smart money to explore speculative plays and frontier concepts outside the Ethereum mainnet. https://x.com/Chyan/status/1928796176498806813?t=Ma8mfg1VC3FRxvDlEIPz9g&s=19 Having several Base tokens among the net top buys shows the growing popularity of the network. While Ethereum hosts established DeFi projects, Base is doing an impressive job of establishing itself as a network with a unique identity, one that often features innovative tokens and savvy financial maneuvers. Memes, AI Agents, and New Narratives Rise Beyond the conventional DeFi assets, new stories are starting to pull in the attention. SPX6900, a meme coin on Ethereum, notched up $44.89K in net smart money buys, placing it firmly in the top five. While meme tokens often rely on community enthusiasm and go viral, their inclusion in smart money activity suggests that some investors are making calculated, short-term bets on momentum and social traction. The AI agent category is topped by AIXBT, which also leads in Base-based assets. Its growing traction is part of a larger movement in DeFi toward on-chain automation and artificial intelligence. As DeFi users seek new ways to generate yield, AI-native protocols and agent-driven financial tools are likely to see sustained and perhaps even burgeoning interest. The sole token not on Ethereum or Base found in the top ten was ABCPHAR on Avalanche. The net inflows were a measly $26.52K. Its presence in the top ten is a gentle reminder of the kinds of opportunities smaller chains serve up. Even as flows grow concentrated around the major ecosystems, the smaller chains still give us chances for niche plays and pocket allocations with tokens like ABCPHAR. Final Takeaways Sophisticated capital movement can be seen in real time with the net inflows and outflows of smart money over 24 hours. The latest data show Ethereum and Base courting all of this attention, with nine of the ten top tokens issued or being used on these two blockchains. Core DeFi tokens—those that serve as backbone elements of decentralized finance—are still very much in the picture, acting as safe havens for capital. With market tranquility comes a choosiness about where to put capital. Yet, in this period of relative calm, there’s also an opportunity to see clearly what investors with a brain and a backbone think is worthy of putting in the ground now — and what’s really set up to blast off when the market gets its groove back.

45344287,https://nulltx.com/?p=150123,1748728483,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Real DeFi in Action: Folks Finance Shows Strong Growth on Algorand,https://nulltx.com/real-defi-in-action-folks-finance-shows-strong-growth-on-algorand/,"Even though many in the crypto world pay attention only to Ethereum and its burgeoning layer-2 ecosystem, there is a world of decentralized finance (DeFi) activity that is quietly and steadily taking root elsewhere. For a perfect case study, look at Algorand. DeFi users on the Algorand blockchain have a rapidly maturing protocol that they can rely on for the kinds of DeFi activities that many in the crypto world associate primarily with Ethereum. Folks Finance is not just an Algorand case study; it is a DeFi protocol that is quietly and steadily serving a clear and growing purpose for a specific user base. From user engagement to capital deployment, Folks Finance is demonstrating what sustainable DeFi growth can look like outside the traditional hotspots. With rising transaction volumes, growing deposits, and high utilization rates, the platform is a clear sign that serious financial activity is happening on-chain within the Algorand ecosystem. User Activity and On-Chain Engagement Are Rising An unmistakable sign of the increasing attention on Folks Finance is the activity of users on the platform. In just the past week, the protocol has netted over 240,000 transactions — a number that is impressive for any DeFi dApp to reportedly handle, and even more so for one operating on an alternative layer-1 network. When considering unique user participation, Folks Finance sees nearly 1,500 individual users weekly engaging with the platform’s lending, borrowing, and staking functions. This ongoing, regular, and organic interaction with the platform places it among the most-used decentralized applications across the Algorand blockchain today. Unlike many smaller DeFi platforms, where on-chain interaction can be sparse, Folks Finance is a sign of a healthy and growing community that actively engages with its financial products on a daily basis. Deposits and Utilization Reflect Strong Capital Efficiency User confidence isn’t just shown in transactions — it’s evident in the real capital being put to work. Total deposits on Folks Finance have now topped $3.2 million — a significant milestone for a project that’s not operating in the high-profile Ethereum network. Two major pools are the focus of much of that activity: the ALGO pool and the USDC pool. The ALGO pool remains one of the most popular, with it consistently enticing over 100 users that are active on a daily basis. Users seem to have established the ALGO pool as a destination for either earning yield or accessing liquidity with no reason to leave the Algorand network. Also significant is the current utilization rate of the USDC pool, which operates at over 85%. As with any lending pool in DeFi, this is key to understanding how capital is being used. A capital-efficient pool doesn’t just sit there with lots of capital waiting to be deployed; it has lots of borrowers taking loans and lots of lenders earning interest on those loans. The same holds true for the DeFi protocol as a whole: until it gets more DC, it’s not going to be capital efficient. To summarize, the platform doesn’t merely hold user assets but works them in a way that generates value across the ecosystem. Staking and xALGO Adoption Show Real Demand One of the biggest successes for Folks Finance is staking ALGO — the native asset of the Algorand network. At the moment, over 280 million ALGO tokens are staked via the platform. That’s a huge number. And it tells us a lot. That people are confident in the Folks Finance protocol. That they believe in the long-term value of Algorand’s DeFi infrastructure. The most telling signal of adoption for Folks Finance is the growth of xALGO, its liquid staking token. Users are opting to stake their ALGO in a way that permits them to stay flexible and continue DeFi-ing without locking up their assets. This is something that has become a hallmark of our user base. Folks who choose to interact with our protocol are mature users of DeFi who understand the benefits of capital efficiency and are actively pursuing it. Liquid staking, once thought of as an advanced feature of DeFi, is now becoming a baseline user expectation, even among the most active DeFi users. Folks Finance isn’t just making a splash with xALGO and grabbing headlines. The protocol seems to be pulling in participants who are taking a long, hard look under the hood and deciding to stick around, quite possibly because they understand and appreciate the DeFi landscape in which they are now fully engaged. A Model for DeFi Beyond Ethereum Despite DeFi narratives typically being centered around Ethereum scaling solutions or newer, faster, more performant chains, Folks Finance, a DeFi protocol built on Algorand, is demonstrating that real DeFi adoption is occurring on this chain. If you are examining the real on-chain economic activity behind the hype, then the data coming from Folks Finance is inescapable. It’s a prime example of how DeFi can work — and work well — in an ecosystem that emphasizes speed, low costs, and security. And it gives us a window into the future of decentralized finance on alternative networks. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

This month comprises unlocks for Layer 1 behemoths, startups, and everything in between. Bundled together, the June unlocks raise many questions about investor sentiment and price resilience. Can the unlocked tokens be absorbed by the market? Will we see any price drops this month as the unlocked tokens start to hit the market? At the head of the list are initiatives such as SUI, ZRO, APT, and ZK, with each releasing token amounts in the tens of millions. Altogether, they represent a significant number of very recent events that are as yet poorly understood and whose potential effects on the broader market can best be described as up for grabs. The Heavyweights: SUI, ZRO, and APT Lead the Pack The biggest release of tokens in June will come from Sui (SUI), with $206.33 million worth of tokens being unleashed. This layer-1 blockchain, developed by a team from Mysten Labs, has made a name for itself in the crypto community thanks to its high throughput capabilities and an architecture based on the Move programming language. Despite these strengths, though, Sui’s huge token unlock this month calls to mind potential sell pressure and liquidity issues it might have. LayerZero’s ZRO, next on the list, plans to unlock $64.29 million worth of tokens. LayerZero has been a central player in cross-chain messaging protocols, and its much-anticipated token is closely watched by investors and users who have interacted with the protocol across dozens of chains. This unlock could have strong implications for both retail participants and many early contributors, who are looking to capitalize on early participation. Aptos (APT), a prominent layer-1 blockchain originally part of Facebook’s Diem project, is set to release tokens worth $58.52 million. Happenings at Aptos have historically shown to be good indicators for market price movements; that’s why holders and market analysts are keeping a close watch on this particular moment. Mid-Tier Unlocks: ZK, SAROS, VANA, and More Several mid-sized unlocks are planned for June, encompassing projects such as ZK, SAROS, VANA, and ARB, that are together releasing to the public more than $160 million worth of new tokens. ZK, an initiative centered on zero knowledge, will release 46.58 million tokens. Since the majority of ZK’s circulating supply is distributed community-wise via airdrop, this release might lead to more market activity in the immediate term. As we pointed out earlier, community-heavy token models often experience a much rockier road because low holding incentives and high market liquidity lead to heightened volatility. Saros (SAROS) and Vana (VANA) will release a total of $43.75 million and $37.02 million tokens, respectively. Both, recent projects, are looking to develop a following. Should these token unlocks serve as any kind of litmus test, we could expect Saros and Vana to behave more like traditional startups — i.e., find a way to generate some buzz and attention while also sometimes losing the same. For projects with $40 million to $50 million in market cap, like Saros and Vana, the next unlock may be a price-sensitive moment. Also on the schedule for this month is Arbitrum (ARB), one of the leading Ethereum layer-2 solutions, unfastening $36.91 million. Arbitrum has made a name for itself as a major player in the rollup space, and even though its market cap is quite hefty, any substantial release of tokens could sway short-term price action. That’s especially true now that investor sentiment is sensitive to any sort of macro shifts or risk-off behavior. Smaller But Notable: ENA, ZKJ, and OP Round Out the List Even smaller unlocks can create ripples, particularly when community sentiment or larger narratives are involved. Also in June, ENA will unlock $35.23 million, ZKJ will release $31.22 million, and OP (Optimism) will unlock $23.63 million. Even though these unlocks are of relatively low value compared to those in the past, they still constitute a noticeable jump in circulating supply for the tokens in question. The performance of the market in response to this latest unlock should tell us something about the resilience of layer-2 tokens in the face of mounting competition and the development of Ethereum’s roadmap. Notably, the amount of funds locked up in yield-generating contracts on Optimism, since the day of the token unlock, has actually not decreased. What This Means for the Market Misunderstanding token unlocks as simply bearish is common, but their effect mostly hinges on context: how they fit into the larger picture of not just current, but also expected future demand for a given token. Take, for instance, the supply and demand dynamics of a token whose total market cap and ideal price are already known, because, say, Bitcoin is a very low volatility investment. Now, couple that with the fact that the highest demand for a given token is almost always way back at its pre-ICO (Initial Coin Offering) price. Well, with context like that in mind, what do you think the average impact of token unlocks is on a given token’s price? The $2.7 billion wave of June unlocks could serve as a stress test for the crypto markets. They are already under pressure because of regulatory uncertainties, the surge in the price of Bitcoin and its effects on other coins, and the recent turbulence in the transition from a $0 interest-rate world to one where rates aren’t at or near zero. Investors in tokens should watch the unlock schedules closely and try to understand what is happening in real-time on-chain with the projects they are invested in. In the present cycle, the compellingness of a project’s narrative, the level of developer engagement, and the extent of ecosystem utilization can at times counterbalance that inevitable trigger along the road to short-term supply that shocks the market. But only if those projects have taken the necessary steps to establish a foundation of demand. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

DOGE has seen its momentum wane despite increased social buzz, while SHIB is hovering in consolidation territory with technicals hinting at either a breakout or deeper correction. Both remain top crypto assets by market cap, but traders searching for the next crypto to explode are increasingly rotating into low-cap coins with better ROI potential. One such coin grabbing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a sub-$0.03 token that’s quietly gaining ground ahead of the 2025 bull cycle. The MUTM presale has witnessed over 11,500 participants before a token price rise to $0.035 at the start of the next phase. Investors at this level can potentially return up to 100% in profit when the estimated launch price of $0.06 is achieved. DOGE and SHIB: Meme Coins at a Crossroads Amid Market Shifts Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at a price of $0.2228, depreciating by around 1.3% within the past 24 hours. The coin is facing significant support levels, and technical indicators are indicating opposing signals whether the coin will be positive or negative in the near term. Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently trades at a price of $0.00001429, depreciating by around 0.012% over the past day. However, SHIB has built up a bull flag pattern, which is a potential breakout that will push its price to the resistance of $0.000022. While DOGE and SHIB struggle with these market forces, new coins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), whose price is at the moment $0.03, are catching investors’ eyes with their potential high returns. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors with its DeFi lending solutions. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.4 million and accumulated 11,500 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. By combining these two systems, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as one of the best cryptos to invest in today. It offers decentralization, security, and efficiency. Certik Audit Officially Completed, Stablecoin Secures Trust and Stability Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network.

At the time of writing, Floki’s price is hovering around $0.00007950, having slipped sharply from its late May high near $0.00010670. The latest Floki price action indicates a breakdown below the 100-day exponential moving average, with multiple indicators suggesting a continuation of the broader downtrend through June.

Several new platforms with solid use cases, high TVL growth, and technical breakouts are pulling attention. From mobile mining to presales gaining traction, this year is shaping into a pivotal moment for altcoins. This guide looks at four standout names: BlockDAG, SUI, Hyperliquid (HYPE), and TRON (TRX). Each coin brings unique strengths, and together they highlight some of the best crypto coins for 2025. Whether it’s fast-growing ecosystems or high-return entry points, these projects are shaping up as ones to watch. Here’s a closer look at why these picks deserve your radar. BlockDAG: GO LIVE Reveal and $0.0018 Entry Deadline BlockDAG is getting major attention in 2025 as its presale enters its final stages. The project has already raised over $279 million, with more than 21.6 billion BDAG coins sold. Right now, the price is frozen at $0.0018 until June 13. That’s when BlockDAG will host its highly anticipated GO LIVE reveal, confirming the 20 centralized exchanges where BDAG will be listed. After this reveal, pricing will switch to the standard batch structure, with Batch 28 priced at $0.0262. This creates a huge potential gain compared to the $0.05 launch price, placing it among the best crypto coins for 2025. What makes BlockDAG more than just a presale is its working product suite. It’s powered by a hybrid DAG + PoW system, delivering both speed and decentralization. The live testnet includes a block explorer, smart contract deployment, and a no-code token builder. Over 1 million users are mining BDAG through the X1 mobile app , while more than 17,750 ASIC miners are being shipped to further secure the network. The presale’s structure also includes a 25% referral bonus, helping users earn more without spending extra. With tech, scale, and listings in place, BlockDAG offers real value. If you’re tracking the best crypto coins for 2025, this entry window might be the most time-sensitive one on the list. SUI: Technical Setup Signals Strength SUI now sits at a $10.8 billion market cap, trading between $3.62 and $3.72. Its current price of $3.69 aligns with May’s projected average of $3.08, while short-term targets stretch to $3.44. On a broader scale, 2025 predictions suggest the coin could move between $2.55 and $8.75, hinting on how it handles resistance levels like the $3.33 Fibonacci extension. SUI stands out due to its scalability and growing usage on-chain. Many still see it as undervalued, especially when compared to other coins in the same tier. Its chart has stayed steady, with no big dips or spikes recently, adding to its reputation as a consistent mover. For those evaluating the best crypto coins for 2025, SUI checks multiple boxes: solid fundamentals, tight trading bands, and long-term upside without excess risk. Hyperliquid: Accumulation Phase in Progress HYPE is currently priced at $32.70 and trading between $32.09 and $38.62. With a market cap of about $10.9 billion, the project has room to grow. 2025 price predictions place HYPE anywhere from $25.30 to $35.72, with some high-end forecasts hitting $41.35. That puts the current level in a key range for accumulation. The Hyperliquid platform is gaining attention for delivering deep liquidity and smooth trading experiences. It’s getting recognition in the DeFi world, especially for those looking at low-risk entries below $36. If platform growth continues through Q3, HYPE could break out of its current range. While it may not dominate headlines, HYPE is shaping up as one of the best crypto coins for 2025 for those targeting emerging players with solid growth patterns. TRON: Stable Gains and ETF Speculation TRX is holding at $0.2752, with a recent range of $0.2742 to $0.2793. Market cap is at $23.95 billion, and analysts are optimistic. Projections show TRX could rise to $0.3409 by June 1, almost 24% higher in a matter of days. Broader models place the average price around $0.368 for 2025 and suggest it could reach up to $1.67 by 2030. TRON continues to see strong usage, especially across Asia, thanks to high speeds and scalability. Its daily volumes and developer activity remain strong, and the coin is often linked with potential ETF speculation. If those rumors get traction, it could act as a price driver later this year. Among large caps, TRX deserves a place on any list of the best crypto coins for 2025. The Bottom Line Each of these coins brings something valuable. SUI stands out with technical reliability, HYPE adds liquidity and strong growth signs, and TRX offers price strength with long-term upside. But BlockDAG delivers a rare opportunity, an entry at $0.0018 with the chance to ride it to $0.05, backed by over $279 million raised and real tech already in action. With its GO LIVE reveal set for June 13 and confirmed listings ahead, BlockDAG combines utility, upside, and urgency. That’s why it leads the pack when picking the best crypto coins for 2025 .

While market volatility is nothing new in the cryptocurrency space, downturns like this often prompt investors to seek out alternative opportunities with greater growth potential. This shift in focus has put the spotlight on Ruvi AI , a rising star in the crypto landscape that combines innovation, real-world utility, and exceptional ROI possibilities. What Happened to Cardano? Cardano’s recent dip reflects the tight competition among cryptocurrencies as well as market reactions to broader economic factors. While many believe in Cardano’s long-term potential due to its robust proof-of-stake mechanism and sustainability efforts, the platform’s scalability challenges and evolving use cases contribute to its price fluctuations. The dip has left some Cardano investors questioning whether to hold, sell, or reallocate their investments. For those looking to diversify their portfolio, Ruvi AI stands as an attractive option that addresses some of the pain points currently holding back more established coins. Ruvi AI’s Promising Growth Ruvi AI has quickly made its mark in the crypto world by achieving what many projects fail to do early on—build momentum. During its presale phase, Ruvi AI successfully sold over 130 million tokens , raising nearly $1.5 million . With an entry price of just $0.015 per token , it has created a low-risk entry point for a wide range of investors. What makes Ruvi AI unique is its impressive projected growth to $1 by Q4 2025 . This would represent an ROI exceeding 12,800% , offering investors exponential returns not often seen in the current market climate. Such figures clearly set Ruvi AI apart as a high-growth opportunity for those seeking a lucrative alternative investment to projects like Cardano. Real-World Applications of Ruvi AI One of Ruvi AI’s most compelling strengths is its practical utility beyond just being a tradable asset. The token powers an AI-driven platform that addresses key challenges across healthcare , logistics , and finance . These industries stand to benefit greatly from Ruvi AI’s innovative solutions, ensuring its long-term demand. Healthcare: Ruvi AI uses artificial intelligence to enhance diagnostics, improve efficiency in patient care, and streamline treatment workflows. Logistics: From optimizing supply chain operations to cutting overhead costs, Ruvi AI is transforming how businesses handle logistics challenges. Finance: Security and transparency are prioritized through Ruvi AI’s fraud detection tools and decentralized payment solutions, catering to modern financial systems. This emphasis on solving real-world problems ensures Ruvi AI builds sustainable value, making it a standout choice for investors looking for more than speculative gains. VIP Investment Tiers That Maximize Returns For those ready to take advantage of Ruvi AI’s growth potential, the VIP investment program presents a tailored opportunity to maximize returns. Here’s how the key tiers work: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Tokens awarded: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token during presale valuation: $4,900. Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Tokens awarded: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token during presale valuation: $15,680. Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $224,000. VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Tokens awarded: 1,280,000 (double allocation). Value at $0.07 per token during presale valuation: $89,600. Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $1,280,000. This tiered approach rewards higher investments while offering remarkable ROI potential, making it a great fit for those looking to maximize the impact of their crypto portfolios. Expanding Reach Through WEEX Partnership Ruvi AI has also partnered with WEEX Exchange to enhance its accessibility and market visibility. This collaboration ensures smooth trading and robust liquidity for Ruvi AI tokens, which further contributes to its appeal among global investors. Partnerships like these build trust and scalability, essential elements for any successful cryptocurrency project. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out Cardano may remain a significant player in the blockchain space, but its recent dip highlights the need for investors to diversify and explore new opportunities. Ruvi AI delivers a rare combination of low entry cost, practical applications, and unprecedented growth potential. With a strategic roadmap, exceptional presale performance, and projections pointing to $1 per token by Q4 2025 , Ruvi AI is emerging as the smarter choice for those seeking high returns and real-world impact.

Based on reports, some users saw a hidden reference to the Pepe meme coin (PEPE). Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ In the next few hours, PEPE shot up by 5% but then fell back by 15%. Traders are now watching to see if this social push can do what Elon Musk once did for Dogecoin. Pepe Price Moves According to market data, PEPE’s price hit its upper resistance after the Trump post. A short surge brought a 5% gain. Then profit-taking and wider market pressure drove an 18% correction. The flip in momentum shows how fast things can change in meme-coin land. A small tweet or post can send prices soaring, but it only takes a bit of selling to push them down again. 🚨 Wait, what Trump just dropped a $PEPE pic on Truth Social 🚨 Is this a secret crypto endorsement or just trolling the internet? Either way the $PEPE rocket might just have a new co-pilot. What’s next a $PEPE rally or a Twitter melt down Stay tuned👀 pic.twitter.com/cu8RF7D55b — Josh Mair (@WizzOfCrypto) May 29, 2025 On Drama & Speculation Trump’s message saying he’s “on a mission from God” makes him sound like he has a special purpose, not just a political goal. The dark street scene and the words “nothing can stop what is coming” hint that something big is coming, even if he doesn’t explain it. This kind of talk can fire up his most loyal supporters – especially PEPE aficionados – because it feels dramatic and urgent. Chart Patterns In Focus Based on reports from chart watchers, PEPE appears to be forming a cup-and-handle pattern that began about five months ago. If the coin breaks above the handle, some say it could reach $0.000026—double its current level. Right now, the MACD line sits below the signal line after a recent death cross, hinting at a near-term downtrend. The RSI has dipped toward 52 and may cross below it soon, which could keep sellers in control. The 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level sits at $0.00001 and could act as a bounce point. If that level gives way, traders will look at $0.000008 as the next support. Tariff Ruling Adds Pressure Based on US Court of International Trade filings, the court reversed Trump’s tariff suspensions right around the same time that PEPE spiked. That move seems to have dampened the market’s risk-on mood. For many traders, broader trade news can be a bigger factor than any single tweet. If traders worry about tariffs and slower growth, they often sell off riskier assets like meme coins. That mix of social hype and market worry helped push PEPE down after its brief rally. Looking Ahead For Traders Based on this mix of social buzz and chart signals, it’ll take more than a hint in a post to keep PEPE climbing. If the coin can break above its current resistance by mid-June, $0.000026 seems to be the main target. But a falling MACD and RSI point toward more selling pressure first. Traders should watch the 0.618 level at $0.00001 for signs of a bounce. If that level breaks, they’ll likely aim for $0.000008 next.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-31 22:30:00

Bowen Wang, who leads the team at NEAR One, shared this plan. It could make NEAR Protocol stand out from other blockchains that want to support new Web3 and AI services. Sharding Upgrade Set to Boost NEAR Protocol’s Performance In his recent post on X, Wang said that NEAR Protocol’s new sharding design, known as Nightshade 2.0, has shown it can handle high transaction volumes. Sharding divides the blockchain into interconnected sub-chains, or shards, which share the workload. This approach enables NEAR Protocol to process a large number of transactions efficiently. However, NEAR Protocol plans to take dynamic resharding a step further. This technology allows shards to split or merge automatically, depending on network demand. As a result, the blockchain can adapt to heavy traffic without sacrificing speed or performance. This capability is expected to be first rolled out on the testnet before being fully deployed on the main network. In line with the current development, we covered recently that Near Protocol (NEAR) is riding a 20% monthly gain as it tests the neckline of an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern. Zero-Knowledge Proofs Poised to Enhance Validation It is worth mentioning that NEAR Protocol is also exploring the integration of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) to strengthen its validation process. ZK proofs promise to replace the traditional Merkle proof-based state witness. It was stated that this provides faster and more secure transaction confirmations. More importantly, this shift could reduce overhead and improve scalability. This is especially necessary as AI and machine learning applications expand within Web3. Near Protocol has also started working on cross-chain bridges with Ethereum and other blockchain s. The aim is to improve how assets and data move between platforms. Community Reaction Remains Mixed Despite Progress It is essential to state that despite these ambitious plans, some community members have expressed doubts about the practical adoption of NEAR Protocol’s high TPS target. Concerns revolve around the number of users and the potential complexities introduced by cross-chain and cross-rollup interactions. Even with its new partnership with DWF Labs, NEAR Protocol still faces skepticism about whether these developments can attract a more extensive user base. Nevertheless, Wang remains confident that dynamic resharding and other improvements will make NEAR Protocol a leading platform in blockchain innovation. In other news, Rhea Finance and Intellex introduced the first vesting contract for Near Protocol. This offers a secure way for projects to manage token releases.

However, it has charted a minor loss daily, but remains strong on a monthly scale. Starting the second quarter of the year on a strong note after crashing to a year-low in April, Ethereum recovered briefly above $1,800 and took a break due to a shrink in volatility, which later led to a 15-day squeeze. Following the second week’s surge, which saw the market through its biggest gain during the buying phase, ETH appears highly bullish again and tapped $2,750 as the price broke through a crucial resistance line. A rejection at this level cooled off the buying, and the market pulled back. Since then, the next market move has remained indecisive as the market continues to move sideways on the daily chart. Although it attempted to break higher on Thursday, but failed after rejecting the $2,788 level. It is currently down following a slight loss in the last 48 hours. Despite that, the asset remains in a buying range. A strong recovery above the $2,300 level could bring hope for more bullish rally on the daily chart. Otherwise, Ethereum may revisit $1,900 before regaining momentum. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Closing this month neutral-bullish, the key resistance level to watch for a break up is $2,788. A surge above it could rally us through $3,000 to retest the $3,213 level. The next buy target above this level is $3,744. If the price continues to decline, especially below the important $2,320 support, the lower discount price to keep in mind would be the $2,104 and $2,873 support levels, bringing a retest at the broken resistance line. Key Resistance Levels: $2,788, $3,213, $3,744 Key Support Levels: $2,320, $2,104, $1,873 Spot Price: $2,536 Trend: Bullish Volatility: Moderate Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Elon Musk exited the White House and immediately got himself caught up in more political drama, this time in his home country of South Africa. The South African government is reportedly in the process of loosening its empowerment laws to accommodate Starlink , a feat that the South African telecom company, Vodacom failed to achieve. Backlash over Starlink deal The South African government has proposed to loosen its Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) laws to accommodate Elon Musk’s Starlink. This proposal has sparked public outrage and caused opposition parties to accuse the acting government of striking a “backdoor deal” to give the US tech giant preferential treatment. Under existing regulations, telecom companies are required to sell at least 30% of their local equity to historically disadvantaged South Africans to operate in the country. The government intends to loosen the laws just enough to allow telecom companies to bypass that strict 30% Black ownership requirement by investing in alternative empowerment initiatives. The government has been under pressure to improve internet access and modernize telecommunications, and argues that the law change is part of its economic reform strategy. Critics have warned that the government’s decision sets a dangerous precedent by prioritizing foreign capital over domestic equity. Opposition parties like Build One South Africa (BOSA) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are leading the growing backlash against the government’s proposal. The BOSA deputy leader, Nobuntu Hlazo-Webster, said that the party has formally requested a public record of the decision from parliament to ensure transparency. “The message being sent is that if you are a powerful foreign billionaire, you can sidestep South Africa’s laws, while our local businesses are forced to jump through hoops,” she said. “We cannot build an economy based on exceptions. Our laws must apply equally to all—foreign or domestic, rich or poor.” Roger Solomons, a BOSA spokesperson, described the move as “impulsive” and accused the government of rewriting long-standing transformation rules to make Starlink’s market entry “favorable to them, and not the country.” The EFF’s Julius Malema warned that he would oppose the decision in parliament. “We cannot be dictated to by business,” he said. South Africa’s BEE laws The loosening of rules in the telecom sector has inspired other industries to seek similar treatment. In the mining sector, the Minerals Council South Africa has urged the government to exclude exploration companies from proposed Black ownership requirements. A new mining bill seeks to enshrine into law a 30% Black ownership target for mining companies. Allan Seccombe, the communications director at the Minerals Council, said: “Prospecting is extremely high risk. There’s no guarantee they’re going to find something that’s economically viable. Every cent they raise should ideally go towards drilling out or finding a resource.” The Democratic Alliance (DA), the second-largest party in the ANC-led coalition government, is currently challenging the BEE laws in court. James Lorimer, a DA Member of Parliament, said that the proposed mining legislation will “effectively end the already tottering case for foreign investment in South African mining.” He added that the bill “seeks to double down on racial transformation and brings back a legion of bad ideas.” Despite mounting pressure, President Cyril Ramaphosa has remained firm in his defense of the BEE laws. In a parliamentary session this week, he rejected claims that the empowerment policies were stifling economic growth. “I find it very worrying that we continue to have this notion that BEE is the one that’s holding our economy back,” he said. “It is the partial and exclusive ownership of the means of production in our country that is holding this economy from growing.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|Elon Musk|Starlink,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-31 23:05:37

The ministry vowed to crack down on what it describes as “involution-style” competition threatening the country’s fast-growing electric vehicle (EV) and auto sectors. The statement, issued on Saturday, comes shortly after the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) launched an industry-wide initiative urging auto companies to preserve fair competition and avoid practices that could destabilize the market. The MIIT said it will step up regulatory oversight and intervene where necessary to restore order to the market. Escalating concerns over China’s EV price wars At the core of MIIT’s warning is the escalating discount frenzy that has swept across China’s EV landscape . Over the past year, automakers, from EV leader BYD, to traditional players like Geely and Chery have slashed prices on dozens of models to hold or grow market share. BYD , for instance, cut prices across more than 20 models in late May, setting off a new wave of markdowns throughout the industry. The MIIT’s intervention is a deviation from the norm for how China manages its production sector. The regulatory approach for the auto market appears to have gone from fostering growth at any cost to ensuring long-term sustainability and quality across its strategic industries, including new energy vehicles (NEVs), which now account for over 40% of new car sales in the country. The CAAM echoed the ministry’s concerns in a statement last week. While it acknowledged the impressive growth of the NEV sector, the association said profitability is declining due to the rise of destructive pricing tactics. While competitive pricing is legal and expected, the group cautioned that it should not come at the expense of industry fundamentals. Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, provided insights into the ongoing price wars, stating that the current pricing strategies could lead to a “bloodbath” later this year, particularly affecting weaker players like Neta and Polestar. Industry analysts say the MIIT’s intervention is timely, though the effectiveness of its new regulatory push remains to be seen. Some fear that without enforceable penalties or an overhaul of pricing policies, companies may continue prioritizing volume over value.

Notably, XRP prices have dipped by over 7% in the past week amidst a general crypto price correction. However, CasiTrades predicts there may be a window for quick price relief provided a specific support level remains valid. Related Reading: Ethereum Pulls Back To 20DMA After $2,700 Rejection: Testing Strength At Key Support Scalp Setup Tips XRP For $2.25 Price Target In an X post on May 30, CasiTrades outlines a XRP trade set up that presents a potentially lucrative short-term trading opportunity. Notably, the analyst explains that XRP decline to its 0.118 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.196 has pushed into a familiar price region for short-term scalp trades. Based on CasiTrades’ analysis, the perfect entry zone for many investors lied at $2.20, with a price target of $2.253 at the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level acting as the take-profit zone. The analyst explains that this is scalp setup that operates on the high chance of securing quick price relief. Therefore, a price surge to $2.253 is not indicative of impending price reversal. However, in the presence of strong bullish momentum, XRP is well-poised to move beyond $2.253 with potential targets set at $2.333, $2.395 and $2.456. Notably, CasiTrades has identified the stop-loss for this trade set-up at $2.13. The analyst explains that market bulls must prevent a decisive price fall below this level as it would neutralize the validity of the entire scalp trade setup. In such a negative scenario, the altcoin is likely to experience further price decline with the next major support set around $1.77. Related Reading: Uniswap Rally Loading—Here’s Why The Next Move Could Be Explosive XRP Price Overview At press time, XRP trades at $2.14 following a significant 4.86% decline in the past one day and 3.01% in the past thirty days. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume has increased by 57.32% suggesting a surge in selling pressure in relation to the ongoing price crash. Based on its daily trading chart, XRP lies below its 200-day moving average indicating there is strong potential for the altcoin to maintain a downward trajectory and invalidate CasiTrades’ scalp relief projection. Meanwhile, the token’s Relative Strength Index currently stands at 36.47 and is headed for the oversold region which could potentially trigger a price rebound to around $2.30. With a market cap of $125.04 billion, XRP continues to rank as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Interestingly, market analyst with X username Crypto V backs the altcoin’s bullish potential projecting a market cap of $790 billion before 2025 runs out.

CRO is the native asset of the Cronos layer-1 blockchain, which was developed by the exchange Crypto.com. Canary filed an S-1 Form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), proposing an ETF that would offer investors exposure to CRO. If approved, the product would also stake a portion of its CRO holdings to earn rewards. The new S-1 statement represents the latest in a spree of recent ETF filings for Canary, which is also attempting to launch Solana ( SOL ), XRP , Sui ( SUI ), Litecoin ( LTC ), Axelar ( AXL ), Hedera ( HBAR ) and Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) funds. The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs for trading last July. Two financial firms, Franklin Templeton and Hashdex, also launched joint BTC-ETH ETFs earlier this year. CRO is trading at $0.102 at time of writing and is up more than 8% in the past 24 hours. By comparison, the overall crypto market cap slumped by more than 4% over the same period.

Looking forward, the price of Ethereum could climb to a new level soon. CryptoGoos forecasts the Ethereum price may soar to $3,000 soon based on a bullish flag pattern. Also, Sensei believes the Ethereum price is gearing up for a breakout. The analyst posted a chart that showed the altcoin price soaring to $3,400 after a long period of consolidation. However, the Ethereum price has to cross the barrier around $2,850 first. Doing so could spark investors’ interest and buying activity. Tron (TRX) Eyes Rally To $0.30 After Breakout While the Ethereum market could see a significant increase soon, the Tron price jumped 3.0% over the last week. The Tron price, according to CoinMarketCap, has stayed close to $0.26 to $0.28 in the last week. The Tron price has made two attempts to break past the upper level but failed. However, indicators reveal that the cryptocurrency’s price action is still bullish. The relative strength index is above 60, signaling a potential Tron coin price rally. Meanwhile, Four Crypto Spaces predicts the Tron price may rise to $0.30 soon. Other market experts who believe that the TRX price could rally to $0.30 are Dendorion and CW. In a different post, AltCryptoGems noted the Tron price has broken out of a long consolidation. He believes the value of Tron might rise to $0.32 in the next few days if the uptrend continues. However, investors should watch out for a clear breakout above $0.27. Investors Turn to Unilabs (UNIL) for High-Yield DeFi Opportunities While the Tron price has broken out of a long consolidation, investors seeking greater upside are now eyeing Unilabs (UNIL) , an AI-powered DeFi platform with advanced earning potential. Unlike traditional tokens, Unilabs delivers more than price speculation. It offers structured yield-generating opportunities backed by intelligent automation. At its core, Unilabs combines AI with DeFi to manage multiple specialized funds, each tailored to different risk levels and investor profiles. From AI-powered portfolio rebalancing to its Mining Fund, Unilabs creates multiple income streams. These funds are driven by real-time market scanning, sentiment tracking, and tokenomics evaluations. The presale, currently at $0.0051 per UNIL, has attracted early backers. Those who join the crypto ICO will be able to enjoy staking rewards, a 12-tier referral bonus structure and a share of the platform’s revenue. Over $30 million in assets are already under management, signaling strong early confidence. To show how much interest there is in Unilabs, it has raised over $1.5 million in its first presale week. If Unilabs reaches just 0.5% of Ethereum’s current market cap, its price could potentially grow by 10x in the long term, which is why now is the time to get in. The Top Crypto Coins To Buy Now With the Ethereum price eyeing a $3,000 milestone and Tron racing toward $0.30, the altcoin season is heating up. They emerge as the best coins to invest in for June gains. On the other hand, Unilabs could be the breakout star, leveraging AI and DeFi to deliver real utility and earning potential. As early backers snap up tokens at presale rates, the window to join this new DeFi project before mainstream adoption closes fast.

ADA trading volume declined by more than 9%, and options trading declined by 93% in 24 hours. SEC delayed Cardano ETF’s decision to July 13, adding short-term pressure on ADA price. Cardano (ADA) is trading below a significant support level, currently around $0.68. The token’s decline happened after its various attempts to maintain above $0.73 failed, marking a reversal from its brief recovery in early May. Technical indicators suggest that prices may continue to decline. The daily chart shows ADA failing at major moving averages and breaking below the $0.70 psychological level. Analysts identify the $0.58–$0.65 region as the next likely support zone, using Fibonacci retracement levels and historical reaction points. Unless the token reclaims $0.70 in the near term, traders may prepare for more short-term weakness.

XRP has maintained solid momentum, driven by optimism around potential ETF approvals and a favorable regulatory climate. This has reinforced XRP as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, especially for those seeking assets with strong institutional backing and real-world utility. Meanwhile, newer altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing investor interest as a potential breakout star. The project is presently at Presale Phase 5 and has already raised over $9.4 million with over 11,500 investors. With a public launch price of $0.06 after subsequent phases, phase 5 investors at the prevailing price of $0.03 can realize potential returns of 100% by the time the token launches on exchanges. XRP Holds Steady at $2.29 Amid Bullish 2025 Forecasts As of writing on May 28, 2025, XRP stands at $2.29, stable despite the recent market volatility. Speculators expect a bright future for XRP, with projections setting aside a likely rise to $4 upon consolidation breakout. Bullish forecasts have XRP rising to $5 to $10 by year-end 2025, contingent on favorable market conditions and increased adoption. While XRP continues to be in the limelight for investors, upcoming altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also in the radar with prospects to deliver high returns. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Certik Audit Completed: Mutuum Finance Solidifies Trust and Transparency Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance has now officially completed its Certik smart contract audit, reinforcing the platform’s commitment to safety and reliability. Their open-source smart contracts are secure in design, instilling trust among users. Presale Momentum Many early investors have become very interested in MUTM following the price drop of the token to $0.03. In the upcoming phase, a 16.67% increase will make the token worth $0.035. Experts who expect post-launch prices to go up to $3 are pointing out that $0.03 is a great time to buy the token. That is why Mutuum Finance is preferred by DeFi enthusiasts who watch for affordable altcoins in the market. Mutuum Finance adds a Buy-and-Distribute system to its structure which is not typical for most speculation projects. It buys tokens on the market at set intervals and gives them to MUTM stakers, helping to gradually reduce the supply and drive people to stake for a longer time. It supports plans that help prices rise over the years and allow people to be part of the market for the long term. Engagement by using the leaderboard Along with building a strong community, Mutuum Finance has launched a leaderboard that continually highlights the 50 biggest holders of the token. MUTM allows users from the top 50 ranks to get bonus tokens, making everyone want to hold their positions and work their way higher in the rankings. It connects the benefits of DeFi together with community engagement. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.29 and Ripple enthusiasts are predicting it could scale up to $10 throughout 2025. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up speed, having raised $9.4M with more than 11,500 investors backing it. With its initial price at $0.03, MUTM may reach $0.06 by launch, giving investors a chance to double their money. Buy and distribute systems reward owners in addition to its exclusive DeFi lending, because the token is also certified by Certik.

Notably, signs of exhaustion are also beginning to surface for Bitcoin, especially in the past 48 hours. While long-term indicators suggest a bullish continuation for the Bitcoin price, short-term models indicate a breakdown of bullish strength, particularly as the cryptocurrency approaches the critical $100,000 support zone. Related Reading: $10 Million Fix? SUI Network Moves Fast After Cetus Exploit Scare This sentiment is relayed by popular crypto analyst Willy Woo, who shared the good and bad news based on Bitcoin’s current technicals. Good News: A Bullish Long-Term Signal Still Intact According to Woo, one of the strongest long-term signals, the Bitcoin Risk Signal, is currently trending downwards. This drop indicates that buy-side liquidity is currently dominant in the long-term environment, setting the stage for another strong leg upward. The lower the risk reading, the safer it is to hold or accumulate Bitcoin, and this signal’s current decline shows a relatively low-risk environment for long-term investors. Woo noted that this long-term setup is intact, and with Bitcoin trading well above the psychological six-figure mark, the momentum is still in favor of the bulls in the long term. At the time of writing, the local risk model, as shown in the chart below, is currently in the mid-range, having declined from peak levels in early 2025, and is expected to continue trending downwards. In another analysis, Willy Woo noted the next significant move could push it above $114,000 and trigger liquidations of short positions. Bad News For Bitcoin Price Although the long-term picture is still favorable, the short-term models, including the Speculation and SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) metrics, are flashing caution. Using this indicator, Woo noted that the strength of the rally from $75,000 to $112,000 has started to weaken, especially with flat capital inflow in the past three days. Keeping this in mind, Bitcoin’s price action this week is critical. “If we do not get follow through, then we will be up for another consolidation period,” the analyst said. If spot buying fails to pick up strongly in the coming week, which is the first week of June, especially with U.S. markets reopening after a long weekend, there will be a chance for a bearish pivot. The good and bad news can be summed up as follows: if buying pressure opens up quickly, Bitcoin could break above $114,000 and head toward the next major liquidity zone between $118,000 and $120,000. Failure to push higher could confirm bearish divergences and set the stage for another round of consolidation. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin?

Real value comes from projects showing results, whether it’s in development progress, user growth, or smart integrations. Many coins make noise, but only a few deliver substance. This guide looks at 4 different picks, Unstaked, Filecoin, Litecoin, and Toncoin, that are standing out in distinct ways. From AI-powered platforms to real utility in storage and payments, each one shows strong momentum. If you’re interested in spotting the top crypto gems to buy now, this list gives you a smart place to begin, with names that are doing more than just riding trends. 1. Unstaked: AI Agents Ready After Presale Ends Unstaked brings a unique twist by preparing real-time AI automation for crypto communities. Its autonomous agents, set to go live after the presale concludes, will run nonstop on apps like Telegram and X, handling support, posting updates, and boosting community activity without human staff. Each action they take will be logged on-chain, and users will earn $UNSD for engagement. These agents cost between $10 and $25 per month, much cheaper than hiring a team, and could save users up to 100 times their annual spending. Now in stage 17 of presale, Unstaked is priced at $0.01043. So far, it has raised over $8 million and sold more than 1 billion $UNSD. The expected launch price is $0.1819, offering a projected return of 2700% for early holders. It follows a fair launch model with no private allocations or VC rounds, keeping it widely accessible. Since $UNSD will be essential to run, improve, and oversee the agents, the usage of the coin is built into daily operations. While the agents haven’t launched yet, the structure and progress place Unstaked among the top crypto gems to buy now with solid future use. 2. Filecoin: Pushing Web3 Storage Further In 2025, Filecoin is staying relevant by providing decentralized storage that’s actually being used. Prices hover between $2.80 and $2.85 as of May, and the team is growing the network through real tools. The Avalanche bridge launched this month lets Avalanche smart contracts link directly to Filecoin storage, offering cheaper, provable, and compliant data solutions. The recent “Teep” upgrade also brings faster settlement, easier terms for storage hosts, and upgraded tools for builders. On top of that, the Fil+ system is speeding up how developers access Datacap with a new Metaallocator setup. AI platforms like SingularityNET and GoKite AI are now using Filecoin’s storage model, which adds another layer of traction. When blockchain and AI work together, that’s usually a strong sign. With solid tech steps and a roadmap that holds up, Filecoin keeps its place among the top crypto gems to buy now. 3. Litecoin: Long-Running and Still Relevant Litecoin may not grab headlines, but it keeps proving its strength with stable network use and price movement. As of now, LTC is at $96.47, seeing a 1.57% daily rise. It’s pushing against resistance at $96, and if that breaks, analysts are suggesting possible climbs to $120 or even $128. If Bitcoin heads toward $150K this year, some forecasts even see Litecoin above $200. The chain still records over 500,000 daily transactions, which speaks volumes about usage. Beyond this, platforms like BitPay and NOWPayments continue to support Litecoin, helping expand its presence in online commerce. An ETF proposal from Canary Capital is also in play, though currently awaiting regulatory clearance. For people looking for a reliable and active project, Litecoin is still one of the top crypto gems to buy now, especially if you prefer steady performance over hype. 4. Toncoin: Scaling Fast with Real Numbers Toncoin’s recent activity points to real traction, not just headlines. Its May 2025 price stands near $2.96 after a 0.71% uptick in a day, though it remains 6.57% down for the month and nearly 54% below its all-time high of $8.27. But while the price dropped, usage spiked. Daily transactions rocketed from 100,000 to 1.2 million, a huge jump for any chain. This rise in network activity is tied to several new features: integration with USDT, fresh tools like TON DNS and TON Storage, and a more focused ecosystem after removing its cross-chain bridge. Technical watchers are watching for a breakout above $3.20, which could push the price toward $5. Currently valued at $7.37 billion in market cap, Toncoin is just behind Monero. With growing utility and strong development, Toncoin clearly fits among the top crypto gems to buy now. Final Say! From planned AI rollouts and strong storage tech to proven payment systems and fast-growing chains, each of these names reflects practical growth, not empty talk. Filecoin’s role in AI and storage blends is expanding fast, while Litecoin continues to offer reliable performance. Toncoin, despite price dips, is seeing real user growth, and Unstaked’s AI model, set to launch after presale, could change how crypto projects manage communities. For anyone aiming to find the most promising cryptos in 2025 , these are the top crypto gems to buy now that deserve attention for their actual progress and usage, not just marketing noise.

Recent global economic uncertainties and blockchain innovations have reignited interest in altcoins that demonstrate real utility and growth potential. One project steadily capturing attention is Qubetics ($TICS), which is positioned to solve persistent blockchain challenges that predecessors like Injective could not fully address. As the crypto sphere moves toward greater interoperability and usability, identifying the top cryptos to buy for 2025 involves recognizing those with robust technology and market traction. Qubetics is rapidly emerging as a front-runner, with its ongoing crypto presale making it an accessible and compelling option in this increasingly competitive market. Injective Protocol: A Missed Opportunity in Decentralized Finance Injective Protocol once stood at the forefront of decentralized finance (DeFi), offering a fully decentralized exchange (DEX) with advanced features like cross-chain trading and zero gas fees. Its innovative Layer-2 scalability solutions positioned it as a pioneer capable of transforming derivatives and spot trading on the blockchain. The token’s crypto presale and early phases saw significant enthusiasm, fueling rapid price appreciation. Yet, many did not capitalize on Injective’s rise during this critical period, resulting in a missed opportunity as the token surged before stabilizing. While Injective remains an influential player with ongoing development, the token’s most explosive gains have likely passed. Why does Injective still appear among the top cryptos to buy for 2025? Its core technology continues to underpin decentralized exchanges, but the maturation of the market and increased competition have tempered expectations for similar rapid growth in the near term. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Rising Star Among Top Cryptos to Buy for 2025 Qubetics stands out as a promising entry on the list of top cryptos to buy for 2025. Currently in its 36th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 514 million tokens to more than 27,300 holders, raising upwards of $17.5 million. At a token price of $0.3064, the project remains accessible to a broad audience eager to participate before the mainnet launch. Analyst projections for Qubetics are particularly optimistic. The token is forecasted to reach $1 after the presale, suggesting a 226% return. Post-presale predictions indicate a surge to $5, equating to a 1531% ROI, while the mainnet launch could potentially push the price between $10 and $15, delivering an impressive 4794% return. Such forecasts place Qubetics among the most compelling top cryptos to buy for 2025. Qubetics’ Technological Edge: QubeQode and Qubetics IDE Qubetics offers a dual-pronged technological innovation through its QubeQode platform and Qubetics Integrated Development Environment (IDE). These tools aim to simplify blockchain adoption and empower businesses, professionals, and individuals with versatile solutions. For businesses, QubeQode enables seamless cross-chain asset management and smart contract deployment, fostering interoperability that reduces operational friction. Professionals benefit from customizable workflows and secure, decentralized applications facilitated by Qubetics IDE, increasing efficiency and control over digital operations. On the individual level, Qubetics prioritizes privacy and control, allowing users to engage with blockchain ecosystems without relinquishing custody of their assets. The crypto presale’s affordability and growing community support accentuate Qubetics’ potential to reshape blockchain usability and adoption in 2025. Why did Qubetics secure a spot among the top cryptos to buy for 2025? Its innovative platforms combined with an accessible crypto presale provide a gateway to exponential growth opportunities previously unseen. Conclusion: Based on Research and Analysis Based on research and analysis, the missed opportunity with Injective highlights the importance of early participation in promising projects. In contrast, Qubetics emerges as a compelling candidate among the top cryptos to buy for 2025 , blending cutting-edge technology with real-world applications and an affordable crypto presale phase. Analyst forecasts support significant growth potential, making Qubetics an attractive option for market entrants seeking substantial upside. Market participants should consider Qubetics’ unique positioning alongside established projects, maintaining awareness of the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments. This period offers a rare chance to engage with a project poised to redefine blockchain interoperability and adoption.

The presale is in stage 36 with tokens priced at $0.3064, open to a wide range of participants. Are analyst price predictions for Qubetics guaranteed? No. While forecasts are optimistic, crypto markets remain highly volatile and subject to various risks. Has Injective’s growth potential declined? Injective’s initial surge has moderated, with future growth expected to be steadier due to increased competition. Which other cryptos are recommended for 2025? Ethereum, Polkadot, and Solana are notable projects with ongoing development and ecosystem expansion.

Amidst the crypto market euphoria seen in the past two months, TRX has maintained a steady price growth reporting percentage increase of 17.39% since the beginning of April. Interestingly, prominent crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci has shared an intriguing market insight that indicates TRX is likely to remain on the uptrend for the foreseeable future. Related Reading: Bullish Candle Formation Suggests The XRP Price Could Touch $22 TRX Futures Market Signals Good Accumulation Opportunity In an X post on May 30, Burak Kesmeci postulated that TRX remains in a prime position for further price gains based on developments in futures retail activity. Using data from CryptoQuant, the analyst explains that TRX previously reached a market of $0.45 in December 2024 which aligned with a period of peak retail speculation as indicated by the cluster of red dots on the chart. During this period, many traders likely leveraged long, trading the rally in anticipation of a sustained price uptrend. However, TRX prices soon crashed to $0.21 during a broader market correction that lasted for the majority of the first trimester of 2025. This period is marked by a sparse amount of gray dots suggesting a neutral retail participation in the futures market. Amidst resumed crypto bull market rebound, TRX prices have risen to around $0.27. However, retail activity has remained neutral with no significant uptick in speculation or emergence of a “mad crowd” as seen in December 2024. According to Burak Kesmeci, these findings indicate there is significant potential for an upswing in the TRX market as retail futures activity is far from overheated. However, there is a need for macroeconomic and geopolitical tensions to subside before these projected gains can occur. Recently, the crypto market produced a negative reaction to reports of the US and China failing to find a common ground in an ongoing trade talk amidst a 90-day truce before both countries.

Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is valued at $806.98 million. According to data from CoinCodex, TRX investors are strongly bullish despite recent losses as evidenced by the Fear & Greed Index of 60. Coincodex analysts project TRX to soon rediscover its bullish form with forecasted price targets of $0.32 and $0.29 in the next five and thirty days respectively. In addition, they paint a positive long-term outlook with a price target of $0.51 in six months.

Let’s break down what’s happening with XRP’s price action and the important support and resistance levels to watch. XRP Bounces from Key Support Zone On the daily chart, XRP recently bounced from a key support area between $2.10 and $2.15. This zone has been flagged as an important level, and for now, the price is holding steady above that range. If XRP falls below this support, the next levels to watch would be around $2.05 and $2.00. A drop under $2.00 could signal a bigger decline in the coming days or weeks. Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern in Progress? Technically, XRP is possibly forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily timeframe. This is often seen as a bullish setup. For this pattern to confirm, XRP needs to bounce higher in the coming days and break through the golden pocket resistance zone between $2.56 and $2.62. A confirmed breakout above $2.62 could open the doors for a strong rally toward new all-time highs. However, for now, this pattern is only a possibility — it hasn’t been confirmed yet. Resistance Areas That Could Slow XRP’s Progress Before XRP reaches the golden pocket resistance, it will face other challenges. The price will need to clear resistance levels around $2.33 to $2.34 and then again near $2.43 to $2.44. Another major barrier stands at $2.48, which has been a key swing level in the past. These areas could lead to short-term pullbacks or pauses as traders take profits and reassess the market situation. Market Reaction: A Bounce in Progress In the shorter term, XRP is showing a minor bounce, often called a wave-four bounce in technical analysis. This small move upward happened after the price tested support around $2.07 to $2.08. Although the price didn’t fully hit the expected $2.06 mark, the reaction suggests traders are still active around these levels.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-01 03:05:55

BTC/USD fell by 8% as of May 31, retreating to levels below its previous all-time high. This decline leaves the token nearly $9,000 below its recent record peak, putting short-term sentiment to the test. Demand Metrics Signal a Cooling Trend A report from CryptoQuant shared with Cointelegraph suggests that Bitcoin’s demand growth may be hitting a temporary ceiling. The analytics platform estimates that Bitcoin demand has increased by 229,000 BTC in the last 30 days, nearing the 279,000 BTC peak seen in December 2024. “Some of Bitcoin’s demand metrics may be reaching a short-term top, which could imply a pause in the current rally,” the report stated. It also noted that whale balances have risen by 2.8% over the past month, a pattern often followed by reduced accumulation from major holders. Additionally, average unrealized profits hovered around 30% when prices neared $111,000—another sign of an imminent slowdown. Analysts Eye Key Technical Levels Prominent trader Mags highlighted the importance of the upcoming weekly candle close. “On the daily chart, BTC has broken below the previous all-time high and is facing rejection at that same level,” Mags observed. “This might look like the start of a deeper correction.” If Bitcoin closes the week below the December 2024 high of $104,450, it may form a bearish pattern before climbing again, he added. Bull Market Outlook Remains Intact for Now Despite the current retreat, broader sentiment remains optimistic. Trader Aksel Kibar said the bull market structure is still intact, provided prices remain above $73,700. He reiterated his 2025 target of $137,000 for BTC, aligning with a midterm bullish outlook. CryptoQuant analysts see $120,000 as a key level where many investors might choose to lock in profits. While the path forward could involve further short-term losses, most analysts agree the bull market has not been derailed.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-01 03:36:34

According to customs office data released on Sunday, exports declined by 1.3% compared to May last year, better than the 2.4% drop economists had forecast in a Bloomberg survey . Imports fell 5.3% over the same period, widening the country’s trade surplus to $6.9 billion. The slide in exports comes as South Korea prepares for the full effect of US duties. In April, Trump slapped a 25% tariff on Korean imports—one of the harshest levies placed on a US ally—though this was temporarily cut to 10% for 90 days. He has also threatened to extend the tariffs to cover Samsung Electronics Co.’s mobile phones. South Korea’s first priority will be to navigate US tariffs Navigating Trump’s trade policy will be among the first tasks for the incoming South Korean president after the June 3 election. Seoul’s trade officials have been trying to secure a revised tariff agreement with Washington, but talks have made little headway. Officials say a leadership gap in Seoul has stalled progress. If no new deal is reached, the tariff will revert to 25%. There is also uncertainty over whether the tariffs can take effect at all. A US federal appeals court has paused a ruling that could overturn much of Trump’s tariff strategy, yet the administration insists the duties will stand in one form or another. Breaking down the May figures, the customs office reported auto exports dropped 4.4% year-on-year, while semiconductor shipments jumped 21.2%. Since chips and cars drive much of South Korea’s overseas sales, these shifts were significant. Exports to the US fell 8.1%, and sales to China were down 8.4%. Meanwhile, the broader economy remains fragile. On Thursday, the Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rate to support growth and almost halved its forecast for 2025 amid concerns over trade uncertainty and weak domestic consumption. Governor Rhee Chang-yong indicated that further rate cuts could follow, pointing to slowing growth momentum.

While Hedera (HBAR) shows signs of a 26% pullback and Pi Network aims for a $0.90 breakout, Web3 ai is moving in a different direction. It is building an AI-powered platform focused on real use, not just price charts. Web3 ai is not chasing trends. Its presale supports a full product suite with trading support, risk tools, and DeFi features all in one place. Having raised over $6.6 million, the project is shifting focus from fast price changes to long-term value. A possible 1747% return shows that some are looking beyond the next chart move. Web3 ai Draws Interest as a Smart All-in-One Crypto Tool While many still switch between different tools for research and DeFi planning, Web3 ai is creating one smart system for it all. The presale offers more than early access. It is a chance to support a full AI system designed to improve the way people interact with crypto. Powered by machine learning and natural language tools, Web3 ai includes a scam checker, yield planner, and risk alert features. All of this comes together in one easy-to-use platform. The goal is to replace complexity with clarity and help users manage crypto smarter. That vision is drawing attention. The presale has passed $6.6 million in funding. With a current stage 7 price of $0.000402 and launch set at $0.005242, early users could see a 1747% gain. Those tracking future trends or the next major platform may find Web3 ai a smart place to start. In the end, this isn’t just another crypto launch. It’s a move toward a smarter platform that aims to understand what traders need before the market even shifts. Hedera Watchlist: Bearish Pattern Raises Concerns The Hedera (HBAR) price outlook is facing uncertainty as key chart signals point to a possible dip. A bearish flag has appeared, often seen as a continuation of an earlier drop, and it suggests that a 26% decline could happen if the pattern holds. This risk becomes more serious due to a $55 million liquidation level that could add pressure and speed up a fall. HBAR is finding it tough to move higher, as trading activity slows and sellers take control. Important support levels are now in focus. If they fail, the price could drop more sharply. Traders watching Hedera (HBAR) should pay close attention to the next move. The flag pattern is nearing a critical point. How the token reacts could decide how the market feels about it in the near future. Pi Network Moves Toward Possible Breakout from Triangle Pattern Pi Network price activity is building interest as a symmetrical triangle forms on the chart. This pattern often shows a quiet period before a breakout. If the price moves above the top trendline, it could rise by 20%. PI is trading near $0.75 and approaching a key area that may decide its short-term trend. This triangle, with its tightening lines, points to a decision moment. If PI breaks above the upper line, it might reach $0.90, in line with the 20% gain. But if it fails to do that, it could fall back to test the lower edge, which might slow its momentum. Investors are closely watching volume and overall market tone. A strong jump in buyer activity would support a breakout. If that support doesn’t show up, PI may stay within the pattern for a while longer. Final Say While traders follow price swings in tokens like Hedera and Pi Network, others are exploring a different path. Web3 ai’s crypto presale stands out for its focus on building tools that solve real problems, not just reacting to charts. Instead of aiming for fast gains, Web3 ai is developing AI-powered tools for the crypto space. These tools are designed to help users with things like trading support and risk alerts, all in one system. It reflects a shift in interest from short-term action to long-term value. In a market often driven by quick moves and hype, Web3 ai shows the value of building something useful. It invites a closer look from those who believe the future of crypto lies in what works, not just what catches attention.

All eyes are now on a crucial support level around $0.60. The big question — will Pi manage to hold this line, or are we about to see a sharper correction if it slips below this mark? Current Status of Pi Coin Launched in 2019, Pi Coin is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency that allows mining via smartphones, making it widely accessible. After years of anticipation, it was finally listed on exchanges in February 2025. Although initial expectations suggested a listing price of $50, the coin launched at around $3, only to fall to nearly $0.60 — a sharp 78% drop from its peak. Despite this, Pi Coin still commands attention due to its unique mobile-first mining model and a massive user base of over 35 million. Pi has been struggling to break past resistance levels near $0.79, while buyers are showing signs of hesitation at lower levels. Key indicators like the RSI, MACD, and Stochastic RSI reflect weakening momentum, with most metrics leaning bearish. Additionally, a descending wedge pattern has formed since mid-May, yet the price remains trapped inside it. Pi Network Price Prediction For Year End According to CoinDCX, Pi Network is expected to start November 2025 on a bullish note, reclaiming the $2.00 mark and potentially rising to around $2.38 to $2.40 by month’s end. In December, the bullish momentum may strengthen, pushing the price to $2.75 to $2.80. Challenges Facing Pi Coin Mainnet Still Pending : Despite its listing, Pi Network’s full mainnet has not been launched. This raises doubts about its real-world capabilities and long-term viability. Limited Exchange Listings : Pi Coin is available on very few exchanges, restricting access and limiting trading volume. Regulatory Uncertainty : Like many cryptocurrencies, Pi Coin faces regulatory hurdles, adding to investor caution. Overhyped Comparisons to Bitcoin : Although some claim Pi Coin could reach $1,000 or more, such projections seem far-fetched. At that price, its market cap would exceed $6 trillion — compared to its current estimated valuation of just $500 million.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-01 04:16:05

Nevertheless, the price lacks sufficient bullish momentum and a deeper correction seems plausible in the mid-term. Technical Analysis The Daily Chart Following its breakout above the previous all-time high at $109K and printing a new peak at $111K, Bitcoin met strong resistance that has sparked notable selling pressure. The failure to sustain momentum above this key psychological level has resulted in a bearish rejection, pushing the asset back below the $109K threshold. This price action coincided with the sweep of buy-side liquidity resting above the previous swing high, allowing smart money to execute sell orders efficiently. As a result, the market has entered a corrective phase, now approaching the daily fair value gap (FVG) between $97K and $100K. This zone likely holds substantial demand, potentially acting as a support zone that could trigger a bullish reaction. Should the price stabilize within this FVG, a rebound toward the $111K resistance becomes likely. Conversely, failure to hold this level could pave the way for further downside, with the next key support residing near the $95K region. The 4-Hour Chart On the 4-hour timeframe, intensified selling pressure at the $111K resistance has caused BTC to break below its previously maintained ascending price channel. The subsequent pullback toward the broken channel boundary near $108K has confirmed the bearish breakout and suggests weakening momentum. Currently, the price is consolidating within a critical support-resistance band spanning from $100K to $108K. As long as Bitcoin remains within this range, short-term volatility is expected. However, a decisive breakout, either above $108K or below $100K, will likely set the tone for the next significant move, with either a bullish recovery or an extended correction unfolding based on the breakout direction. On-chain Analysis The Realized Price of mid-term holders has consistently functioned as a pivotal support or resistance zone, making it a valuable indicator for gauging broader market sentiment. This metric, representing the average on-chain acquisition cost of UTXOs held by long-term investors, often aligns with key turning points in Bitcoin’s price cycle. Currently, Bitcoin remains positioned above the Realized Price of the 3–6 month holder cohort, a signal that this group remains in profit and has not faced significant stress. However, recent selling pressure and a rejection from the $111K level have dragged the price closer to the Realized Price of the 3–6 month holder range, which resides around the $98K zone. This places the $98K–$100K area in the spotlight as a crucial support region. A firm reaction from this zone would confirm continued confidence from mid-term holders and may act as the launchpad for a renewed bullish leg, potentially propelling Bitcoin to fresh all-time highs. Failure to hold this support, however, could shift market sentiment and open the door to deeper corrections.

According to the blockchain analysis platform Lookonchain, the funds were sent to Ulbricht’s donation wallet just a few hours ago. Crypto community fuels Ulbricht’s fresh start with millions in donations The generous donation is another line of donations Ulbricht has seen since being released. Kraken, a cryptocurrency exchange , donated $111,111 in Bitcoin earlier this year to help him adjust to life outside prison. Free Ross also claims to have received over $270,000 in cryptocurrency donations to help Ulbricht prepare for life after prison. Another address associated with Ulbricht collected $4,615 in Ethereum, USDC, Tether (USDT), and Binance Coin (BNB) in the same period. On January 21, 2025, Donald Trump signed a full and unconditional pardon for Silk Road dissenter and operator after 11 years of a double life sentence without parole. Ulbricht was convicted in 2015 in New York in a narcotics and money-laundering conspiracy and sentenced to life in prison. Despite his release, questions have been raised as to the financial status of Ulbricht, as reports indicate he could hold access to inactive Bitcoin wallets associated with Silk Road, believed to contain approximately $47m. Ulbricht has been in the news recently after attending the Bitcoin 2025 conference, where he thanked his staunch supporters for coming to his aid while behind bars. He stressed the need for solidarity in the crypto community, saying, “You didn’t leave me. You didn’t forget me. You wrote me letters. You raised money for my defense.” Ulbricht sells some personal items to eliminate the reminders about his arrest The founder of the infamous Silk Road darknet marketplace has also raised approximately $1.8 million in Bitcoin through an auction of personal items and artwork created during his incarceration. The auction, hosted on the Bitcoin-powered collectibles platform Scarce City, featured 13 artifacts from Ulbricht’s life before and during his imprisonment. Among the items auctioned were Ulbricht’s prison ID card, which fetched the highest bid, and an oil painting. Other notable pieces included his prison sneakers, sweatsuit, t-shirt, prison notebook, locker lock, and three ID cards. Additionally, personal items from his life prior to arrest, such as a down sleeping bag, djembe drum, backpack, and a pair of Vibram FiveFingers shoes, were also sold. “I’ve left Arizona, the state where I was in prison. It’s time to travel. That means downsizing and turning the page,” Ulbricht wrote in a message on the auction page . He continued to say that he decided to auction some personal items from before his arrest and during his time in prison. He emphasized that he didn’t need the reminders and noted that some of his supporters would fancy them. Ulbricht’s last prison ID card featuring the early Bitcoin devotee’s broad smile is fetching a winning bid of 11 BTC, now valued at more than $1.1 million. Concerning the broad smile on the ID card, he revealed on the item’s page that Ulbricht still smiled that day despite the guard’s effort to make him stop smiling for the photo. He says his joy comes from within, even though he was in prison. The painting created by Ulbricht and “Omega,” the inmate who taught him oil painting, was another item for auction. Based on reports from sources, the painting took in a high bid of 1.01 BTC. A painting entitled Archway by Ross Ulbricht and another prisoner known as Omega The bidders are set to complete their payment by Monday because the bids are due on June 2. About the painting, Ulbricht said that he was so impressed by how the archway looked in a photo that he had to paint it. He expressed the feeling behind those paintings. According to Ulbricht, the painting made him feel as if he was walking through the archway, as if something amazing was waiting on the other side.

The offering, priced above the last market close, was spearheaded by His Royal Highness, Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Abdulaziz Al Saud, Chairman of Eleventh Holding Company in Saudi Arabia. The capital raise also included participation from a range of prominent investors in the digital asset space, including the investment office of VivoPower Chairman Kevin Chin. VivoPower said it is launching the first XRP-focused digital asset treasury strategy by a publicly traded company, intending to contribute to the development of the XRPL ecosystem. The company intends to allocate a significant portion of the funds raised towards accumulating XRP and implementing blockchain-based financial applications. The move marks a broader shift in the company’s strategic focus, as it prepares to spin off its Tembo electric vehicle business and Caret Digital asset mining subsidiary. Prince Abdulaziz Confirms Long-Term Commitment to XRP Prince Abdulaziz commented on the initiative, describing it as a culmination of a decade of involvement in the digital asset sector and a long-term commitment to XRP. He explained that VivoPower was selected for its strategic emphasis on XRP and its active plans to support the XRPL ecosystem .

Traidman is investing in the offering and has joined VivoPower’s Board of Advisors as Chairman. He praised VivoPower’s XRP-focused strategy as a forward-thinking move that aligns with institutional momentum behind real-world blockchain applications. VivoPower’s Executive Chairman, Kevin Chin, welcomed the Prince’s leadership in the capital raise and reiterated the shared vision among investors focused on XRP. Chin, himself a long-term XRP holder, stated that the treasury strategy aims to scale benefits for both the XRP community and VivoPower stakeholders. He highlighted the practical value of XRP in addressing inefficiencies in cross-border payments . He expressed interest in deploying XRP-based solutions within VivoPower’s operations, specifically in its Tembo and Caret Digital units. Next Steps and Shareholder Approval The offering is subject to shareholder approval and standard closing conditions, with a meeting scheduled around June 18, 2025. The raised capital will primarily support XRP accumulation and ecosystem development, while also addressing corporate debt and operational costs. The transition solidifies VivoPower’s intent to become a dedicated XRP-focused digital asset treasury entity. This development represents a milestone in the institutional adoption of XRP and its underlying ledger technology. Vincent Van Code’s tweet drew direct attention to the political and corporate alliances involved, identifying key participants such as Prince Abdulaziz, President Trump, and members of the Ripple Board. His message emphasized that these actors share a collective understanding of XRP’s strategic potential. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

The 10-day and 100-day simple moving averages are close, at $4.57 and $4.52 respectively. The RSI is at 48.36, near the neutral zone. The Stochastic oscillator reads 60.71, suggesting moderate bullish momentum. The MACD level of 0.0152 indicates a slight upward trend. These factors suggest the price may continue to consolidate or move toward the nearby support or resistance levels.

Currently trading in the range of $0.22 to $0.25, the token has seen a 5.08% decrease in the past week and a 4.01% decline over the last month.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 50.03, indicating a neutral market without clear overbought or oversold conditions. Both the 10-day and 100-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA) stand at $0.23, suggesting a consolidation of short-term and long-term trends. The MACD level is slightly positive at 0.0004599, hinting at minimal bullish momentum. The stochastic oscillator registers at 65.16, below the traditional overbought threshold. Key support levels are at $0.21 and $0.18. A drop below the immediate support could lead to an 18% decline to the next level. Resistance is at $0.27 and $0.30. Breaking above the nearest resistance could result in a 20% rise, signaling potential recovery. Traders are watching these levels to assess future movements based on the current technical data.

Right now, Kaspa (KAS) market sentiment is holding strong after a major network upgrade and a large token unlock. On the flip side, the MOONPIG price crash wiped out over 65% of its value after a single whale took profits, rattling the market. Both show how different the paths can be when hype isn’t backed by structure. Then comes Punisher Coin ($PUN) , flipping the typical meme coin script. It’s not just about hype, it’s about value through action. $PUN lets users earn by participating, creating, and sticking around. This isn’t another short-lived trend. With its pay-to-play model and weekly burns, $PUN is making a serious case as one of the top crypto coins to buy now. $PUN is Rewriting the Top Crypto Coins Order Book Punisher Coin ($PUN) brings something fresh to meme coin culture, real rewards for real action. Every Punisher Mission pays in USDT or tokens for things like meme contests, crypto puzzles, and more. Instead of speculation, the project rewards engagement, whether you’re contributing content or completing tasks. Weekly token burns keep the supply low, adding another reason to stay involved. Fueling all of this is the Mean Meme Machine, a tool that lets anyone create and share memes, with top picks getting spotlighted across official platforms. The War Room takes it further. With just $100 in $PUN or a presale spot, holders unlock early access to missions, airdrops, and exclusive content. It’s designed to keep people in, not just buying and leaving. The presale is currently in Stage 2, priced at $0.00531, with over $77,000 raised so far. Out of 25 total stages, each step burns unsold tokens to build long-term scarcity. While Kaspa (KAS) market sentiment shows strength through consistency, $PUN is showing it through innovation and has thus been a project where crypto whales have shown interest in. Potential 1000x climbs coming? All the fundamentals are there. It’s not about waiting for hype, it’s building it from within. If you’re tracking crypto coins to buy now, this one has a model that’s already working. Hard Fork Boosts Kaspa (KAS) Market Sentiment Kaspa (KAS) is showing how consistency can win, especially after the recent Crescendo v1.0.0 hard fork. Live since May 5, the upgrade increased block speed to 10 per second, helping boost transaction flow without compromising security. That move, along with a $13 million token unlock days later, had minimal downside impact, proof that Kaspa (KAS) market sentiment is steady for now. Price sits around $0.1016, with a solid 80% gain so far in 2025. Daily volume is near $60 million, and wallet growth from 500,000 to 1.8 million shows rising adoption. Predictions range between $0.10 and $0.26 for the year, backed by a growing DeFi and NFT presence. While others ride out hype cycles, Kaspa is playing the long game, one block at a time. Whale Sell-Off Triggers MOONPIG Price Crash MOONPIG had its breakout moment, hitting $0.12 and topping $125 million in market cap. But it was short-lived. After a major wallet belonging to James Wynn dumped millions in tokens, a sell-off followed, leading to a sharp MOONPIG price crash. The coin now trades at around $0.0384, with the community split between hopefuls and skeptics. Even so, MOONPIG is still building. On May 28, it launched an official mobile game on the Apple App Store, giving the token added visibility. Earlier in May, one trader famously flipped $7.6K of TRUMP tokens into $1.4M worth of MOONPIG at its peak. But the sharp drop proves how fast things shift. Unlike steady Kaspa (KAS) market sentiment, MOONPIG’s chart shows what happens when the hype outpaces the roadmap. Summing Up The differences couldn’t be clearer. Kaspa (KAS) market sentiment has stayed strong thanks to real upgrades and a loyal base. In contrast, the MOONPIG price crash shows how fragile meme coin momentum can be when major holders exit. Both cases offer a snapshot of what’s working, and what’s not, in today’s market. Then there’s Punisher Coin ($PUN), which is setting up its own rulebook. From paying users to participate, to rewarding meme creators and burning tokens weekly, $PUN isn’t here for a flash pump. It’s here to build. With its presale live at $0.00531 and over $77k raised, it’s building utility while others chase it. If you’re scanning the charts for crypto coins to buy now, this is one that’s not waiting for hype, it’s earning it.

While PEPE’s rise was largely driven by hype and speculation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s rapid growth comes from solid development and genuine utility. This milestone clearly shows that MUTM is more than just a fleeting trend — it is building real traction with lasting potential. Why wallet growth matters Wallet growth is one of the most reliable early indicators of a project’s adoption and future success. Unlike meme tokens that often experience short bursts of hype, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is attracting users because it offers real value through its decentralized lending and borrowing platform. Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s unique combination of peer-to-peer (P2P) and peer-to-contract (P2C) lending models sets it apart. The P2P model allows users to lend and borrow tokens that are usually unavailable on P2C platforms e.g memecoins like PEPE and DOGE, increasing flexibility and choice. In the P2C model, users pool their assets together, and interest rates adjust automatically based on supply and demand. This dynamic system ensures efficient capital allocation and attractive returns for lenders. Strong passive income potential One of the biggest draws of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is its passive income opportunity. Depositing cryptocurrencies like Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC), or stablecoins such as DAI into Mutuum’s liquidity pools lets users earn interest that grows as borrowing demand increases. Interest rates fluctuate based on pool utilization, rewarding lenders during periods of high demand with attractive yields. To put this into perspective, a $1,000 investment in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at the current price of $0.03 could grow 15 to 35 times in value, turning into $15,000 to $35,000. This price appreciation is combined with ongoing passive income from interest and dividends. MUTM token holders who stake their mtTokens also receive rewards funded by protocol revenue buybacks, enhancing long-term earnings. Phase 1 to phase 5: proven growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) started its presale at $0.01 per token during Phase 1. The price has already tripled to $0.03 in Phase 5, reflecting a 200% increase and rewarding early investors handsomely. So far, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has generated approximately $9.70 million in liquidity with over 11,650 active holders. These figures show strong market interest and support the case for continued growth. According to the project roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a beta version of its platform alongside the live token release. This upcoming beta will allow users to experience the lending and borrowing system firsthand, further driving adoption and engagement. Additionally, ongoing initiatives like the $100,000 giveaway and the recent CertiK audit reinforce the project’s commitment to security and community trust. The CertiK audit completed in May 2025 involved manual review and static analysis, resulting in a solid Token Scan score of 70. This independent verification assures users that Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s smart contracts are secure and reliable. In an industry where trust is paramount, this audit adds a crucial layer of confidence for both investors and users. Utility that drives sustainable demand Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s value goes beyond price speculation. Its lending and borrowing system addresses real user needs, such as accessing liquidity without selling assets. Users can deposit ETH or DAI as collateral to borrow other tokens, maintaining exposure to their original holdings while gaining liquidity for new opportunities. This approach helps avoid taxable events and supports more sophisticated trading and investment strategies. Pepe (PEPE) experienced explosive growth fueled mainly by social media hype and community memes. Although it attracted many holders quickly, its utility and long-term value remain limited. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s wallet growth reflects genuine interest fueled by its platform’s functionality, making its trajectory more sustainable and less volatile. While PEPE’s momentum has plateaued, MUTM is still in the early stages of value accumulation with strong foundations. Why now is the best time to invest The difference between Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s Phase 1 price of $0.01 and the current Phase 5 price of $0.03 shows how much value has been created so far. But the greatest profit opportunities remain ahead, as later phases will likely offer smaller gains. Early investors who jump in now not only benefit from price appreciation but also start earning passive income immediately. With more than 11,650 holders and nearly $9.70 million generated in liquidity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is proving that this is a once-in-a-cycle opportunity to build generational wealth. The combination of price upside, passive dividends, and expanding platform utility means MUTM tokens are a must-have for serious DeFi participants.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/xrp-today-vs-2017-analyst-foresees-a-coming-massive-breakout-heres-the-timeline/,"On May 30, 2025, crypto market analyst Galaxy shared a comparative view of XRP’s current weekly chart against its historical movement in 2017. In a post on the social platform X, Galaxy stated: “$XRP today vs. 2017. Looking very similar. Consolidated for 210 days then and we are now at day 182. Curious to see how it will unfold.” The post included a chart highlighting two specific periods of price consolidation following major upward price moves—one from 2017 and one ongoing in 2025. The 2017 chart section Galaxy referenced shows XRP consolidating for approximately 210 days (30 weekly candles) following a sharp price surge. A similar consolidation phase appears to be forming in the current market structure, with 182 days (26 weekly candles) having elapsed since the most recent sharp move upward. Both zones exhibit price compression after impulsive moves, and Galaxy notes the resemblance in structure and timing. In the image Galaxy shared, the 2017 consolidation zone was followed by a significant upward continuation, which drove XRP toward its all-time high during that cycle. The implication of the post is not a forecast, but an observation of pattern similarity, leaving open the possibility of a comparable outcome depending on how the current structure develops. $XRP today vs. 2017. Looking very similar. Consolidated for 210 days then and we are now at day 182. Curious to see how it will unfold. pic.twitter.com/NquEaLkFRh — Galaxy (@galaxyBTC) May 30, 2025 Additional Market Context Provided by Community Member An X user identified as Ivelin responded to Galaxy’s post by offering an alternative perspective grounded in historical price behavior and cycle dynamics. Ivelin wrote: “The difference is we haven’t broken 2018 ATH unlike 2017 when it had already broken it at this point when you show it. Also we missed last bull market and had 7 year accumulation, which leads to longer period for each thing. So we are much more likely at this point and we still have 100x to go.” We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 To support this commentary, Ivelin shared a separate chart showing a broader technical pattern that includes XRP’s all-time high and long-term consolidation. This chart features a symmetrical triangle pattern starting from around 2014 and culminating in a breakout attempt in 2025. Ivelin’s interpretation emphasizes that XRP’s 2017 breakout had already surpassed previous highs by the time consolidation ended, whereas the current 2025 price remains under the 2018 peak. According to this analysis, the cycle may be unfolding at a slower pace due to extended accumulation and a missed participation in the 2021 bull market. Ivelin’s chart also outlines multiple resistance and support levels, highlighting the prolonged compression XRP experienced over several years. These technical structures suggest that the longer accumulation phase may yield a larger breakout, with the potential for significant returns, depending on market conditions and continued momentum. The tweet by Galaxy brings attention to technical similarities between XRP’s 2017 and 2025 weekly price charts, specifically the structure and duration of post-rally consolidation phases. While Galaxy highlights the timing and pattern resemblance, additional commentary from Ivelin provides a broader macro perspective, pointing out key differences in all-time high positions, market cycle timing, and accumulation duration. These perspectives together contribute to an ongoing technical assessment of XRP’s current market structure, without offering definitive price predictions. The outcome of the present consolidation remains to be seen. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

Table of Contents XRP price prediction: Can Ripple Foundation hold $2.27 as regulatory uncertainty settles in? Technical outlook: A cliffhanger for XRP’s price prediction ETF buzz adds fire to Ripple Foundation’s bullish outlook Unilabs reshapes the $500 billion asset management market Egrag Crypto has issued a highly positive XRP price prediction. The crypto trader says that Ripple’s Foundation token could hit $11 in the next few years. This outlook is fueled by growing hopes for a spot ETF. While big players eye XRP, retail investors are shifting to Unilabs for quicker, steadier gains. The fund’s token, UNIL, is priced at just $0.051 and is gaining attention fast. What sets it apart is its revenue-sharing model. Unilabs gives 30% of its earnings back to token holders through dividends. This rewards early buyers and builds long-term value as the fund grows. You might also like: As ETH targets $4k, rising DeFi coin Unilabs attracts ADA holders with better opportunities XRP price prediction: Can Ripple Foundation hold $2.27 as regulatory uncertainty settles in? Ripple’s XRP is testing key support near $2.27 after falling from $2.65. This drop has weakened short-term bullish sentiment for XRP’s price prediction. If the token breaks below this level, losses could extend toward $2.07 or even April’s low at $1.61. The 100-day EMA is also under pressure, adding to the risk. Alongside price struggles, Ripple Foundation faces regulatory uncertainty. On June 5, the SEC will host a major digital assets conference. Ripple Foundation has already sent a letter urging the SEC to modernize outdated crypto laws, especially for secondary market transactions. The company wants clear rules for developers and investors, especially in a project’s early stages. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce has raised the key issue: when does a digital asset stop being an investment contract? Until the SEC offers real answers – rather than just enforcement – markets will likely stay cautious. Ripple Foundation may need regulatory clarity and stronger momentum to create a better XRP price prediction. Technical outlook: A cliffhanger for XRP’s price prediction Ripple Foundation’s token is on edge. The MACD flashed a bearish crossover on May 20, and the RSI has dropped below 50, signaling increased selling pressure. The chart shows a bear flag forming, hinting at a possible 55% fall to $1.00 if support gives way. Still, the SuperTrend holds at $2.17, acting as a key support zone. Zooming out, the longer-term view offers hope. A falling wedge is close to completion. If XRP’s price prediction breaks above $2.42 and clears the wedge, it could target $3.40. The RSI rising from 31 to 47 shows that buyers are slowly coming back. XRP is at a critical point. Bulls need to defend key levels to avoid a breakdown. A move higher could shift momentum fast. ETF buzz adds fire to Ripple Foundation’s bullish outlook The biggest wildcard for XRP’s price prediction right now is a spot ETF. The SEC has started reviewing WisdomTree’s XRP Trust, kicking off a 240-day window with 21 days for public comment. This news sparked major excitement in the XRP community. On Polymarket, approval odds jumped to 84%, up from 63% last month. Bloomberg analysts put the chances at 85%. A green light could bring in waves of institutional cash. XRP might break past $3 quickly, with $8 in sight for 2025. Some even see $50 down the line if giants like BlackRock jump in and invest in Ripple Foundation. Unilabs reshapes the $500 billion asset management market Unilabs is changing how asset management works. It cuts out human mistakes and uses smart AI instead. At the core is EASS, an algorithm that checks new crypto projects using clear performance and risk data. It doesn’t just look for growth – it also avoids weak assets, making investing safer and smarter. This AI also powers the Unilabs Launchpad. It scans tons of new projects and highlights the best ones with strong potential. That gives investors early access to high-quality opportunities they might otherwise miss. The goal is simple: trust, speed, and long-term value. Unilabs now manages over $30 million.

At its highest point, it was up by over 50% from its lowest point in April, when Donald Trump unveiled his retaliatory tariffs. This BTC forecast looks at what to expect in June. Bitcoin recap for May May was a good month for Bitcoin in a few areas. First, Wall Street investors continued to pump money into BTC during the month. The net inflows into spot Bitcoin ETFs jumped by over $5.2 billion, while the total value traded during the month jumped to over $73 billion. May was Bitcoin’s best month since January, when the net inflows jumped by $5.25 billion. The surge in inflows brought the cumulative inflows to over $45 billion, making Bitcoin the most successful ETF launches ever. For example, the iShares Bitcoin ETF (IBIT) now has over $70 billion in assets under management, 18 months after its launch. In contrast, the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) has less than $100 billion in assets, 21 years since its launch. The other big theme in May was the continued Bitcoin purchases by companies, a move that could accelerate following Strategy’s purchases. Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, acquired thousands of coins, bringing its total holdings to over 580,235. Twenty One, a company formed between Cantor Fitzgerald, Tether, and Softbank , is acquiring Bitcoins worth over $3 billion. It plans to go public as a Bitcoin holding company. Trump Media, the parent company of TruthSocial, raised $2.5 billion to acquire Bitcoin. GameStop, the game store company, also started to accumulate Bitcoin as we recommended a few months ago. The other big Bitcoin news in May was key events like Consensus Toronto and Token2049 in Dubai. BTC price analysis for June Bitcoin’s price will likely continue doing well in June because of the soaring demand and falling supply. The supply of Bitcoin on exchanges has continued falling, moving from over 3.1 million in 2020 to 1.2 million today. More companies will likely continue acquiring Bitcoins this month, which will help boost its price. The risk, however, is that June is usually one of the worst months for Bitcoin because of the start of the summer season. The average Bitcoin return in June is usually minus 0.50%. The other risk is that the trade war between the US and other countries will continue, leading to more volatility. Also, the Federal Reserve may insist that it will not cut rates soon as inflation remains stubbornly high. Bitcoin price analysis BTC price chart | Source: TradingView Technicals suggest that the BTC price has more upside to go this month as it has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the ongoing retreat being part of the handle section. This cup has a depth of about 32%, meaning that the target price is about $143,000. Bitcoin remains above the 50-day and 200-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMA). Therefore, the most likely scenario is where BTC price rises and hits at least $120,000 this month. A drop below the support at $100,000 will invalidate the bullish outlook.

Bitcoin Solaris at $5 Is the Closest You’ll Get to a Real Second Shot,https://coinpedia.org/press-release/missed-bitcoin-at-1-bitcoin-solaris-at-5-is-the-closest-youll-get/,"The post Missed Bitcoin at $1? Bitcoin Solaris at $5 Is the Closest You’ll Get to a Real Second Shot appeared first on Coinpedia Fintech News Most investors who passed on Bitcoin early didn’t lack belief — they lacked access, context, or timing. The mechanics were there, but the interface was limited, and the broader market hadn’t caught up. Bitcoin Solaris reintroduces that structure with clearer terms: a locked 21 million supply, no inflation mechanics, and real entry points that don’t rely on speculation or hardware. Phase 5 of the BTC-S presale ends today. The token is priced at 5 USDT, with a supply model that mirrors Bitcoin’s original fixed-cap approach — but deployed on modern infrastructure designed to support mobile mining and rapid scaling from day one. A Supply Model That Doesn’t Move Bitcoin Solaris is permanently capped at 21 million tokens, all hard-coded and locked from future inflation. Of that, 4.2 million were allocated for the entire presale, with all phases published and traceable. No stealth wallets, no emissions model, and no post-launch minting built into the contract. The economics are static — and that’s intentional. With most new chains relying on flexible supply to game rewards or subsidize hype, Bitcoin Solaris is taking the opposite approach. Its value mechanics are front-loaded and locked in — so early access doesn’t just mean lower cost, it means better structural positioning in a closed system. Helios Architecture: The Tech Behind BTC-S Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t run on borrowed infrastructure. It’s built on Helios, a dual-layer blockchain system engineered to scale without the bottlenecks seen in other high-performance chains. At its core is a combination of Proof-of-Stake (PoS)and Proof-of-Capacity (PoC), creating a secure and energy-light base for consensus. That foundation is extended by the Solaris Layer — a high-speed validation layer powered by Proof-of-History (PoH)and Proof-of-Time (PoT). This structure enables finality in under two seconds and over 10,000 transactions per second, all while consuming less than 0.05% of the energy used by Bitcoin’s legacy mining system. It’s more than a technical win. It’s what makes mobile mining viable. This system doesn’t rely on hash power — it validates based on committed storage and time. That’s why the Nova App, currently in final pre-launch testing, is able to deliver mining access from standard smartphones with no specialized hardware. Over 11,000 users are already registered for Nova, lining up to enter a network where rewards are tied to action, not asset holding. This is what early Bitcoin looked like — real distribution, real use, and no middleman standing between you and the protocol. Presale Phase 5 Ends Today — So Does This Price At 5 USDT, BTC-S sits far below its projected listing target of 20 USDT. That pricing model isn’t arbitrary — it’s based on liquidity provisioning targets, CEX partner estimates, and the anticipated impact of mobile onboarding at scale. Once listings go live, the entire dynamic shifts. Token acquisition becomes price-driven, and mining returns become more competitive. This phase is the last time entry happens under capped, predictable conditions. The network is about to shift into full operation. Access won’t vanish — but it will get more expensive, and more crowded. BTC-S isn’t being ignored. Several independent analysts have already broken down the structure, architecture, and rollout mechanics — not from hype, but from a technical lens. In a recent breakdown, Crypto Volt walked through Bitcoin Solaris’s consensus model, mobile mining design, and presale economics, calling it “the closest thing to early Bitcoin access since 2013.” Audited, Verified, and Fully Accountable The Bitcoin Solaris ecosystem has passed two full audits. A Cyberscope review confirmed the contract integrity and presale mechanics. A Freshcoins audit tested the Nova App’s mining logic, validating its ability to operate across mobile environments. On top of that, the team has completed KYC verification , giving the project accountability that most presales avoid. These aren’t extras. They’re part of the foundation — and they’re why capital is flowing into BTC-S before it hits open markets. Bitcoin Solaris doesn’t recreate 2011. It builds on what we’ve learned since.

This investor thinks that putting $400 into this token could make it worth $120,000 by 2026, which would be a 30,000% increase. This bold prediction is getting people interested and making them wonder what this little-known asset could do. Price Prediction for XYZVerse ($XYZ): Could It Go Up 30 Times? XYZVerse has entered the meme currency market at a time when tokens that are driven by the community are still the most popular for speculative trading. The growth of meme currencies like PEPE, Dogwifhat, and Bonk shows that excellent branding, viral marketing, and getting people involved can lead to huge profits. The general mood of the market is also very important to XYZVerse’s potential. As the altcoin season approaches, investors are becoming more interested in lower-cap meme currencies. Since XYZVerse is still in presale, it might benefit from this wave provided it gets listed on the right exchanges and keeps the community excited after the launch. What XYZVerse does well in the current market: Strong branding through relationships with sports teams and influencers, which makes it more appealing to a wider range of people. Deflationary mechanisms (17.13% token burn) to ease supply pressure Allocation of liquidity (15%) to help keep things stable after launch Community incentives (10%) Encouraging participation and holding Forecast for the Price of $XYZ The current price for presale is $0.003333. According to the project’s calculations, the post-presale target is $0.10. If demand goes up and listings generate FOMO, the price might reach $0.15 to $0.25 in the first one to two weeks after launch. Long-Term Potential (6–12 Months): $0.20–$0.40 (if the initiative gets big listings and partnerships) Buy $XYZ Early to Increase Its Profit Potential Realistic Expectations: Will XYZ Hit $0.10? A 30x surge from presale to $0.10 is achievable, however it relies on: Strong Exchange Listings: If XYZVerse is listed on big CEX sites like KuCoin, OKX, or Binance, its price might go up a lot on launch day. Long-Term Community Growth: Meme coins need to go viral. If XYZVerse follows through on its connections with sports influencers, it might get a lot of people talking on social media. Market Conditions – If Bitcoin and altcoins remain bullish, speculation-driven assets like XYZVerse tend to benefit. Is a 3000% Surge Possible for $XYZ? XYZVerse has the ingredients for a strong launch, but its long-term success depends on execution. If the team delivers strong marketing, high-profile listings, and real community engagement, the $0.10+ target, which is around 3000% from the current price, could be achievable. Invest in $XYZ Before It Surges The Fast Blockchain from Solana: A Major Development in the Crypto Industry Solana blockchain platform, popularly known as Ethereum killer, was created for speed and scability. However, the platform offers a foundation for other dapps and what makes it unique is its design and speed. With Solana, developers can make use of multiple programming languages. Solana’s native coin, which is SOL, is used to acilitate transactions, run custom programs, and reward those who support the network. Solana is attracting lots of attention in the crypto markets, and this due to its unique features and even its capabilities, as it doesnt rely on on sharding or second-layer solutions to scale. Nonetheless, SOL is offering crypto enthusiasts beyond just transaction, but the ability for them to access various projects with ease Conclusion Coins like SOL are solid, but XYZVerse (XYZ) pioneers by uniting sports fans in a memecoin aiming for 20,000% growth, offering early adoption benefits and a clear roadmap.

So far, one of the hottest coins that everyone is talking about is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) . Some analysts believe that this could outperform Ethereum (ETH) in terms of real-term gains. This is especially so based on recent developments revealed by the team, which have been turning heads. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Recent Developments One of the biggest announcements to come from the Mutuum finance team is that they have passed the Certik audit. The audit is a mark of trust and represents a major milestone for the team. It signals they are committed to delivering a safe product that will benefit everyone in the DeFi world. Passing a Certik audit requires that the code be examined for any inherent vulnerabilities that may impact early adopters. Due to the trustless nature of DeFi, a Certik audit is the only way for early adopters to confirm that a project is safe. Following the results of the Certik audit, the team is now focused on delivering a beta version of the platform. They plan to launch the beta version on a testnet on the same day as the public listing. This will allow all early adopters and future ones to examine the platform and confirm the promises made by the team. The launch is also expected to generate more visibility for the project online, which will boost its organic reach. Another development that is turning heads is the planned $100K giveaway. The giveaway is ongoing and aims to reward presale participants with $10K in MUTM tokens each. To participate in the giveaway, buyers in the presale only need to make a $50 purchase of MUTM tokens. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Price Forecast Mutuum Finance is currently in Phase 5 of its presale. It has so far raised over $9.7 million from over 11,400 investors. These early investors stand to make some massive gains based on recent forecasts from analysts. For instance, at the current price of $0.03 per token, that is a 100% ROI based on the listing day price of $0.06. The current price represents a 200% increase from the Phase 1 price of $0.01, and a 20% increase from the Phase 4 price of $0.025. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price will increase 16.67% to $0.035. However, those presale price gains pale in comparison to what analysts expect when MUTM goes live. Currently, the most conservative estimates call for a 5x increase, with some more optimistic estimates calling for a 20x increase. Those increases are expected to occur within the first few days of the public listing. With a listing on a major exchange expected after that, the price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) tokens could have exploded, shadowing the gains made by Ethereum in the early stages of its release. Once the initial surge dies down, it is likely that Mutuum Finance will continue rising due to its value proposition. A Deep Dive Into The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Utility The Mutuum Finance project aims to transform the DeFi world with utility. For lenders, it will provide an easy means to earn interest on assets while still maintaining total liquidity. The project achieves this through a nouveau approach called mtTokens. These tokens represent the value of a depositor’s assets in a pool as well as the interest they accrue. For instance, if a depositor deposits $4,500 worth of MATIC in a pool, they will receive mtMATIC tokens. These tokens grant the holder instant liquidity and can be used to take advantage of market opportunities elsewhere. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch external liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap, where users can go to redeem their mtTokens. The approach will ensure liquidity is preserved on the protocol while still allowing users to have access to their assets with ease. To preserve the long-term stability of the platform, they have also introduced a stability factor. The factor will be used to rate tokens used as collateral. This rating will be assigned based on various factors, with a focus on volatility and liquidity. If the value of collateral backing a position drops below an acceptable level, it will be liquidated. Liquidators can then step in to purchase the debt at a profit, while helping to maintain protocol stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will reinvigorate the DeFi space, opening up new opportunities for crypto asset holders worldwide. Its commitment to protocol growth by balancing liquidity and expanding market opportunities will ensure holders of MUTM tokens can experience value growth. The ongoing presale presents a unique opportunity to join this revolutionary ecosystem while it is still on the ground floor.

45359719,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69239,1748758880,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,"Ripple Is “Building the New Wall Street”, XRP Ledger Is Leading the Way",https://timestabloid.com/ripple-is-building-the-new-wall-street-xrp-ledger-is-leading-the-way/,"In a recent X post, Ripple made a direct and symbolic statement about the transformation underway in global finance. Accompanied by a short promotional video, Ripple’s tweet read, “If it’s happening onchain, it’s happening with @Ripple.” The video clip featured bold imagery, including a ticking clock, a charging bull, and directional signs pointing to Wall Street, Broad Street, and Tokyo’s Marunouchi Line. The video prominently displayed the phrase “It’s happening,” suggesting a shift already in motion. The post aligns with Ripple’s ongoing efforts to position itself as a central infrastructure provider in the emerging on-chain financial ecosystem. Ripple Is Building the New Wall Street Crypto researcher SMQKE responded to Ripple’s tweet by stating , “Remember: Ripple is ‘building the new Wall Street’, starting with the Hidden Road acquisition.” SMQKE’s message emphasized that Ripple’s broader strategy is not merely about blockchain adoption but about reshaping institutional finance itself. The researcher added, “Ripple’s post is a strong signal that the Wall Street flood to On-Chain finance has begun. And the XRPL is leading the way.” The researcher’s commentary reinforces the view that Ripple is no longer just a participant in blockchain innovation but a driving force behind structural changes to how capital moves in institutional markets. Remember: Ripple is “building the new Wall Street”, starting with the Hidden Road acquisition. Ripple’s post is a strong signal that the Wall Street flood to On-Chain finance has begun. And the XRPL is leading the way. Listen closely. https://t.co/tQTSTgpAVP pic.twitter.com/D0XznhRKvo — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 30, 2025 We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Hidden Road Acquired as Strategic Infrastructure Ripple’s acquisition of multi-asset prime broker, Hidden Road , marks a major step in its expansion into institutional finance. SMQKE referenced the acquisition in the context of Ripple’s RLUSD stablecoin, noting that Hidden Road already uses RLUSD as collateral. According to a shared briefing, Ripple plans to leverage the acquisition to scale RLUSD and integrate post-trade activity into the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ripple Payments. This signals a significant broadening of Ripple’s infrastructure strategy — moving beyond cross-border payments into the full lifecycle of institutional trading and settlement. By incorporating prime brokerage functions and post-trade capabilities on-chain, Ripple is positioning itself to offer end-to-end solutions for institutional finance. XRPL at the Forefront of Institutional On-Chain Activity SMQKE’s interpretation positions the XRP Ledger as a leading protocol in the transition of financial markets onto blockchain infrastructure. By citing Ripple’s tweet and connecting it to broader developments such as Hidden Road’s institutional footprint and the use of RLUSD, SMQKE underscored that Ripple is not building in isolation. Instead, the firm appears to be constructing a vertically integrated stack for institutional finance — one that includes stablecoin issuance, brokerage access, post-trade systems, and native on-chain settlement.

Since early April 2025, when President Donald Trump introduced his new “liberation day” tariffs, the 10-year yield rose from 4.16% to 4.42%, but the dollar didn’t follow, it dropped instead, losing 4.7% against a basket of other major currencies. That kind of dislocation hasn’t been seen since mid-2022, and it’s forcing traders and funds to rethink how they hedge against volatility. According to Financial Times , the usual pattern was simple: rising yields meant a stronger US economy, which brought in foreign capital and boosted the dollar. But right now, that story doesn’t hold. Investors are questioning the reason behind the rising yields, and it’s not confidence. It’s concern. Concerns about exploding deficits, a downgraded credit rating, attacks on the Fed, and unpredictable policymaking are turning what should be a sign of strength into a warning signal. Trump pressures Powell while debt fears hit US credibility Donald Trump’s policies are driving this break. His tax bill may have passed, but it’s done damage. It added to the deficit, and Moody’s wasn’t impressed. It downgraded the US credit rating, something that added more pressure to bond prices. The cost of insuring US debt against default is now at the same level as Greece and Italy, two countries nobody wants to be compared to financially. Oh but Trump didn’t stop there. He summoned Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell to the White House just this Friday and lied that he told him point-blank that not cutting rates was a “mistake,” whereas Powell’s statement said he didn’t even let the conversation go there. Still, that meeting rattled investors, especially because of what Michael de Pass, Citadel Securities’ global head of rates trading, explained: the dollar’s strength has always come from trust in American institutions. “The rule of law, independence of central banking, and policy that’s predictable—these are the components that create the dollar as the reserve currency.” But now, he added, “a major concern for markets right now is whether we are chipping away at the institutional credibility of the dollar.” That loss of trust is being reflected everywhere. UBS strategist Shahab Jalinoos explained that when yields go up for the right reasons—like strong growth—it attracts capital. But when they rise because people are worried about risk, it causes outflows. “If the yields are going up because US debt is more risky, because of fiscal concerns and policy uncertainty, at the same time the dollar can weaken,” Shahab said. And that’s exactly what’s happening. Investors hedge against dollar, turn to gold and safe currencies The current breakdown is also reshaping portfolio strategy everywhere. Andreas Koenig, head of global FX at Amundi, said this is a problem for people who depended on the dollar to balance their portfolios. “When the dollar is a balancing factor, you have a stable portfolio. If all of a sudden the dollar is correlated, it increases the risk.” That sentence is getting repeated on every trading floor right now. Goldman Sachs analysts said in a Friday note that the unusual combination of a weaker dollar, higher yields, and declining equity prices is hurting the two main tools used to hedge volatility. With all three now moving in the wrong direction, portfolios are left more exposed. Funds and asset managers are responding fast. Many are now hedging their dollar positions more aggressively, and some are outright shorting the currency. Jalinoos from UBS warned, “The more policy uncertainty there is, the more likely it is that investors will raise their hedge ratios.” And when hedge ratios rise across the massive pile of dollar-denominated assets, “you’re talking about many billions of dollars of selling [the US dollar],” he added. That rush to hedge is already being reflected in market positions. Goldman Sachs said the best strategy now is to expect further dollar weakness, especially against the euro, yen, and Swiss franc – currencies that have all gained in recent weeks. They also recommended an increased position in gold, saying the current situation “creates a strong basis for some allocation to gold.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Economy|Federal Reserve|Gold|USD,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-01 06:38:50

XRP has risen over 1.5% from yesterday, and Gemini expects it to continue this climb, predicting a rise from its current price of $2.17 to $3.20 by June 30. According to Gemini, the projected target is based on several key considerations, most notably the current market sentiment, regulatory developments, and adoption. XRP’s Recent Performance Gemini notes that the broader crypto market is in a recovery phase, with Bitcoin leading the trend. XRP has historically moved in line with overall market performance, though often with less intensity. Assuming continued bullish momentum through June, XRP could see notable gains. Gemini’s $3.20 price target represents an increase of more than 47%, and it could set XRP up for further gains. If XRP hits this target, it will be the first time the digital asset has surpassed $3 since its decline in early February . The digital asset experienced a remarkable climb from around $0.55 in November 2024 to $3.39 in January 2025. It took things a step further, closing January above $3—its first monthly close above $3 . However, it has struggled since then. The U.S. economic policies and uncertainty around the lawsuit impacted its performance. Gemini’s prediction suggests the asset’s trajectory is about to turn around, listing some reasons for this bullish outlook. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Factors Contributing to the Bullish Prediction The ongoing Ripple vs. SEC lawsuit remains a central factor in XRP’s future valuation. According to Gemini, the decisive end of the lawsuit could create upward momentum for the digital asset. Both parties have agreed to drop their appeals and are working for the approval of their settlement agreement. This agreement involves the removal of the permanent injunction preventing institutional XRP sales and the reduction of Ripple’s penalty from $125 million to $50 million. Gemini suggests that the legal clarity from the lawsuit’s conclusion will positively impact investor confidence and price performance. It also highlighted XRP’s role in cross-border payments as a foundational strength, particularly through Ripple’s payment network. As adoption grows , Gemini expects XRP’s price to rise significantly. However, it notes that Ripple will need more high-profile partnerships and central bank integration for long-term growth. While the crypto market is difficult to predict, the outlook remains positive for XRP, with $3.20 representing a realistic short-term target under current market conditions.

While the broader crypto market digests recent volatility, SOL has been quietly consolidating just below key resistance. This silence, however, might not last much longer. Top analysts are starting to turn their focus back to Solana, suggesting that a powerful move could be brewing. Related Reading: Ethereum Bulls Defend Support – Key Indicator Hints At Short-Term Rally According to analyst Bluntz, the recent price action in SOL is showing promising signs. He notes that after sweeping the lows, Solana is now working on a reclaim of support — a classic bottoming pattern that often precedes a strong rebound. Although it’s still early days, this reaction could lay the foundation for a sharp rally if SOL manages to break back above the $160–$165 range. The sentiment echoes a broader belief among market watchers that Solana could become a major leader in the next leg of the altseason, especially if Ethereum breaks out from its current resistance. As bullish structure builds and technical indicators begin to align, the setup for SOL appears to be quietly strengthening, making it a key altcoin to watch in the coming weeks. Solana Setup For Breakout Remains Strong Solana (SOL) has been on a consolidation path over the past few weeks, struggling to reclaim the $180 resistance level. After peaking in early May, SOL has retraced steadily, now trading around the $150 range as it searches for renewed demand. This retracement aligns with a broader market pullback, as global tensions — especially surrounding US–China tariffs and rising interest rates — inject volatility and caution into financial markets. Despite the current slowdown, analysts remain optimistic about Solana’s medium-term outlook. Top trader Bluntz recently shared that SOL’s reaction after taking the lows is promising. According to him, the altcoin is now working on a reclaim of support, which could be the precursor to an aggressive rally. The key lies in whether Solana can push back above the $180 zone — an area of heavy supply that has repeatedly rejected bullish momentum. If SOL does manage to flip this level into support, the price structure suggests there’s ample room for a sharp breakout. The setup aligns well with rising calls for an altseason, particularly if Bitcoin dominance continues to roll over and Ethereum confirms a breakout above its multi-month resistance. In this scenario, Solana could emerge as one of the leading assets in the next crypto leg up, given its strong developer ecosystem, scalability, and growing DeFi sector. While current price action remains neutral to slightly bearish, a reclaim of $180 would likely flip sentiment quickly and attract fresh capital. As market focus shifts from major caps like BTC and ETH, SOL could be poised to capture the spotlight — and potentially lead the next altcoin rally.

The chart shows that SOL is now hovering just below the 34-day EMA and the 50-day SMA, indicating a breakdown in short-term bullish momentum. Volume has also decreased, signaling hesitation from both buyers and sellers amid broader market uncertainty. The 200-day moving average at $179.73 remains the major resistance level to reclaim in order to resume a bullish structure. Meanwhile, the zone between $150 and $156 is now acting as a critical demand area. A sustained close below $150 could open the door for deeper corrections, possibly toward the $140-$130 range, which aligns with previous consolidation levels in April. Related Reading: Ethereum Daily Gas Usage Hits New Highs – Real Demand Powers ETH Growth Despite the current weakness, the longer-term trend remains neutral-to-bullish as long as Solana holds above the 100-day SMA around $144.58. If SOL can consolidate and reclaim the $160–$165 region, it could trigger renewed upside momentum and challenge the $180 level once again. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, with some expecting a rebound if market conditions stabilize and altseason momentum picks up in the coming weeks.

The challenge came Friday evening when the Securities and Exchange Commission told ETF Opportunities Trust — the entity responsible for registering funds managed by REX Financial and Osprey Funds — that the new Ethereum and Solana staking ETFs may not qualify as legal investment companies under federal law. This call into question their ability to list on public markets. Both ETFs aim to give investors access to staking yields by tracking Ethereum and Solana, while also passing staking income back to shareholders. But the SEC said the filings were “improperly filed” and warned that the registration documents might be “potentially misleading” about the funds’ legal status. The funds had claimed they met the definition of an investment company, but the SEC says that’s not a given. In a formal letter sent on Saturday, the Commission said it might take further steps “to ensure compliance with the federal securities laws” if the situation is not resolved. While the funds had technically received effective registration earlier on Friday, meaning they could have gone live at any time, that launch is now stalled. SEC flags ETF structure and staking disclosures Greg Collett, general counsel at REX Financial, said the firm isn’t backing away. “We think we can satisfy the SEC on the investment company question, and we don’t intend to launch the funds until we do that.” REX had hoped to get the products trading by mid-June, according to Greg King, the firm’s founder. Now, everything is paused until the SEC gives a clear go-ahead. James Seyffart, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said the Commission’s objection may be specific to the filing strategy REX used. “Even if the SEC doesn’t allow this structure to list, we still believe the more straightforward attempts to allow staking in a US ETF will ultimately be successful,” he said. “It’s a matter of when, not if. But the SEC doesn’t seem to be a fan of the way Rex tried to push these listings through.” This is the second time in just a few months that the SEC has stepped in after a fund tried to go public with a structure it didn’t like. In March, the agency publicly pushed back on a private credit ETF managed by State Street Corp. and Apollo Global Management — the first of its kind — only hours after it listed. That product had to deal with similar regulatory issues around classification. The new staking ETFs attempt to blend traditional investment products with crypto-native features like yield from validating transactions. But the SEC doesn’t consider staking returns to be straightforward income, and is clearly uncomfortable with listing a product that generates money in a way they don’t fully regulate. The legal uncertainty around staking continues to block more complex crypto offerings. Bitcoin ETFs attract billions while gold-backed funds bleed As the SEC slams the brakes on staking products, Bitcoin ETFs are pulling in serious capital. Over the past five weeks, US Bitcoin ETFs have seen more than $9 billion in inflows, led by BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). On the flip side, gold ETFs have been bleeding money — losing more than $2.8 billion in the same timeframe. This comes as Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $111,980 earlier this month. That rally followed positive movement on regulatory issues — especially new momentum around a stablecoin bill — and mounting concern over the United States’ fiscal position under President Donald Trump’s second term. Investors are seeing Bitcoin as a hedge, not just a bet. Even though gold is still up more than 25% for the year, it’s down nearly $190 from recent highs. Some analysts see this shift as long-term. Christopher Wood, global equity strategist at Jefferies, said, “I remain bullish on both gold and Bitcoin. They remain the best hedges on currency debasement in the G7 world.” But others aren’t convinced Bitcoin can be counted on during market stress. Critics point out that during major events — like the August unwinding of the yen carry trade — Bitcoin dropped sharply alongside other risky assets. That kind of volatility continues to make the SEC wary of expanding crypto exposure through mainstream investment products like ETFs.

In a new interview with CNBC at the Reagan National Economic Forum, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon says the US government is having internal problems with the management of its finances. Dimon says that unless the government gets its act together, the country risks losing its status as a military and economic superpower. “The amount of mismanagement is extraordinary. By state, by city, for pensions – that stuff is going to kill us. I always get asked this question: ‘Are we going to be the reserve currency?’ No. If we are not the preeminent military and the preeminent economy in 40 years, we will not be the reserve currency. That’s a fact, just read history.” Dimon calls on the US government to act with a sense of urgency and fix its internal issues if the country is to remain the largest economy in the world. “Now, I think we will be [on top]. Warren Buffett will tell you that we’re normally resilient, and I agree with that, [but] I think this time is different.

The decline followed the formation of an ascending channel earlier in the day, but that structure collapsed under high-volume selling, including a spike of over 1.4 million units as prices briefly touched $6.00. However, the breakdown proved temporary. UNI quickly reversed course and climbed back to $6.18, indicating strong dip-buying interest and suggesting the uptrend may still be intact if support near $6.05 continues to hold. Technical Analysis Highlights UNI formed a clear ascending channel throughout most of the day, with notable support at the $6.00 level backed by above-average volume. A sharp reversal occurred as UNI briefly broke below its uptrend line, triggering high-volume selling. Two significant volume spikes occurred: over 455,000 units at 01:38 and exceeding 1.4 million units at 01:42. The token quickly rebounded after the breakdown, regaining ground and pushing back toward the $6.18 area. Initial resistance was encountered at $6.19, which now appears within reach again as bullish momentum returns.

Deutsche Bank even warned that tax could quickly erode the allure of US assets. The legislation item dictates an increase in tax rates for foreign individuals and companies that the government considers “discriminatory.” What worries investors more is that the policy extends to tax hikes on passive income, like interest and dividends. Wall Street analysts have warned that the provision could discourage foreign investors, especially since their confidence in the US market waned when Trump introduced tariffs earlier this year. Saravelos believes revenge tax depresses investor yield George Saravelos, head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, believes the “revenge tax” could reduce their appeal to investors, warning that it could even cultivate a capital war. He wrote: “We see this legislation as creating the scope for the US administration to transform a trade war into a capital war if it so wishes, a development that is highly relevant in the context of today’s court decision constraining President Trump on trade policy.” George Saravelos The United States Court of International Trade ruled against Trump’s tariffs, stating that the President is not authorized to set unlimited tariffs on nearly every country worldwide. However, Section 899 could serve as a workaround to impose new taxes. Saravelos argued that the legislation item uses taxation on foreign investors to push the US government’s economic goals and can be implemented with little justification. He added that the provision would only complicate deficit financing, slashing the effective yield foreign governments earn on Treasury securities by close to 100 basis points. He suggested that while his yield cut estimation may be off and may be less severe, any added uncertainty and complexity surrounding US investments further weaken the appeal of dollar inflows—especially at a time when confidence is already wavering. He also believes it would not be completely unreasonable for investors to deduce that Trump wants to tax foreign capital to have leverage. The JCT estimates revenue loss in 2033 and 2034 due to the revenge tax The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) also agrees with most Wall Street investors that policy could drive away foreign investors. The committee’s chief of staff, Thomas Barthold, even claimed Section 899 would only plunge international demand for American direct and portfolio investment and cultivate avoidance and compliance behavior. The JCT projected that the provision could pull in close to $117 billion over the next decade. However, it would eventually reduce yearly US tax revenues by $13 billion in 2033 and 2034. Barthold explained that foreign companies’ lowered earnings would decrease baseline US tax receipts. He added that diminished foreign demand would also depress US asset values, hence the expected revenue loss. On Friday, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith, a proponent of the revenge tax, even asserted that he hopes it will not be enforced and only stand to dissuade foreign governments from implementing unfair policies against US companies. Elias Haddad, a Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. strategist, also noted that the legislation would now only undermine foreign investment at a time when the country is still heavily dependent on foreign inflows to clear its debts.

However, its weekly performance is in the red. Many altcoins have produced even more notable price declines since this time last Sunday, led by DOGE, SOL, SUI, and LINK from the larger caps. BTC at $104K Bitcoin made history last week when it broke its January 2025 all-time high and registered a fresh peak on Pizza Day (May 22) at almost $112,000. However, it started to retrace on the next day when US President Trump outlined a new tariff recommendation against the EU and the asset slumped by several grand to around $107,000. It bounced off at the start of the business week and tapped $110,000. However, another rejection followed at that point, and BTC was pushed down to the $107,000 level once again. The situation worsened as the week progressed and BTC slipped to $105,000 on Friday after Trump blamed China that it had violated the previous trade agreement between the two. Saturday saw another leg down as bitcoin slumped to a 12-day low of $103,000. It has recovered some ground and is above $104,000 now, but it’s still over 3% down on the week. Its market cap has calmed at $2.070 trillion on CG, while its dominance over the alts is well above 61%. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView CRO Defies Market-Wide Trend Most altcoins have posted big losses over the past seven days. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu lead the pack, with massive declines of 15% and 12.6%, respectively. Solana, SUI, and LINK follow suit, with price drops of around 10%. ETH has managed to maintain the $2,500 level, while XRP is down to $2.16 after a 6.7% weekly slump. Further losses are evident from PI, XMR, and PEPE, while CRO has defied the market-wide trend. Cronos’ native token has jumped by 7.5% since last Sunday and sits well above $0.1. The total crypto market cap has dropped by over $250 billion since last week and is below $3.4 trillion on CG now.

PEPE is currently with a market cap nearing $6 billion, a meteoric rise fueled by community hype and aggressive token burns. Meanwhile, SHIB, continues to battle resistance as bulls eye a potential breakout towards the $0.000015 range. Both coins are locked in a fierce competition for market share, but as analysts weigh long-term potential and ROI, attention is shifting toward emerging low-price gems. Among them, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is gaining serious traction as a high-upside play heading into 2025. The project is in phase 5 of its presale priced at $0.03. Mutuum Finance’s presale surges past $9.7 million with over 11,500 investors already onboard. As Mutuum Finance enters Phase 6, the price will jump 16.67% to $0.035. PEPE Poised to Surpass SHIB as Meme Coin Market Evolves Pepe Coin (PEPE) is $0.00001375 and the total market value of these coins is $5.8 billion. At the moment, Shiba Inu (SHIB) costs $0.00001429 and has a large market capitalization of over $8.3 billion. While SHIB is currently leading in market cap, things have changed in the past few weeks. PEPE is seeing more and more traders entering the market across many different exchange platforms. By contrast, whale transactions for SHIB have fallen over 80%, suggesting that big investors are not as interested. Because meme coin enthusiasts value speed, PEPE has what it takes to replace SHIB at the top of the meme coin hierarchy. Because of the many changes happening now, new tokens like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are gaining attention from investors because of the potential gains they could offer. Transforming DeFi Lending with a Hybrid Model Mutuum Finance is revolutionizing decentralized lending by merging both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. The P2C model allows users to lock stablecoins like USDT in liquidity pools backed by smart contracts, receiving passive income while making it easy for borrowers to borrow money easily. Meanwhile, the P2P model eliminates middlemen, allowing lenders and borrowers to directly negotiate with each other. Mutuum Finance stablecoin will launch on the Ethereum blockchain, fully collateralized and USD-pegged. The stablecoin is built to avoid the collapse risk of its algorithmic counterparts. This transparent and secure architecture, supported by open-source smart contracts and now formally attested through the completion of a Certik audit, guarantees healthy financial transactions. With the intersection of next-generation lending technology and robust infrastructure, Mutuum Finance is reshaping the future of decentralized finance. A DeFi Disruptor Drawing Massive Investor Interest Still in presale, Mutuum Finance has already surpassed more than $9.7 million in funding and has amassed nearly 11,500 investors, making it a solid altcoin ready to experience a major breakthrough. With Phase 5 price at $0.03 and with an impending 16.67% price boost in the next phase, early investors stand to gain good returns in terms of bagging their highest returns. At launch, with an anticipated price of $0.06, profits will be 100%, and for the next bull cycle. Early adopters of Mutuum Finance all have enticing incentives, including a $100,000 giveaway in which 10 people will win $10,000 value of MUTM tokens. While PEPE and SHIB battle for meme coin dominance, smart investors are turning to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for real utility and stronger upside. Priced at $0.03 with a 16.67% increase set for Phase 6 and a launch price of $0.06, MUTM offers early buyers up to 100% profit. With over $9.7 million raised and 11,500+ investors already on board, the momentum is undeniable. Secure your position now.

In a chart shared on X, he identifies two symmetrical triangle formations and describes XRP’s next moves as “fantastic.” The first occurred before XRP’s major move last November, and another is currently unfolding, suggesting a repeat of XRP’s performance in November. The next move for #XRP will be fantastic! pic.twitter.com/V8mKAUWsub — STEPH IS CRYPTO (@Steph_iscrypto) May 31, 2025 The First Symmetrical Triangle The previous triangle formed between July and October 2024. XRP spent much of this time consolidating between $0.5 and $0.6 without any sustained breakouts. However, the tables turned when Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. Gary Gensler, the former Chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), announced his resignation shortly after, ending the war against cryptocurrencies. The excitement from these developments ignited a market-wide resurgence. Bitcoin rose above $100,000 for the first time, and XRP broke through notable resistance levels despite the legal battle between Ripple and the SEC. Surged over 500% to $3.39. XRP’s Current Symmetrical Triangle Steph’s current analysis suggests that the structure of the ongoing consolidation bears a close resemblance to that earlier setup. The implication is that another breakout of comparable magnitude could occur if XRP decisively breaks the current resistance line. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 The new symmetrical triangle pattern , shown on a 3-day Heikin Ashi chart, indicates consolidation between support at around $1.90 and resistance just below $2.70. The similarity between the two patterns could signal an imminent move. XRP is currently trading at $2.18, and if it experiences another 500% surge like it did in November, it could climb to a new all-time high of $13.08. Experts have set targets around $15 for the current market cycle, and Steph’s analysis reaffirms these double-digit targets. Whale Activity Reinforces Bullish Expectations Adding to the bullish excitement, a whale recently opened a $1.08 million long position using 12x leverage at an entry price of $2.1336. This shows confidence in the digital asset’s future and suggests whales may be preparing for something big. This combination of positive factors, including the symmetrical triangles, historical similarity, and significant whale positioning, has led many in the community to anticipate a powerful breakout. If XRP can replicate its previous pattern, the coming weeks could deliver explosive price action that mirrors or even exceeds the rally seen in late 2024.

The Strategy man made his intentions known on X after a fan account on the show posed the question. Michael Saylor has been a long-time proponent of Bitcoin, willing to talk about the leading digital asset with anyone who cares to listen. Even at times when it seemed like the world wasn’t listening, he continued to talk about Bitcoin. His company, Strategy has also been committed to their goal of owning more Bitcoin than any other person in the world, with a recent purchase of 4,020 BTC, worth $427 million. The firm has signaled its intention to own more, noting that it will continue to raise capital to purchase more BTC in the future if it needs to. Taking to his X handle, Saylor shot his shot toward the podcast host. “Hey @joerogan, let’s talk about Bitcoin,” Saylor said in a May 31 X post in response to a Joe Rogan fan account asking, “Who’s one guest you’d love to see Joe Rogan interview that he hasn’t had on yet?” Michael Saylor triggers community excitement with his post Saylor’s post seemed to have pumped up the Bitcoin community, with high-profile members of the community praising the move. Crypto analyst Kook told their over 164,000 followers that “Saylor is going to Bitcoin pill Joe Rogan.” While addressing the concerns of a member who mentioned that Joe Rogan might not understand Bitcoin, he said, after a second or third conversation, he expects Rogan to become a massive advocate of the token. Another crypto commentator Brandon McDougal also mentioned that he will be watching his first-ever Joe Rogan podcast if he manages to invite Saylor to the show. Meanwhile, Rogan has frequently talked about crypto and Bitcoin on his podcast, but this might be the first significant shift considering the fact that Saylor has a wealth of knowledge and experience in the sector. Aside from making pro-Bitcoin statements over the years, Rogan mentioned in an episode with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in October 2023 that out of all the digital assets that exist in the market, Bitcoin fascinates him the most. “The real fascinating crypto is Bitcoin. That’s the one that I think has the most likely possibility of becoming a universal viable currency. It’s limited in the amount that it can be,” Rogan said at the time. He added that it fascinates him, saying, “I love the fact that it’s been implemented.” While Joe Rogan has yet to respond publicly to Saylor’s post about coming on the show, there is a likelihood that both of them could discuss a potential appearance on the show in the coming days. Meanwhile, this is not the first time that a personality with a wealth of experience in the Bitcoin community will be making an appearance on the show, with Rogan inviting Bitcoin entrepreneur Andreas Antonopoulos. Antonopoulos made his appearance on the show around 2014 to 2016 when Bitcoin was still eyeing a move above $1,000. Meanwhile, Saylor’s firm has been holding strong in the Bitcoin race, with Strategy now holding up to about 580,250 BTC, worth $60.56 billion according to the Saylor Tracker website . He also recently discussed why Bitcoin is yet to touch close to the $150,000 price mark. He mentioned that holders who do not plan to hold the asset long-term have been selling off their holdings while new investors are currently flooding the market. “I think we’re going through a rotation right now,” Saylor said on the Coin Stories podcast with Natalie Brunell on May 9.

Here’s the Timeline,https://timestabloid.com/bitcoin-analyst-sets-8-to-10-xrp-price-heres-the-timeline/,"George Tung, founder of the crypto-focused platform CryptosRUs and a recognized analyst in the Bitcoin space, has recently voiced his expectations for XRP’s future performance. Speaking with Altcoin Daily, Tung stated that XRP could realistically rise to a price between $8 and $10 by the end of 2025. This prediction, which he described as a conservative estimate, is based on the digital asset’s market durability and the increasing involvement of institutional investors. Institutional Growth and Market Trends Tung’s outlook hinges on the belief that XRP is well-positioned to benefit from a broader trend of increased institutional engagement with digital assets. During the interview, he said that recent filings for XRP-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) could be a catalyst for significant growth. According to him, if any of these products receive approval, they could channel considerable capital into XRP, thereby placing upward pressure on the token’s price. XRP has won the trust of many institutions , and these products could cement its status as highly attractive to institutions. Aaron Arnold, the host, noted that XRP has maintained relevance through multiple shifts in the crypto market. Tung believes this resilience distinguishes it from highly speculative tokens, making it a better option for those who want long-term exposure to digital assets. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 High Expectations for XRP in the Current Cycle While discussing other leading cryptocurrencies, Tung made it clear that XRP can outperform the others. He believes Bitcoin could see a 1.5x to 2x increase from current levels, while Ethereum may achieve a 3x to 4x return. However, he expects XRP to deliver up to 5x its current value under favorable market conditions. This suggests a target range of $8.76 to $10.95 based on the asset’s current price of $2.19. Tung also noted that established assets, such as XRP, will benefit from improved market sentiment and a return of capital to altcoins. His broader forecast for the cycle includes a Bitcoin peak between $200,000 and $300,000. In early 2024, veteran trader Peter Brandt predicted that BTC could hit $200,000 by Q3 of 2025 , and this move would set a strong backdrop for gains across the market. Caution on Unrealistic Expectations Tung also warned retail investors against chasing extreme short-term gains, noting that meme coin success is rare despite notable surges of meme coins like PEPE. He urged a disciplined strategy and focus on credible projects with long-term utility. Even former skeptics like Davinci Jeremie now see potential in XRP, with Jeremie suggesting it could hit $24 this year , and Tung advised beginners to allocate most of their funds to fundamentally strong projects.

The token is now hovering around $154.50 after establishing a tight trading range between $152.33 and $158.06, reflecting a 3.76% swing in the past 24 hours, according to CoinDesk Research's technical analysis data model. Although higher lows had previously suggested resilience, SOL slipped from $156.74 to $154.86 in a single hour, breaking beneath its mid-April uptrend channel. Derivatives data reflects bearish sentiment: open interest in SOL futures is down 2.47% to $7.19 billion, while long liquidations surged to $30.97 million, indicating pressure on leveraged positions. Short liquidations remain minimal, reinforcing the downside bias. Still, institutional interest remains evident. Circle’s recent $250 million USDC mint on Solana has added liquidity and cemented the chain’s stablecoin leadership, with 34% of all stablecoin volume now routed through the network. Additionally, SOL Strategies’ $1 billion validator fund signals sustained long-term confidence in the protocol’s scalability, even as short-term price action falters. Technical Analysis Highlights SOL established a 5.73-point range ($152.33–$158.06), indicating a 3.76% intraday swing. Earlier price action traced a clear ascending channel with solid support near $152.80, supported by heavy accumulation.SOL hit a session high of $158.06 during the 19:00 hour on strong volume, signaling earlier bullish momentum. A reversal unfolded in the early morning hours, with SOL falling from $156.74 to $154.86 on increased selling.Selling pressure peaked between 01:53–01:54, with over 74,000 units traded in a sharp burst. Short-term momentum turned bearish as lower highs and weaker volume defined the final trading stretch.As of writing, SOL is consolidating near $154.50, suggesting price stability but with downside risk if volume doesn’t improve.

The announcement was made at the Litecoin Summit event held in Las Vegas. LitVM, built on BitcoinOS and Polygon CDK infrastructure, is also supported by the Litecoin Foundation. This new Layer-2 solution, which is EVM compatible, draws attention with its trustless structure and aims to bring cross-chain liquidity to Litecoin with smart contract functionality for the first time. Launched in 2011, the Litecoin network has so far focused on speed and simplicity in daily transactions. However, with LitVM, this classic approach is changing to integrate into the modern DeFi and Web3 world. Related News: SEC Does Something It Rarely Does: Issues Negative Opinions on ETF Applications for Two Altcoins Litecoin founder Charlie Lee made the following statement on the subject: “Security and reliability have been our top priorities since we created Litecoin in 2011. This new Layer-2 solution preserves these principles while bringing Litecoin into the smart contract era.” According to their own statements, LitVM offers the potential not only for technical development but also for cultural and financial expansion. Thanks to the new network, tokenized real-world assets (RWA), stablecoin-based payment systems, and on-chain assets such as Runes and Lordinals will become possible on the Litecoin network. *This is not investment advice.

The flagship cryptocurrency reached an intraday high of $104,896 before declining to current levels. BTC has been up almost 1% over the past 24 hours, trading around $104,612, as it looks to build momentum and push above $105,000. Michael Saylor’s Bitcoin Strategy Is Gaining Steam Michael Saylor’s Strategy’s Bitcoin accumulation plan is being copied by media firms, multinational conglomerates, and meme stock companies. However, Wall Street remains skeptical and isn’t buying into the hype. This week, Trump Media announced an ambitious plan to raise $2.5 billion to fund Bitcoin purchases. GameStop also made a $500 million allocation towards Bitcoin purchases, while Tether, Softbank, and Strike’s Jack Mallers announced TwentyOne, a Bitcoin-native public company. The company plans to launch with more than 42,000 BTC on its balance sheet. However, the market doesn’t see any of the firms becoming the next Strategy. Trump Media shares plunged 20% since the announcement, while GameStop is down 17%. Speaking about the market’s reaction to the announcements, Strategy executive chairman Michael Saylor stated, “Maybe the market wanted them to buy more bitcoin. But these are short-term dynamics. Over the long term, bitcoin on the balance sheet has proven to be extraordinarily popular.” Saylor called Trump Media’s move aggressive and intelligent, stating, “Everywhere I go at this conference, someone says, you know, I’m working on a bitcoin treasury company in Hong Kong. I’m doing this thing in Korea. I’ve got this thing I’m working on in Abu Dhabi. We’re going to do this in the Middle East, you know, we’ve got this in the U.K.There’s an explosion of interest right now.” IMF Flags Concerns About Pakistan’s Bitcoin Plan The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns about Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The plans were announced last week amid ongoing negotiations with the IMF to extend the country’s financial program. However, the IMF has questioned the move and requested urgent clarification from the country’s Finance Ministry regarding the legality of crypto mining and power allocations as the country struggles with chronic energy shortages and fiscal pressures. According to reports, the IMF was not consulted prior to the announcement, prompting it to question the legal standing of cryptocurrencies in Pakistan. It has also voiced concerns over potential impacts on resource distribution and power tariffs. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative. The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the talks.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) continued its decline from recent highs, dipping below $105,000 as sellers gained the upper hand in recent sessions. Analysts predict a deeper pullback to $100,000 will occur before bulls find the momentum to return to the price discovery phase. The flagship cryptocurrency is almost $8,000 below its peak of $111,970. As BTC encountered resistance at multiple levels, on-chain indicators flagged a slowdown in momentum. On-chain analytics platform CryptoQuant noted in a report that some Bitcoin demand metrics were reaching a short-term top, indicating a pause in the current rally. The report stated, “CryptoQuant’s estimate of Bitcoin’s demand growth in the last 30 days is at 229K, which is near the previous demand growth top of 279K Bitcoin reached in December 2024. Additionally, whale-held Bitcoin balances have increased by 2.8% over the past month, a pace that often precedes a slowdown in whale accumulation.” Bitcoin (BTC) raced to a new all-time high on Thursday (May 22), racing an intraday high of $111,970 before settling at $111,589. However, it has been downhill since, with the price nearly 4% to $107,356. BTC recovered over the weekend, registering an increase of 0.46% on Saturday and 1.16% on Sunday to settle at $109,103. The price registered a marginal increase on Monday but was back in the red on Tuesday, dropping 0.46% and settling at $108,954. Sellers retained control on Wednesday as BTC fell .03% and settled at $107,834. Source: TradingView Bearish sentiment intensified on Thursday as the price fell over 2%, slipping below the 20-day SMA and settling at $105,662. BTC continued to decline on Friday, falling 1.51%, falling below $105,000 and settling at $104,067. Despite the overwhelming selling pressure, the price recovered on Saturday, rising 0.69% to $104,784. The current session sees BTC marginally down. The MACD shows sellers have the upper hand. If the current downtrend continues, BTC could test the $100,000 support level before bouncing back. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

While the premier cryptocurrency seems to have recovered fine in the past day, its price is still more than 6% away from the recently achieved all-time high of $111,814. Interestingly, the latest on-chain data suggests that the Bitcoin price could resume its upward trajectory anytime from now. Mass Long Liquidations Could Mean Sustained Upward Trend For BTC In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci shared that the Bitcoin market witnessed its third-largest long liquidation in the month of May. Data from CryptoQuant shows that $202 million in BTC long positions were liquidated on the Binance derivatives exchange on Friday, May 30th. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin Price Doomed For $93K? Technical Indicators Paint A Bearish Image As highlighted by Kesmeci, leveraged trading and speculative pressure ramped up on the world’s largest crypto exchange as the price of Bitcoin rallied from around $94,000 to a new record high above $111,000. These long liquidations typically occur when derivatives traders are forced to close their positions as prices move sharply against them, leading to automatic sell-offs that can further trigger volatility in both directions. The latest event — involving $202 million worth of BTC long positions — is the third-largest in the past month, trailing only two larger liquidations in May: $211 million on May 12 and $277 million on May 23. This series of high-value liquidations reflects the increased speculative activity in the Bitcoin market over the past few weeks. While the investors who suffered this liquidation may feel hard done by the market, these mass liquidations could be positive for the flagship cryptocurrency — a healthy reset for what is starting to feel like an overheated market. By removing excessive leverage, the Bitcoin market can reestablish a more stable foundation for price discovery and a continued upward trend. Bitcoin Funding Rates Still Very Low: Analyst According to another on-chain analyst with the pseudonym Darkfost, the Bitcoin funding rates are still at extremely low levels. This trend signals the unwillingness and hesitation of traders to open new long positions, read the post on X. Darkfost added: Typically, when Bitcoin breaks above its previous all-time high, we tend to see a surge in funding rates, signaling that euphoria and risk appetite are back. But that’s not what we’re seeing right now, investors need more clarity before jumping in with conviction. The on-chain analyst stated that this cautious stance of investors could be positive for the Bitcoin price and the upward trend. Moreover, the lack of euphoria reflects a market that is yet to be overheated, with room for further upside growth. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $ 104,897, reflecting a mere 0.2% increase in the past 24 hours.

Global trade tensions and renewed U.S. tariff risks have triggered risk-off flows, with digital assets increasingly mirroring traditional markets in their reaction to geopolitical uncertainty. On-chain data revealed sizable inflows to centralized exchanges — most notably 385,000 ETH to Binance —a dding to speculation that institutional players may be trimming positions. Although ETH has since recovered modestly to trade around $2,506, market observers are closely watching whether buyers can defend this level or if another leg lower is imminent. Technical Analysis Highlights ETH traded within a volatile $48.61 range (1.95%) between $2,551.09 and $2,499.09. Price action formed a bullish ascending channel before breaking down in the final hour. Heavy selling emerged near $2,550, with profit-taking accelerating into a sharp reversal. ETH dropped from $2,521.35 to $2,499.09 between 01:53 and 01:54, with combined volume exceeding 48,000 ETH across two minutes. Volume normalized shortly after, and price recovered slightly, consolidating around the $2,504–$2,508 band. The $2,500 level is now acting as interim support, though momentum remains fragile with signs of distribution still evident in recent volume patterns.

Mogul Club (stylized as mogul Club)—a platform founded by former Goldman Sachs real estate professionals—is taking a bold step in that direction with the launch of Clubs, on-chain, community-powered investment groups designed to democratize access to premium, income-generating properties. One of the first major collaborations? A partnership with Ava Labs to launch the Avalanche Club, a real estate syndication initiative built for the Web3 community. Through this alliance, developers and users in the Avalanche ecosystem can now pool resources and invest in institutional-grade properties using stablecoins and digital assets—no intermediaries required. To understand how the startup is turning tokenized real estate from concept to execution, crypto.news caught up with co-founder Alex Blackwood. Alex Blackwood, co-founder of mogul Club What was the original vision behind mogul Club, and how has it evolved with the introduction of Clubs? Our original vision behind mogul Club was to democratize premium real estate, traditionally one of the most powerful vehicles for long-term wealth creation, through fractional ownership. Historically, access to institutional-grade property deals has been limited due to high capital minimums, exclusive networks, and knowledge barriers. We aimed to dismantle these barriers by enabling everyday investors and high-net-worth individuals alike to invest fractionally in professionally managed, cash-flowing blue-chip properties. With the introduction of Clubs, our vision has expanded from individual access to fostering community-powered investing. Now, groups such as friends, families, alumni networks, and others can learn and earn together while investing in real estate. Clubs bring a collaborative, social dimension to mogul, empowering communities to build wealth collectively and intentionally. What problems are you solving that traditional platforms don’t address? Clubs represent a fundamental reimagining of the traditional real estate investing model, tailored specifically for a digitally native and community-oriented generation. Traditional investing has typically been exclusive, opaque, and reliant on institutional gatekeepers. Clubs reverse this paradigm by creating a transparent, grassroots-driven approach powered by shared values and collective goals. mogul aims to lead community-led capital formation by allowing groups such as crypto ecosystems, alumni networks, and others to form or join Clubs aligned with their specific interests. Additionally, as Clubs evolve, we are developing premium, customized features designed to meet the investing needs of community organizers and participants. What’s your revenue model? Mogul currently collects revenue through fees structured around our fractional investments. We have a 3% onboarding fee and a 2% setup fee, both capitalized into the deal based on the purchase price of the property. These fees cover expenses related to finding, vetting, and onboarding properties. Additionally, we collect 2.5% of the rental income to manage coordination with property managers and to leverage institutional-level discounts. Importantly, this 2.5% minimally impacts returns and aligns our incentives closely with investors—we do not collect this fee unless investors receive returns. All returns projected on our platform, including IRR estimates, are presented net of these fees. How do you ensure liquidity for investors in tokenized real estate assets? Mogul plans to introduce secondary liquidity options by Q2 2026. Until then, investor liquidity primarily occurs when properties are sold. In the interim, investors benefit from real-time appreciation of their investment, monthly dividends distributed directly to their account, and tax benefits. Are there any regulatory safeguards in place, particularly around tokenized securities? Mogul operates as an investment club and not as a regulated security, so traditional securities regulations do not apply. We implement robust Know Your Customer (KYC) processes to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations related to identity verification and anti-money laundering. Additionally, our platform is built on Avalanche (AVAX) blockchain technology, using Snowtrace for transparency, and we utilize Fireblocks to securely store users’ wallets and keys. Fireblocks employ stringent security protocols and measures, including secure custody and robust key management, to protect digital assets and ensure their safe transfer and storage. Crucially, investors’ capital is placed directly into the property-owning PropCo LLCs, which means their investments are fully protected even if mogul were to experience operational disruptions.

A rare IP leak exposed a hacker’s location in China. G7 leaders plan to address North Korea’s growing crypto thefts at their upcoming summit. BitMEX’s security team has exposed significant operational weaknesses within the Lazarus Group, the North Korean state-sponsored cybercrime network responsible for a string of high-profile crypto hacks. In a recent counter-operations probe , BitMEX researchers identified technical missteps that revealed parts of the group’s infrastructure. Among the discoveries were exposed IP addresses, an accessible database, and tracking algorithms used by the group in its campaigns. Rare Slip Exposes Lazarus Hacker’s IP Address in China One key finding suggests that a hacker likely exposed his real IP address during an operation, pinpointing a location in Jiaxing, China — a rare lapse for the highly secretive group. Researchers also gained access to a Supabase database instance used by the attackers. Supabase is a platform that simplifies database deployment, and its use by Lazarus highlights the group’s evolving operational tools. BitMEX’s report underscores a growing divide in the group’s internal structure. It notes an “asymmetry” between low-skill social engineering teams, responsible for tricking users into downloading malware, and the more advanced developers creating sophisticated exploits. The fragmentation suggests that Lazarus has splintered into sub-groups with varying capabilities. While some cells rely on basic social engineering, others deploy complex technical attacks targeting the blockchain and tech sectors. North Korea is funding its weapons program with cryptocurrency stolen through cyberattacks. Hackers stole more than $50 million from at least three cryptocurrency exchanges between 2020 and mid-2021, according to a U.N. report https://t.co/EkLEJwPjdj pic.twitter.com/edPXkjsaV3 — Reuters (@Reuters) February 8, 2022 The findings come amid a wider surge in DPRK-linked cyber activity. Global law enforcement agencies continue to investigate the group’s operations. In September 2024, the FBI warned about phishing scams using fake job offers to lure crypto users. That warning was later echoed by Japan, South Korea, and U.S. officials, who labeled Lazarus a threat to financial stability. Now, international concern is growing. A Bloomberg report suggests world leaders may address the Lazarus threat at the upcoming G7 Summit, exploring coordinated strategies to mitigate damage from the group’s activities. With Lazarus remaining an active force in the crypto threat landscape, BitMEX’s findings offer new insights into the group’s operational vulnerabilities — and potential avenues for disruption. G7 to Address North Korea’s Crypto Theft Surge G7 leaders are expected to address North Korea’s escalating cyberattacks and cryptocurrency thefts at next month’s summit in Canada. While global conflicts remain high on the agenda, Pyongyang’s cyber operations, seen as a key funding source for its weapons programs, are drawing urgent attention from member states seeking coordinated action. The Lazarus Group, North Korea’s most infamous hacking collective, is believed to be behind a series of major crypto thefts, including a record $1.4 billion heist from exchange Bybit in February. Chainalysis has claimed that North Korean-linked actors stole over $1.3 billion across 47 separate incidents in 2024 alone. Beyond external hacks, the regime employs rogue IT workers to infiltrate crypto firms from within — a tactic flagged in a joint warning from the U.S., Japan, and South Korea. North Korean cyber strategies continue to evolve. In April, Lazarus-linked operatives reportedly set up U.S.-based shell companies to distribute malware to crypto developers. Kraken recently thwarted an infiltration attempt by a suspected North Korean posing as a job candidate.

The most promising protocols in crypto today aren’t just algorithmic marvels. They’re designed to harness the collective intelligence of their communities. Having managed both a 5,000-acre vegetable farm and multiple crypto ventures, I’ve watched purely technical approaches consistently fail where community-integrated systems thrive. You might also like: Rethinking money in the web3 era: From capital to code, narrative, and moral design | Opinion In northern Italy, truffle hunters work in perfect synergy with their trained pigs. The pigs detect valuable truffles through their acute sense of smell, sensing compounds humans cannot perceive. The hunters contribute expertise in identifying promising locations, interpreting signals, and extracting truffles without damage. Neither succeeds alone. This complementary intelligence offers a powerful lesson for crypto protocols. Many are still trying to replace human judgment with algorithms when they should be creating systems that combine both. Protocols that listen outperform Look at Yearn Finance. It didn’t revolutionize DeFi through better algorithms. It created a system that actively integrates community signals into its vault strategies. When unsustainable yield farms emerged during the 2021-2022 DeFi boom, Yearn’s community detected the risks months before they became obvious. The protocol amplified this intelligence, outperforming purely algorithmic approaches. Similarly, Aave’s risk management framework incorporates ongoing community governance to adjust parameters based on subtle market shifts that quantitative models miss. This integration helped Aave weather market turbulence that destroyed less adaptive protocols. The evidence is compelling. During the 2024 election, while traditional polls showed 15-point swings between candidates, prediction markets maintained signals accurate to within two percentage points. When people put actual money behind their predictions, they consistently outperform expert analysis. In protocol performance, the pattern is unmistakable. During the cascading liquidations of 2023, protocols with community-integrated risk systems experienced significantly fewer insolvencies than those relying solely on algorithms ( Gauntlet, 2023 ). Aave, for example, weathered the March 2023 USD Coin ( USDC ) crisis with only minimal bad debt, while algorithmic protocols faced cascading failures ( Chaos Labs, 2023 ). Meanwhile, protocols with active governance, like MakerDAO and Yearn Finance, delivered significantly higher risk-adjusted returns from 2020 to 2024 ( ChainCatcher, 2024 ). I’ve seen this dynamic throughout my years growing up in and around agriculture. The most resilient farming communities don’t just follow models. They draw on generational, regional knowledge to get the most out of their soil and maximize yield over the long term. They know which rotations actually restore fertility in their specific fields, how to manage nitrogen without over-relying on inputs, and which cover crops make sense given local climate and soil type. This isn’t folklore. It’s research-backed, but grounded in lived experience. Top-down agtech platforms and government policies often miss the mark because they assume one-size-fits-all answers. But soil doesn’t work that way. Neither does making a living from it. The knowledge that matters most lives in communities, passed down, adapted each season, and tested over time. Behavioral finance confirms what’s obvious to experienced market participants: algorithms excel in stable environments but falter when fundamental conditions shift. Like a truffle pig trained to find black truffles suddenly hunting white ones, these systems can only detect what they’re programmed to find. Designing for complementary intelligence Creating effective partnerships between algorithms and communities requires intentional design. The most successful protocols incorporate these principles: Transparent observability : Community participants need visibility into system operations. Dashboards, real-time metrics, and clear documentation enable the community to develop pattern recognition capabilities that algorithms might miss. Graduated response mechanisms : Rather than binary on/off switches, effective protocols provide a spectrum of intervention options. Uniswap’s three-tiered fee structure exemplifies this approach, allowing community wisdom to find the right balance for different trading pairs. Sentiment aggregation systems : Beyond formal governance votes, successful protocols capture continuous feedback through multiple channels: forums, Discord discussions, GitHub issues, on-chain behavior. These inputs form an ongoing conversation between code and community. Failure planning : The most resilient systems assume algorithmic failures will occur and design community response systems in advance. These “break glass in case of emergency” mechanisms acknowledge that human judgment becomes most valuable precisely when automated systems reach their limits. By designing with these principles, protocols create space for complementary intelligence to flourish. Algorithms handle routine operations with efficiency while community wisdom addresses complex edge cases and strategic decisions. Finding your edge as an investor For investors, the implications are clear: protocols designed to harness community intelligence offer more sustainable returns. Look for projects that: Integrate governance beyond token voting, capturing community insights continuously. Look for protocols with active forums, responsive Discord channels, and teams that engage meaningfully with user feedback outside of formal governance processes. Demonstrate adaptive strategy shifts based on community signals. Review how the protocol responded to previous market stress events. The best projects show a pattern of preemptive adjustments based on community discussions before problems become obvious to the broader market. Prioritize ecosystem health over maximum short-term yields. This typically appears as conservative risk parameters and sustainable growth rates. Examine how the team handled previous yield opportunities—did they chase maximum returns or maintain prudent safety margins? The most valuable protocols don’t replace human judgment with algorithms. They build systems that combine community wisdom with technical precision, just like the centuries-old partnership between truffle hunter and pig. When millions are at stake, would you trust only the algorithm, or would you prefer a protocol that incorporates the collective wisdom of thousands of engaged participants? The market is delivering its verdict: the most resilient protocols aren’t just code. They’re living partnerships that blend human insight with machine execution. In a market defined by uncertainty, that partnership is becoming the only sustainable edge.

The United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Utah says 41-year-old Kyle Eugene Duncan-Carle has been sentenced to 72 months in prison after he admitted to committing bank fraud. Authorities say that between January and September 2023, Duncan-Carle stole US Treasury checks that were already made out to people or companies and stole their identities to open credit union accounts under their names. He subsequently deposited the checks to be able to withdraw the funds, according to prosecutors. All in all, Duncan-Carle admitted to stealing at least eight Treasury checks totaling $7.97 million. In the end, authorities say the victims, which include the US government, financial institutions and an insurance provider, sustained $3.49 million in losses. Duncan-Carle’s sentence also includes five years of supervised release after his six-year stint behind bars and an order to pay restitution to his victims. He was reportedly arrested in Lyon County, Nevada, last year and charged with bank fraud, aggravated identity theft and receipt of stolen government property.

Over the years, the company has employed human evaluators to look into the risks associated with new products and features, but things are set to change with this new update. According to internal conversations and documents, Meta is planning to have 90% of all its risk assessments automated. This means that aspects regarding critical updates to the company’s algorithms, safety features, and changes to how content is allowed to be shared across Meta’s platforms will mostly be approved by a system backed by artificial intelligence. It also means that these changes would no longer be subjected to being reviewed by staff tasked with discussing how a change on the platform could have unforeseen effects or be misused. Meta intends to move to an AI-powered review system According to sources inside Meta, the development has been seen as a win for product developers, as it affords them enough time to release their app updates and features. However, there are still concerns inside the company about how tricky the situation is, noting that the company will be allowing AI to make tricky determinations about Meta’s apps could lead to real-world harm. The bias has been shared by both former and current employees. “Insofar as this process functionally means more stuff launching faster, with less rigorous scrutiny and opposition, it means you’re creating higher risks,” said a former Meta executive who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation from the company. “Negative externalities of product changes are less likely to be prevented before they start causing problems in the world.” In a recent statement, Meta mentioned that it has infused billions of dollars to support user privacy. The company has also been under the watch of the Federal Trade Commission since 2012, with the agency reaching an agreement with the company on how it handles the personal information of its users. As a result, there has always been a need for privacy reviews of products, according to former and current Meta employees. In its statement, the company added that the product risk review changes will help streamline decision-making, noting that it still employs human expertise in novel and complex issues. Meta also noted that only low-risk decisions are currently being automated, but internal documents reviewed by NPR show that Meta has been looking into automating reviews for sensitive aspects, including AI safety, youth risk, and another category known as integrity, which is responsible for things like misinformation and violent contents. Under the previous system, product and feature updates were first sent to risk assessors before being rolled out to the public. However, according to a slide showcasing how the new process works, product teams will receive instant decisions after completing a questionnaire about the project. The AI-powered decision will identify several risky areas and requirements that could address them. Before the launch of such projects, the product team will also verify if the requirements have been met. What the new system highlights are that the engineers building Meta products will need to make their judgement about the risks. According to the slide, In some cases, including new risks or where a product team needs additional feedback, the projects will be given a manual review which is carried out by humans. However, a former Meta director for innovation until 2022, Zvika Krieger has mentioned that product managers and engineers are not privacy experts. “Most product managers and engineers are not privacy experts and that is not the focus of their job. It’s not what they are primarily evaluated on and it’s not what they are incentivized to prioritize,” he said. He also added that some of these self-assessments have become exercises that miss some important risks.

Currently, XRP trades at $2.32, with only small increases over the last week, as people await news on the approval of the Ripple ETF and new rules in the U.S. SHIB has continued to be firm despite less whale involvement, since its community is rallying together and supporting their cryptocurrency ahead of the coming market upturn. While both assets remain key players in long-term crypto investing strategies, analysts suggest that newer, low-priced token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) may offer significantly higher upside, with 30x potential gains drawing increasing attention from forward-looking investors. The presale of Mutuum Finance is now in phase 5 after selling out the fourth one. Over $9.7 million has been raised, attracting more than 11,500 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows MUTM utilizes a two-way lending model that has made the project take center stage as far as speedy adoption by users is concerned. More than 11,500 investors have invested $9.7 million in the presale pointing to the success of the project. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, Mutuum Finance is an intriguing DeFi project. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design ensures long-term price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. The platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have now been officially audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust and paving the way for institutional adoption. Rewarding Early Investors and Growing the Community Mutuum Finance is encouraging people to join by offering attractive rewards to early investors. Ten lucky participants in the ongoing Mutuum Finance Giveaway will be rewarded with $10,000 worth of MUTM tokens each. While Ripple (XRP) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) continue to offer steady returns for long-term holders it’s the low-cost high-upside potential of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) that has investors taking notice. With over $9.7 million raised from 11,500+ investors and a unique hybrid lending model backed by a completed Certik audit, MUTM stands out as a next-generation DeFi token. Priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5 and set to list at $0.06 early participants are positioned for a 100% return before launch with post-launch projections reaching as high as $10.7 representing a possible 30x surge. Don’t miss your chance to get in early to join the presale and claim your stake in this potential breakout token.

The project offers some groundbreaking decentralized finance capabilities delivered at scale. Crypto veterans who know a good project when they see one plan to take full advantage of this unique opportunity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) – Innovating To Power Growth Mutuum Finance comes with unique features that include cost optimization, a decentralized stablecoin, and robust liquidity protections for depositors. Backers who have examined the project in-depth believe this project could skyrocket after launch, making this the perfect time to jump in. How To Join The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Presale The project combines real-world use cases, cross-chain functionality, and low costs to give it an edge over all other DeFi presales. So far, investors agree, and they have bought over $9.7 million in presale tokens. The ongoing presale is currently in phase 5, with tokens available at a discounted $0.03 per token. This price represents a golden opportunity for early backers to make a 100% return on the $0.06 listing price. The token price rises in steps, with the next price increase set at 16.67% to $0.035 in phase. This stepped price increase ensures that the earliest believers in the vision make the most profits. The tokens can be bought for Ethereum (ETH), BNB (BNB), or Polygon (MATIC). Additionally, buyers can use the USDT or USDC stablecoins on those three native blockchains. There is no minimum or maximum purchase. However, a $50 purchase grants you access to the $100K giveaway, in which 10 lucky winners stand to receive $10K worth of MUTM tokens each. Purchases can be made via the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) by connecting a crypto wallet such as MetaMask or Trust Wallet to the platform. In the next step, pick your preferred currency and chain, and enter the amount of MUTM tokens you wish to purchase. Click “Buy Now,” and the transaction will be completed once you confirm it on your wallet. Benefits Of The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) features numerous benefits that are designed to ensure the best possible outcomes for all participants. Let us list a few below: Instant Liquidity Once lenders place their assets in a lending pool, they receive access to instant liquidity via mtTokens. For instance, if they deposit $3,000 worth of MATIC in a pool, they receive mtMATIC tokens that represent their deposit in the pool, plus interest accrued. The mtTokens can be used to take advantage of various market opportunities in the crypto market, or even used as collateral for products on Mutuum Finance. Low Transaction Cost Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will keep costs low for users via layer-2 cost optimization. This will work by focusing on calldata, which is the main source of fees. Since the protocol will support a limited number of high-value assets, it will assign each of the supported assets a compact identifier, such as using a 16-bit identifier, instead of the full 160-bit address. This innovation, coupled with other cost-cutting measures, will ensure adoption of the protocol at scale by making it accessible to everyone in the crypto world. Cutting-Edging Liquidity And Volatility Management Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will deploy innovative strategies for the management of liquidity on Mutuum Finance. It will include strict liquidity parameters and caps to control exposure. For instance, if an asset has low liquidity, the protocol could boost incentives for liquidators to maintain the health of the ecosystem. Asset ratings will be another way to control the overall health of the ecosystem. As such, assets with a better stability factor rating will be assigned a higher threshold for liquidation, while those with a low rating will have a lower threshold. The solution will ensure there is a balance between broad market participation and protecting the protocol’s stability. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recognizes that to move to the next level of DeFi scalability, costs must come down, and new solutions are needed. Its focus on optimal design to address existing needs has analysts excited, as they anticipate a minimum of 10x gains soon after the project launches.

After peaking above $111,000 in May, the Bitcoin price has entered a retracement phase and is now trading below $105,000. While some interpret the current downturn as a sign of a weakening trend, others see it as a textbook bullish correction. Among them is crypto analyst MasterAnanda, whose latest chart suggests that Bitcoin is structurally strong enough to reach new highs, but it might fall short of the speculated $200,000 price target this cycle. Related Reading: No Room For Doubt: Analyst’s $900K Bitcoin Forecast Follows Familiar Script MasterAnanda Predicts Higher Low And $137,000 Target In his TradingView post, MasterAnanda stated clearly that Bitcoin is still in a bullish structure, but he believes a $200,000 peak is out of reach for this cycle. Instead, he identified $137,000 as the more realistic upside target when Bitcoin finally rebounds from the ongoing correction. According to the analyst, the formation of a higher low on the larger time frame will be an important confirmation that Bitcoin’s macro uptrend remains intact. He outlined $88,888.88 as an ideal retracement level to make this perfect higher low, because it aligns with the 0.618 Fibonacci level and comes in well above the prior bottom at $74,500 on April 7. Despite the current sell-off, MasterAnanda argues that the broader trend is healthy. “Bitcoin will never ever trade below $80,000 in its history again,” he declared, ruling out any deep reversal below the prior low. On the other hand, the analyst also noted that if Bitcoin holds above $100,000 to $102,000, this retracement would be considered minor, with price action still classified as bullish continuation rather than a breakdown. If Bitcoin bulls manage to keep prices trading above that area, it would suggest the current move is nothing more than a short-term dip. When that moment arrives, the bias will shift from short to long, and a rally to $137,000. However, a clean break below the $100,000 price level would mark a significant shift in how long Bitcoin reaches new highs. Chart From TradingView: MasterAnanda RLinda Echoes $101,000 Support For Bitcoin Adding to the analysis, another trader, RLinda, shared a 4-hour chart perspective showing how Bitcoin is currently in a fragile recovery path. She agrees that Bitcoin is still operating within a bullish context, but flagged the $102,000 and $101,400 zones as vital structural supports. Her chart suggests that the false breakout at the key $110,000 resistance level is the end of the recent rally leg, and the current decline could be a liquidity-driven correction rather than a complete reversal of the bullish trend. Furthermore, RLinda’s analysis shows that Bitcoin has exited its upward channel. The outcome, she said, will depend heavily on whether support levels at $102,000 and $101,400 can hold. A bounce from these levels could lead to a retest of the $106,000 to $108,000 resistance zone, where market direction may become clearer. If bulls fail to hold $101,000, it could invite a more dramatic sell-off that pushes the Bitcoin price toward a local bottom or even deeper.

The agency flagged the C-corp structure as conflicting with ETF regulations. Final decisions on staking ETFs are likely delayed until October. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has raised concerns about the structure of proposed Solana (SOL) and Ether (ETH) staked exchange-traded funds (ETFs), arguing that the products may not qualify as ETFs under current regulations. ETF provider REX Financial and asset manager Osprey Funds recently submitted amendments for the funds’ registration. However, according to Bloomberg, the SEC flagged the use of a c-corporation (c-corp) structure, a rare choice for ETFs, as conflicting with Rule 6C-11, commonly referred to as the “ETF rule,” which defines permitted fund structures. SEC Flags Compliance Issues in Proposed ETF Structures The SEC staff said they continue to have unresolved questions about whether the proposed funds, if structured and operated as planned, meet the definition of an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act, according to a letter dated May 30. The letter further warned that disclosures about the funds’ investment company status “may be potentially misleading.” Despite the regulatory pushback, analysts remain hopeful. “REX lawyers say they can work it out,” Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted in a May 31 post on X. “Issuers are pushing the envelope hard in an effort to get first to market.” Update: SEC sent letter to REX last night saying it was concerned SEC improperly filed. REX lawyer says they can work it out. Feels a bit like the $PRIV situation. Issuers pushing envelope hard in effort to get first to mkt. Saturday scoop from @isabelletanlee https://t.co/6fnYf5Oo2V pic.twitter.com/NHTvOQyDsO — Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) May 31, 2025 Market participants are closely tracking the progress of altcoin and staking-based ETFs, viewing them as a potential gateway for fresh institutional capital to enter the crypto sector. The SEC’s caution comes even after it clarified earlier this year that crypto staking, in itself, does not constitute a securities transaction. Still, the agency has delayed rulings on several staking and altcoin ETF applications. These delays are not unexpected. “Almost all of these filings have final due dates in October,” Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart wrote. “It is uncommon for ETF applications to be approved so early.” BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Sees Record $430M Outflows As reported, BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) recorded $430.8 million in outflows on May 30, ending a 31-day inflow streak — its longest since launch. The move marks IBIT’s largest single-day outflow to date, according to Farside data, following a month where BlackRock added $6.2 billion in Bitcoin. Despite the pullback, IBIT’s total Bitcoin holdings now stand at around $70 billion. The outflows were part of a broader trend across U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw $616.1 million in net redemptions on May 30 — the second consecutive day of outflows. The previous day had seen $346.8 million withdrawn. Notably, BlackRock was the only issuer to post inflows on May 29, even as others saw redemptions.

Despite minor pullbacks, the odds have stabilized above 80% as the year progresses. SOL spot ETF progress This growing optimism aligns with ongoing developments in Solana-related ETF proposals. Notably, the SEC is reviewing a proposed rule change by NYSE Arca to list the Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund, which includes Solana, alongside other major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Recently, the SEC extended its decision timeline by 60 days, pushing the original June 1, 2025, deadline to July 31, 2025. Adding to the regulatory landscape, REX Shares and Osprey Funds have submitted a proposal for a novel “staking ETF.” This fund would invest in Solana and Ethereum, staking at least half of its assets to generate additional yield. However, the SEC has expressed concerns about whether this structure qualifies as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. In a letter, SEC Associate Director Brent J. Fields outlined unresolved questions regarding the proposal’s compliance, signaling potential hurdles for Solana’s ETF ambitions.

A report titled “Amid the Public Opinion Storm: What Happened to HashKey?” by Foresight News claimed that the company only has about six months of cash flow left in its coffers and recently laid off a third of its staff. The report also alleged that some of its suppliers were experiencing delays in payments or had their contracts terminated. In response to these claims, HashKey Group issued a harsh statement. The company stated that the news in question was intended to deliberately mislead the public and was a “malicious attack” aimed at damaging their reputation. The statement included the following statements: “The published article was prepared with the aim of misleading the public and damaging our reputation. Such malicious behavior is not only condemnable, but also reveals the capital connections and unethical competitive motivations behind it.” Related News: SEC Does Something It Rarely Does: Issues Negative Opinions on ETF Applications for Two Altcoins HashKey drew attention to a possible capital connection between Foresight News and the trading platform OSL.

According to the report, the stolen amount dropped drastically from April stats, with the largest incident making up 90% of the month’s total. According to a post by PeckShield on X, the blockchain security firm mentioned that the crypto industry recorded about 20 hacks, pushing the total amount lost to $244.1 million. “In May 2025, ~20 major crypto hacks were recorded, resulting in total losses of $244.1M — a 39.29% decrease from April,” PeckShied said. The decline comes as the crypto industry has been putting measures in place and stepping up efforts to combat these activities. Funds from the Cetus DEX hack frozen According to the blockchain security firm, the biggest hack that occurred last month happened on the Cetus decentralized exchange. The platform suffered a breach on May 22, resulting in the loss of about $223 million in users’ funds. The incident was reported by pseudonymous Web3 researcher COMDARE3, who posted on X that the Sui-based DEX Cetus is being exploited. According to blockchain security firm Dedaub, the hackers exploited a flaw in the most significant bits (MBS) check. #PeckShieldAlert In May 2025, ~20 major crypto hacks were recorded, resulting in total losses of $244.1M—a 39.29% decrease from April.

It then allowed them to establish relatively large positions with a keystroke. “This allowed them to add massive liquidity positions with just one unit of token input, subsequently draining pools collectively containing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tokens,” the blockchain security firm said in its report. PeckShield added that Cetus and the Sui Network had frozen about $157 million in stolen funds, which represents about 71% of the entire cache. PeckShield noted that the second-largest exploit of May was the attack on the decentralized finance platform Cork Protocol . According to cybersecurity firm Cyvers, the Cork Protocol hacker used the exploit to cart away about 3,761 Wrapped States Ether (wstETH), which they converted to Ethereum. The last three of the top five hacks for the month were an MBU tokens exploit worth $2.2 million, a MapleStory Universe exploit of $1.2 million, and an attack suspected to be linked to the DPRK, worth $5.2 million. Industry steps up the war against crypto hackers The PeckShield report comes after increased efforts by the crypto industry to protect itself against bad actors. According to previous reports, the security team of crypto exchange BitMEX released a report where it mentioned that it discovered gaps in the operational security of the Lazarus group, a North Korean cybercrime group that is alleged to have ties to the government of the country. During the counter operations probe into the organization, the platform discovered IP addresses, a database, and tracking algorithms deployed by the group. According to some of the security researchers, there is a likelihood that one of the hackers in the group accidentally revealed his true IP address, which they said showed the actual location of the hacker to be in Jiaxing, China. The researchers also said they were also able to access a Supabase database, a platform for easily deploying databases with simple interfaces for applications, used by the hacking group. According to PeckShield, the crypto industry lost over $1.63 billion to hackers, with the blockchain security platform pointing out that the Bybit exploit accounted for more than 92% of the entire loss. The firm also pointed out that over $487 million in crypto was lost to hackers in January, while February saw a jump to $1.53 billion due to the Bybit incident, which has been dubbed the largest crypto heist to date.

As institutional interest in Bitcoin grows and nations onboard crypto into their reserves, meme tokens are evolving beyond their punchline past. The next wealth wave might just come wrapped in satire—and these meme coins are riding that momentum. Among the names grabbing serious attention are Troller Cat, Just a Chill Guy, Official Trump, Act I: The AI Prophecy, Fartcoin, and Degen. Some are reviving nostalgic memes, others are gamifying politics or AI, but only one combines utility, yield, and viral appeal in a way that makes it a true standout. For those looking to buy TCAT, Troller Cat currently leads the pack of the best meme coins for long-term investment. 1. Troller Cat: The Strategic Presale Powerhouse Transforming Fun Into Financial Firepower Troller Cat launched its presale on May 2, 2025, with an initial price of just $0.000005 per token.

It raised concerns over legal risks and energy strain. Pakistan advances national crypto and blockchain strategy. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is pushing back on Pakistan’s plan to allocate 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers as the country navigates tough financial negotiations with the Fund. The initiative, unveiled last week, is part of a broader push to attract blockchain firms, AI companies, and crypto miners to Pakistan. However, according to a report by local outlet Samaa , the IMF has flagged several concerns — primarily the legality of crypto mining in the country and the strain such a move could place on its already fragile power grid. IMF Seeks Urgent Clarification on Pakistan’s Crypto Mining Plan The IMF was reportedly not consulted ahead of the announcement and is now seeking urgent clarification from the Finance Ministry. With Pakistan facing chronic energy shortages and inflationary pressures, the Fund has also warned about potential knock-on effects on power tariffs and resource distribution. “There is a fear of further tough talks from the IMF on this initiative,” an official involved in the negotiations told Samaa . “The economic team is already facing stiff questions, and this move has only added to the complexities of the talks.” While I'm an optimist by nature and I really hope I'm wrong, I think Pakistan will struggle to follow through on its Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining plans Short answer why: IMF Mid-sized answer why: * Bitcoin is a huge threat to IMF in 5 ways. * Pakistan are heavily indebted… pic.twitter.com/4t4BO6Keqm — Daniel Batten (@DSBatten) May 31, 2025 The IMF delegation, which is currently holding virtual discussions with Pakistani authorities, is expected to hold a dedicated session on the electricity plan for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers in the coming days. The power allocation is part of a wider national strategy to integrate digital assets into Pakistan’s economy. A key piece of this strategy is the new Pakistan Digital Asset Authority (PDAA), approved by the Finance Ministry on May 21. The PDAA will oversee the regulation of exchanges, wallets, stablecoins, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and the tokenization of national assets in line with global standards, including those of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Pakistan Launches Strategic Bitcoin Reserve The move follows Pakistan’s surprise debut of its first strategic Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference last week. During the event, Bilal bin Saqib, crypto adviser to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, unveiled plans for a national Bitcoin wallet and reaffirmed the government’s support for the digital asset sector. Pakistan began shifting its crypto policy earlier this year with the proposal of a “National Crypto Council,” tasked with building a regulatory framework and driving foreign investment into the country’s emerging crypto ecosystem. Last week, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif elevated Bilal Bin Saqib to the role of Special Assistant to the PM on Blockchain and Crypto, granting him the status of a minister of state. As Special Assistant, Saqib will be tasked with key responsibilities: drafting FATF-compliant crypto regulations, launching state-backed Bitcoin mining projects, and overseeing blockchain integration in governance, land records, and finance. He will also supervise licensing of virtual asset service providers and advance investor protection measures in the Web3 space.

Traders Divided as Market Cools Off,https://cryptopotato.com/bitcoin-to-150k-or-back-to-92k-traders-divided-as-market-cools-off/,"Bitcoin (BTC) smashed a fresh all-time high (ATH) of $111,814 on May 22, but the party may be over, at least for now. After rallying by more than $15,000 over the month, the king crypto has shed $9,000 in the last week alone, slipping to the $103,000 level, putting traders on edge and sparking new debate: Is this a healthy cooldown or the start of a deeper plunge? Technical Red Flags Flashing Volatility is back with a vengeance. In the last 24 hours, BTC has swung between $103,300 and $105,000, reflecting growing market uncertainty. Zooming out, it’s still up 9.1% in the last 30 days and 52.1% over the past year, but the momentum seems to be fading. According to data shared by analyst Axel Adler Jr., Bitcoin just triggered four consecutive sell signals on CryptoQuant’s Net UTXO Supply ratio. “This is a typical pattern for an overheated market phase, where profit-taking occurs and demand begins to lag supply,” he warned, highlighting the red flag that often comes before short-term tops. Further, the market watcher pointed to two possible scenarios for the asset: a sideways purgatory, with BTC drifting sideways between $95,000 and $105,000 for weeks, or a mid pullback that could see it plunge toward $92,000 in a bid to “relieve overbought conditions.” Betting Big on Bitcoin However, others are more optimistic, or delusional, depending on who you ask. According to BetIdeas in an email to CryptoPotato , there’s an 80% chance of BTC hitting $120,000 in 2025, and a 40% shot at $150,000. “The volatile nature of crypto is what will always grab the headlines but with the upwards trend in May with Bitcoin being increasingly positive, it looks as though a big run for Bitcoin holders is coming,” wrote spokesman Steve McQuillan. He stated that traders on the platform had placed a 22% chance on a run toward $200,000 before the end of the year. Meanwhile, popular analyst Daan Crypto Trades has pointed to the zone between $97,000 and $99,000 as a key level to watch for a potential bounce, citing Fibonacci retracement levels and the 200-day moving average. Elsewhere, Michaël van de Poppe doesn’t seem too fazed by the current goings on in the market, terming it “consolidation and correction,” which, in his opinion , is “very healthy and normal.” The post Bitcoin to $150K or Back to $92K?

Recently, a growing number of analysts are turning their attention away from Ripple (XRP) and focusing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which is gaining traction for its innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) model and impressive forecasted returns. With the current price of MUTM at $0.03 and a projected 45x return within just 10 months, this shift is driven by clear data and real-world utility. Contrasting Ripple (XRP)’s stagnation with Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s dynamic model Ripple (XRP), once celebrated for its promise in cross-border payments and banking solutions, has seen a relatively stagnant price performance and limited innovation in recent months. In contrast, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is introducing a dynamic, decentralized liquidity protocol that expands borrowing and lending options significantly. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates with two main lending models: peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P). The P2C model allows users to deposit assets into pooled liquidity contracts to earn interest and enables borrowers to take loans against collateral in a fully automated system. The P2P model goes a step further by allowing users to lend and borrow tokens directly from one another with negotiated terms. One of the most notable advantages of the P2P model is its support for a wider range of tokens, including popular memecoins like Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). These tokens are typically unavailable in many P2C lending pools, giving Mutuum Finance (MUTM) users unique access to diverse assets and trading strategies. This flexibility contrasts sharply with Ripple (XRP)’s limited use cases, making MUTM far more attractive for investors seeking both utility and growth. A strong liquidity base and impressive presale success Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has generated around $9.70 million in liquidity so far during its presale phases, demonstrating solid investor confidence. With over 11,650 holders already onboard, the project’s community is growing steadily. This level of liquidity is a key driver behind the forecasted 45x return, as it provides the foundation for sustainable growth and increased token demand. To put this into perspective, the price difference between phase 1 of the presale and the current phase highlights early investors’ gains. Early participants purchased MUTM tokens at prices significantly below $0.03, securing impressive profits already. As the project progresses through subsequent phases, the window for such outsized gains narrows, making the current price the best entry point for new investors looking to maximize returns. Confident investment examples with passive income Investors seeking to benefit from Mutuum Finance (MUTM) should consider the passive income opportunities available on the platform. For instance, depositing $2,000 worth of ETH or DAI into Mutuum’s liquidity pools allows users to earn passive interest that varies with the pool’s utilization rate. When liquidity pools experience high demand, interest rates increase, rewarding lenders. At the current utilization rates, lending these assets can generate annual returns ranging from 8% to 12%, a solid income stream that complements the anticipated token price appreciation. If an investor commits $1,000 at the current price of $0.03, a 17x rise in MUTM’s price would transform that into $17,000. With a 22x increase, the investment becomes $22,000, and at 28x, it reaches $28,000. More aggressive forecasts of 33x or 37x returns would multiply the original investment to $33,000 or $37,000 respectively. Security concerns have held many investors back from fully embracing DeFi projects. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) addresses these concerns head-on by completing a thorough CertiK audit. This audit included manual review and static analysis, culminating in a solid token scan score of 70. The audit timeline, requested in February 2025 and revised in May 2025, reflects the project’s ongoing commitment to transparency and safety. This security endorsement builds further confidence among investors and analysts who prioritize projects with audited smart contracts. The assurance that Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s contracts are reliable and resistant to vulnerabilities makes MUTM a trusted choice in the DeFi lending space. Upcoming beta launch and community incentives According to the roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) plans to launch a beta version of its platform by the time the token goes live. This beta will provide users with early access to the core features of the platform for testing, including lending, borrowing, and staking functions. Such early exposure often leads to increased adoption and liquidity growth, fueling the token’s price appreciation. To encourage wider participation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is running a $100,000 giveaway. This giveaway rewards early adopters and builds excitement around the platform. These community incentives increase engagement and spread awareness, driving more users to join before the token’s value spikes. Holders who stake mtTokens earned from lending activity receive passive dividends generated from protocol revenue. This token utility creates a strong alignment between the success of the platform and the wealth of its holders. Unlike Ripple (XRP), which primarily serves as a bridge currency within Ripple (XRP)’s payment network, MUTM provides real use cases that generate value continuously through lending, borrowing, and staking rewards. Why now is the time to switch to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Analysts switching focus from Ripple (XRP) to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) base their recommendations on clear advantages: a dynamic, dual lending model, significant liquidity already generated, an ongoing audited security framework, and multiple streams of income for investors. The current $0.03 price point represents a prime entry, offering an early mover advantage that won’t last as the project gains traction. The combination of a forecasted 45x return and reliable passive income from assets like ETH and DAI positions MUTM as one of the most promising crypto investments in 2025. Investors who move now will capitalize on the growth, while those waiting risk missing out as later presale phases reduce profit margins.

Absolutely—especially in the meme coin sector. Over the past few years, meme coins have stormed the digital currency landscape with humor, hype, and surprising profits. From the legacy of Dogecoin to new arrivals like Dogs Coin and Fartboy, the trend shows no signs of cooling. But amidst this chaos, Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the Top meme coins in June 2025, and it’s not just hype—it’s strategy, utility, and timing all wrapped in one frosty package. While Dogecoin remains iconic and the likes of Dogs Coin and Fartboy shake things up with quirky value propositions, Arctic Pablo Coin is forging a disruptive path. It’s commanding attention with a dynamic presale model, lucrative referral system, and jaw-dropping potential returns. Ready to dive into the meme coin movement? This listicle highlights the four meme coins shaking up the scene—and one of them could be your golden ticket. 1. Arctic Pablo Coin – Game-Changing Referral Incentives What makes Arctic Pablo Coin stand out from the herd? Its referral incentives are unlike anything in the meme coin market right now. Arctic Pablo Coin lets users earn rewards simply by spreading the word—an innovative, scalable way to grow the community while putting real value in participants’ hands. This isn’t a gimmick; it’s a bold move that transforms community members into active promoters with a tangible stake in the project’s growth. Is there a better way to amplify word-of-mouth than to incentivize it? This is how Arctic Pablo Coin turns holders into advocates. Every share, every signup, every conversion feeds directly into your wallet with APC rewards. In a landscape where attention equals value, this feature drives both. Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the Top meme coins in June 2025 , and this community-powered model is a significant reason. Arctic Pablo Coin – Explore the Excitement Around the Polar Port Presale Presales come and go—but not like this. Arctic Pablo Coin doesn’t follow traditional “stages.” Instead, it journeys through arctic-themed locations, making every meme coin presale phase a story. Currently docked at Polar Port, Arctic Pablo Coin is priced at just $0.00023, with over $2.66 million raised. The buzz is deafening—and rightly so. What does this mean for early investors? The potential is enormous. The projected launch price is $0.008, representing a 3,378.26% ROI from this 25th “location.” A $1,000 investment today translates into 4,347,830 APCs, and once listed, that could soar to $34,782.64. The window is open—but not for long. The price climbs as Arctic Pablo Coin “travels” to its following location. Hesitation could mean losing out on one of the year’s most thrilling crypto opportunities. Remember, Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the Top meme coins in June 2025; the numbers prove it. 2. Dogs Coin – Barking Up the Right Blockchain With meme power and community-driven energy, Dogs Coin has carved out its niche among newer crypto projects. Born from a vibrant internet culture and backed by strong social media campaigns, this token taps into the viral DNA that made meme coins famous. The team behind Dogs Coin continues to foster community engagement through giveaways and gamified staking platforms, encouraging active participation. Is Dogs Coin just another dog-themed clone? Not quite. Its development roadmap includes NFT integrations and a decentralized exchange partnership, adding functional layers beyond the meme. This blend of utility and fun keeps investors sniffing around for more. Its ability to stay relevant with real features puts Dogs Coin on this list. 3. Fartboy – Absurd, Audacious, and Astoundingly Profitable What happens when humor meets tokenomics? You get Fartboy, the unapologetically ridiculous meme coin—and that’s precisely its strength. Fartboy launched with a satirical tone, poking fun at crypto clichés, yet quickly amassed a devoted following. It’s so outrageous that it works. Is there real value behind the meme? Surprisingly, yes. Fartboy incorporates a deflationary supply model with regular token burns, keeping scarcity intact. Plus, its community is actively involved in charitable campaigns and quirky merchandise drops. Fartboy’s audacious branding and clear-cut mechanics deliver in a space where identity drives demand. That’s why Fartboy deserves a spot in this meme coin roundup. 4. Dogecoin – The Original Meme Giant Still Stands Tall No meme coin list is complete without Dogecoin, the movement’s originator. Born as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin has transcended its beginnings to become a mainstay in digital culture. Fueled by celebrity endorsements, especially from Elon Musk, and a massive community, Dogecoin is now more than a meme—it’s a movement. But is Dogecoin still relevant? Absolutely. Dozens of merchants worldwide accept it, showing remarkable resilience during bear markets. Its long-standing reputation, liquidity, and continued updates keep it in the spotlight, which lands Dogecoin back on this year’s must-watch list. Summary: Arctic Pablo Coin – The Presale Opportunity That Shouldn’t Be Missed Based on the latest research, Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the Top meme coins in June 2025, alongside Dogs Coin, Fartboy, and Dogecoin. Yet among them, Arctic Pablo Coin commands the spotlight. Why? Because its innovative presale system, eye-watering ROI potential, and referral-driven community engine all converge to create the perfect storm of opportunity. Don’t wait for Arctic Pablo Coin to hit mainstream exchanges. Once the presale journey exits Polar Port, price points rise. The urgency is real—the clock is ticking. Secure entry now at $0.00023 and ride the wave to $0.008. The numbers don’t lie: $1,000 becomes nearly $35K at listing. This is the meme coin narrative investors dream about. Arctic Pablo Coin is one of the Top meme coins in June 2025, and this presale could define a financial breakthrough for early adopters. For More Information: Arctic Pablo Coin: https://www.arcticpablo.com/ Telegram: https://t.me/ArcticPabloOfficial Twitter: https://x.com/arcticpabloHQ FAQs What makes Arctic Pablo Coin different from other meme coins? Arctic Pablo Coin integrates a location-based presale, referral rewards, and a unique community-building system, setting it apart from traditional meme coin models. How can someone earn rewards from Arctic Pablo Coin? Users earn APC tokens by participating in its referral incentive program, which helps spread awareness and attract new users. Is Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale a limited-time offer? Yes. Each location in the presale journey has a limited supply and fixed price, increasing with each phase. Missing Polar Port means missing the $0.00023 price. How does Arctic Pablo Coin compare to Dogecoin regarding ROI potential? While Dogecoin offers stability, Arctic Pablo Coin’s early presale stage provides a significantly higher ROI, especially for early backers entering now. Can someone still invest in Arctic Pablo Coin today? Yes, but the Polar Port presale phase will be live for a limited time. Investors are urged to act fast before the next price jump occurs.

Specifically, Master Ananda’s analysis shows that the $100,000 to $103,000 range now serves as Bitcoin’s key support. If this level fails, traders should brace for a red week followed by sideways consolidation before any meaningful recovery, according to a May 31 post on TradingView. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: TradingView Ananda noted that Bitcoin has already dipped into this zone, and the market is watching closely to see if it will hold or break under pressure. His analysis emphasized the critical nature of this range. Bitcoin recently reversed from highs near $112,000, pulling back to test support. If the level breaks, a deeper correction could follow, with downside targets near $88,000, a key Fibonacci retracement level. However, if support holds, the analyst expects a sharp rebound that could push Bitcoin to new highs above $130,000. “Between $100,000 and $103,000. If this level breaks, prepare to see Bitcoin producing another week red then consolidation, on and on, before the next high,” he said. While the short-term outlook is uncertain, Ananda remains bullish in the long run. He pointed out that retracements are typical and healthy in any uptrend. He also suggested the current pullback may offer a rare buying opportunity for those who missed earlier entries. Bitcoin’s price next key target This analysis comes as Bitcoin attempts to reclaim the $105,000 support zone , which could anchor a move to new highs. Despite the recent pullback, Bitcoin ended May with its highest monthly close on record. Looking ahead, market analysts believe Bitcoin could resume its bullish trend and target new highs above $120,000. In a June 1 post on X, Pseudonymous analyst Mags noted that Bitcoin is completing a bullish “cup and handle” breakout pattern, with a potential target of $125,000. Bitcoin price analysis chart. Source: Mags The pattern is a continuation setup where an asset forms a rounded bottom (“cup”) followed by a consolidation (“handle”). A breakout above the resistance neckline often leads to a rally roughly equal to the depth of the cup. This supports the view that Bitcoin’s breakout from the $65,000 to $70,000 resistance channel has laid the groundwork for further gains. Following the breakout, Bitcoin has already crossed the $100,000 threshold and continues to push higher. Bitcoin price analysis At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $104,009, up 0.5% over the past 24 hours, though down 5.5% on the week. Bitcoin price analysis chart.

The defendants range in age from 16 to 23 and were accused of belonging to a larger ring that preyed on individuals in the crypto world and their families. Failed Abductions and High-Profile Targets The investigation centers on a foiled May 13 kidnapping in the 11th arrondissement of Paris. Targets were the grandson and daughter of Paymium crypto exchange founder Pierre Noizat. Video online showed the masked kidnappers physically beating up Noizat’s family with minor injuries. The same was attempted the previous day, and another one was also thwarted near Nantes days later. Suspects in Custody, but Masterminds Unidentified Out of the 25 suspects, 18 are detained pre-trially, four are under judicial control, and three are awaiting hearings. Police officials report the suspects had diversified backgrounds such as in regions of France, Senegal, Angola, and Russia. Lawyers representing the suspects report most of them were youthful and driven by money offers. Despite arresting the low-level coordinators and operatives, the masterminds remain unknown, and the authorities worry about future threats. Ruling of Crypto-Related Offenses across France These abductions are not a new phenomenon. Earlier this year, Ledger co-founder David Balland and his co-worker were abducted. May 1st saw a father of a crypto millionaire kidnapped—an incident blamed on the recent assaults. Recovery efforts, nevertheless, rolled into action quickly. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau sat with the leaders in the crypto space to bolster security . Measures now include home security checks and greater police collaboration with crypto firms. Insurance Companies and Security Firms Step In The physical risk of possessing digital assets has driven interest in protection. Insurers are now developing kidnap and ransom (K&R) policies for crypto holders.

As excitement grows around established players like Dogecoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , are being watched closely for exponential growth potential as the 2025 altcoin season approaches. The presale of Mutuum Finance is now in phase 5 after selling out the fourth one. Over $9.7 million has been raised, attracting more than 11,500 holders. Investors are piling in at $0.03 before the price jumps 16.67% to $0.035. Those buying today are set for a 100% ROI when the project finally launches at $0.06. Dogecoin (DOGE) Eyes $50B Market Cap Amid Bullish Patterns Dogecoin (DOGE) stands at $0.22 having dropped marginally by some 0.04% over the last 24 hours. Despite this marginal decline DOGE boasts an impressive market capitalization of approximately $32.7 billion and is the 8th largest market-capitalized cryptocurrency. Technicians have noted a strong bullish trend on DOGE’s higher timeframes that can push its price to $12 representing a market capitalization of around $1.79 trillion. The same is also identified by a recent 4% intraweek recovery from an intraweek low of $0.219, as an indication of strength against market uncertainty. While DOGE continues to display good fundamentals, new coins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is exchanging hands at under $0.03, are also making waves as they promise greater returns. Mutuum Finance Presale Surges as Investor Interest Grows A two-way lending model has made Mutuum Finance go viral in 2025. More than 11,500 investors have invested $9.7 million in the presale. MUTM token will cost $0.035 in Phase 6 which means its price is set to appreciate by 16.67%. That presents investors with an opportunity for high returns. Through both market demand and strong lending approaches, MUTM is an intriguing DeFi project that could be worth $6 after launch. Mutuum Finance’s Lending Platform Gains Trust as Certik Audit Wraps Up The Mutuum system brings together both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. With P2C, individuals can gain rewards from USDT pools and automated smart contracts and P2P gives them full power to handle direct cryptocurrency payments. Because of these factors, trading in DeFi has become safer, more convenient and more attractive for high-yield investors. Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network. Its overcollateralized design will ensure price stability, avoiding the collapse risks that have affected algorithmic stablecoins. The platform is powered by open-source smart contracts that have been audited and certified safe by Certik, providing a strong foundation for user trust. Dogecoin (DOGE) and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are both poised for significant market cap growth heading into 2025, with each offering unique opportunities for investors. DOGE, currently valued at $32.7 billion, continues to demonstrate resilience and bullish technical indicators, potentially setting the stage for a run toward a $50 billion—or even $1 trillion—market cap in the next bull cycle. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance is emerging as a high-upside alternative, combining DeFi innovation with rapidly growing investor interest. With over $9.7 million raised and more than 11,500 investors onboard, the project’s hybrid lending model, secure Certik-audited contracts, and upcoming USD-backed stablecoin are creating strong momentum. Priced at just $0.03 in presale with a 100% ROI expected at listing, and long-term projections as high as $6, MUTM could be one of the biggest breakout tokens of 2025. Act now and join the presale before the next phase price increase.

Mirroring the improving crypto market sentiment, the price of TRX maintained a level of stability in its bullish momentum throughout the month of May as it slowly ascended to a local high above $0.28. However, the slow-and-steady growth of the cryptocurrency was met with a significant obstacle over the past week, reflecting what seems to be a return of bearish sentiment in the altcoin market. Here’s a look at the possible reason why the Tron price might be struggling at the moment. Tron Sellers Gain Traction: Spot CVD Data In a Quicktake post on the CryptoQuant platform, on-chain analyst Burak Kesmeci published data from his analysis, pegging Tron’s dip in value to as high as 5.48% in 48 hours. Kesmeci’s analysis revolved around the Spot Taker CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta, 90-Day) metric, which tracks by volume the net difference between market buys (Taker Buy) and market sells (Taker Sell) over a period of 90 days. Related Reading: XRP Set For Price Relief, But Only If Bulls Defend Key $2.13 Price Level – Details According to the crypto pundit, a positive and rising value of the CVD metric indicates a higher Taker Buy volume and the dominance of buyers in the market. On the flip side, a negative or dropping value of the on-chain indicator reflects a higher Taker Sell volume and suggests that sellers are overwhelming the market. Data from Kesmeci’s publication shows how the market devolved from being dominated by the buyers to being bearish. The chart below shows a transition from green bars (Taker Buy Dominant) to red bars (Taker Sell Dominant). The shift from buys to sells became evident from around May 22nd and has since intensified, leading to a steady decline in the price of Tron. However, the Cumulative Volume Delta (marked in gray) has shown neutral on-chain action over the last few days. Caution In The Market Warranted Kesmeci, in his conclusion, stated that if this negative CVD trend were to continue, it could signal further correction in Tron’s price. The relatively neutral state of current on-chain activity, though, suggests that investors’ uncertainty about the future trajectory of the cryptocurrency.

Analyst Reveals End-Of-Year Prediction However, investors should still pay rapt attention as a further increase in sell pressure could heighten volatility and, consequently, lead to liquidations. As of press time, Tron trades at $0.2656, reflecting a price rise of approximately 1% in 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the TRX token is down by more than 1% in the past seven days.

Different predictions have popped up online, and while some are overly bold, others seem within reach. Let’s break down what AI models are saying about XRP’s future price. Where XRP Stands Right Now At the moment, XRP is trading around $2.15. It’s come a long way from its earlier prices but is still far from the huge numbers some holders are hoping for. The coin has faced a tough battle with US regulators, but it’s still one of the major names in crypto, especially for international money transfers. Some Say XRP Could Reach $22 by 2040 Analyst Cheeky Crypto made an analysis and one prediction puts XRP at $22 by the year 2040. The idea is that once the legal issues are sorted out, and if more banks and businesses start using XRP for faster, cheaper international payments, the price could climb steadily. If this happens: To have $500,000 by 2040, you’d need around 22,727 XRP today, which would cost about $53,000 at current prices. If your goal is $1 million, you’d need 45,454 XRP, costing roughly $106,800 now. Others Predict an Even Bigger Jump to $150 Some very bullish predictions by Goggle Gemini suggest that XRP could reach $150 by 2040. This would only happen if the coin became widely used for global money transfers and its demand skyrocketed. In that case: You’d only need 3,333 XRP to have $500,000 Or 6,667 XRP to hit $1 million This would be a dream come true for early investors — but it’s a bold prediction, and no one can say for sure if it will happen. The Truth Is Probably Somewhere in Between While $22 seems more reasonable and possible if the market grows and XRP overcomes its challenges, $150 would require the perfect mix of massive adoption and strong market demand. The real price might land somewhere in between those two numbers.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-01 11:30:54

Still, activity on the dominant crypto options exchange, Deribit, suggests that bulls aren't ready to back down yet. The payments-focused cryptocurrency formed a ""doji"" with a long upper shadow in May, a classic sign of indecision in the market, according to charting platform TradingView. The long upper wick suggests that bulls pushed prices higher to $2.65, but bears stepped in and rejected those levels, driving prices down to near the level seen at the start of the month. The appearance of the doji suggests the recovery rally from the early April lows near $1.60 has likely run out of steam. Doji candles appearing after uptrends often prompt technical analysts to call for bull exhaustion and a potential turn lower. Accordingly, last week, some traders purchased the $ 2.40 strike put option expiring on May 30. A put option offers insurance against price drops. Bullish options open interest The overall picture remains bullish, with options open interest concentrated in higher-strike calls in a sign of persistent positive sentiment. Open interest refers to the number of active contracts at a given time. A call option gives the purchaser an asymmetric upside exposure to the underlying asset, in this case, XRP, representing a bullish bet. ""XRP open interest on Deribit is steadily increasing, with the highest concentration of strikes clustered on the upside between $2.60 and $3.0+, reflecting a notably bullish sentiment while the spot price currently trades at $2.16,"" Luuk Strijers, CEO of Deribit, told CoinDesk. The chart shows that the $4 call option is the most popular, with a notional open interest of $5.39 million. Calls at the $3 and $3.10 strikes have an open interest (OI) of over $5 million each. Notional open interest refers to the dollar value of the number of active contracts. ""XRP option open interest is split across June and September expiries, with monthly notional volumes approximating $65–$70 million, of which over 95% is traded on Deribit,"" Strijers said. The bullish mood likely stems from XRP's positioning as a cross-border payments solution and mounting expectations of a spot XRP ETF listing in the U.S. Furthermore, the cryptocurrency is gaining traction as a corporate treasury asset. Ripple, which uses XRP to facilitate cross-border transactions, recently highlighted its potential to address inefficiencies in SWIFT-based cross-border payments. The B2B cross-border payments market is projected to increase to $50 trillion by 2031, up 58% from $31.6 trillion in 2024.",Markets|XRP|Ripple|Markets|Deribit|Options|News,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/5/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-06-01 11:36:52

Its price is stuck at the same level where it began the year, underperforming Bitcoin, which has risen 15% in 2025. Ripple ( XRP ) price was trading at $2.140 on Sunday as its volume and futures open interest remained under pressure. This article highlights the top four reasons it may jump by 50% and retest the year-to-date high of $3.4 in June.

Approval would likely help boost the XRP price because of the expected inflows from Wall Street investors. JPMorgan analysts estimate the fund would attract over $8 billion in funds in the first year. However, the likely scenario is that the SEC delays the approval again, possibly until October. Polymarket traders place the odds of approval by July 31 at 21%, and by the end of the year at 83% . Crypto traders are pricing an eventual XRP price breakout in the coming weeks. The eight-hour funding rate has remained in the positive zone in the past few weeks. A positive funding rate is essential data in perpetual futures, meaning traders anticipate the price to be higher. As we wrote here , there are signs that Bitcoin will make a bullish breakout. We cited the bullish forecasts by top analysts and the fact that it is forming the handle section of the cup-and-handle pattern. This pattern points to an eventual Bitcoin surge to $143,000. A Bitcoin price breakout will likely push other cryptocurrencies, including XRP, higher. The final reason the Ripple price may break out and surge to $3.4 is its strong technicals. See below. XRP funding rate | Source: CoinGlass XRP technicals The accumulation and distribution indicators point to increased accumulation. This means that XRP may now be in the accumulation phase of the Wyckoff Theory. It will move to the markup, which has higher demand than supply. XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The XRP price has remained slightly above the 200-day moving average. It has also formed a giant bullish pennant pattern, comprising a vertical line and a triangle. A pennant often leads to a strong bullish breakout. XRP has also formed an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. As such, a breakout will see it retest the resistance at $3.3842, up almost 50% from the current level.

The items, sold exclusively via the Bitcoin-only marketplace Scarce City, offered collectors a chance to own a piece of crypto history, just months after Ulbricht was pardoned by former U.S. President Donald Trump. The auction, which included both personal effects from before Ulbricht’s 2013 arrest and memorabilia from his time behind bars, attracted strong interest from the crypto community. Items ranged from a well-worn sleeping bag and backpack to prison clothing, artwork, and even his final prison-issued ID card . “I’ve left Arizona, the state where I was in prison. It’s time to travel. That means downsizing and turning the page,” Ulbricht wrote on the auction page. “I don’t need the reminders and I’m sure some of you will love to have them.” ID Card Sells for Over $1 Million Among the most coveted items was Ulbricht’s final prison ID card, which sold for an astonishing 11 BTC — over $1.1 million at current prices. “The guard tried to get me to stop smiling for the photo, but my joy comes from within,” Ulbricht remarked in a personal note. “So I smiled that day, even though I was in prison.” Another standout was a painting co-created by Ulbricht and a fellow inmate known as “Omega,” which fetched 1.01 BTC. Ulbricht described the piece as a symbol of hope: “It gave me the feeling that, if I could pass through it, something better would be on the other side.” The auction was structured to ensure fairness, requiring a 1% collateral deposit from bidders and a resettable countdown to deter last-minute bid sniping. All payments must be finalized by June 2, with Bitcoin preferred, although small PayPal payments were accepted. Ulbricht Dormant Bitcoin Holdings Beyond the auction, Ulbricht could potentially regain access to millions in dormant Bitcoin. According to Coinbase’s Conor Grogan, about 430 BTC — currently worth around $47 million — remain untouched in wallets tied to Ulbricht that were never seized. Blockchain firm Arkham Intelligence confirmed the findings, identifying 14 such wallets . One of them alone holds over $9 million in BTC. These funds have been inactive for more than 13 years, stirring speculation about their future use following Ulbricht’s release.

Woo tells his 1.2 million followers on the social media platform X that BTC has until Monday to avoid printing a bearish divergence on the weekly chart. A bearish divergence happens when price makes higher highs, while an indicator like the relative strength index (RSI) makes lower highs, suggesting that an asset is losing bullish momentum. Says Woo, “Dear Mr Bitcoin, you have [until Monday] to rally or you’re gonna print a bearish divergence on weekly charts and then we will be bored for weeks and weeks.” Source: Willy Woo/X Using proprietary data from his Bitcoin analysis firm, the Bitcoin Vector, Woo says that BTC appears to be strong, but may be “equalizing” itself after rallying faster than usual in previous months. “Our Bitcoin Vector framework remains strong despite the pullback. What’s happening is technical resistance in the form of a bearish divergence playing out against strong fundamentals. Basically, BTC ran up faster than normal and is equalizing.” Source: Willy Woo/X While many traders are still betting on the traditional halving-based four-year cycles, Woo says BTC is becoming more linked to external macro forces, and that predictable, cyclical price patterns are now a thing of the past. “BTC is global macro this cycle. Which means don’t necessarily bet on nicely manicured four-year cycles. BTC is transitioning.

It seems like every few days, there’s news about another business joining the growing list of Bitcoin investors. One of the first big names in this space was MicroStrategy, led by its CEO, Michael Saylor. Years ago, the company began buying Bitcoin, and since then, its stock price has jumped by an incredible 3,000%. Saylor has said he believes other companies will have no choice but to follow, especially as Bitcoin prices keep rising. Why Are More Companies Buying Bitcoin? As explained by an analyst, it’s simple: when a few companies start buying Bitcoin and their stock prices rise, other businesses take notice. Soon, more companies feel pressured to join in, which pushes Bitcoin’s price even higher. As the price rises, it becomes more expensive for new buyers to enter the market, which creates a rush to buy before prices climb further. New Player From Indonesia A company called DigiAsia from Indonesia has just announced its plans to buy $100 million worth of Bitcoin. While it’s not as big as MicroStrategy’s investments, it’s still a huge amount. What’s more surprising is that DigiAsia plans to use 50% of its future profits to keep buying Bitcoin. This shows they’re serious about making cryptocurrency a key part of their financial strategy. More Big Numbers from Other Companies Another company called MetaPlanet has also been making headlines. They want to build a Bitcoin reserve of 10,000 Bitcoins by the end of this year, and 21,000 by the end of next year. Recently, they revealed they’ve already collected over 6,700 Bitcoins — much faster than expected. The big question now is: with Bitcoin’s price expected to rise to around $370,000 to $500,000 by the end of this year, will these companies still be willing to buy more at such high prices? And what will happen if Bitcoin hits $2.4 million by 2029 or 2030, as some predictions suggest? What Does This Mean for Regular Bitcoin Holders? Every time a company buys thousands of Bitcoins, it reduces the number of coins available for everyone else. Some experts have said that one day, even millionaires and billionaires won’t be able to buy a full Bitcoin because so many have been taken off the market by big companies. There’s an old idea in the crypto world that owning just 0.28 Bitcoin would put you in the top 1% of Bitcoin holders. Back then, people thought it was a small number. But with companies grabbing up huge amounts of Bitcoin, that 0.28 BTC is starting to look a lot more valuable. In Short More and more companies are buying Bitcoin as a long-term investment. As these businesses keep adding to their Bitcoin reserves, it could drive prices up and make it harder for others to buy in the future. And if Bitcoin reaches the price levels some experts predict, it’ll make the small amounts of Bitcoin owned by regular investors even more valuable.",News|Bitcoin|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|FIAT|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-01 11:46:43

Lazarus Group has been notorious for targeting the crypto sector , employing all sorts of tricks and tactics to steal funds from unsuspecting crypto holders. The hackers have targeted various exchanges, including Phemex and Bybit . They even approached a BitMEX employee, offering a phony project to disguise a phishing attempt to install malicious software on the employee’s device. But now BitMEX is fighting back, taking a deep dive into the malicious code used by the hacking group. BitMEX has discovered serious vulnerabilities that exchanges can exploit to protect their assets, including exposure of the group’s tracking databases and origin IP addresses. BitMEX can track its operational hours and isolate actors pivotal to the hacking group’s operations. BitMEX has identified different tiers for hackers, with amateur hackers assigned to phishing tasks and highly skilled hackers assigned to post-exploitation procedures. The BitMEX blog post outlined various measures to be implemented to detect security breaches in real time, including an internal monitoring system to detect infections. BitMEX has taken a sudden interest in cybersecurity because a Lazarus Group member contacted a BitMEX employee on LinkedIn, offering a proposal to join a fake NFT project. BitMEX was not impressed by the brazen phishing attempt and decided to investigate the matter. BitMEX now had a chance to analyse live Lazarus code because the hacker gave them a link to a next.js / React project on GitHub. The team quickly discovered that the code was designed to entice employees to run malicious code on their systems. A Lazarus Supabase was discovered by BitMEX researchers, uncovering data relating to the malware, including username, hostname, operating system, geolocation, timestamp, and IP address. BitMEX was able to classify various devices as either a developer or test machine due to the frequency of operation. Many of the developers were using VPNs to obfuscate their location. However, one developer slipped up at one stage, revealing the actual IP address of the machine, which is located in Jiaxing, China, and uses a China Mobile IP address. BitMEX believes this was a major operational failure and could reveal the hacker’s identity. The Supabase also revealed which VPN services the hackers were using. BitMEX then developed a script to analyse the Supabase and search for operational mistakes automatically. After all, even hackers make mistakes, which can be highly costly for them. BitMEX found that Lazarus activity dropped between 8 am and 1 pm UTC, equivalent to 5 pm and 10 pm Pyongyang time. Such a structured schedule suggests the attackers are following an organised work schedule. According to BitMEX developers, hackers have various technical abilities and reside in a hierarchy of operations. The BitMEX developers could exploit such a detail by searching for mistakes made by novice hackers. BitMEX developers noticed that one hacker had attempted to reuse a program named ‘BeaverTail’ but implemented it incorrectly, nearly exposing a personal IP address. Therefore, BitMEX was able to enhance its security by first categorising attack victims so that it could detect operational mistakes made by novice hackers. JavaScript deobfuscation significantly impacted BitMEX developers because the Lazarus Group relied heavily on obfuscated code. The BitMEX blog commented that the developers had a lot of fun uncovering the obfuscated code because they could utilize various creative methods to find the malware. They used the tool Webcrack to rename JavaScript variables with human-readable text. Webcrack has a symbol renaming function that assists with the deobfuscation process. The BitMEX team had deobfuscated previous malware and was prepared for the task ahead. They could store various procedures so that the process could be done quickly. However, the developers noticed that the code had a new function connected to a Supabase database and added details about the victim’s machine. The Supabase allowed the attackers to create a database on the fly without needing an API layer. BitMEX developers knew programmers often do not secure such a database with authentication. They could access the Supabase and perform more analysis about the attackers.",Cryptocurrency|News|Cryptocurrency News|North Korea,EN,0,0,ASIA|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-01 12:06:16

Cardano’s ADA , the 9th largest cryptocurrency by market cap, has recently recorded a massive jump in trading volume, particularly across the Japanese market. Japan has notably driven a surge in ADA’s trading volume over the past week, resulting in a spike in trading volume for ADA/JPY pairs. These pairs emerged as the pairs with the second-highest volume recorded globally over the last 48 hours. The new development suggests increased demand for the ADA altcoin among Japanese traders and investors. Interestingly, it comes as the global cryptocurrency market prepares for the highly anticipated altcoin season. According to a report from Taptools, a Cardano trading and tracking platform, the recent surge in trading volume points to structural advancement in Japan’s broader cryptocurrency and finance industry. The Japanese market appears to be opening its doors to the ADA token as liquidity levels continue to soar. “Volume doesn’t spike in isolation. It follows infrastructure, regulation, and readiness. Japan’s appetite for ADA is rising—because the rails are already in place. Liquidity always finds maturity. Cardano’s built for it.” The report read. It bears mentioning that ADA remains attractive to a larger investor base outside Japan. Taptools revealed that more than 24,000 new ADA wallets were created in May. The current trend hints at an influx in new ADA holders flocking into the market, as well as long-standing ADA holders adding to their already existing investments. At press time, ADA is trading for $0.66 per coin. Although the asset is far from retesting its previous all-time high of 0.73%, it has closed the month on a decent note despite its close competitors nursing mild losses.",Cryptocurrency|News|ADA|Cardano|Japan,EN,0,0,ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-01 12:11:31

According to reports, the partnership has birthed a digital platform for its fans called PSG World. The launch of the PSG World platform was announced earlier, with the platform going live just before the UEFA Champions League final, where its men’s team came out victorious in a 5-0 victory over Italian side Internazionale. According to the club, the latest initiative is a push forward in its strategy to strengthen the relationship between its fans across the world. The platform was also designed to act as a forum for members. PSG launches new platform to strengthen fan relationships According to the football club, the platform will provide a home for its supporters to share their pre-match and post-match thoughts, acting as a commentary center for the fans. Users will also be able to co-create content, access exclusive media, and build global connections around their football club. Speaking at the Bitcoin Conference in 2025, Pär Helgosson, Head of PSG Labs, discussed the vision of the French club for PSG World. The discussion also involved other prominent members of the crypto community, including the founder and CEO of Roundtable, James Heckman, and Managing Partner at Blockchain Founders Fund, Aly Madhavji. “As we look ahead, our mission is to deepen our connection with fans — not just in France, but around the world,” Pär Helgosson said. “And that means meeting them where they are, online, on-chain, and in their culture.” Helgosson also added that one of the issues of today is that clubs don’t try enough to own their audience data, and PSG is planning to fix it with the new platform. “We have all these fans running for us but they’re not always on our platforms,” he said. “The challenge is to build a direct channel — to capture more data, understand our fans better, and engage them in more relevant ways.” According to the club, the platform will be powered by RTB, a SaaS technology company providing full-stack, white-label community and infrastructure for brands, journalists, and creators. RTB’s vision fulfills the dream of premium brands by uniting them under a single Web3 SaaS platform. The architecture also offers an array of features, tools, and distribution assets, which are already being used by several partners. Helgosson says the club will tap its global reach Speaking alongside Madhavji, Helgosson discussed the scale of the club’s audience, noting that the club is as big in all parts of the world as they are in France, even bigger in some places. Heckman also added contact to the club’s global footprint, noting the number of players they have from diverse countries. “A team in Paris has stars from Argentina, Brazil, Italy, England, and Germany. When you claimed half a billion fans, it sounded ludicrous — but it’s actually true,” he said. Founded in 1970, PSG has grown into one of the most recognizable brands in world football. With its digital presence expanding, the club is prepared to unveil this new model of sports engagement. However, the strategy isn’t about just the reach, it is about building a meaningful and persistent relationship with its fans. The platform adds physical, digital, and blockchain-based tools to shape that interaction. “We dominated social, online today. And we also want to dominate in on-chain and all tokenized ways,” Helgosson said. “We want to engage our fan base across what we do offline, online today — and on-chain tomorrow.” Helgosson also mentioned that the club has taken some financial bets on Bitcoin, noting that it took some of its fiat reserves and allocated it into Bitcoin last year. He added that they are the largest club doing it globally. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Scaramucci most notably affirmed that bringing Initial public offerings (IPOs) on-chain is possible and allows non-traditional users affiliated with banks to purchase IPOs through their wallets. “You can actually crowdsource the public offering through the tokenization process.” He remarked. When asked about the state of institutional investors and their interest levels in Solana, he revealed that he was authoring a book on Solana titled “Solana Rising”. While interviewing Chief Technology Officers around Wall Street for the book, he revealed that Solana’s scale, functionality, affordability, and throughput position the network to become one of the principal rail systems. “If Bitcoin is the operating layer for money, Solana will be the operating layer for real-world assets, stocks, bonds, and tokenization.” He asserted. Speaking of skeptics, particularly Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, who maintains that he is not a fan of Bitcoin and has shown almost no interest in the broader crypto market, Scaramucci believes he will “come around.” He explains that Dimon, surrounded by Senator Elizabeth Warren, tasked with regulating the financial system, is understandably “towing the line.” He further credits the Trump administration for reshaping the system. Scaramucci conclusively disclosed that he and Michael Saylor are fixed on the process of assets transitioning into yield-bearing assets. “Solana certainly, you have the staking situation, but Solana is going to be a healthy enough operating system where you’re going to be able to lend your Solana out, go to a Goldman Sachs of crypto, like a Galaxy, post up your Solana. Sure, you’ll get your staking, but you will also be able to lend it out and get yield in addition to that.” He remarked.",Cryptocurrency|News|SOL|Solana,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-01 12:16:33

ChatGPT Weighs In,https://cryptopotato.com/why-is-ripples-xrp-price-stuck-chatgpt-weighs-in/,"TL;DR Bitcoin charted a new all-time high, and even Ethereum managed to post some impressive gains in the past month. However, Ripple’s cross-border token has failed to recapture any of its previous momentum. Here’s what ChatGPT thinks about the current situation and what might be the cause of it. Also, will there be a breakout soon? Current Price Landscape Numerous prominent crypto analysts have outlined in the past several weeks how important the support levels of $2.3 and $2 are for XRP’s future price movements. The former, though, has already been broken to the downside and many of them believe the asset is primed for another retracement toward the latter. Recall that the last time XRP slumped beneath $2 was in early April as the financial world braced for the impact of Trump’s growing and constant tariffs against essentially every country. Although the economic situation improved dramatically in the following two months and many cryptocurrencies, such as the aforementioned new BTC peak and ETH’s revival, marked impressive gains, XRP remained on the sidelines to some extent and was quickly stopped during its surge toward $2.6. It was (and still remains) confined in a descending pattern that has seen another 6.5% decline on a weekly scale. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView Why So? ChatGPT first listed the broader market conditions as one of the reasons behind XRP’s stagnation, but that sounds accurate only if we take into account the past week, in which many digital assets have turned red. However, XRP has been outperformed by ETH, BTC, and many, many alts, such as HYPE , on a monthly scale as well. The AI solution noted that investor sentiment and behavior have changed lately toward XRP, as the post-US election hype has evaporated. Now, even though Ripple essentially won its legal fight against the SEC, investors are “opting to sell during minor price increases rather than holding for long-term gains.” ChatGPT mentioned XRP’s tokenomics, in which a billion new coins are released monthly. According to its answer, this continues to add selling pressure for XRP and may hinder its progress. “This consistent increase in available tokens can suppress price growth, especially if demand doesn’t keep pace.” On the question of what could help XRP break out of its consolidation, the AI chatbot said it might take a significant change in investor behavior, such as whales going on a massive accumulation spree similar to the one at the end of 2024, as well as an overall improvement in the market. Additionally, big partnership or acquisitions can aso fuel a new rally. The post Why Is Ripple’s (XRP) Price Stuck?

While the predictions accommodate both bullish and bearish possibilities, price forecasts are going up to $200,000 as an attainable level in 2025. Identifying the factors validating this potential outcome, prominent analyst TradingShot first observed that the BTCUSD pair is experiencing the weakest bull cycle in history, which he believes is a “product of the Theory of Diminishing Returns (TDM).” Notably, the first market cycles appeared to have been more aggressive, with incoming gains hitting rooftop levels, as the market’s upside potential seemed larger in its beginning stages. The analyst revisited the 2025 to 2017 and 2019 to 2021 bull cycles, stating that these periods were in harmony with the traditional capital market. However, the market seems to be headed in a different direction now. “ The current Cycle (2023 – 2025), following the late February 2025 divergence, is now attempting to converge again with its strong rebound in the past 6 weeks. Being however within a Channel Up throughout the entirety of the Cycle, it appears that it will do so in a structured way and as the ( Theory of Diminishing Returns) TDM suggests, will offer weaker gains.” He asserted . He conclusively deduces the timing of the Cycle Top by referring to previous market cycles, projecting that this time, the bull cycle could reach the top between October, November, or December. At this time, the asset is supposed to have hit its peak, around the $150,000 to $200,000 price range.

Why the $0.03 contender may outperform Polygon’s run,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/01/mutm-or-matic-why-the-0-03-contender-may-outperform-polygons-run/,"In the growing universe of cryptocurrencies, investors often compare emerging projects with established giants to find the best opportunities. Polygon (MATIC) has been one of the standout success stories in recent years, soaring from mere cents to above $2.80 at its peak. Yet, a new contender, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , priced currently at just $0.03, is showing signs it will outperform Polygon’s impressive run—and do so in a fraction of the time. Lower price, faster growth potential Polygon built its reputation as a leading Layer 2 scaling solution, gaining massive adoption and fueling the growth of decentralized applications on Ethereum. While its price growth was remarkable, it took years for Polygon (MATIC) to reach its current valuation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), on the other hand, is entering the market with a much lower price point and a more agile, innovative business model. At $0.03 per token and with a total supply of 4 billion tokens, MUTM offers investors an accessible entry point with significant upside. With over 11,650 holders already onboard and around $9.70 million generated in liquidity during its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is growing quickly. This rapid wallet growth reflects strong interest from a diverse range of users eager to participate in its unique lending ecosystem. Unique lending pools attract diverse users One of the main drivers of Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s accelerated growth is its innovative lending model, which supports both peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. The P2C pools allow users to deposit assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Dai (DAI), and USDC to earn passive income, while borrowers can take loans against these pools with automated interest rates. The P2P feature takes this further by enabling direct lending and borrowing of tokens usually unavailable in typical DeFi pools, such as popular memecoins Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). This variety attracts a broad spectrum of users—those seeking stable yields and those interested in riskier, high-return tokens. The flexibility to borrow or lend memecoins alongside stablecoins positions Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as a versatile platform in the DeFi space, differentiating it from Polygon’s primarily Layer 2 scaling focus. Generating yield and passive income Investors holding MUTM tokens can benefit not only from capital appreciation but also from passive income. For example, depositing $1,000 in ETH or DAI within Mutuum’s liquidity pools generates an annual yield of around 8 to 12%, depending on pool utilization. This steady income complements the growth potential of the MUTM token itself, creating a dual source of return for holders. Consider an investor buying MUTM tokens at $0.03. A conservative 20x price increase would turn a $1,000 investment into $20,000. At 25x, the investment jumps to $25,000. More ambitious forecasts of 30x or 35x returns translate to $30,000 or $35,000, respectively. These confident projections showcase the power of early entry at Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s current price. CertiK audit and security confidence Security remains a major concern for DeFi investors. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has addressed this through a comprehensive CertiK audit that involved manual review and static analysis. Achieving a token scan score of 70, the audit was completed between February and May 2025, highlighting Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s commitment to safe and reliable smart contracts. This security certification boosts investor confidence and sets the stage for a smoother platform launch and adoption compared to many other projects without verified audits. According to the roadmap, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will launch a beta version of its platform, coinciding with the token’s public availability. Early access to lending, borrowing, and staking features allows the community to experience the protocol’s benefits firsthand. Beta releases often accelerate user growth and liquidity as investors and traders gain familiarity with the platform’s functionality. For MUTM, this milestone signals the beginning of full-scale operations and increased token utility. FOMO: why waiting will cost you Many investors who missed the early gains of Polygon (MATIC) now see the chance to join Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at the ground level. While Polygon took years to reach $2.80, MUTM’s unique DeFi utility and rapidly expanding user base will deliver similar or better returns much faster. The ongoing $100,000 giveaway adds an additional incentive for new users to get involved now. Combined with a growing community and solid liquidity, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is positioned to create significant demand for its token, driving prices upward. Early adopters in MUTM’s presale phases have already seen impressive profits, and the window for such returns narrows with every passing phase. Entering at $0.03 gives investors a prime chance to maximize upside before the token reaches wider market circulation. MUTM Token Utility: More Than Just Price Appreciation Those who stake mtTokens earned from lending receive passive dividends. These dividends come from a portion of the protocol’s revenue used to buy back and redistribute MUTM tokens to stakers. This cycle aligns token holder rewards with the overall success of the ecosystem, creating a sustainable growth loop that benefits long-term investors. Why Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out While Polygon (MATIC) remains a respected and proven project, Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s combination of low entry price, innovative lending models, diverse asset support, and strong security measures make it a compelling alternative. The project’s focus on generating passive income, supporting memecoin lending, and offering a beta launch within months sets it apart from many competitors. For investors seeking Polygon-like returns but on a faster timeline, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents a unique opportunity. The current $0.03 price is a strategic entry point to join a growing community and benefit from rapid development milestones. In the world of crypto, timing and innovation matter. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) combines both, giving investors a real shot at outperforming Polygon’s impressive run, potentially doubling that success in half the time.

Hyperliquid ( HYPE ) price soared to $39.92 on May 26, up by over 327% from its lowest point in April. This surge brought its market cap to over $10.9 billion and the fully diluted valuation to over $35 billion. Data sho ws that Hyperliquid had a cumulative volume of over $242 billion in May, much higher than other companies combined. Jupiter had $19.78 billion in volume, while Apex Protocol, APX Finance, and edgeX had less than $10 billion each. Hyperliquid’s volume in May was much higher than April’s $187 billion and March’s $175 billion. This growth means that Hyperliquid has processed tokens valued at over $1.6 trillion since its inception.

Hyperliquid now competes with top centralized exchanges like Binance, Bybit, and Bitget. It handled over $4 billion in assets in the last 24 hours, while the three centralized platforms handled $41.27 billion, $15 billion, and $14 billion. The soaring volume made Hyperliquid one of the most profitable players in the crypto industry. It made over $69 million in fees in May. That’s higher than Ethereum ( ETH ), Raydium ( RAY ), and BSC Chain, which made $40 million, $42 million, and $15 million, respectively. Hyperliquid’s volume rebounded as the crypto market bounced back, with Bitcoin soaring to a record high of $111,900, and the market cap of all coins crossing the $3.5 trillion market cap.

It formed a cup-and-handle pattern whose upper side was at $28.40. A C&H pattern is one of technical analysis’s most bullish continuation patterns. HYPE has pulled back as the crypto market crash continued. The most likely scenario is it drops and retests the upper side of the cup and then resumes the uptrend.

However, as the big bull continues its unwavering streak, alternative tokens fail to follow the asset’s direction. Ripple’s XRP , a leading altcoin, was one of many that failed to meet market expectations last week. Despite this, market analysts’ sentiments are firmly within bullish territory. Egrag Crypto, a prominent analyst in the X crypto space, has made an assertion validating multiple bullish possibilities for the asset. The analyst revisits XRP’s 2017 performance and explains that a breakout could be around the corner if the altcoin mimics historical patterns. “If XRP is repeating the last section or pattern from October 2017, we might be on the brink of a major breakout soon! Back in October 2017, XRP took roughly 63 days to explode and set a new all-time high, skyrocketing by an astonishing 1,772%!” He wrote. The analyst added that if XRP follows this pattern, the asset could reach the $27 mark in the next few months. He points to the 21-week EMA as a virtual support level and a last line of defense for the XRP. As such, remaining above the $2.30 price mark could sustain the bullish momentum. For the bullish breakout to occur, XRP bulls are expected to close above the Fib 1.414 level around the $2.70 price mark, which would be indicative of a strong bullish signal going forward. The ultimate target, however, is a break above the $3.00 high reached in February. The analyst remains convinced that this move could happen in the near term. “Cycle analysis: If we mirror October 2017’s duration, the peak might occur around July 21, 2025 — roughly two months from now! A cycle top in July suggests BTC may also challenge new ATHs within the next 40 days.” He concluded.",Cryptocurrency|News|Ripple|XRP News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|BTC|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-06-01 12:36:49

That sharp pang of regret from not acting sooner, watching others multiply their portfolios while you held back, is all too familiar. Near Protocol was once a hidden gem — and now it’s taken off, leaving cautious investors wishing they’d taken the plunge earlier. But before that regret settles in again, there’s a new name rising fast — Qubetics ($TICS) — and this one is still within reach. Qubetics is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects in 2025. Built on solid fundamentals and crafted with real-world blockchain utility, Qubetics isn’t just another coin — it’s a high-functioning ecosystem aiming to change how applications and smart contracts are built. With its presale currently active, the time to act is now. While Near has already made its move, Qubetics is offering that rare second chance to get in early on what many are already calling one of the best cryptos to buy this month. Qubetics: The Missed Beginnings, But Still Among the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month Many investors are already kicking themselves for missing Qubetics ’ earliest stages — when $TICS tokens were quietly launched in September 2024 at just $0.01. Since then, this top-tier presale has seen multiple rounds of growth, and prices have surged stage after stage. Still, hope isn’t lost. You’ve now landed at Stage 36, where $TICS is priced at $0.3064. Over 514 million tokens have been sold, with 27,300+ holders and more than $17.5 million raised. It’s a sign of growing traction and interest in this next-generation protocol. The good news? You’re not late — Qubetics is still one of the best cryptos to buy this month, with generous early-stage benefits still on offer. The tokenomics behind Qubetics are built for sustainability and accessibility. With 12.85% of the supply allocated for early participants, and each presale stage offering only a 7-day window with a 10% price increase, urgency is real. Investors are actively positioning themselves before the Q2 2025 mainnet launch, where expectations are sky-high. At current prices, investing $2,000 today would yield 6,528 tokens. If $TICS reaches just $6 post-launch, that’s a projected return of $40,800. At $10, the same investment would be worth over $65,000, and at $15 — an astonishing $97,920. With an ROI of up to 4,794.74%, this is undeniably a top crypto presale and truly one of the best cryptos to buy this month . Qubetics’ power doesn’t lie solely in token value — it’s about the infrastructure. At its core is the QubeQode IDE, a comprehensive, visual development environment that’s transforming blockchain integration. Whether you’re a fintech startup creating secure token-based payments, a healthcare provider setting up decentralized patient record systems, or an independent creator looking to tokenize content, QubeQode simplifies the process. Through its drag-and-drop components, intuitive form-based configuration, and a library of smart contract snippets, it offers real-world utility for enterprises and entrepreneurs alike. This is blockchain development redefined for productivity, accessibility, and scalability. Near Protocol: A Trail Already Blazed Near Protocol is a classic example of a project that quietly entered the market, built robust infrastructure, and then exploded in value — all while many watched from the sidelines. Launched in 2020 with an ICO price of just $0.40, Near quickly built a reputation for being a scalable, developer-friendly Layer 1 solution. Its Nightshade sharding and fast finality became game-changers, fueling the DeFi and NFT space with high throughput and low fees. As the broader market began to take notice, Near’s value skyrocketed, delivering massive returns to early adopters. The protocol reached its all-time high in 2022, registering staggering growth that left many investors in disbelief. From its humble ICO beginning, Near has grown into a major player in the blockchain space, forming partnerships, integrating new dApps, and constantly evolving its ecosystem. Today, it stands tall as a mature project with significant adoption and credibility — but the major gains have already been harvested. For those still chasing high potential returns, Near’s train may have left the station, making way for emerging competitors that still hold exponential upside. The Final Verdict: Don’t Miss Another One of the Best Cryptos to Buy This Month In a market where timing is everything, missing the rise of Near Protocol is a costly reminder of hesitation. Qubetics, however, is your next chance — and it’s ticking. Backed by real-world development tools like QubeQode, a robust presale structure, and massive ROI potential, it’s no wonder Qubetics is ranking high among the best cryptos to buy this month. With its mainnet launch around the corner, this opportunity won’t linger for long. The data is clear, the projections are compelling, and the early-stage value is still on the table. Whether you’re a new investor or a seasoned participant looking to diversify, now is the time to join this top crypto presale before it surges past affordability. The missed opportunities of the past don’t have to define your future — because Qubetics could very well be the one you don’t miss this time.

While 20 major hacks were recorded during the month, total losses amounted to around $244.1 million — a sharp 39.29% drop compared to April. The month’s total was heavily skewed by a single major incident involving the Cetus decentralized exchange , which accounted for roughly 90% of all stolen funds in May. The Cetus hack, which occurred on May 22, resulted in $223 million in losses within 24 hours, making it one of the most impactful exploits of the year so far. Hacks Highlight Ongoing Technical Vulnerabilities According to cybersecurity firm Dedaub, the Cetus exploit stemmed from a vulnerability in the most significant bits (MSB) check. This flaw allowed attackers to manipulate liquidity values, enabling them to establish disproportionately large positions with minimal effort. Despite the scale of the breach, there was a silver lining. PeckShield reported that $157 million of the stolen funds—about 71%—had already been frozen through joint efforts by the Cetus team and the Sui Network. These swift actions have been credited with limiting the long-term damage of the attack. The second-largest breach in May was a $12 million exploit targeting the Cork Protocol, where hackers stole around 3,761 Wrapped Staked Ether (wstETH) and swiftly converted it into Ether, according to the cybersecurity firm Cyvers. Other notable incidents included a suspected North Korean cyberattack that led to $5.2 million in losses, an MBU token exploit that cost $2.2 million, and a $1.2 million breach involving the MapleStory Universe. Industry Ramps Up Security Measures The drop in crypto theft during May comes amid a growing effort within the industry to counter sophisticated cybercriminals. BitMEX’s security team recently conducted a counter-operations probe against the Lazarus Group, a cybercrime organization reportedly linked to the North Korean government. The investigation exposed the group’s IP addresses, databases, and tracking tools. While May’s figures show progress, the overall trend in 2025 remains concerning. In Q1 alone, hackers stole more than $1.63 billion in digital assets, with February seeing a massive spike due to the Bybit exploit, which accounted for over 92% of losses that month. Still, the industry’s proactive response and increasing ability to recover stolen funds may signal a positive shift in the ongoing battle against crypto-related cybercrime.

The price has lost the 20/50/100 EMA cluster on the 4-hour chart and is now consolidating below the key resistance zone of $105,000–$106,000, a range that capped multiple bounces this week. The trendline support drawn from the early May breakout has also been breached, increasing caution among bulls. What’s Happening With Bitcoin’s Price? BTC price forecast (Source: TradingView) On the daily chart, Bitcoin price action reflects a weakening structure after facing repeated rejection near the 0.0 Fibonacci extension zone of $112,000. The recent retracement has pushed BTC back toward the 0.236 Fib level at $103,145, which is now being tested as near-term support.

At its current price of just $0.03 per token, a $500 investment in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) holds the power to grow into a portfolio worth $75,000 by the end of next year. This represents an impressive 150x return—an extraordinary milestone that rivals the biggest success stories in the crypto world but on a much faster timeline. The power of early entry and rapid growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is still in the early stages of its journey, with over 11,650 holders already participating and approximately $9.70 million raised in liquidity during the current presale phase. Unlike many projects priced higher and further along their growth curve, MUTM’s low price point allows investors to accumulate substantial token quantities. The difference between phase 1, where tokens were priced at $0.01, and the current phase 5 at $0.03 means early participants have already secured significant profits. This price progression highlights why jumping in now is critical, as later presale phases will gradually reduce profit margins. How passive income compounds your gains What makes Mutuum Finance (MUTM) truly stand out is not just the potential for price appreciation but its robust passive income mechanisms. The platform allows users to deposit popular cryptocurrencies like ETH and DAI into liquidity pools, generating steady interest based on real-time pool utilization. For example, lending assets in Mutuum’s pools can deliver annual yields between 8% and 12%. These returns compound over time, accelerating portfolio growth. Additionally, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers staking benefits through mtTokens, which represent a user’s share of deposited assets plus earned interest. Staking mtTokens makes holders eligible for passive dividends distributed from the protocol’s revenue, paid out in MUTM tokens. This creates a powerful earnings loop: investors benefit from token price growth and ongoing income rewards, reinforcing long-term value. P2C and P2P lending models: a competitive edge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) operates a dual lending model, combining peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) pools. The P2C pools allow anyone to lend and borrow common stablecoins or cryptocurrencies in a pooled environment with automated interest rates that adjust based on demand. However, P2P lending is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) gains a distinctive advantage. It enables users to lend and borrow tokens often unavailable on typical P2C platforms, including popular memecoins such as Pepe (PEPE), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Shiba Inu (SHIB). This flexibility attracts a broad user base—from conservative investors seeking stable yields to risk-tolerant traders looking for high returns on meme tokens. The diverse asset support strengthens liquidity and generates multiple income streams, ensuring steady protocol growth. CertiK audit: a mark of security and trust Security is paramount in DeFi, and Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has passed a rigorous CertiK audit that included manual code review and static analysis. With a token scan score of 70, this audit completed in May 2025 reassures investors that the platform’s smart contracts are secure, transparent, and reliable. This level of scrutiny differentiates Mutuum Finance (MUTM) from many newer projects still lacking formal security validation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gearing up for a beta launch of its platform coinciding with the public token availability. This beta release will enable users to access lending, borrowing, and staking functions, providing a hands-on experience of the ecosystem’s benefits. Historically, beta launches accelerate user adoption and liquidity inflows, creating upward pressure on token prices. Simultaneously, the ongoing $100,000 giveaway fuels excitement and community growth. These combined events create strong momentum for Mutuum Finance (MUTM), making it an unmissable opportunity for investors who want to get ahead before the market catches on. Confident investment examples Consider a $1,000 investment at Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s current $0.03 price. With a 15x gain, that investment grows to $15,000. At 20x, it becomes $20,000; 25x reaches $25,000; 30x climbs to $30,000; and a 35x return results in a $35,000 portfolio. Given Mutuum Finance (MUTM)’s growth trajectory, diverse utility, and upcoming milestones, these targets are not speculative—they reflect the platform’s realistic potential based on its market positioning. Tokens in early presale phases were sold at prices as low as $0.01, so early investors have already made substantial profits. The current phase 5 price of $0.03 is three times higher than the initial price, meaning the window to capture the most lucrative gains is narrowing fast. Future phases will push prices even higher, shrinking profit margins. Investors who delay joining Mutuum Finance (MUTM) risk missing the prime opportunity to multiply their capital. How lending and borrowing work Lenders deposit cryptocurrencies into Mutuum’s smart contracts, which pool these assets to fund over-collateralized loans. Borrowers provide collateral to access liquidity without selling their tokens, preserving ownership while meeting financial needs. Interest rates fluctuate dynamically, balancing supply and demand within the pools. This automated mechanism maintains healthy liquidity levels and sustainable returns. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a rare combination of low entry price, fast growth potential, and real utility through innovative lending pools and passive income. Backed by a solid CertiK audit and moving swiftly toward a beta release, the project is shedding hype and building a functional, secure platform. With over $9.70 million raised so far and a rapidly expanding community, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is on track to deliver remarkable gains. Investors who put $500 into MUTM now are positioned to build a $75,000 portfolio by the end of next year, benefiting from price growth, passive income, and staking rewards. The time to act is now—waiting for later presale phases will mean losing the chance for maximum profits and fast-tracked returns.

Many retail traders started doing the exact opposite of his recommendations, and the idea became so famous that an “Inverse Cramer ETF” was launched (it was later shut down, but the meme lives on). Now, crypto traders might have found their new ""Inverse Jim Cramer"" in James Wynn's trading wallet . ""The winning strategy lately? Do the opposite of James Wynn,"" s aid blockchain sleuth Lookonchain in an X post, pointing to a trader who has been making millions by doing exactly the opposite of James Wynn's trades. ""0x2258 has been counter-trading James Wynn—shorting when James Wynn goes long, and going long when James Wynn shorts. In the past week, 0x2258 has made ~$17M, while James Wynn has lost ~$98M,"" Lookonchain said in the post. Seventeen million dollars in a week just by inverse-betting on one trader is not a bad payday. However, this might be a short-term trade, and one should be very cautious as things can change lightning fast in the trading world, leaving punters millions in losses if not hedged properly. Even James Wynn said, ""I’ll run it back, I always do. And I’ll enjoy doing it. I like playing the game,” after the trader got fully liquidated over the weekend . So, maybe this Reddit gem : ""How much money would you have made if you did the exact opposite of Jim Cramer?"" would never translate to include James Wynn. But the sentiments, though, are loud and clear: in a market where perception is half the trade, even your PnL can get memed!

The highly anticipated initial public offering (IPO) will attract large crypto and traditional finance firms. This follows a thickening institutional plot in the crypto market, adding an extra layer of legitimacy for the high-flying assets. Big Firms Eye Circle’s IPO BlackRock is preparing to acquire part of Circle’s shares in its upcoming IPO, Bloomberg reported , citing sources familiar with the matter. Per a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing, Circle’s Chief Executive, Jeremy Allaire, plans to raise about $624 million in the IPO. The deal, which is expected on June 4, has recorded multiple orders for the shares available. The sources said the deal’s details are not finalized, and the $9 trillion asset manager could swoop in for a stake through another vehicle or opt out entirely. BlackRock and Circle are not strangers, as previous deals have already been struck. BlackRock manages a money market fund for Circle that backs the USDC stablecoin. The Fund now holds approximately $53.5 billion. USDC adoption is projected to build on gains in the past three quarters. Recent institutional developments in the United States, with its user base soaring, are tipped to favor the asset. Incoming stablecoin rules will also push its compliance in multiple jurisdictions. Circle initially filed for its IPO on April 1 but delayed due to rising economic concerns amid US tariff wars. The company has attracted big crypto firms like Ripple and Coinbase as users flock to its USDC stablecoin. Fortune reported informal sale talks with Coinbase and Ripple. However, Circle insisted it was not for sale following reports of a $4 billion bid deemed too low. According to the rebuttals, Circle remains committed to its long-term goals. Meanwhile, Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest is also preparing a $150 million swoop in Circle’s IPO. Community Expresses Optimism Over Soaring Adoption Digital asset traders remain thrilled as more institutional investors increase their exposure to the crypto market. According to experts, inflows have positioned assets for major upswings in Q2 2025. From investment in Bitcoin mining firms to stablecoin issuers, traditional players have raised the bar. Strategy, H100, and Addentax made recent Bitcoin acquisitions as the price closed at $110k.

Related Reading: Pepe Makes It To Trump’s Feed—Is A Crypto Endorsement Next? According to Keiser’s May 30 X post, Saylor kept buying Bitcoin through past market drops without selling, even when his holdings were underwater. He pointed out that Strategy’s imitators have yet to face a real bear market. Based on this, Keiser warned it might be unrealistic to assume these newer firms will stay steady if prices slide. Max Keiser Raises Doubts In a May 30 X post, Keiser wrote, “The Strategy clones have not been tested in a bear market. Saylor never sold and just kept buying, even when his BTC position was underwater. It is foolish to think the new Bitcoin Treasury Strategy clones will have the same discipline.” The @Strategy clones have not been tested in a bear market.@saylor never sold, and just kept buying, even when his BTC position was under water. It’s foolish to think the new Bitcoin Treasury @Strategy clones will have the same discipline. — Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) May 31, 2025 He had already compared Strategy to “the Bitcoin of BTC treasury plays,” implying that other firms will struggle to match that level of conviction. Short trades and quick flips have driven some copycats so far. Long holds in a downtrend? That’s a different story. Corporate Bitcoin Holdings Soar Companies are jumping on the Bitcoin treasury train at a rapid pace. Based on reports, dozens of businesses announced plans to follow Strategy’s lead in the first half of 2025. Some analysts now believe 50% or more of all crypto could soon sit on corporate balance sheets. Strive, the asset management firm led by former political candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, joined on May 7. Trump Media and Technology Group confirmed a $2.5 billion capital raise to buy Bitcoin on May 27. Each fresh announcement drives more copycats, which adds to both hype and risk in the space. Related Reading: No Room For Doubt: Analyst’s $900K BTC Forecast Follows Familiar Script Premium Prices Alarm Analysts Strategy’s stock rose to an all‐time high of $543 on November 21, and that jump inspired rival firms to list their own Bitcoin plans. Metaplanet, for example, trades at a Bitcoin premium of $600,000. That means investors are paying nearly six times more for exposure than if they bought Bitcoin directly. Based on reports, analysts argue such high premiums can’t last forever. If Bitcoin dips or demand for stock‐based exposure weakens, those markups could evaporate. Paying $600,000 extra per Bitcoin position today might look very different if prices fall tomorrow.

Local news outlet Le Monde shared the report, citing an announcement from the Paris public prosecutor’s office. According to previous reports, there has been an increase in the number of crypto-related kidnappings targeting prominent crypto personalities and their relatives since the beginning of the year in Paris. The prosecutor’s office mentioned that the suspects are between the ages of 16 and 23, with about six minors in the mix. The report mentioned that 18 suspects have now been placed in pre-trial detention, three have requested a deferred hearing, while four remain under judicial supervision. France charges 25 suspects in connection with crypto-related kidnappings According to the report, the investigation centers on the botched abduction attempt in Paris’ 11th arrondissement, which occurred on May 13. The targets were the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of the French cryptocurrency exchange Paymium. Although the assailants were able to escape after the failed attempt, they did enough to leave visible damage in their wake, with the husband of the target being hit on the head and eyewitnesses mentioning that blood was everywhere. Authorities mentioned that that was not the first crypto-related kidnapping attempt, with a similar failed attempt being staged the previous day, and the police foiling one some days later. The suspects, according to the report, were from diverse backgrounds, including individuals born in the Paris region, Châtellerault, Senegal, Angola, and Russia. According to the defense attorneys, most of the suspects were young, describing them as “young profiles lured by money and caught in a situation beyond their control.” The Paris case is not the first, as it is part of a rise in crypto-related kidnappings across the country this year. Several high-profile individuals have been affected by the ongoing menace, including Ledger co-founder David Balland and his partner. Another one occurred on May 1, which involved the father of a crypto millionaire in the city. The criminals were said to have carried out brutal attacks on the father, mutilating him to force his son to pay the ransom for his release. Investigators also say the case is linked to the current wave of attacks. French minister convenes urgent meeting, insurance companies to cover risks According to the police, while they have been able to apprehend some of the goons used in wreaking this havoc, the mastermind behind the operations remains unidentified. The incident has also drawn national attention, with France’s Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau meeting with crypto industry professionals to discuss protective measures. The ministry later released a memo mentioning enhanced cooperation between law enforcement and crypto firms, including home security checks conducted by the police and gendarmerie officers. Meanwhile, insurers are developing new protections aimed at the growing physical threat against their clients in the target demography. According to a report by NBC News, more than three firms specializing in crypto insurance and security are now preparing tailored kidnap and ransom (K&R) policies for cryptocurrency investors. At the same time, crypto executives and investors have been seeking personal security services for their protection. Cryptopolitan Academy: Want to grow your money in 2025?

As of press time, ZEC was trading at $51.67, up over 10% in the past 24 hours. Over the past month, Zcash has surged more than 40%, pushing its market capitalization to around $860 million, edging closer to the $1 billion milestone. ZEC one-day price chart. Source: CoinMarketCap While most major cryptocurrencies remain under pressure, Zcash’s rally is partly fueled by increased usage of its privacy features. A key metric supporting this momentum is the total shielded ZEC supply , which rose by 6,484 ZEC on June 1, bringing the total to 3,119,887 ZEC, worth approximately $161.6 million. That’s a $1.26 million increase in shielded transactions in just one day. Zcash total Shielded pool. Source: ZeroBits Shielded holdings are a core feature enabling private transactions on the Zcash network. It reflects a rising preference for censorship resistance amid potential surveillance and regulatory overreach debates. The broader privacy coin market cap now stands at $8.8 billion, up 1.3% in the last 24 hours. This contrasts with a crypto market where most assets remain in the red. Rising demand for privacy tokens Interestingly, Zcash’s rise comes despite mounting challenges. In April, ZEC was again included in a Binance delisting vote, raising concerns about the exchange’s stance on privacy coins. ZEC has faced multiple delisting threats across platforms and has even been subject to questionable voting practices, including alleged fraud, prompting pushback from the broader crypto community. Meanwhile, Monero ( XMR ), the top privacy coin, has also seen increased buying pressure , even after being delisted from major exchanges like Coinbase. Amid these headwinds, Monero continues to be the top choice for untraceable transactions, thanks to its advanced privacy technologies.

According to blockchain security firm PeckShield, this marks a 39.29% decrease from April’s figures. The month recorded roughly 20 major incidents, with coordinated recovery efforts successfully freezing some stolen assets. The most notable development involved the collaborative response between Sui ( SUI ) validators and Cetus Protocol following a massive $220 million exploit. Network participants managed to freeze $157 million of the stolen funds, a 71% recovery rate from the total theft amount. #PeckShieldAlert In May 2025, ~20 major crypto hacks were recorded, resulting in total losses of $244.1M—a 39.29% decrease from April.

According to blockchain security firm Dedaub, attackers exploited a vulnerability in the most significant bits check mechanism. This allowed them to manipulate liquidity parameters by substantial margins and establish disproportionately large positions with minimal effort. While hackers successfully looted $220 million from the protocol, approximately $63 million remains in the exploiter’s wallet, with the remainder frozen through validator coordination. The remaining top exploits of the month included Cork Protocol losing $12 million. A purported North Korean-affiliated strike that caused losses of $5.2 million came next. The MBU token suffered a $2.2 million exploit, while MapleStory Universe experienced a $1.2 million breach and rounded out the top five incidents. Despite the major absolute losses, May’s figures are an improvement over previous months in the context of 2025’s overall security losses. More than $1.63 billion worth of cryptocurrencies was stolen in the first quarter of this year. Additionally, PeckShield said that almost 92% of all losses at that time were caused by the Bybit vulnerability. January’s security incidents resulted in over $87 million in stolen cryptocurrency, while February experienced a surge to $1.53 billion. This was primarily driven by the massive Bybit attack that ranks among the largest crypto thefts in history.

The recent breakdown from a rising wedge structure and repeated rejections below key resistance zones suggest that bearish momentum continues to weigh on the short-term outlook. ETH is now testing a critical confluence support near $2,500, with a deeper slide on the cards if bulls fail to defend this floor. What’s Happening With Ethereum’s Price? ETH price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, Ethereum price action shows a clear shift in sentiment after the local top above $2,768. Price is now consistently closing below the 20/50 EMA cluster between $2,527 and $2,577, while the Bollinger Bands have started widening after a period of consolidation — a technical signal that often precedes elevated Ethereum price volatility.

45373710,https://invezz.com/?p=2742232,1748785200,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,DOGE loses momentum against utility-driven Mutuum Finance (MUTM),https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/01/doge-loses-momentum-against-utility-driven-mutuum-finance-mutm/,"Following a month of gains that saw Dogecoin (DOGE) rise over 20%, the upward momentum has cooled off as DeFi token Mutuum Finance (MUTM) shows signs of becoming a major gainer in 2025. One of the factors that is driving the optimism for MUTM is the $100,000 giveaway that is pulling in investors looking for utility-driven gains. How the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) ecosystem works Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is powered by non-custodial smart contracts. Once you deposit funds in a shared liquidity pool, you will receive mtTokens that represent your share in the pool, plus the accrued interest. Since all holdings are non-custodial, you retain full control of your assets, and the protocol cannot move or access your funds without your say-so. To withdraw your funds from the share pool, you can redeem the mtTokens, as well as any accrued interest. The amount of interest you stand to earn is based on the pool’s utilization rate. As pool usage rises, so will your returns. Besides the shared liquidity pools, MUTM supports a peer-to-peer mode, where users can lend directly to others. The earnings in the P2P mode can be quite high. However, the mode is built for high-volatility assets like the DOGE meme coin. Overall, the amount you earn is determined by demand for the asset, its volatility, and the chosen lending strategy. There are no minimum or maximum amounts to participate in the ecosystem. Thus, users can begin to grow their assets based on what they have available. However, small deposits might not be practical due to transaction fees. Additionally, the protocol’s internal stability factor could place a supply cap on some assets. These caps are designed to ensure the protocol’s long-term solvency, and users should check for limitations, especially when dealing in large amounts. A deep dive into mtTokens The mtTokens are a unique technological innovation on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). They are the tokenized representation of a user’s deposit in a liquidity pool. For instance, when a user deposits $2,500 worth of DAI, they receive mtDAI tokens in exchange. The mtTokens represent the initial deposit and accrued interest. These tokens are based on the ERC-20 token standard, which confers instant liquidity on their holders. Additionally, the tokens allow holders to track their earnings with ease since each token accrues value automatically based on the real-time interest accumulation on the protocol. With the mtTokens, holders can engage in trade on secondary exchanges to benefit from crypto market opportunities in real time. Additionally, they can use their tokens as collateral within Mutuum Finance, allowing them to benefit from any DeFi opportunities that may arise. Yield generation on stablecoin collateral In the envisioned Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stablecoin design, borrowers will deposit collateral to mint stablecoins. The deposits will be overcollateralized to protect the long-term stability of the stablecoin. The collateral used to mint the stablecoin will be actively engaged in the lending pool. Consequently, holders will accrue interest from those assets. This unique design ensures that stablecoin minters can earn collateral to offset a portion of the interest borrowed on the stablecoin borrow position. It means that even when in a borrowing arrangement, users’ assets generate yield, which promotes a capital-efficient ecosystem. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale major giveaway The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is currently offering $100K in an ongoing giveaway to 10 lucky participants of its ongoing presale. To stand a chance to be one of the 10 lucky winners that receive $10K in MUTM tokens, one only needs to take part in the presale with at least $50. Besides the giveaway, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has also launched a leaderboard on the presale website. The top 50 MUTM presale participants will receive spot bonus rewards in MUTM alongside the token purchase. The presale page also has a great calculator that allows you to view your ROI based on the size of your purchase. At the current phase 5 price of $0.03 per token, the ROI is 100% based on the listing price of $0.06. In the previous phase 5, the token price was $0.025, and has since increased by 20%. The MUTM presale token price is set to rise by 16.67% in the upcoming phase 6 to $0.035. So far, the presale has attracted over 11,400 participants, with nearly $9.7 million raised so far. Over 15% of the Phase 5 presale tokens have been sold in the current phase, which is impressive, given that it launched less than a week ago. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) aims to be one of the most capital-efficient decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols in the world. So far, its presale has been a roaring success, driven by overwhelming support from the crypto world. At the current low entry point of $0.03 per token, participating in the presale could be your ticket to one of the leading products of decentralized finance at the ground floor.

The infographic classifies types of ledgers based on who can access them, who maintains them, and the number of existing copies. SMQKE specifically pointed to XRP’s classification in this taxonomy, which identifies it as a “permissioned, publicly shared ledger” and labels Ripple as “a global financial transaction system.” Ripple’s position was circled under the branch that represents ledgers, which are shared publicly but maintained by trusted validators. Ripple = A Global Financial Transaction System Documented. pic.twitter.com/4LjlZgt948 — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) May 31, 2025 Ripple’s Global Payment System The design and operational structure of Ripple’s payment system make it a credible alternative to legacy payment networks like SWIFT. Ripple facilitates real-time settlement through XRP and its distributed ledger technology. This enables near-instantaneous cross-border transactions with reduced costs and fewer intermediaries. The taxonomy presented in the image supports this interpretation. By categorizing Ripple’s technology as a permissioned but publicly shared ledger, it acknowledges Ripple’s use of selected validators while maintaining an open ledger system. This enables both efficiency and auditability, qualities that traditional payment systems lack. It allows direct asset transfer with low fees, and the system can significantly improve liquidity management and transaction traceability for financial institutions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 XRP’s Perception in this System This visual and structural classification has implications for how XRP is perceived in both technical and regulatory discussions. By distinguishing Ripple as a global financial transaction system, the taxonomy supports the view that XRP is designed for institutional-grade use . XRP works with a trusted validating model that allows scalability and compliance features required by traditional financial institutions. However, the system remains decentralized, as Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) has clarified multiple times , because no single entity has full control over the network. Institutional Applications and Global Reach Ripple’s positioning as a global financial transaction system is not theoretical. Its technology is already in use by financial institutions and payment providers across multiple jurisdictions. The use of XRP as a bridge currency enables the rapid exchange between fiat pairs, which reduces the need for pre-funded accounts in foreign currencies. XRP’s use in Ripple’s global financial system has the potential to streamline global remittance services, corporate treasury operations, and international trade finance. This recognition has reaffirmed the belief XRP army has held for years about the asset’s potential. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

On Sunday, the Bitcoin price prediction is mixed as BTC consolidates in a narrow range of $ 105,000 to $10,350. On the 4-hour chart, Bitcoin is testing a downward sloping trendline, with the 50-period EMA at $106,331 capping the rally. A Doji at $104,894 is a sign of indecision, while a lower high pattern indicates a potential continuation of the downtrend. The MACD is bearish, with a deep red histogram and a widening gap below the signal line. Levels to watch: Support: $103,501, $102,141 Resistance: $106,331, $107,914 A reversal at $103,501 (Hammer or Bullish Engulfing with MACD convergence) could spark a move to $106,331 or higher. Until then, be careful. For traders, it’s simple: wait for a breakout or reversal. Without confirmation, bearish.

Twenty-five individuals, including six minors, have been charged in connection with these audacious plots, sending ripples of concern through the digital asset community. The arrests underscore a disturbing escalation in criminal activity specifically aimed at prominent crypto figures and their families, a trend that has drawn the attention of national authorities and the insurance industry alike. The Paris public prosecutor’s office announced the charges on May 31, as reported by Le Monde. The accused, aged between 16 and 23, are implicated in multiple schemes. Currently, eighteen suspects are in pre-trial detention, three have sought a deferred hearing, and four remain under judicial supervision. The investigation’s focal point is an abduction attempt on May 13 in Paris’s 11th arrondissement, where the daughter and grandson of Pierre Noizat, CEO of French crypto exchange Paymium, were targeted. Authorities revealed this was not an isolated incident, with a similar plot thwarted the previous day and another near Nantes days later. Widely circulated social media footage of the May 13 incident depicted four masked assailants assaulting Noizat’s daughter, her husband, and their child, who fortunately sustained only minor injuries. Lower-Level Operatives Apprehended The backgrounds of the suspects are diverse, spanning individuals born in the Paris region , Châtellerault, Senegal, Angola, and Russia. Defense lawyers have largely characterized them as “young profiles lured by money and caught in a situation beyond their control,” suggesting a recruitment dynamic where financial enticement played a significant role. This Paris case is emblematic of a broader surge in crypto-related kidnappings across France this year. Notable incidents include the January abduction of Ledger co-founder David Balland and his partner, as well as the May 1 kidnapping of a crypto millionaire’s father, an event investigators believe is directly linked to the current spate of attacks. While law enforcement has successfully apprehended lower-level operatives and logistics coordinators, the masterminds orchestrating these elaborate schemes continue to elude capture. Industry Responds to Heightened Kidnappings The growing threat has not gone unnoticed at the highest levels of the French government. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau convened with crypto industry professionals in mid-May to strategize protective measures. Subsequently, the ministry announced enhanced cooperation between law enforcement and crypto firms, including police and gendarmerie conducting home security checks. In parallel, the insurance sector is rapidly adapting to this environment of kidnappings. Insurers are now developing specialized kidnap and ransom (K&R) policies tailored for digital asset investors, with at least three firms reportedly preparing such offerings. Furthermore, executives and investors in the crypto industry are increasingly seeking personal security services. Private firm Infinite Risks International reported a surge in requests for bodyguards and protection contracts from high-profile figures in the crypto space, highlighting a clear shift towards proactive security measures in response to these escalating threats.

Tokens priced under $0.03, such as Ruvi AI and Shiba Inu , have caught the attention of value-driven investors. But which one is more likely to deliver 100x gains by 2026 ? To answer this, we need to analyze each token’s underlying strengths, market appeal, and growth potential. Shiba Inu’s Speculative Growth Drivers Shiba Inu , launched as a meme coin and self-proclaimed “Dogecoin killer,” owes its origin to the hype surrounding community-driven cryptocurrencies. Its early success stems from a massive community following and speculative trading. Shiba Inu’s low price per token made it wildly accessible, causing retail investors to flood in, especially after its listing on major exchanges. Community initiatives like ShibaSwap , a decentralized exchange, sought to add utility, but its use case remains speculative. While Shiba Inu has seen astronomical returns in the past, sustaining this growth depends heavily on market sentiment and hype , not inherent functionality. For Shiba Inu to achieve another 100x gain , its market cap and ecosystem would require massive expansion. However, its lack of scalable real-world applications poses significant challenges. Over-reliance on speculation may limit its ability to replicate its past success as competition and investor expectations evolve. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out On the other hand, Ruvi AI is an emerging token focused on practical applications across critical industries. With a presale price of just $0.015 per token , Ruvi AI has already demonstrated significant traction, selling over 130 million tokens and raising nearly $1.5 million in presale funding. The buzz among investors revolves around its projection to hit $1 by Q4 2025 , equating to approximately 12,800% ROI . Real-World Applications Driving Ruvi AI’s Demand Ruvi AI sets itself apart by leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence to address real-world challenges head-on. Key industries targeted include: Healthcare: AI-enhanced diagnostic tools improve efficiency and accuracy, offering hospitals robust solutions. Logistics: Ruvi AI optimizes supply chain processes by analyzing data to reduce inefficiencies and lower costs. Finance: It brings advanced fraud prevention mechanisms and creates reliable, transparent payment systems. Unlike Shiba Inu’s dependence on community-driven hype, Ruvi AI’s focus on real-world utility ensures sustained demand , making it a standout token for long-term investors. VIP Investment Options for Maximized Returns Ruvi AI incentivizes early backers with a VIP investment program featuring tier-based rewards. Here’s how the VIP tiers amplify returns: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Tokens awarded: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token (presale valuation): $4,900 . Projected value at $1 per token by 2025: $70,000 . VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Tokens awarded: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token (presale valuation): $15,680 . Projected value at $1 per token by 2025: $224,000 . VIP Tier 5 ($9,600 investment, 100% bonus): Tokens awarded: 1,280,000 (double the allocation). Value at $0.07 per token (presale valuation): $89,600 . Projected value at $1 per token by 2025: $1,280,000 . This program not only offers significant bonuses but also maximizes potential long-term profits , making it an attractive choice for strategic investors. A Thriving Community and Strategic Partnerships Ruvi AI’s rapid community growth bolsters its scalability. Across social channels and early adoption forums, Ruvi AI is gaining attention as a blockchain project capable of delivering practical utility . Additionally, its strategic partnership with WEEX Exchange ensures liquidity and broad accessibility , enhancing its position as a competitive, trustworthy token. The Verdict When comparing Ruvi AI and Shiba Inu, the upper hand lies with Ruvi AI —thanks to its innovative technology, real-world applications, and strategic growth plans. While Shiba Inu may appeal to those looking for speculative gains, Ruvi AI’s combination of utility, scalability, and strong market entry positions it as the better choice for 100x returns before 2026 . For investors seeking sustainable growth with immense upside potential, Ruvi AI offers the chance to participate in a token reshaping the worlds of healthcare, finance, and logistics , while Shiba Inu remains a more speculative play reliant on fleeting market trends.

Cardano ( ADA ) price dropped for five consecutive days, reaching a low of $0.65, its lowest level since May 8. It has dropped by over 21% from its highest point in May and by 50% from its November 2024 high. On-chain data shows that Cardano’s investors have started to capitulate. According to Santiment , the number of ADA holders has dropped to 4.49 million, down from 4.55 million at the highest point in May. More data shows that whales have continued to sell their coins, sign that they expect its price to continue falling. Whales holding between 100 million and 1 billion coins hold 3.02 billion coins today, down from a high of 3.4 billion in April. Cardano whale transactions | Source: Santiment Similarly, those holding between 1 million and 10 million have reduced their holdings to 5.7 billion from the year-to-date high of 6 billion. These sales happened as the number of ADA tokens in profit dropped to 22.69 billion from 27 billion in April. Cardano, once touted as a viable alternative to Ethereum, has continued to underperform across all areas. Its total value locked in decentralized finance has dropped to $391 million, while its cumulative DEX transactions stand at $4 billion. In contrast, Unichain has a TVL of over $702 million, and its DEX volume has jumped to over $14 billion, a few months after its launch. Cardano is now pegging its growth to its integration with Bitcoin ( BTC ), a move it expects will boost its TVL by billions . The argument is that incorporating Bitcoin will enable BTC holders to stake their holdings and earn rewards. However, this technology already exists, and Bitcoin staking platforms like SolvProtocol and Lombard Finance hold billions in assets. You might also like: Can XRP fall back to $2.20? Ripple foundation making moves Cardano price technical analysis ADA price chart | Source: crypto.news The daily chart shows that the ADA price has crashed in the past few days. This sell-off continued after it formed a double-top pattern at $0.839. It has now moved below this pattern’s neckline at $0.710, confirming its bearish bias. Cardano has also plunged below the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and is at risk of forming a death cross. Therefore, the coin will likely continue falling as sellers target the psychological point at $0.50, down by 25% below the current level. Cardano audit Cardano also finds itself on the receiving end of damning allegations made by non-fungible token artist Masato Alexander. Founder Charles Hoskinson , Alexander alleges, misappropriated $619 million in ADA tokens. Hoskinson denied the allegations. An audit is currently in the works to debunk the claims, he said. If the audit clears the project of these accusations, investors’ confidence could be restored, triggering a strong rebound in Cardano. However, if the findings raise further concerns, ADA may continue in its recent downtrend. The allegations center on a 318 million ADA transfer during the 2021 Allegra hard fork. Hoskinson, one of the co-founders of Ethereum, launched the project in 2015. The Cardano blockchain officially went live on Sept. 29, 2017. Hoskinson founded the Cardano protocol through IOHK, or Input Output Hong Kong, a blockchain research and engineering company he co-founded with Jeremy Wood. The project was named after Gerolamo Cardano, a 16th-century Italian mathematician, and its native cryptocurrency, ADA, was named after Ada Lovelace, a 19th-century mathematician often credited as the first computer programmer.

However, this break below the $0.22 support has cascaded into a string of selloffs that eventually pushed Dogecoin below $0.2. The mood was further complicated by a recent on-chain development of a massive inflow of Dogecoin into crypto exchange Coinbase that has raised eyebrows across the crypto community. Related Reading: No Room For Doubt: Analyst’s $900K Bitcoin Forecast Follows Familiar Script 312 Million Dogecoin Moved Into Crypto Exchange Coinbase According to data from blockchain monitoring platform Whale Alert, three large Dogecoin transactions were recorded in rapid succession, each involving 104,125,016 DOGE valued at approximately $20.09 million. These transfers were sent from three different wallets to the Coinbase exchange, bringing the total moved to 312,375,048 DOGE, worth over $60 million at the time of the transaction. 🚨 104,125,016 #DOGE (20,090,304 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/ZHkkBkN9Bm — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 31, 2025 🚨 104,125,016 #DOGE (20,090,304 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/4x6lIhHDSk — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 31, 2025 🚨 104,125,016 #DOGE (20,090,304 USD) transferred from unknown wallet to #Coinbasehttps://t.co/6G8vEk2Hnj — Whale Alert (@whale_alert) May 31, 2025 Although the wallets are technically separate, their identical balances, timing, and synchronized movement strongly suggest they are controlled by a single entity. On-chain history reveals that these wallets started receiving Dogecoin in October 2021, five months after the cryptocurrency reached its all-time high of $0.7316 in May 2021. Fresh inflows were added again in 2022, but since then, there had been little to no incoming activity. Furthermore, these addresses haven’t had any outgoing activity since their creation, until now. This makes the recent transfers not only unusual but significant, as it marks the first time these tokens are being moved out and directly to an exchange. Brace For Impact? What This Means For DOGE Price The immediate concern for investors is whether these transfers is the precursor to an impending selloff. Sending over 312 million DOGE to Coinbase could be interpreted as a move to liquidate, especially if the whale behind these wallets intends to take profits after holding the asset dormant for nearly two years. Such a sale will introduce substantial selling pressure to Dogecoin, which is already currently struggling to get market demand to absorb selling pressure. On the other hand, not all large transfers to exchanges indicate bearish intent. There is a realistic possibility that the wallets are not externally owned but rather belong to Coinbase itself. In that case, the transfers may simply represent internal restructuring or cold-to-hot wallet reallocation, which poses no threat to price action. At present, there is no conclusive evidence confirming either scenario, and the uncertainty is enough to keep retail Dogecoin traders on alert.

Pseudonymous analyst Dave the Wave tells his 153,800 followers on the social media platform X that he’s keeping a close watch on Bitcoin’s moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator on the weekly chart. The MACD is a technical indicator that tracks the convergence and divergence of moving averages to gauge an asset’s momentum and trend direction while pinpointing potential reversal areas. According to Dave the Wave, BTC’s weekly MACD suggests that Bitcoin is bullish and is primed to hit a diagonal resistance that has marked market tops since 2012. “On the basis of the weekly BTC MACD extension, you’d expect another push up.” Source: Dave the Wave/X Looking at the trader’s chart, he seems to suggest that the MACD will rise to the diagonal resistance by the end of the year, just as BTC rallies to $160,000. Zooming out, Dave the Wave says the monthly time frame supports his long-term bullish outlook on BTC. “Longer-term monthly BTC MACD turning upward again…” Source: Dave the Wave/X But in the short term, the analyst thinks that Bitcoin will slide to around $98,000, where it could potentially print a local bottom before sparking new rallies. “Would it be such a terrible thing to see BTC price consolidate to just under $100,000 before moving up again? Surely, only snowflakes would think so…” Source: Dave the Wave/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $104,348.

According to WatersAbove’s statement on X, XRP is expected to hit its bottom between June 4th and June 6th, setting the stage for what could be one of the most anticipated rallies in the token’s recent history. With eyes set on a breakout to $10 by late July or early August, the XRP Army is buzzing with anticipation, but also caution, as the analyst warns of significant market manipulation in the days ahead. Dear #XRPArmy the bottom on XRP should be in by June 4th – 6th after June 18th, expect a straight line breakout to $10 by late July / early August in the meantime, watch out for this week ahead June 3rd – 6th will be heavy manipulation — WatersAbove (@WatersAbve) May 31, 2025 June Bottom: The Setup for the Next Surge WatersAbove’s forecast suggests that the XRP price floor will lock in between June 4th and 6th, a timeframe that aligns with broader market shifts anticipated across the crypto space. This bottoming phase is critical, as it may offer the last opportunity for accumulation before XRP begins a major upward trajectory. XRP’s past performance has shown cycles of price suppression followed by sudden breakouts, a trend closely monitored by traders and long-term investors. What makes this forecast particularly compelling is the specificity of the timing. Rather than offering vague “sometime this summer” predictions, WatersAbove narrows it down to a window of just a few days, suggesting that key market signals, possibly linked to on-chain data, liquidity patterns, or technical setups, are pointing to this narrow band as the inflection point. Anticipating the Breakout to $10 Following the anticipated bottom, WatersAbove predicts a straight-line breakout after June 18th, with XRP rocketing toward the $10 mark by late July or early August. If realized, this would represent a staggering multi-fold increase from current price levels, signaling a decisive shift in XRP’s market dynamics. This projection doesn’t come out of thin air. Over the past year, Ripple has seen growth in its international partnerships and the broader adoption of XRP for cross-border payments. Despite Ripple’s notable legal victories, the market hasn’t yet fully reflected these positive developments in its pricing. A breakout to $10 would signal not just speculative excitement, but a recalibration of XRP’s value in light of Ripple’s expanding global role. Short-Term Risks: Manipulation Ahead The long-term outlook from WatersAbove is bullish, but the short-term cautionary notes are equally significant. According to the analyst, the period between June 3rd and June 6th will be marked by heavy market manipulation. This warning highlights the importance of vigilance for traders and investors. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 In past cycles, XRP has been no stranger to volatility, often whipsawing in response to news events, coordinated whale activity, or even broader market corrections tied to Bitcoin’s price movements. Heavy manipulation can manifest in sudden price dumps, fake breakouts, or misleading on-chain activity, all of which can shake out weak hands and confuse market participants. WatersAbove’s warning serves as a reminder that while the path to $10 may be paved with opportunity, it’s also lined with traps designed to derail the impatient or ill-prepared. Broader Context: Why This Rally Matters If WatersAbove’s predictions hold, XRP’s potential rally to $10 would not only be a price milestone but a symbolic one. XRP has long held a distinct place in the crypto landscape, serving both as a utility token for Ripple’s payment solutions and as a focal point in regulatory discussions around digital assets. Achieving a $10 price point would push XRP’s market capitalization deep into the top ranks of the crypto leaderboard, potentially reigniting debates about its role as a bridge currency for global finance. Moreover, such a surge would come at a time when the broader crypto market is poised for renewed institutional interest, particularly as the U.S. advances its regulatory frameworks and spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs gain traction. XRP’s rally could further spotlight altcoins with strong utility and regulatory clarity, setting the stage for a broader shift in market sentiment.

In a Sunday X post , Zach said laws in Canada and the EU are too soft, especially when underage hackers are involved in crimes like SIM swapping and phishing. He pointed directly at Cameron Redman, a Canadian who SIM-swapped one victim for millions at age 17, then got charged quietly, with his name and face kept hidden until Zach exposed it. According to Zach, “Cameron Redman helped SIM swap $37M in 2020 when he was 17. Not a single mention of his full name or photo on the internet until I posted it after he got involved with phishing / X ATOs. Zero reason his name should’ve been protected or hidden.” Redman got away with millions before the police intervened The hack happened on February 22, 2020, when Redman SIM swapped Josh Jones, an early crypto investor, and took control of his number. That let him bypass security tied to Josh’s wallets. Redman drained 1547 Bitcoin and 60,000 Bitcoin Cash from two BTC wallets and one BCH address. After the theft, Redman started laundering the BCH through hundreds of tiny transactions, sending them into centralized exchanges to try and cover his tracks. Zach posted the chart below showing how the stolen tokens moved through the blockchain, ending up mostly at just two exchanges. Chart showing the pattern with which the SIM swappers moved stolen tokens through the Blockchain | Source: TRM By the time police stepped in, most of the money was already scattered. It wasn’t until November 17, 2021, that Redman was formally charged by Hamilton Police in Ontario, with backup from the FBI and the US Secret Service. Officers were able to seize $5.4 million in crypto, but the rest—$31.5 million—was never recovered. At the time of arrest, Redman was still legally underage, which meant his name stayed sealed, and his photo wasn’t released. Zach said that secrecy is part of the problem. He believes Redman’s identity should’ve been public once he allegedly moved on to phishing and hijacking X accounts. Those takeovers reportedly caused millions in losses from followers who trusted hacked NFT-related profiles and got tricked into handing over wallet credentials. SIM swapping is exploding and organized crime is involved Zach’s frustration isn’t about one hacker. SIM swaps are growing fast, especially in 2024 and 2025. The UK saw a 1,055% rise in cases from the previous year, jumping from 289 to 2,985 incidents. In the US, the FBI recorded $68 million in SIM swap losses in 2021, followed by $48.8 million in 2023 from over 1,000 victims, then $82 million in 2024. The damage is serious enough that organized crime groups, including ones tied to the Italian Mafia, are now using SIM swaps to pull off million-dollar thefts. The method is low-tech but powerful. Hackers steal enough personal info—through phishing, breaches, or social media—to trick mobile providers into handing over someone’s number. Once they control it, they intercept 2FA codes sent by SMS, lock users out of their accounts, and start draining crypto wallets and bank accounts. The results can be brutal. Victims have lost tens of thousands, faced identity theft, and been saddled with fraudulent debt. One person in the UK saw £50,000 wiped across different accounts. Another got hit with £2,200 in fake charges. Even Jack Dorsey, the founder and former CEO of Twitter, had his account taken over using this tactic in 2019. Back in 2018, one crypto investor lost $23.8 million in one go to a similar SIM hack. While eSIM tech does reduce physical risks, it hasn’t solved the issue because the real weakness is still human error and social engineering. Tech experts say using authenticator apps like Google Authenticator is safer than relying on SMS-based two-factor authentication. They also suggest setting custom PINs with carriers, sharing less online, and reacting fast if a swap is suspected. That means freezing accounts, contacting the carrier, and keeping an eye on transaction logs. But even with all that, criminals keep adapting, and the systems in place aren’t strong enough to stop them completely.

XRP is currently above a key support zone between $2.0814 and $2.0209, an area of previous buying interest.

Meanwhile, Pi Network is facing a 3% price drop after mainnet delays and a large token unlock that has investors losing confidence. Bittensor is holding steady, with TAO up 1.6% in 24 hours and its subnet ecosystem expanding rapidly. Let’s take a look at the latest performance, investor sentiment, and project developments for all three projects. Pi Network Price Drops Due to Ongoing Concerns About Mainnet Progress Right now, Pi Network (PI) is trading at around $0.75, down about 3% in the past 24 hours. That’s a big fall from its February high of $2.99—a drop of roughly 75%. The decline isn’t that surprising. After the long-awaited mainnet launch earlier this year, progress has been slower than expected, and that’s worn down investor confidence. One of the big issues was the token unlock in April, which released over 21 million PI into circulation. That added selling pressure and pushed the price lower. On top of that, the token’s still only listed on a few exchanges like OKX, so liquidity is still limited and harder to access for many. Still, the project has a massive community—over 70 million users—and a $100 million ecosystem fund aimed at supporting DApp development. Bittensor Maintains Momentum with Expanding Decentralized AI Network Bittensor (TAO) has climbed about 1.6% in the last 24 hours and is now trading at around $446. It has a market cap close to $3.9 billion and 8.72 million TAO in circulation, so it’s still holding strong. What sets Bittensor apart is its focus on decentralized AI. Instead of building one massive model, Bittensor runs on subnets—mini AI environments where people can contribute models and computing power. And those subnets are growing fast, jumping from 64 to 96 in just over two months. The TAO token is what keeps everything running. It’s used to reward contributors and power the network. Some analysts think if this growth keeps up, TAO could climb to around $1,239 by the end of the year—a potential 200% gain from current levels. Coldware Blends Hardware, Blockchain, and Privacy—and It’s Working Coldware ($COLD) is doing what most crypto projects only talk about—bringing blockchain into the real world with products you can actually use. While others are busy pitching future plans, Coldware’s ($COLD) is already shipping hardware, rolling out a Layer-1 network, and making the whole Web3 experience feel simple. At the center of it all are two flagship devices: the Larna 2400 smartphone and the ColdBook laptop. These aren’t just “Web3-ready”—they’re built for it. Users can turn them on and they’re instantly connected to the Coldware blockchain, no extensions or extra wallets needed. The Larna 2400 runs on Android 15, features a 6.56-inch OLED display with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate, and comes preloaded with Coldware’s own apps like ColdWallet, ColdChat, and a decentralized VPN. Why $COLD Is Gaining Attention Behind the whole ecosystem is the $COLD token. It’s used for transactions, governance, and staking—but also unlocks Freeze.Mint, a no-code tool that lets users create tokens or tokenize real-world assets directly from your device. It’s a game-changer for creators and small business owners who want to bring value on-chain without diving into complex development. What also makes Coldware’s ($COLD) stand out is its focus on privacy. Their custom OS blocks trackers and keeps your data out of third-party hands—something most tech doesn’t bother with anymore. The project has already raised over $4 million and the presale is getting close to its final phase. Closing Words While Pi Network struggles with slow mainnet progress and Bittensor pushes forward with its subnet system, Coldware ($COLD) is taking a more grounded approach—delivering hardware, software, and a blockchain that’s already working together. Pi still has a massive user base, and Bittensor’s AI angle is gaining traction, but Coldware’s ($COLD) is turning ideas into usable tech. It’s proving that Web3 adoption doesn’t have to be complicated—it just has to work. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored article and is for informational purposes only.

45375207,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/ai-trading-bots-for-risk-adjusted-returns-in-crypto,1748789685,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/45375207.jpeg,AI Trading Bots for Risk-Adjusted Returns in Crypto,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/06/ai-trading-bots-for-risk-adjusted-returns-in-crypto,"While most crypto traders fixate on maximum returns, professional investors focus on risk-adjusted performance—the returns generated relative to the risks taken. Cryptocurrency markets present unique challenges with their extreme volatility, regulatory uncertainties, and 24/7 trading cycles. AI trading systems excel in this environment by maintaining consistent risk parameters regardless of market conditions. A properly configured DeFi trading bot applies mathematical precision to risk management tasks that human traders often compromise during emotional market phases. This article examines how AI trading bots implement sophisticated risk-adjusted strategies and the metrics to evaluate their effectiveness. Risk-Adjusted Returns in Crypto Markets Risk-adjusted returns measure investment performance accounting for the risk assumed to generate those returns. Unlike absolute returns, which only show profits, risk-adjusted metrics provide context for those gains. Key risk-adjusted performance indicators include: Sharpe Ratio: Returns beyond risk-free rate divided by standard deviation of returns Sortino Ratio: Similar to Sharpe but only considers downside deviation Maximum Drawdown: Largest percentage drop from peak to subsequent trough Calmar Ratio: Annual return divided by maximum drawdown Ulcer Index: Measures drawdown pain over time Crypto markets demand specialized risk assessment due to their fat-tailed distribution patterns—extreme events occur more frequently than traditional financial models predict. While HODLing crypto assets has historically produced strong overall returns, the journey includes drawdowns exceeding 85% during bear markets. AI trading strategies typically target more modest returns with significantly reduced drawdowns, resulting in superior risk-adjusted performance. Key Risk Management Capabilities of AI Trading Bots AI trading bots implement programmatic risk management through several core capabilities: Position Sizing Algorithms: Automatically adjust trade size based on volatility metrics, reducing exposure during turbulent markets. Dynamic Stop-Loss Systems: Continuously recalculate optimal stop-loss levels using standard deviation bands, support/resistance levels, or volatility-based approaches. Correlation-Based Hedging: Monitor relationships between assets to prevent overexposure to single risk factors. Drawdown Controls: Implement trading size reductions after losses to preserve capital during drawdowns. Tail Risk Detection: Use machine learning to identify patterns preceding major market dislocations. Volatility-Responsive Trading Strategies Volatility forms the cornerstone of risk-adjusted trading systems. Advanced bots implement: Volatility Bands Trading: Only entering positions when market volatility falls within predetermined ranges, avoiding both extremely quiet markets (insufficient movement) and chaotic conditions (excessive risk). ATR-Based Position Sizing: Using Average True Range to establish position sizes proportional to market noise, reducing allocations when volatility expands. Regime-Switching Models: Implementing different parameter sets for distinct volatility regimes, automatically shifting between aggressive, moderate, and defensive postures. Volatility Trend Analysis: Analyzing directional changes in volatility to predict potential market regime shifts before they fully materialize. AI-Powered Risk Assessment Techniques AI systems continuously evaluate market conditions to adjust risk parameters using: Regime Classification: Machine learning models categorize current market conditions into distinct regimes (trending, ranging, volatile) based on dozens of technical factors. Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised learning algorithms flag unusual market behavior that doesn't match historical patterns, triggering defensive measures. NLP Sentiment Analysis : Monitoring news and social media sentiment to adjust risk exposure when negative sentiment spikes precede potential downturns. Cross-Asset Correlation Analysis: Tracking dynamic relationships between cryptocurrencies, detecting when typically uncorrelated assets move together — a warning sign of systemic risk. Machine Learning Models for Risk Profiling Specific machine learning approaches deliver superior risk assessment: Gaussian Mixture Models: Identify distinct market volatility regimes without requiring labeled data. LSTM Networks: Predict volatility spikes by recognizing temporal patterns in market data sequences. Random Forest Classifiers: Rank feature importance to identify which indicators currently drive market risk. Reinforcement Learning: Discover optimal risk-reward tradeoffs through experience, optimizing for Sharpe ratio rather than absolute returns. Implementing Risk-Adjusted Bot Strategies Practical implementation of risk-adjusted trading bots requires specific configuration approaches: Calibrate risk parameters first, then optimize for returns—not vice versa. Start with maximum drawdown limits, then adjust other parameters to maximize returns within these constraints. Backtest across multiple market regimes with emphasis on stress periods. A strategy should demonstrate resilience during crashes, not just performance during uptrends. Implement gradual capital deployment through dollar-cost averaging into positions rather than taking full-size entries. Employ time-based risk adjustments, reducing position sizes during historically volatile time periods (like weekend markets or around major economic announcements). Configure cross-market hedging to offset directional exposure when correlation between assets increases. Position Sizing and Risk Allocation Position sizing represents the most powerful risk management tool available: Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing: $Position = \frac{Account \times Risk%}{Volatility \times Stop Distance}$ Risk Parity Approach: Allocate capital inverse to asset volatility, giving more stable assets larger allocations. Correlation-Weighted Exposure: Reduce aggregate positions in highly correlated assets to prevent overexposure to single risk factors. Maximum Drawdown Recovery Sizing: Scale position sizes relative to distance from maximum equity peak, reducing exposure after drawdowns. Measuring Bot Performance Through Risk-Adjusted Metrics Evaluate bot performance using risk-adjusted metrics rather than absolute returns: Track monthly Sharpe and Sortino ratios with a target of consistently maintaining values above 1.5 and 2.0 respectively. Compare maximum drawdown percentage against absolute returns. Professional strategies typically target annual returns at least twice their maximum drawdown. Monitor recovery time after drawdowns—the period required to reach new equity highs after losses. Analyze performance variation across market regimes to identify strategy blind spots. Even slight underperformance during certain market phases is acceptable if the strategy demonstrates strong risk-adjusted returns overall. Case Study: AI Bot Performance During Market Stress During the May 2021 crypto crash, when Bitcoin fell 53% from its peak, several AI trading strategies demonstrated superior risk management: Early Reduction of Exposure: Machine learning models detected anomalous market conditions 12-24 hours before the major crash, automatically reducing position sizes. Volatility-Based Position Sizing: Strategies employing volatility-adjusted position sizing automatically reduced trade size as market turbulence increased. Correlation-Based Risk Management: Systems monitoring inter-market correlations detected unusual synchronization across assets and implemented defensive measures. Recovery Positioning: While human traders often remained sidelined after the crash, AI systems methodically re-entered positions at technical support levels, capturing the subsequent recovery. The most successful systems maintained drawdowns below 15% during this period, compared to the broader market's 50%+ decline. Conclusion: Balancing Risk and Return in Automated Trading Effective AI trading bots prioritize risk management over profit maximization. Configure systems to target consistent, moderate returns with minimal drawdowns rather than maximum possible gains. Evaluate performance through risk-adjusted metrics rather than absolute returns, and ensure your strategy performs adequately across all market regimes. Remember that the most successful automated trading approach isn't necessarily the one with the highest returns during bull markets, but the one that preserves capital during downturns while delivering acceptable performance over complete market cycles.

45376120,https://invezz.com/?p=2742319,1748789760,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,PEPE investors looking to double their investment in 2025 turn to MUTM,https://invezz.com/news/2025/06/01/pepe-investors-looking-to-double-their-investment-in-2025-turn-to-mutm/,"Following the wave of speculative growth since May 2023, PEPE investors are now facing a lack of growth as the focus shifts to utility-based projects. This sideways movement has forced many PEPE investors to look to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) for future growth. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) DeFi project is built with real-world utility in mind. Balancing profitability with long-term growth Speculative hype has been the downfall of many crypto investors, who have been left holding the bag as a meme coin’s price has dropped to zero. To avoid this issue and ensure long-term and sustainable growth for its community, the Mutuum Finance protocol envisions a framework that differentiates between various asset types based on their volatility. Mutuum Finance recognizes that assets typically used for collateral have high volatility compared to those used primarily for liquidity. Collateral-oriented assets have to be complemented by strong liquidity to ensure quick liquidations. The measure is designed to ensure that lenders’ assets are always protected. Mutuum Finance also recognizes that assets with low liquidity demand require more conservative interest rate measures to reduce sudden spikes in utilization. To address some of the issues that may arise, the protocol will reduce optimal utilization rates for set assets, or raise rates for some assets during spikes in pull unitization to maintain stability. It ensures that borrowing costs are competitive with other yield opportunities, ensuring the protocol never runs out of capital during high market demand. One of the ways Mutuum Finance will ensure liquidity providers are incentivized to supply sufficient liquidity is via a reward system. The system will focus on those who provide important assets, ensuring they are compensated for deepening the protocol’s liquidity. One way this will be done is by using MUTM tokens. Some of the specific measures implemented to deepen liquidity are: Attracting key liquidity providers For high-value assets like stablecoins and major crypto coins, Mutuum Finance will employ various strategies, including MUTM token rewards. It will ensure that there is a robust supply in the pools to safeguard solvency. High-volatility token management Tokens that are highly volatile could destabilize the long-term success of the protocol for liquidators and lenders. By reducing incentives for these tokens, Mutuum Finance will ensure they are not a source of concern. Limiting resource allocation Mutuum Finance acknowledges that spreading incentives too thin is a problem. As such, the focus will be on lenders with high-value assets that assist the protocol’s progress. Security protections on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) recently passed a Certik security audit, in recognition of the robust protections the platform offers its users. Some of the measures in place to protect users’ assets are: DDoS protection Mutuum Finance will implement DDoS mitigation to ensure all income requests are filtered before entering the protocol infrastructure. They will rely on a scalable solution that ensures the platform remains accessible, including during periods of high demand. Domain integrity To protect from DNS spoofing, the project will implement DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions). The method validates DNS data to reduce the likelihood of success for attackers. Ongoing monitoring and DNS configuration updates will also boost the domain-level security. IPFS deployment and naming Every new build of the Mutuum Finance user interface will be deployed to a decentralized storage solution and tracked with the DNSLink standard. By pinning deployments to unique IPFS hashes, it ensures tamper-evident updates on the front end, thereby improving transparency and trust. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) The front end will feature a top-quality IDS that can detect all suspicious traffic. It will analyze data in real time and swiftly identify potential intrusions. That will ensure there is no unauthorized access to the protocol infrastructure. Code modification checks Mutuum Finance will also deploy a Content Security Policy (CSP) and Subresource Integrity (SRI). These two measures validate hashes of static resources to ensure that only approved scripts run on the interface. All illegal modifications will be detected fast, preserving the platform’s integrity. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale success The robust security the platform will offer lenders, coupled with the great value proposition, has led to huge success for the presale. So far, over $9.7 million worth of tokens have been sold. Mutuum Finance is currently in phase 5 of its presale, where each token is going for $0.03. The current price represents a 20% increase from the Phase 4 price of $0.025 and a 200% increase from the Phase 1 price of $0.01. In Phase 6, the token price is expected to rise by 16.67% to $0.035. So far, over 11,400 unique buyers have participated in the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale. Analysts forecast that the MUTM token price could hit $3 sometime after the listing. For those who buy now, a rise to $3 would represent a 100x return on investment. As such, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale is one of the best bargains currently available in the crypto space.

The once-promising project has seen over 102 million tokens withdrawn from OKX in just three days, while reports of insider selling continue to shake market confidence. With Pi's price hovering around $0.79—down 72% from its all-time high—and allegations of tokens sold from Foundation-controlled wallets, the exodus to more transparent blockchain projects has begun. And that’s where we Coldware ($COLD) and Theta Network ($THETA) get into our story. These two established projects might capitalise on Pi's misfortunes with enterprise-ready solutions and real-world utility that Pi has yet to deliver. Let’s dig a bit deeper Is Pi Network in Trouble? Investors Worry as Red Flags Multiply Pi Network is facing serious questions—and investors are starting to walk away. What started as an ambitious project with a loyal community is now raising eyebrows due to some troubling developments. According to blockchain investigator Dr. Altcoin, a Pi Foundation wallet recently moved 1.4 million tokens from a long-dormant address and sold them, triggering concerns about insider manipulation. This, combined with a record-breaking wave of token outflows from exchanges, has many wondering if something bigger is going on behind the scenes. It doesn’t help that Pi’s technical chart shows a bearish flag forming. If that pattern plays out, prices could slide toward $0.66. Add to that a sharp 60% drop in daily trading volume and a lack of active DeFi or dApps, and things don’t look great. Yes, there’s talk of a $100 million venture fund—but without actual utility or adoption, that promise feels a little hollow right now. And with 1.47 billion more Pi tokens set to hit the market this year, the fear of dilution is real. Investors aren’t panicking—but they’re not sticking around blindly either. Without clear steps forward, Pi could be in for a rough road. Coldware and Theta Network Step Up as Pi Loses Investor Confidence As doubts mount around Pi Network, investors are shifting their focus to projects that actually deliver—namely Coldware and Theta Network. These two platforms are quickly emerging as credible alternatives, backed by real utility and solid partnerships. Coldware ($COLD) stands out with its enterprise-ready Layer-1 blockchain and a unique hardware-software model. While Pi’s roadmap remains vague, Coldware is already rolling out solutions for industries like finance and logistics. It’s built for real-world use, not just whitepaper hype. With privacy-first features and a secure Proof-of-Stake system, it’s attracting serious attention from those tired of speculative plays. Then there’s Theta Network ($THETA), which is making major moves in AI and media. It’s not just talk—Theta has partnered with NBA and NHL teams, top esports brands, and even Stanford University. Its upcoming EdgeCloud launch on June 25th brings decentralized GPU power to AI developers, a space where Pi hasn’t even shown up. From AI infrastructure to blockchain utility, both Coldware’s ($COLD) and Theta are doing what Pi hasn’t—delivering. And in a market where confidence matters, that’s quickly turning heads and pulling investment away from projects still stuck in potential. The Bottom Line While Pi Network continues to face questions around transparency and lack of progress, Coldware and Theta Network are showing what real blockchain adoption looks like. The difference between them couldn’t be clearer. Coldware tackles the very problems Pi is being criticized for—offering a clear, enterprise-grade solution with real utility, strong governance, and a focus on transparency. It's not just talk; it's building tech that businesses can actually use. Theta Network, on the other hand, is making real moves in the AI and media space. From partnerships with major sports teams to academic collaborations, it's proving there’s demand for decentralized infrastructure—and it's delivering on it. For investors feeling burned or skeptical about Pi, Coldware and Theta offer something that’s rare in the crypto world: actual credibility, backed by working tech and meaningful partnerships. In a market full of empty promises, that’s starting to matter a lot more.

Back in 2017, Ripple (XRP) turned a few hundred dollars into six figures for early backers. Today, a similar setup is forming with Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a cheap altcoin. The official presale of Mutuum Finance has priced the token at $0.03 in Phase 5, closer to a Phase 6 price of $0.035 per MUTM. Already having achieved a 200% growth from when it was first released, MUTM will officially launch at $0.06, giving current customers a minimum 100% return on investment (2x ROI). If it follows a trajectory similar to XRP’s historical climb, a modest $200 investment could theoretically balloon to $200,000. While speculative, the token’s low market price, growing ecosystem, and timing ahead of the 2025 cycle make it one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in now for those seeking asymmetrical gains. For risk-tolerant investors, this might be the best crypto coin to buy before the next major breakout. Presale Gaining Momentum: Mutuum Finance Leads the Charge Mutuum Finance presale sold out Phase 4 earlier than expected, and the momentum is intensifying. The presale is now in phase 5 available at $0.03. Those quick on the uptake can lock in a 16.67% profit when the next price tier comes into play. With demand comes increased anticipation of even more dramatic profits at launch. With sound tokenomics and practical DeFi applications, MUTM is shaping up fast to be a breakout player in the 2025 altcoin conversation. Revolutionary Buy-and-Distribute Model Contributes to Long-Term Value Mutuum Finance carries out a unique buy-and-distribute process, unlike other many other speculation tokens. By doing this the periodic purchasing of tokens from the market and providing them to the MUTM stakers helps sustain the model and brings long term participation and thus reduces supply. This structure should increase price rise and encourage constant use from users. Stablecoin Secures Future with Completed Certik Audit A new USD-pegged stablecoin backed by Ethereum and running on it is soon being launched by Mutuum Finance. The advantage of MUTM stablecoin’s extra collateral is that it stops the kind of collapse that algorithmic tokens are subject to. Using recently audited and confirmed smart contracts from Certik, Mutuum Finance can be trusted by all users and investors. Thanks to its special buy-and-distribute approach and an overcollateralized stablecoin, MUTM joins innovation, safety and trust among its members. Early investment gives daring traders a chance to join the project in its very initial days. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is emerging as one of the most compelling altcoin opportunities ahead of the 2025 bull cycle, especially for investors seeking outsized returns. With the token currently priced at just $0.03 in Phase 5 of its presale and a launch price set at $0.06, early participants are already positioned for a 2x ROI. Backed by over $9.7 million raised, more than 11,500 investors, a completed Certik audit, and a unique buy-and-distribute model, MUTM offers innovation, trust, and real DeFi utility. If the token follows a growth pattern similar to Ripple’s legendary 2017 run, a $200 investment today could potentially transform into $200,000. While no investment is without risk, the upside here is hard to ignore. Act now to secure your position before the next presale price hike.

45375574,https://thecoinrise.com/czech-justice-minister-resigns-after-accepting-bitcoin-from-convicted-criminal/,1748790001,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/45375574.jpeg,Czech Justice Minister Resigns After Accepting Bitcoin from Convicted Criminal,https://thecoinrise.com/czech-justice-minister-resigns-after-accepting-bitcoin-from-convicted-criminal/,"Czech Republic’s Justice Minister, Pavel Blazek, has stepped down amid growing backlash over the sale of nearly $45 million worth of Bitcoin donated by a convicted drug trafficker. The resignation, announced on May 30, follows a police investigation into the source of the cryptocurrency and mounting political pressure just months ahead of national elections. The scandal erupted after the Justice Ministry announced on May 28 via X that it had auctioned off 500 Bitcoin, raising almost 1 billion Czech koruna (approximately $45 million). The funds were intended for projects such as improving prison infrastructure, digitizing the justice system, and reducing drug use in correctional facilities. However, a report by local media outlet Denik N revealed that the cryptocurrency came from Tomas Jirikovsky — the operator of Sheep Marketplace, a dark web platform infamous for hosting illicit drug and weapons sales. Jirikovsky, convicted in 2017, served time for crimes including embezzlement and drug trafficking. Bitcoin ‘Gift’ Raises Eyes on Czech Justice Minister The controversy intensified after it emerged that Blazek accepted the donation without verifying its origin. Jirikovsky’s lawyer had approached the ministry in March, offering one-third of his remaining Bitcoin holdings as a donation. Blazek, defending his decision, claimed he had “no way to investigate the matter” and assumed it was an act of repentance. “I wasn’t interested so many years after the case,” Blazek told reporters at a press conference. “It was his decision to make amends.” The public, however, reacted sharply to the perceived negligence. Opposition leaders branded the move a scandal, criticizing the lack of due diligence in accepting cryptocurrency from a known criminal. Police have now opened an investigation into the true origin of the Bitcoin. Jirikovsky has reportedly been trying to reclaim 1,500 Bitcoin seized at the time of his arrest. Although authorities suspected his crypto holdings were linked to other dark web operations like Nucleus, the court ultimately ruled he could keep the coins after his release in 2021 due to insufficient proof of illegality. Blazek Steps Down as Crypto Rules Take Shape As the political fallout grew, Prime Minister Petr Fiala distanced himself from Blazek, a long-time ally. To preserve the government’s credibility, Blazek announced his resignation. “I am not aware of any illegal action. However, I do not wish to damage the reputation of the government,” he said in a statement. His resignation comes at a time when Czechia is beginning to define its crypto policy framework.

On the 2-hour chart, Solana’s price is stuck in a descending channel, characterized by lower highs and lows, indicating clear selling pressure. The 50-period EMA at $160.79, once support, is now resistance. The MACD is bearish, MACD line below signal line and red histogram bars. Price is approaching the $150.66 support zone, the lower boundary of the channel. If a bullish reversal candle, such as a Hammer or Bullish Engulfing, forms here with MACD convergence, we could see a move to $158.33 or $160.79. But a clean break below $150.66 could take SOL to $142.14 or $134.01. Key Technical Levels: Support: $150.66, $142.14, $134.01 Resistance: $158.33, $160.79, $165.59 For traders, wait for confirmation—rising volume and a bullish candle—before going long. Without that, SOL is bearish, but a textbook rebound at $150 could be a good entry. BTC Bull Token Presale Approaches $7.67M Mark as 62% APY Staking Draws Interest With SOL/USD dipping below $160, attention is shifting to altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) . So far, $6.38 million has been raised, with the next price jump approaching quickly. Bitcoin Rewards and Supply Reductions BTC Bull Token operates with a built-in system: the higher BTC’s price, the more BTC airdrops are distributed to token holders. Notably, presale participants receive priority. The system also features: Token burns every $ 50,000 BTC increase, reducing the supply. The current token price is at $0.00254 before the next bump. This approach aligns token value with BTC/USD’s price moves while maintaining scarcity through programmed burns. Staking Terms for Passive Returns – BTCBULL’s staking pool holds 1.62 billion tokens offering 65% APY, with: No lockup periods or fees. Full access to funds at any time. This structure appeals to investors seeking yield without complex requirements or the risk of illiquidity. Momentum Before the Cap Fills With just over $1 million remaining in the presale, buyers are positioning early. The token’s mechanics of BTC-tied rewards, supply adjustments, and staking options are driving participation. Key figures: USDT raised : $6,632,712/ $7,676,876 Token price : $0.00254 BTCBULL offers a whopping ~62% APY on its Ethereum-based staking pool (currently holding 1.61B BTCBULL), with no lockups or withdrawal fees. That means passive yield, with full liquidity.

Current market conditions—low implied volatility and unfavorable Bitcoin seasonality—make covered-call selling less attractive for CONY. I'm bullish on Bitcoin long-term due to ETF inflows, institutional adoption, and reduced exchange supply, but June seasonality tempers my enthusiasm. I rate CONY a sell, Coinbase and Bitcoin a hold, citing systematic strategy risks, low volatility, and seasonal headwinds for CONY. The YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF ( CONY ) sells covered-call on Coinbase stock and distributes the premia proceeds to holders. This distribution currently annualizes into a 123.31% rate. However, this isn't a yield in the traditional sense where usually some kind of relatively steady profit is disbursed. Like with REITs or MLPs or leveraged fixed-income CEFs or things like that. The graph below illustrates this effect and how the share price went down over 60% since inception while the yield lead to a positive total return of ~109%: Data by YCharts A low triple digit return since inception is very good. However, I'd caution this is driven in part by the strong return of the underlying. The return profile is relatively favorable to sell covered calls. I'm also apprehensive of what's essentially a mechanical covered-call selling strategy. Selling more calls as money pours into the ETF: Data by YCharts This could potentially depress call prices, which is to the strategy's disadvantage. Last time I wrote about CONY I said: This time, I think there is a chance the underlying will be surprisingly strong in April and that makes it unfavorable to sell short-term calls against it. I’ll detail why I think Coinbase could do well during April. and I’m wary of the Coinbase seasonal data because it usually holds its earnings call in March, but the next one is coming up at the end of April. I think April could be a lot better this time around. Because generally Bitcoin is also quite strong in April, that lines up favorably. Coinbase got hammered on April 2 along with the rest of the market but recovered well. I don't remember how I got the notion earnings were moved to the end of April because they were May 8, and they propelled the stock. Coinbase and Bitcoin both ended up at ~21% with CONY lagging at a very respectable 9%. Data by YCharts Meanwhile, we're moving into June when Bitcoin seasonality is unfavorable. This is relevant because Coinbase price is quite correlated with the most important digital asset. Bitcoin Seasonality (Author's Own) Last time I argued Coinbase volatility was very low, making selling calls less attractive. It is now even lower. In the past 6 or 12-month periods the IV has only been lower 9% of the time. A silver lining; out of the money Coinbase calls are now somewhat more expensive than similar puts. Last time this wasn't the case while it is common for Coinbase and Bitcoin calls to trade like that. I'm currently still bullish on Bitcoin as I laid out in Potential Interesting Way To Gain Bitcoin Exposure. Key reasons: 1) Bitcoin ETF inflows are very strong this year. Below; assets under management for the two largest players. The iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF ( IBIT ) and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund ( FBTC ): Data by YCharts 2) Institutional adoption continues with RIA's increasingly allocating client portfolios to crypto. 3) Potentially Bitcoin is in a high profit/low volatility phase (coined by Fidelity). Somewhat confirmed by the low implied vol on both CONY as well as IBIT. 4) Bitcoin supply on exchanges going down, indicating a preference for long-term hodling over trading. 5) Expect Strategy ( MSTR ) to aggressively accumulate Bitcoin as long as its share price remains buoyant. On May 26, the firm reported having issued shares to buy another 4k Bitcoins. Seeking Alpha data shows its momentum as A+ and as long as it continues to run, I expect it to keep buying. Either financed by equity issuance or (convertible) debt. 6) Global money supply increased during April: Global money supply (MicroMacro) My enthusiasm is somewhat decreased because June is generally quite bad. I'm temporarily lowering my buy rating to hold. Right now, I rate these related assets as follows (with the caveat I can easily revert Bitcoin back to a buy in June): Asset Rating Coinbase Hold Bitcoin Hold CONY Sell I'm not a huge fan of most of the crypto-related equities. I think it is more important to avoid Strategy than Coinbase. From my latest note on MSTY : ...it owns around 500k Bitcoins. These are worth roughly speaking $40 billion. Meanwhile, the company's enterprise value is around $78 billion... But until the next Coinbase earnings call (Seeking Alpha data has it on 8/7/2025) the stock likely correlates highly to Bitcoin. I'd rather just be long Bitcoin without the execution risk at the company level. However, I don't expect it to perform badly while Bitcoin is doing well. It is really the valuation (D by Seeking Alpha) and the fact I don't really believe in the long term competitive advantage that usually keeps me from rating Coinbase equal to Bitcoin. This time I'll keep COIN at hold because I prefer it over CONY and don't want to lower the latter towards a strong sell. The main reasons I rate CONY lower are the systematic covered-call strategy while AUM is increasing rapidly, the low IV on Coinbase stock and the seasonal headwinds.",IBIT|FBTC|MSTR|COIN|CONY,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-06-01 15:04:29

As the head of possibly the most pro-crypto corporation, Saylor pointed towards the growing interest among other large companies to replicate Strategy’s Bitcoin play. Keep reading to find out exactly what Saylor said and why his unwavering confidence in Bitcoin provides retailers like you and us the opportunity to accumulate the best altcoins before the next crypto rally. Companies Worldwide Are Embracing Bitcoin During his time at the Bitcoin event, Saylor noticed a surreal ‘explosion of interest’ by companies to follow Strategy’s ‘buy and HODL $BTC’ playbook. Moreover, the companies that approached Saylor during the event belonged to different parts of the world, including the UK, Hong Kong, and South Korea. This is huge because it confirms that $BTC’s rising popularity isn’t just limited to the US. Speaking of the US, it’s worth remembering that president Trump signed an executive order earlier this year, kickstarting the establishment of a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. Combined with Vice President JD Vance’s recent address to the Bitcoin community, where he said that $BTC is ‘a hedge against inflation, censorship, and unelected bureaucrats,’ it’s easy to see the merit behind Saylor’s Bitcoin stance. In addition to calling Bitcoin ‘the most explosive idea of the era’ and ‘an idea whose time has come,’ Saylor also remarked that an unprecedented interest in buying $BTC could make it exponentially harder to accumulate the asset. We think it will get exponentially harder to buy Bitcoin, but we will work exponentially more efficiently to buy Bitcoin – Michael Saylor Everything signals to this being a perfect time to buy and HODL some of the top cryptos that could pump heavily during a $BTC supply squeeze. To help you get started, here are our top three recommendations. 1. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Best Bitcoin-Themed Altcoin on the Market Right Now BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is arguably the best crypto to buy now thanks to its never-before-seen approach to following Bitcoin’s growth trajectory. $BTCBULL holders who store their tokens in Best Wallet will automatically receive free (and 100% legit) $BTC as airdrops. These airdrops will take place whenever the king cryptocurrency reaches the mighty price landmarks of $150K and $200K for the very first time. Additionally, BTC Bull Token will also regularly burn a portion of its total token supply. This will keep a check on the token’s availability, hiking its demand and price during Bitcoin bull runs. Needless to say, the best time to buy a new meme coin is when it’s in presale, which, luckily for you, $BTCBULL is. The project has raised over $6.6M, and each token is currently available for just $0.00254. Here’s how to buy it . 2. MIND of Pepe ($MIND) – Best AI Agent Altcoin for Real-Time Crypto Investment Advice MIND of Pepe ($MIND) is the perfect ally to have during a crypto bull run. This AI agent coin will identify the best cryptos to invest in on your behalf, and that, too, after carefully analyzing social trends and on-chain activity data. $MIND interacts with crypto influencers on platforms like X, where it patiently listens to their unique opinions on various altcoins going around. Next, it combines this data with real-time information from CoinMarketCap and DexScreener to find out underrated coins that are silently shaping up to become the next cryptos to explode . It’s worth noting, though, that access to MIND of Pepe ‘s actionable crypto trading signals will be reserved for $MIND token holders. If you want to become a $MIND owner, this might just be your last chance. The project’s presale ($12M+ raised) is coming to a close in less than 36 hours, following which you’d probably never be able to buy $MIND for a low price of $0.0037515. 3. TROLL ($TROLL) – Meme Coin Based on Internet Trolling TROLL’s success is proof that there’s still enough space for ‘dank’ internet users who like to indulge in occasional – and hopefully harmless – online trolling. This low-cap coin has surged over 120% since its launch in the latter half of April. Over 8% of these gains have come in just the last seven days, making $TROLL one of the top trending cryptos currently. $TROLL is currently trading at $0.02189 , and a break above the $0.023 resistance level can see it reach for $0.028. Moreover, with continued momentum, especially during a trending crypto market, can see $TROLL even claim its all-time high of around $0.040. If this prediction holds true, investors who position themselves in $TROLL now can potentially churn out 180% in returns. DYOR Before Investing in the Best Altcoins With a squeeze in Bitcoin supply likely to send the broader crypto market soaring, top presale altcoins like BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) and MIND of Pepe ($MIND) are certainly great inclusions in your crypto portfolio. However, beware that the crypto market is highly volatile; it turns and twists upon every big and small macroeconomic event. We’d advise you to only invest after doing your own research and due diligence. None of the above is a substitute for professional financial advice.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|ASIA|BTC|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-06-01 15:04:53

With the trip, he hopes they can arrive at a better trade deal for the two countries. Japan has been actively negotiating with the US, frequently dispatching its chief tariff negotiator and Economy minister, Ryosei Akazawa, to Washington. While progress has been gradual, Japanese officials say the US is beginning to show receptiveness to their proposals. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, Akazawa is set to return to Washington later this week, after which it will be decided whether Prime Minister Ishiba will make his US visit. Trump plans to add another 25% tariff on steel and aluminum products from Japan Japan is looking at a 24% tariff on its exports to the US starting next month if it fails to reach a deal with Washington. The nation is already facing a separate 25% tariff on its automobiles , steel, and aluminum products and a 10% baseline tariff, which Ishiba has termed a “national crisis.” Unfortunately, the tariff situation could worsen for Japan, with President Trump stating on Friday that he could increase tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%. Akazawa even refused to comment on the planned double tariffs imposition, claiming that Trade Secretary Howard Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had not brought them up in their last round of talks. He, however, stated that both sides agreed to expedite talks and hold another round of negotiations from June 15 to 17 in Canada. Meanwhile, US leaders Bessent and Lutnick described their most recent negotiations with Akazawa as “frank and constructive.” According to the Treasury Department, Bessent stressed to Akazawa the need to tackle both tariff and non-tariff barriers, boost investment, and collaborate on economic security and other shared priorities. Akazawa told reporters that Japan still wants Trump’s administration to drop all tariffs On Friday, Akazawa clarified that Japan still contends that the US should drop all tariffs, including those imposed on its automobiles, aluminum, and steel. At the Japanese embassy in Washington, he told reporters: “If our requests to do that are met, we may be able to come to an agreement. But if that is not possible, then it will be difficult for us to agree to a deal.” In May, Ishiba had also called for a 0% tariff deal. Nonetheless, some Japanese officials remain hopeful they can close a deal with Washington before Trump’s birthday on June 14. However, Japan has made it clear before that they would not rush to sign a deal that will not benefit their country, especially its automobile industry. Akazawa added that he was still closely watching Nippon Steel’s possible deal for US Steel. However, he claimed he could not give any details on the ongoing talks since the US administration had yet to give an official statement. On the same day, President Donald Trump told reporters Friday that the Nippon Steel acquisition deal was still in the works and needed his approval. He stated that Nippon had shown their commitment, and their deal could mark the “largest investment in the history of Pennsylvania in any deal, not just steel.” KEY Difference Wire : the secret tool crypto projects use to get guaranteed media coverage",Economy|G7,EN,0,0,ASIA|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-06-01 15:05:46

Key tokens, including ONDO , AVAX , and HBAR , are showing strong prospects. This article dives into the potential these digital assets have for notable gains. Discover why these coins are primed for significant action in the coming months. Ondo's Price Setbacks Reveal Key Support and Resistance Levels Ondo experienced a steady decline over recent times, with prices falling nearly 10% in the past month and a significant drop of about 44% over the last six months. Prices quickly succumbed to bearish pressure as weekly performance dipped over 12%, marking a clear downturn. The coin's indicators, including a negative summary recommendation, reinforced this downward movement. Historical performance shows that even moderate recoveries faced strong resistance, while buyers encountered limited support levels. The overall trend indicates that the market has largely retreated, with investors showing caution and hesitance to commit to any lasting uptrend. Prices are currently trading between $0.70 and $1.05, with clear technical levels evident. The nearest resistance stands at $1.27, while a further barrier exists at $1.62. On the downside, immediate support can be found at $0.57, with stronger support near $0.21. Bears dominate as momentum indicators show a downward bias, and oscillators hint at continuing pressure. No sharp upward trend appears, suggesting a focus on short moves between these key levels. Traders might consider a breakout test around $1.27, followed by caution if the price approaches $1.62, or look for pullback trades near $0.57 for a potential entry ahead of any reversal. Avalanche Price Dynamics and Trading Opportunities Avalanche experienced notable declines over recent periods. The coin dropped around 4.62% over the last month and saw a steep fall of roughly 60.52% over the past six months. A one-week loss of about 10.01% highlights the recent weakness in price performance. These movements indicate a significant pullback and volatility that has pressured the coin’s value over both short and medium terms. Current price levels serve as key markers for potential trading moves. With resistance near $29.97 and support around $14.51, the AVAX’s price is trading in a constrained range. Bearish signals are evident in indicators such as the negative Awesome Oscillator and a downtrend in momentum with a reading of -4.62. The RSI of 41.42 does not yet reach oversold territory. This suggests that bears currently have the upper hand, although a move above the nearest resistance could attract buying interest. Traders may look to trade within these defined levels by watching for breakouts or reversals near support or resistance. Hedera HBAR Market Overview: Price Trends and Key Levels HBAR experienced a one-month decline of nearly 10% and a six-month drop of over 46% while trading in a range of $0.14 to $0.21. Price action showed weak momentum and low enthusiasm as indicators pointed to bearish pressure. A recent Awesome Oscillator reading of -0.015 and an RSI of 36.03 suggested that selling pressure has remained strong, pushing the coin into oversold territory. This performance indicates a continued decline with no clear signs of recovery. Current trading for Hedera HBAR sees the price trapped between immediate support at $0.12 and secondary support around $0.05, while resistance is encountered at $0.25 and a stronger level at $0.32. A recent drop of over 10 percent highlights ongoing bearish control. With the Awesome Oscillator at -0.015 and momentum at -0.038, the downward trend remains significant. Although bears dominate, oversold levels may spark selective buying. The absence of a clear trend suggests a range-based strategy, focusing on key levels for potential trades while remaining cautious amid short-term uncertainty. Conclusion ONDO , AVAX , and HBAR have the potential to make significant gains this summer. Each offers unique features that could drive their success. ONDO is gaining attention due to its innovative approach to decentralized finance. AVAX is noted for its high-performance capabilities and growing ecosystem. HBAR stands out with its advanced technology and strong partnerships. These attributes position them well for notable movements in the near term.

One such example is Ripple (XRP), which experienced massive gains in 2017. In May 2025, a new contender for these massive gains is quietly gaining momentum. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) could potentially replicate the gains made by XRP back in 2017. What advantages does Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offer? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has several yield generation opportunities designed to encourage liquidity growth on the protocol. One example of this is the decentralized stablecoin, which will be minted from overcollateralized collateral. Its design will ensure that each token in circulation is backed by enough on-chain assets. Additionally, its value will be pegged to the USD via a market-based mechanism. Besides offering holders all the benefits of a stablecoin, the collateral used to mint the coins will also be actively engaged in lending pools. Consequently, the collateral will accrue interest for the borrowers. This design will ensure that they can use the collateral to offset part of the interest payment on the stablecoin borrow position. It will provide an avenue for yield generation and improve the capital efficiency of the protocol. The borrowing mechanism on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is designed to help users unlock liquidity without selling their assets. It is a great option to avoid missing out on future growth or having to pay capital gains for simply holding assets. Borrowing can also be used as part of a hedging strategy to amplify yields via leveraged positions. Additionally, it can allow borrowers to seize time-sensitive opportunities in other parts of the crypto market, without having to give up valuable assets. How Mutuum Finance (MUTM) maintains the protocol Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has implemented numerous protocol safeguards to ensure the ecosystem remains solvent. One of the first solutions is overcollateralization, which is meant to ensure the system can absorb market fluctuations. Other measures to protect the protocol are: Deposit caps The deposit cap sets the maximum amount of a given asset that can be supplied. The limit ensures that there is no outsized exposure for a given asset. The cap is often determined using on-chain volumes, price volatility, and historical performance. Borrow caps Borrow caps are a ceiling on how much a set asset can be borrowed on Mutuum Finance. The cap is great for tokens that experience price manipulation. By limiting the volume, the protocol ensures there is no chance for insolvency due to price movements. Restricted collateralization mode Some low liquidity tokens may be given this classification to ensure that some assets can only be used to borrow the same asset. If the oracle data for a token can be easily manipulated, it ensures there is no system-wide impact on the protocol. Liquidation trigger This mechanism sets a threshold for when a debt becomes undercollateralized. If the position of a borrowed amount falls below this level, the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) protocol triggers a liquidation. The liquidator can then access the debt at a discount to ensure protocol stability. These are only a few of the stringent measures that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has in place for the overall safety of the ecosystem. To verify that the system is safe for all users. The team recently subjected the code to a Certik audit, which they passed. This successful Certik audit will help bolster the case for the Mutuum Finance DeFi protocol being the safest one in 2025. Mutuum Finance presale details The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project is currently in the presale phase. Thus far, over $9.7 million has been raised in the presale, which is in phase 5. Over 15% of the tokens reserved for phase 5 of the presale have already been sold, barely a week after it started. The Phase 5 presale tokens are going for $0.03, which is a 20% increase in price from the Phase 4 price of $0.025. In the upcoming phase 6, the token price is set to increase by 16.67%. So far, over 11,400 unique participants have joined the presale. As word spreads on this protocol, this number is expected to keep rising. Those who purchase tokens in the current phase stand to make a 100% return on their purchase based on the planned listing price of $0.06. Ripple (XRP) was no doubt one of the biggest gainers in 2017. However, the crypto market is still young and growing, and new opportunities like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) present new avenues for gains. Analysts forecast that MUTM could easily outshine the XRP gains of 2017. Best of all, everyone has a chance to participate at the ground floor price of $0.03 per token.

According to the full statement from China’s Ministry of Defense, spokesman Zhang Xiaogang said the U.S. “creates disputes, sows discord, provokes confrontation, and seeks selfish interests.” He added that the U.S. would suffer the consequences if it keeps moving down that road alone. Zhang’s statement came hours after Hegseth gave his speech at the annual security summit, where he called out China directly and criticized Beijing for not sending a top official to participate. Hegseth pointed out that it was the first time since 2019 that China didn’t send its defense minister, which effectively cut it off from military diplomacy with major powers attending the event. That absence came at a time when many officials had expected clarity on China’s plans for regional security. China defends Taiwan stance, calls U.S. ‘hegemon’ In a separate response, China’s Foreign Ministry described the U.S. as “the true hegemonic country in the world,” saying it’s the “biggest factor that undermines peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region.” The ministry also warned Washington to stop “playing with fire” over Taiwan after Hegseth declared that a confrontation over the island “could be imminent.” This year’s summit structure was already out of step with tradition. The Sunday program didn’t open with China’s usual rebuttal session, where its top military voice typically responds to the U.S. and its allies. Instead, the only Chinese speaker in an official capacity was Rear Admiral Hu Gangfeng, vice president of the National Defense University, who avoided questions on Defense Minister Dong Jun’s absence. “Every time we send the delegation on different levels — this is completely a normal work arrangement,” Hu said. “It’ll not affect our explanation of our national defense policies, ideas, and communication with others or enhance mutual trust.” China’s irritation spread beyond the forum stage. Wang Xiaolong, Beijing’s envoy to New Zealand, slammed Hegseth’s Taiwan comments in an X post on Sunday. “If this is not saber rattling or fearmongering, then nothing is,” Wang said . “It will be a stretch of imagination to think that many, if any at all, in the region would buy that unfounded, self-centric, and delusional rhetoric.” Embassy and delegates criticize forum shift On Facebook, China’s embassy in Singapore posted two sharp rebukes. The first post went after French President Emmanuel Macron, who had said the world’s handling of Russia’s war in Ukraine should guide the global response to a future Taiwan crisis. The embassy called that comparison “unacceptable.” The second post zeroed in on Hegseth. “Mr. Hegseth repeatedly smeared and attacked China and relentlessly played up the so-called ‘China threat,’” it said. “As a matter of fact, the U.S. itself is the biggest ‘troublemaker’ for regional peace and stability.” Public criticism of the Shangri-La Dialogue by China’s embassy is rare. Typically, the diplomats stay behind the scenes and help coordinate logistics for the visiting Chinese military team. Despite the lack of media appearances or briefings this year, some members of China’s delegation participated in sessions. Senior Colonel Zhang Chi, who teaches at the National Defense University, asked Hegseth how the U.S. would prioritize allies versus Southeast Asian countries, considering many of its security frameworks don’t include ASEAN members. That exchange was one of the few times a Chinese official directly confronted U.S. policy during the forum. Still, China’s visibility was clearly lower than last year. In 2024, its delegation had multiple press briefings and student-led roundtable discussions with the media. This year, there were no such events. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

Trading around $2.15 at the time of writing, XRP has broken key short-term support levels and continues to drift within a defined descending channel. Despite a brief rebound attempt near $2.22, the XRP price action suggests sellers still dominate the market ahead of the weekend. What’s Happening With XRP’s Price? XRP price forecast (Source: TradingView) On the 4-hour chart, XRP price has failed to reclaim the confluence zone around the 20/50 EMA near $2.25–$2.29. This dynamic resistance, combined with upper Bollinger Band rejection near $2.30, confirms bearish control. A clean breakdown from the $2.22 support on May 30 initiated a broader correction, which saw XRP drop as low as $2.08 before bouncing modestly. Current price behavior shows lower highs and descending trendlines intersecting near $2.20. Until this area is broken decisively, bullish reversal calls remain premature.

He highlighted the case of a Canadian teenager who allegedly carried out a $37 million cryptocurrency theft. ZachXBT’s comments followed an X user’s suggestion that “wallet draining should be the death penalty.” The post received a reply from the crypto sleuth on the gaps in current legal frameworks, especially regarding juvenile offenders.

Cameron Redman helped SIM swap $37M in 2020 when he was 17 from Canada Not a single mention of his full name or photo on the internet until I posted it after he got involved with phishing / X ATOs Zero reason his name should’ve been protected or hidden https://t.co/F5uoQsD4rK — ZachXBT (@zachxbt) June 1, 2025 According to ZachXBT’s research , the February 22, 2020 attack against victim Josh Jones involved complicated money laundering techniques. The stolen Bitcoin Cash was moved through hundreds of small transactions to centralized exchanges. However, most Bitcoin was funneled through mixing services, including Chip Mixer and Crypto Mixer. ZachXBT criticized the legal protections afforded to minors in high-value cybercrime cases. He noted that “laws in Canada and EU are super relaxed, so threat actors can get away with a lot.” The sleuth expressed particular frustration with name suppression policies for juvenile offenders and stated he publishes full names “regardless of age” when investigating crypto crimes. Hamilton Police in Ontario formally charged Redman in November 2021 following collaboration with the FBI and U.S. Secret Service. Authorities recovered $5.4 million of cryptocurrency during the investigation, though $31.5 million remains unaccounted for. The case resurfaced when ZachXBT identified Redman’s alleged involvement in recent phishing attacks and X account takeovers targeting NFT projects. Given the scale of the financial crimes, the investigator noted there was “zero reason his name should’ve been protected or hidden.” Read more: NFT sales plunge 16.7% to $105.7m, Ethereum sales surge 30%",News|Bitcoin|Bitcoin Cash,EN,0,0,BCH|ETH|MARKET|REGULATION|RESEARCH,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-06-01 15:30:00

Out of the total, 376,930 were passenger vehicles. 204,369 were fully electric, while 172,561 were plug-in hybrids — only the second time since early 2024 that electric sales beat hybrids. The company’s full-year target sits at 5.5 million, and by the end of May, it had already hit 1.76 million units sold. The numbers didn’t happen in a vacuum. Those massive late-May discounts didn’t just send customers rushing into dealerships, they also sent BYD’s shares, along with other EV stocks, straight down. Automakers who weren’t slashing prices suddenly had to. That triggered backlash. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers dropped a warning Saturday, saying “disorderly price wars intensify vicious competition, further compressing corporate profit margins.” The group didn’t name anyone directly, but nobody needed a hint. It was a clear response to BYD. Industry reacts to discount chaos Traffic at BYD showrooms exploded after the cuts. Analysts at Citi Research estimated that visits to dealerships jumped 30% to 40% week-on-week. Customers weren’t waiting for prices to go any lower. They showed up fast, and they bought. The company didn’t issue statements about what the price cuts would mean for margins or long-term profits, but the reaction from industry players and market analysts was immediate. Everyone else in the EV space was either slashing prices or getting left behind. While BYD’s domestic surge got all the attention, the company was making moves in Europe too. In April, Chinese carmakers, led by BYD, took 8.9% of the EV market in the region — the highest share in nine months. That rebound came after the European Union slapped tariffs on Chinese EVs in November 2024. The tariffs slowed things down briefly, but they didn’t last. Over the past two months, Chinese brands have come roaring back. Researchers at Dataforce confirmed the comeback, noting strong growth in both electric and hybrid sales from Chinese companies. Julian Litzinger, an analyst with Dataforce, said, “The Chinese brands did successfully adapt to the new market surroundings.” He pointed out that the jump in hybrid sales helped push the overall performance higher in Europe. Chinese hybrids rise as MG pivots Chinese hybrids are starting to take up real space in the European market. Last month, those brands accounted for 7.6% of all hybrid car sales, up from under 1% a year ago. BYD is right at the center of that rise. It’s not just outselling rivals like Tesla; it’s also pushing harder into hybrid models to meet new demand. While EVs still make up the core of its growth, the company clearly sees the need to spread its bets. That strategy is now showing results. One competitor that’s had to react fast is MG, which used to be the top Chinese EV brand in Europe. The brand, owned by SAIC Motor Corp, has been hit hard by EU duties that now top 45% on EVs. Even in Norway and the UK — where those tariffs don’t apply — MG has seen its EV sales drop. The brand is now going all-in on hybrids, trying to meet buyers where the tariffs can’t reach. Felipe Munoz, an analyst at Jato Dynamics, said MG is now focused on the ZS crossover and the MG3 subcompact, both non-electric models that are doing well. Munoz added, “The focus now is not merely on electric cars but on other power trains.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Despite XRP’s struggles to maintain momentum, it remains one of the top cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals, particularly in cross-border payments. Because of this instability most in the crypto community moved on to discover other altcoins that offer better results. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up steam as more people notice its strong growth potential and the chance it provides for earning significant gains while they choose the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2025. The project is currently in Presale Phase 5 and so far has raised more than $9.7 million from 11,500 backers. Those who invested in phase 5 at $0.03 stand to gain 100% when the token goes on exchanges with the price rising from its public launch cost of $0.06. XRP Faces Market Uncertainty XRP is now worth about $2.25 which is a decline of 3.43% in the last 24 hours. The price of XRP has quadrupled since November 2024 despite recent volatility. This happened because of positive regulations set up by the current U.S. administration and Ripple’s progress in making international payments easier. Experts suggest that over the next few months XRP might achieve a price between $5 and $7. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) on the other hand is gaining popularity for its massive upside in 2025 and beyond. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Certik Audit Completed: Mutuum Finance Solidifies Trust and Transparency Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance has now officially completed its Certik smart contract audit, reinforcing the platform’s commitment to safety and reliability. Their open-source smart contracts are secure in design, instilling trust among users. Additionally, the platform is set to extend compatibility with both non-EVM and EVM blockchains, broadening access and increasing liquidity across ecosystems. Presale Momentum Many early investors have become very interested in MUTM following the price of the token at $0.03. In the upcoming phase, a 16.67% increase will make the token worth $0.035. Experts who expect post-launch prices to go up to $3 are pointing out the 100x ROI opportunity. That is why Mutuum Finance is preferred by DeFi enthusiasts who watch for affordable altcoins in the market. Mutuum Finance adds a Buy-and-Distribute system to its structure which is not typical for most speculation projects. It buys tokens on the market at set intervals and gives them to MUTM stakers, helping to gradually reduce the supply and drive people to stake for a longer time. It supports plans that help prices rise over the years and allow people to be part of the market for the long term. The Mutuum Finance Leaderboard Along with building a strong community, Mutuum Finance has launched a leaderboard that continually highlights the 50 biggest holders of the token. MUTM allows users from the top 50 ranks to get bonus tokens, making everyone want to hold their positions and work their way higher in the rankings. It connects the benefits of DeFi together with community engagement. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers early investors a potential 2x gain at launch, with strong momentum, $9.7M raised, and a completed Certik audit. While XRP wobbles the new DeFi token offers a safe haven for investors. Jump into the Mutuum Finance (MUTM) prresale now before prices skyrocket during the 2025 bull run.

With investors locking in profits and key economic data like nonfarm payrolls on the horizon, all eyes are on what’s next. This week, Pi Coin ( PI ), Immutable X ( IMX ), and Zebec Network ( ZBCN ) are among the top tokens to watch as the market searches for its next catalyst. Pi coin at risk ahead of more token unlocks Pi coin price | Source: crypto.news Pi coin will be in the spotlight this week as the network unlocks tokens. PiScan data shows that it will unlock 277 million tokens this month, with 67.3 million being unlocked this week. These unlocks come as the coin remains under intense pressure following the Pi Network Ventures launch in May. It has crashed to $0.6310, its lowest level since May 8, and 62% below the highest point during the month. Pi coin has dropped below the key support level at $0.6593, its lowest point on May 17. Moving below that level invalidated the double-bottom pattern that was forming, whose neckline was at $0.8645. Therefore, the path of least resistance for the Pi Network price is bearish, with the next target being the all-time low of $0.40.

It will unlock tokens worth $19.2 million, equivalent to almost 2% of the float. Immutable has already unlocked 90% of all its tokens, with the final unlock expected to happen in November. The IMX token price has come under pressure in the past few weeks, moving to a low of $0.5400, its lowest point since May 8. It has dropped by 33% from its highest point in May, and the downtrend may continue ahead of the unlock. More sell-off may see it drop to the key support at $0.3458, its lowest point in April. Zebec Network loses momentum ZBCN price chart | Source: crypto.news Zebec Network was one of the breakout coins in May, jumping to a record high of $0.007156, up by 925% from its lowest level in April. The rally accelerated last week when it acquired Science Card , a British fintech company with over 50,000 users. ZBCN price will be in focus this week as it loses momentum, possibly as it moves into the distribution and markup phase of the Wyckoff Theory. It has already pulled back by almost 20% from its highest point in May, and barring any major catalyst, the coin may drop to the psychological point of $0.00250.

Notably, PlanD states the premier cryptocurrency remains on course for a $340,000 price point but only if a specific support zone remains valid. Related Reading: Bitcoin Sharpe Ratio Says It’s Time For ‘Cautious Optimism’ — Further Upside Growth Incoming? Bitcoin Bullish Momentum Hinges On $91,000 – $100,000 Support Structure In an X post on May 31, PlanD outlined Bitcoin’s potential to soon re-enter price discovery mode regardless of the recent price dip. Since hitting a new all-time high at $111,970, the flagship cryptocurrency has slipped into a minor corrective phase, forcing market prices to go below $104,000. However, PlanD explains that Bitcoin’s price action has a 3-year giant cup and handle pattern that postulates the digital asset is set for immense price gains in the current bull cycle. The cup-and-handle pattern is a common chart pattern that signals a bullish continuation in price movement. As illustrated in the chart above, the cup is formed Bitcoin’s crash from its previous all-time high at $69,000 in November 2021 followed by a stabilization and recovery period which lasted until March 2024 when Bitcoin returned to the same price level. This is followed by the handle which is the descending channel as seen from March 2024 to around October 2024 before Bitcoin achieved a decisive price breakout above the neckline of $76,000 in November 2024. Despite registering impressive strides from this price point to around $112,000, PlanD notes that the Cup-and-Handle pattern tips Bitcoin to hit a price target of $340,000 before 2025. Amidst the ongoing retracement, the analyst states that this bullish structure remains in place as long as Bitcoin remains above the support price zone of $91,000-$100,000. Provided the premier cryptocurrency does not fall below this price level, the ongoing correction is expected to serve as mere pullback in preparation for a major upswing. Related Reading: XRP Price Risks Crash Below $2 As Correction Takes Hold, Here’s Why Bitcoin Price Overview At the time of writing, Bitcoin trades at $104,739 following a minor price gain of 0.64% in the past day. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is valued at $40.03 billion following a 31.28% increase in the past day. Despite this slight price increase in the past day, Bitcoin must return to its current all-time high at $111,970 to neutralize any current bearish potential. However, the premier cryptocurrency will face familiar resistances at the $106,000 and $109,000 to achieve this task.

With global trade tensions resurfacing in the past few days, investors appear to be approaching the world’s largest crypto market and other risk assets with some level of caution. According to the latest market data, the spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced more than $157 million in total net outflows over the last trading week. This latest round of net capital withdrawals suggests a declining appetite for crypto-linked financial products and the return of negative sentiment among US investors. BlackRock’s IBIT Ends Month-Long Streak Of Positive Inflows On Friday, May 30th, the Bitcoin exchange-traded funds recorded a daily total net outflow of $616.22 million. Data from SoSoValue shows that Friday’s $616.22 withdrawal marked the second-straight day of outflows for the US-based Bitcoin ETFs after seeing $358.65 million flow out of the funds on Thursday, May 29th. Leading the pack, BlackRock’s IBIT (the largest BTC exchange-traded fund by net assets) posted a daily total net outflow of $430.82 million to close the week. This Friday’s performance snaps its longest streak of inflows yet (34 days of capital influx), albeit with three days of zero netflow. Meanwhile, ARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (with the ticker ARKB) came in second, with a daily cumulative outflow of $120.14 million on Friday. Bitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB), Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust (BTC), and Fidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) were the only other US-based Bitcoin ETFs that recorded any activity on the day, registering $35.33 million, $16.22 million, and $13.71 million, respectively, to close the week. The exchange-traded funds’ performances in the last two trading days of the week pushed the ETFs’ weekly record into negative territory. As mentioned earlier, the US Bitcoin ETF market witnessed over $157 million in total net outflows in the past week, putting an end to a six-week streak of positive capital influx (over $9 billion inflows). Bitcoin Price And Spot ETFs As shown in the past, there is no doubt about the direct relationship that exists between the US-based spot Bitcoin ETFs and the price of BTC. The financial products’ capital flow slowed down as the premier cryptocurrency moved farther away from its recently acquired all-time high price of $111,871. As of this writing, the price of BTC stands at around $104,424, reflecting a mere 0.4% increase in the past 24 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, the flagship cryptocurrency has lost nearly 3% of its value in the last seven days.",ETF|bitcoin|bitcoin ETFs|bitcoin price|btc|btc price|BTCUSDT|Spot Bitcoin ETFs,EN,0,0,AAVE|ADA|ALTCOIN|ASIA|ATOM|AVAX|AXS|BCH|BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|COMMODITY|DOGE|DOT|ETC|ETH|EXCHANGE|FIAT|FIL|LINK|LTC|LUNA|LUNC|MANA|MARKET|MATIC|MINING|REGULATION|SHIB|SOL|SPONSORED|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING|TRX|UNI|USDT|WALLET|XLM|XMR|XRP|XTZ|ZEC|ZRX|OTHER|RESEARCH|APT|ARB|BITTENSOR|BNB|CRO|WIF|FDUSD|HBAR|ICP|IMX|INJ|LDO|MNT|NEAR|NOT|PEPE|SUI|TON|USDC|AR|FLOKI|ONDO|BGB|BONK|BRETT|RUNE|FET|PYTH|SEI|FLR|JUP|BSV|AGX|ENS|ZK|WLD|XAUT|CAKE|OM|APE|HNT|XDC|FTT|BTG|PEOPLE|MOG|PYUSD|AXL|MEME|RAY|SSV|ARKM|ETHFI|MX|AIRDROP|TOKEN SALE|FORKS|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-06-01 16:00:41

Here’s Why Unstaked, Bittensor, NEAR, & Filecoin Make the Cut!",https://thecoinrise.com/looking-for-the-highest-potential-crypto-picks-in-2025-heres-why-unstaked-bittensor-near-filecoin-make-the-cut/,"If you want bigger gains than the usual 2x or 3x, then it’s time to look at the highest potential crypto projects. These are the ones built to last through market cycles and offer long-term growth. They stand out because of clear use, strong design, and growing demand. From changes in AI to storage tech, the best crypto plays now are focused on real progress instead of hype. This list looks at four of the highest potential crypto choices: Unstaked, Bittensor, NEAR Protocol, and Filecoin. Each one brings something different, but all aim to deliver strong returns for early supporters. Whether you are checking presale value or future price goals, these coins might beat many others in 2025 and beyond. Let’s see what makes them interesting. 1. Unstaked: AI Tools with 27x Upside Possibility Unstaked is one of the rare projects that mixes useful AI tools with blockchain records. It is not just a concept. The team is building AI agents for Telegram and X (Twitter) that help grow and manage online communities. These agents are meant to handle tasks like support and engagement, and they are designed to adjust and improve. The idea is to make digital outreach smarter using AI, while tracking everything on-chain through a system called “Proof of Intelligence.” These AI agents are not live yet. They will go live after the platform’s public launch. Right now, Unstaked is in stage 17 of its presale. The $UNSD token is priced at $0.01043. Over $8.4 million has been raised, and over 1 billion tokens have been sold. The launch price is expected to be $0.1819, offering a possible 27x return for early buyers. This is why Unstaked stands out as one of the highest potential crypto projects. It combines working tools, lower costs than human teams, and a reward system based on output. For those looking for both use and upside, it is a strong option to consider. 2. Bittensor: A Reward-Based AI Network Bittensor offers a unique take on crypto and AI. It allows anyone to share computing power or machine learning models with a decentralized AI system and earn rewards. Bittensor is not trying to replace major AI providers. Instead, it is creating an open option for those who want something different. Users who add helpful AI work to the system earn more tokens. This reward setup has attracted developers and researchers, and the network continues to expand. The native token, TAO, saw strong price changes through 2024 and early 2025. Right now, TAO trades at around $282, which is down from a high of over $400. Some see this drop as a chance to re-enter. Long-term estimates from some analysts place it between $600 and $800, depending on how AI use grows in Web3. With real-world use, staking rewards, and its role in AI networks, Bittensor is viewed as one of the highest potential crypto coins by both builders and long-term holders. 3. NEAR Protocol: Simple Tools for Web3 Builders NEAR Protocol has been around for a while, but its recent updates have brought fresh interest from individuals and larger players. What NEAR does best is making Web3 easier to build. It offers low fees, fast speeds, and tools that help developers create apps that feel like normal websites. This makes it easier for new users to get started. More AI features and cross-chain tools have added to its growth. The token price for NEAR is now around $7.20, which is more than 350% higher than its 2023 low. New DeFi and gaming apps are going live on NEAR. Grants and partner programs are also growing. Many believe NEAR could return to double digits during this cycle. NEAR is more than just a smart contract system. It is one of the few platforms with rising user numbers and developer activity. These signs, along with strong design, put NEAR on the list of highest potential crypto projects in 2025. 4. Filecoin: Storage Power for a Decentralized Future Filecoin solves a key problem: safe and flexible storage. Unlike big names like AWS or Google Cloud, Filecoin gives a decentralized option. It uses open tools and pays storage users in its FIL token. With Filecoin, anyone can store files across a wide network without depending on one large company. FIL is now priced at about $5.40, far below its peak of over $200. Still, its use has gone up a lot. Many Web3 apps use Filecoin to save large data files, NFTs, and blockchain backups. Filecoin works with other layer-1 chains and even some common storage tools, making it easy to use. As storage needs grow in AI, gaming, and big business, Filecoin has more space to rise. Its real use and long-term vision keep it in the highest potential crypto group, especially at this lower price. What These Four Projects Have in Common Unstaked, Bittensor, NEAR Protocol, and Filecoin are more than just market names. They offer real ideas that could bring strong gains. From open AI systems and fast smart contract tools to global storage and social automation, each one solves a problem and has a path to grow. Unstaked stands out with a presale price of just $0.01043 in the current stage 17. It has a clear plan to grow AI tools for use across social networks. With a possible 27x return, Unstaked is one of the highest potential crypto picks for 2025. Its “Proof of Intelligence” setup adds open and clear tracking to AI work, which many others do not have. If you want crypto projects that focus on real tools, scale, and rewards, these four are worth watching. Always do your own research, but don’t overlook these names while they are still early.

This summer could see significant price jumps. Key levels have been identified that might spark huge gains. Enthusiasts and investors should keep a close watch on these developments. Get ready to uncover which coins are gearing up for a potential surge. Sui Coin Market Trends Amid Ongoing Bearish Pressure Sui has experienced a notable decline in recent months, dropping by 8.27% in the last month and 3.84% over the past half year. Weekly performance also reflects downward pressure, with a decrease of 10.05%. Price activity has predominantly stayed within a range of $2.77 to $4.01, highlighting ongoing market uncertainty. The coin's movements suggest a gradual retreat from prior highs, showcasing sensitivity to external market conditions and a consistently negative momentum. Currently, Sui trades between $2.77 and $4.01, with immediate support at $2.29 and resistance at $4.77. Bears dominate this phase, as indicated by negative momentum and an RSI value around 40.51, pointing to weak buyer interest. The trend shows uncertainty, fluctuating between selling pressure and brief periods of stabilization. Traders should monitor for potential rebounds near $2.29 or a further drop to around $1.05. Conversely, a breakout above $4.77 could trigger new buying interest towards $6.01, suggesting cautious trading strategies with managed risk amidst persistent bearish sentiment. XRP Moves Lower Amid Continuing Bearish Sentiment XRP experienced a decline over the past month, with prices drifting downward by roughly 2.74% from earlier highs. Over the half-year period, prices fell significantly by nearly 21%, indicating sustained bearish pressure. During the past week, a drop close to 7.53% further signaled volatility and cautious market sentiment. Historical movements reflect a period where selling pressure steadily increased, contributing to a lingering downtrend. Investors faced consistent challenges in pushing prices higher during these recent timeframes. Currently, XRP is trading within a defined range between $1.95 and $2.53. Immediate resistance stands at $2.88, with an additional barrier at $3.45, while support is observed near $1.73 and deeper backing around $1.15. The Relative Strength Index remains around 39.6, suggesting the coin is inching toward oversold levels. The market shows no clear upward trend, with bears dominating. Traders might consider short-term moves by targeting small corrections within these levels, but caution is urged until a decisive break above resistance occurs. Ethereum Shows Short-Term Gains Amidst Long-Term Decline Ethereum ’s price action over the last month reveals a notable rise of 36.21%, contrasting with a broader six-month decline of 31.22%. Price levels have fluctuated significantly, reflecting renewed confidence among buyers in the short run despite a subdued longer-term outlook. Recent activity indicates aggressive buying, which has pushed prices higher, while the overall market sentiment over the past six months has remained cautious. This has resulted in a mix of swift recoveries and gradual declines, creating a volatile environment without a stable pattern. Ethereum is currently trading between $1923 and $2961.93, with resistance around $3395.41 and support at $1318.73. A second resistance level exists at $4433.75, with another support near $280.39. While bulls have driven prices up recently, bears still influence the longer-term trend. The unclear direction suggests a transitional market, urging traders to explore opportunities near support levels for rebounds and monitor resistance points for potential reversals. A balanced approach could lead to better outcomes as the market seeks a more defined pattern. Conclusion SUI , XRP , and ETH are showing potential for strong performance this summer. Hitting key levels could lead to significant gains. SUI is poised for its next move if it can surpass its resistance point. XRP might see a surge if it breaks through its long-standing resistance. ETH holds promise of a rally if it can sustain its upward momentum. Keep an eye on these pivotal points to see how these coins will unfold in the coming months.

The order mandates the creation of departments to manage and accumulate digital assets, reinforcing long-term demand for decentralized money. As the U.S. Treasury and Commerce Departments begin executing these strategies, investors are eyeing not just Bitcoin, but what could come next. And that’s exactly where Bitcoin Solaris (BTC-S) enters the spotlight. A New Bitcoin Narrative Begins Bitcoin Solaris isn’t trying to replace Bitcoin. It’s here to complete the mission Bitcoin started—but in a world that’s now mobile-first, speed-driven, and efficiency-demanding. With a dual-layered blockchain architecture, BTC-S integrates a Proof-of-Work (PoW) base layer and a Proof-of-Contribution (PoC) reward structure to maintain decentralized integrity, while an application layer driven by Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Time (PoT) executes transactions at 10,000 TPS with 2-second finality. Where Bitcoin can be slow, expensive, and energy-intensive, Bitcoin Solaris is built for scale, without compromising decentralization. Built-In Demand Through Inclusive Mining Bitcoin Solaris flips the mining paradigm on its head. The upcoming Solaris Nova App brings mining to your phone, laptop, or browser. You don’t need expensive hardware, complicated setups, or huge energy bills. All you need is to hold BTC-S—and that’s where the demand curve bends upward. By requiring users to hold BTC-S tokens to participate in mining , Bitcoin Solaris removes supply from the open market, naturally reducing selling pressure and encouraging long-term participation. This system not only democratizes mining access, but creates steady, price-supportive demand from every user who joins the ecosystem. The Final Day at $5: The Window Is Closing The buzz isn’t just theoretical. With less than 9 weeks left in one of the shortest and most explosive presales in crypto history, over 11,000 users have already joined—and today is the final day before the presale price rises from $5 to $6. With a projected launch price of $20 and a potential return estimated at 1,900%, BTC-S is turning heads across the market. This isn’t speculation—it’s structured growth. Bitcoin Solaris has already raised over $1.8M, and its controlled token distribution ensures that value stays locked into active contributors—not early flippers. From Zero to Wealth—How BTC-S Levels the Crypto Playing Field Bitcoin Solaris Liquid Staking: Rewards Without Sacrifice Traditional staking often locks users out of their tokens—but not here. Bitcoin Solaris introduces liquid staking , a breakthrough feature where staked tokens are converted into sBTC-S at a 1:1 ratio. These liquid assets can still be used in DeFi, governance, lending, and more—all while earning staking rewards. Passive income with no lockups DeFi-compatible for expanded use Fully integrated into the Solaris Nova App Auto validator assignment for a seamless staking experience This opens the door to dynamic staking—a future-forward model where your assets remain active while working for you. Verified. Audited. Trusted. Security isn’t a tagline—it’s a requirement. Bitcoin Solaris has passed comprehensive smart contract audits by both Cyberscope and Freshcoins , and the team has completed full KYC verification . This foundation of trust is essential in today’s landscape—especially for a project aiming to serve as the “second Bitcoin.” Influencers and Analysts See the Signal The momentum is not going unnoticed. Respected analysts and creators are spotlighting BTC-S as the top sleeper for 2025. A full review by Crypto Dex World unpacks why Bitcoin Solaris is being positioned by many as the next generational wealth opportunity. This isn’t just hype—it’s traction built on real fundamentals. Conclusion: A Rare Second Shot at Bitcoin-Level Wealth Most people missed Bitcoin under $100. Fewer had the conviction to hold when it mattered. Today, Bitcoin is a macro asset—and while it will likely continue to grow, those jaw-dropping gains are in the past. With an inclusive mining model, verified infrastructure, ultra-fast execution, and real-world scalability, BTC-S isn’t just another token—it’s a second shot at being early. Backed by a government shift toward digital assets and designed with long-term growth in mind, the time to act is now.

This means that BTC may experience a significant price correction before another rally ensues. A report from the market analytics platform CryptoQuant revealed that the metrics that appear to be overheating are those pertaining to Bitcoin’s demand growth. Regardless, Bitcoin’s overall conditions remain bullish, and the CryptoQuant’s Bull Score Index is at 80. Historical data shows BTC has continued to rally, provided the index remains above 50. Demand Metrics Are Overheating CryptoQuant analysts report that BTC balances held by whales have increased by 2.8% over the past month. They also estimate Bitcoin’s demand growth to be at 229,000 BTC within the same time frame. This figure is close to the demand growth recorded in December 2024 at 279,000 BTC when the cryptocurrency surged past $100,000 for the first time. Such paces often precede a slowdown in whale accumulation, and as analysts always say, BTC needs strong demand to sustain a rally. Additionally, the Bitcoin Traders’ Unrealized Profit Margin has approached a level that often indicates potential resistance for prices. According to historical data, bitcoin’s price surge tends to slow down whenever the metric nears 40% or crosses below its 30-day moving average, which is currently at 19%. At the time BTC rallied past $111,000 last week, the margin hit 32%. This means it got close to 40%, which is the level marked for overheating. Bitcoin Falls Below $104K Analysts believe $120,000 could be the next major resistance level for BTC if it continues to rally. This is because $120,000 is the upper band of the Traders’ On-chain Realized price – here, the unrealized profit margin sits at 40%. Historical data indicate that this upper band has consistently served as a key resistance during bull markets. While BTC still faces the possibility of a continued rally, the asset had fallen below $104,000 at the time of writing. Data from CoinMarketCap showed BTC was down 2% in 24 hours, tumbling from the $105,000 level. Meanwhile, analysts have revealed that BTC investors have been realizing some profits following the recent price surge, but at moderate levels compared to past markets. Hence, there is no evidence to suggest that the bull cycle is ending; in fact, market conditions indicate continued strength in bitcoin’s upward trajectory.

45378121,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=738924,1748794957,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/45378121.jpeg,UK is pushing the Trump administration to implement a zero-tariff deal on steel exports,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/uk-to-press-trump-for-zero-tariff-steel-deal/,"The UK government will head into tense talks next week with Donald Trump’s White House, demanding that the United States immediately activate a deal to eliminate tariffs on British steel exports, just days before the US enforces a new 50% tariff on global steel and aluminum. According to reporting from the Financial Times, Jonathan Reynolds, Britain’s business and trade secretary, will meet with Jamieson Greer, Trump’s trade representative, in Paris during an OECD summit. Reynolds is going there to get answers—and push Washington to act fast on the Economic Prosperity Deal, a handshake agreement signed on May 8 between Trump and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. The agreement included a plan to scrap tariffs on UK steel and aluminum completely, but over three weeks later, none of it has taken effect. British officials admitted they still don’t know how hard the upcoming tariff hike will hit the country’s £400 million in annual steel and aluminum exports to the US. One said , “The steel situation is still unclear.” Another conceded that bringing any trade deal into effect “normally takes several months,” which leaves the UK steel industry staring down a financial cliff as Washington moves forward with Trump’s new 50% rate—double the existing 25% tariff. Reynolds heads to Paris to force clarity on trade deal timing Reynolds will use the meeting in Paris to push for real timelines. That’s the only way the UK can get a grip on the consequences of the new tariffs. Despite the May 8 agreement being described by Starmer as a breakthrough, it’s non-binding, and Washington hasn’t provided any clear signal on when—or if—the tariff changes will actually happen. Meanwhile, industries back home are in limbo. Gareth Stace, director-general of UK Steel, called Trump’s decision to hike tariffs “a body blow.” Stace warned, “Uncertainty remains as to whether and when our second-biggest export market will be open for business or is being firmly shut in our faces.” And it’s not just steel. The UK is also chasing the implementation of a second part of the May 8 deal: cutting US tariffs on British cars. Trump agreed to slash the 27.5% tariff to 10% for up to 100,000 vehicles per year. Starmer said this part of the deal could protect British auto jobs, especially at firms like Jaguar Land Rover. But just like the steel deal, this one’s stuck in the same holding pattern—agreed but not enacted. The UK already gave up market access to get those tariff cuts. In exchange, the UK government allowed more US imports of beef, ethanol, and industrial products. But none of the trade benefits—on either side—have actually taken effect. The UK government said it’s still “working to ensure that businesses can benefit from the deal as quickly as possible” and that the next steps would be announced “in due course.” Trump tariffs still moving forward despite court rulings British officials in Washington are trying to speed things up. They’ve been holding talks with the US Department of Commerce in hopes of pushing the agreement forward. One UK official insisted, “The original deal stands, in our view.” But even as the UK presses for movement, Trump’s new tariffs are charging ahead. The US Court of International Trade ruled on Wednesday that the so-called “liberation day” tariff scheme—Trump’s broad plan to reimpose sweeping trade duties—was illegal. The decision was immediately paused by a federal appeals court, meaning there’s no legal block stopping Trump from pushing his new 50% steel tariff forward. And there’s another problem: Trump’s not fully focused. Trade experts say the US president is tangled in multiple court fights and legal battles that are likely to slow or sideline any real movement on UK trade. As one British official put it, the problem isn’t the paperwork, it’s the politics. The UK, for its part, says it plans to present the Economic Prosperity Deal and all related legislation to Parliament, but there’s still no date. And the clock is ticking. The steel tariff hike kicks in Wednesday, and without action from Trump’s team, UK exporters will be hit hard.

The news was shared in a recent post on the company’s official X account, noting that XRP Healthcare did not wait for the future, but chose to build it. In its blog post , the company breaks down how it achieved this growth, highlighting its rapid acquisitions, digital innovation, and a principle-based operating model. The piece highlights the company’s expansion across Africa and the development of its AI-powered ecosystem. All these contribute directly to the utility and visibility of XRP-linked technology in the real world. Focused Expansion in Emerging Markets Rather than entering saturated Western markets, XRP Healthcare identified value in consolidating fragmented healthcare services in regions with unmet medical needs. The acquisition of Uganda-based Pharma Ville , a 7-branch pharmacy group, demonstrated this approach. This strategic move allowed XRP Healthcare to establish a physical footprint while introducing digital efficiency through the XRPH AI app, which is now available globally. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Kain Roomes, CEO, emphasized that the company operated with a clear end goal: “We saw the destination before the road appeared.” This clarity enabled rapid decision-making and eliminated delays commonly caused by external validation. The result is a functional healthcare platform backed by blockchain-based tools, advancing health access and economic utility simultaneously. Technology Deployment and Ecosystem Building XRP Healthcare’s rollout of the XRPH AI app and the XRPH Wallet positions it as a full-spectrum digital health provider with native crypto integration. These tools are not experimental concepts but live, with scalable products supporting pharmaceutical access and payment infrastructure. The wallet anchors the real-world utility of XRPH tokens, providing tangible economic interactions within the company’s healthcare system. The wallet launched swapping between XRP and XRPH in May 2024, expanding its list of features. This also increased the relevance of blockchain assets in practical, regulated industries, such as healthcare. Partnerships with established firms, including ARC Group, further support XRP Healthcare’s roadmap toward IPO. These alliances enhance institutional credibility and indicate that the model can scale with governance and compliance in mind. Outlook for XRP Healthcare This growth of XRP Healthcare is more than a corporate achievement, as it contributes to the broader XRP ecosystem by showcasing a practical, real-world utility of XRP-related innovation, especially in emerging markets. XRP Healthcare has become mainstream in Uganda . With a Letter of Intent to list publicly and a proven acquisition strategy underway, its continued success may drive further adoption and interest in XRP-backed business applications.

It also jumped as the supply of tokens on exchanges fell, signaling reduced selling. Quant ( QNT ) price jumped to a high of $119.67 in May, up 101% from its lowest point in April. This surge brought its market cap to over $1.2 billion. At last check on Sunday, the token’s price hovered at around $110.35. See below. Source: CoinGecko Quant’s surge accelerated after the European Central Bank selected it as a pioneer partner in its digital euro project . It was one of the 70 companies on the list, and its role will be to help secure the currency. The ECB partnership came a few months after it partnered with Oracle, one of the biggest companies globally. Quant’s technology is key in the Oracle Blockchain Platform Digital Assets Edition or OBP DA. Quant’s technology is helping Oracle enable interoperability and cross-ledger orchestration. It is doing this with its Overledger solution, which is a chain-agnostic solution that enables communication across various blockchains. Quant, like Chainlink (LINK), will likely play a big role in the evolving real-world asset industry. Data shows there are now $23 billion in tokenized assets, up from less than $50 million in 2020. This growth will continue, with analysts estimating that assets worth trillions will be tokenized in the next few years. This growth likely explains why investors have reduced their QNT selling pressure. Santiment data shows that there are now 1.67 million QNT in centralized exchanges, down from 1.7 million in May.

As the 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages have crossed each other, they have formed a golden cross pattern, which often leads to more gains. Quant price has formed a cup-and-handle pattern, with the current retreat being part of the handle section. Therefore, the most likely scenario is for Quant price to bounce back and possibly hit the psychological point at $150.

The most widely known of them is $TRUMP, a token associated with the political and financial community of President Donald Trump. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce had this week assured that memecoins would not be considered securities, a pointer to a hands-off approach. “People, if you’re waiting for the hope that there’s SEC protection around these, you should not have that hope,” Peirce said in an interview with CNBC . The remark amounts to leaving investors to their own devices in one of the crypto world’s most speculative corners. $TRUMP: Billion-Dollar Token, Zero Regulation Previously valued at $15 billion, the $TRUMP memecoin dropped dramatically after hitting its apex — the usual fate of meme tokens. But 80% of the supply of the token, as reported, is controlled by Trump-affiliated groups, which raised eyebrows about its purpose and ownership. Critics argue this structure causes a conflict of interest at the highest point in the government. Democratic legislators like Senator Richard Blumenthal have demanded oversight, threatening potential abuse of political power for personal gain. SEC’s Peirce: Investors Are on Their Own Commissioner Peirce equated it to the 2021 NFT mania, when the SEC also refrained from issuing concrete guidelines. She acknowledged the missed opportunity but said that memecoins fall outside the agency’s authority — unless purposefully created as security transactions. While sounding a word of caution, Peirce made no secret of it: the market is on its own, and the SEC won’t intervene. Washington’s Crypto Shift Under Trump Since the return to office of Donald Trump, the White House has become more sympathetic towards crypto. The SEC’s withdrawal from strong-arm enforcement is reflective of this shift, which is in stark contrast to previous Democratic administrations . Peirce went on to defend the shift, with the argument that past enforcement was lacking in a strong legal foundation. “We didn’t have a clear set of rules,” she said. Now that the president’s family directly benefits from a memecoin now outside regulation, the future of crypto policy under Trump is increasingly self-serving — and detached from traditional regulation.",Blockchain|DonaldTrump|Market|SEC,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MARKET|REGULATION,"{'name': 'BTC Pulse', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/85/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",btcpulse,2025-06-01 16:34:00

The demand for its platform has not yet reached the heights initially projected. The price of Cardano (ADA) has remained frustratingly low for years, with 10-year price forecasts indicating that there will be little to no price movement. Considering the new all-time high for Bitcoin, with the market roaring, the disappointment for Cardano supporters has become even more glaring. Cardano (ADA) investors have been finding solace in Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , which could become one of the hottest DeFi projects of 2025. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) represents practical technical perfection While Cardano (ADA) has worked to be technically perfect, the project has missed the human element in its design. This is where Mutuum Finance (MUTM) makes the real difference. It offers sound solutions that address the real-world needs of people. Balancing market volatility and liquidity The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) project strikes a perfect balance between raising liquidity on the protocol and keeping volatility in check. The measures in place ensure that positions that fall in low liquidity can be closed without leading to price slippage. One of the ways it does this is via stringent parameters that help to keep lenders safe. For instance, when there is low liquidity, the protocol revs up the incentives for liquidators to maintain coverage at the right level. Price fluctuations have also been dealt with on Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Such fluctuations could impact collateral underpinning borrow positions. If volatility causes collateral to dip below a set parameter, it could affect solvency. The protocol has measures in place to ensure a perfect Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. The liquidation level is set at a level that ensures there is headroom for liquidators to make a profit while stabilizing the ecosystem. Assets with low volatility, like ETH and stablecoins, are given a higher LTV of up to 75% and a liquidation threshold of 80%. Meanwhile, high volatility assets are given an LTV of around 40%, with a liquidation threshold of around 65%. These measures ensure that the protocol is not destabilized by sudden market shifts that cause under-collateralization. Finally, the platform applies an overall ratio for each asset to determine the reserve factor. Less volatile assets might be awarded a share of around 10%, while more volatile ones can rise up to 35%. This ensures that depositors’ investments are safeguarded at all times, to promote wide market participation. Benefits of borrowing on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) One of the benefits of using collateral to borrow assets is the ability to unlock collateral without selling assets. That ensures you can avoid capital gains tax while ensuring you do not miss out on future growth. For example, if you believe Ethereum (ETH) will appreciate in value, you can use it as collateral to access a stablecoin. The funds can be invested elsewhere, and the returns used to cover the interest payments. However, you retain exposure to future ETH gains. Borrowing can also be used as part of a hedging strategy to amplify yields via leverage positions. It can also be used to quickly access new opportunities in the market, without giving up ownership of your assets. Mutuum Finance presale picks up steam The Mutuum finance (MUTM) has made two recent announcements that have increased buying pressure on the presale tokens. First, they released the Certik audit report, which showed that MUTM was a safe platform for investors. Even before the ink had dried on that investment, they announced that they would release a beta version of the platform on listing day. These two announcements have pushed the token presale to over $9.7 million, with over 11,400 participants. Each token in the Phase 5 presale is going for $0.03, a 20% increase from the Phase 4 price of $0.025. Those who buy their tokens in the current phase stand to make a 100% ROI based on the listing price of $0.06. In the upcoming phase 6, when the token price rises by 16.67% to $0.035, the ROI will dip to 71.43%. Given the pace of the current Phase 5 presale, where over 15% of the tokens have been bought, less than a week after it started, analysts have upped their forecasts. They predict that MUTM tokens could rise to up to $5 after listing. A major exchange listing, which is expected to happen, could push those gains even further. Cardano investors, who have consistently prioritized utility, have already identified this project as their next major winner. At the current low price of $0.03, this is an opportunity you too should consider.

In fact, the last three years have seen a 1000% increase in the money lost to scammers via Bitcoin ATMs. 30,000 Unregulated Bitcoin ATMs in the US Bitcoin ATMs resemble traditional ATMs but are designed to accept cash in exchange for digital assets. Once this action is completed, the converted money in digital currencies is transferred to a designated crypto wallet. Often, scammers leverage this concept to cheat unsuspecting victims out of their funds, and their activities are increasing at an alarming rate. Crypto consumers claim to have lost more than $114 million through this method in 2023 alone. Scammers prefer this Bitcoin ATM method because of its anonymity and the immediacy of fund delivery. The US currently has the largest number of Bitcoin ATMs, and quite a number of them are unregulated. Australia Records 29-month Streak of Monthly Bitcoin ATM Additions As the number of Bitcoin ATMs in America increases, so does it in other regions. In December 2024, Australia reported a record of 1,359 Bitcoin ATMs operating in its jurisdiction. At the time, this figure represented about 3.5% of all crypto ATMs worldwide. According to Statista data, the number of Bitcoin ATMs globally was over 38,299 as of May 1, 2025. Even with the increasing occurrence of scams, the number of Bitcoin ATMs will likely keep spiking. Tactics Employed by Bitcoin ATM Scammers To deceive users of the Bitcoin ATM, the bad actor usually poses as a law enforcement agent, a government official, or technical support personnel. They create a story strong enough to scare the crypto enthusiast, and then add a tone of urgency to ensure that the victim takes immediate action. On one occasion, a 66-year-old South Carolina-based retired health care worker was told by a scammer posing as an officer with the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office that she was in contempt of court for missing jury duty. The scammer claimed that there was an arrest warrant out for her. She was told she could pay a $7,500 bond through a Bitcoin ATM to stay out of prison. At another time, a breach could reveal customers’ personal details.

Amid this, a new player, Wall Street Ponke (WPonke), has emerged, capturing attention with its bold claim to combine AI with blockchain for safer trading. Experts and enthusiasts alike are now weighing in: Could this be the next big 100x opportunity in crypto? New Breed of Meme Coin With a Mission Unlike other meme coins, depending on hype, WPonke has a clear mission statement . It’s more than just hype or laughs. It actually seeks to address real-world concerns in the crypto world, such as scams, rug pulls and dishonest projects. The team behind WPonke previously worked on the original Ponke project but chose to split when they saw integrity being compromised for fame. Consequently, WPonke now commits to transparency, education, and the safety of its community. Welcome to Wall Street Ponke .WITH THE $WPONKE TRADING PLATFORM YOU’RE NOT JUST TRADING, YOU’RE TRADING SMARTER SAFER AND WITH PEACE OF MIND #WPONKE $WPONKE 🔗: https://t.co/lQk6PYik7O pic.twitter.com/30dUCoIcsU — Wall Street Ponke (@Wallstreetponke) May 14, 2025 Smart Trading Through AI Integration The defining feature of WPonke is its AI-driven trading system. This technology continuously scans and evaluates the market for new tokens. It flags possible threats based on smart contract structure, liquidity behaviour, and code vulnerabilities. This proactive alert system classifies tokens as low, medium, or high risk before users make any trades. Hence, investors can make safer decisions and avoid getting trapped in high-risk tokens. This AI-first approach is a game-changer. It’s especially critical in a market where thousands of tokens appear monthly, many with hidden red flags. According to several industry analysts, WPonke’s integration of AI might not only improve market safety but also attract institutional interest looking for compliance-ready tools. Education and Community at the Core In addition, WPonke provides more than just trading tools. The project has created an E-Learning Platform that helps newcomers learn about trading. Topics discussed in the courses are technical analysis, tokenomics and managing risks. The learning experience is made fun and worthwhile through gamification. Seeing up-to-date prices and talking with others on forums makes the process more engaging. Experts expect that concentrating on education will ensure users stay loyal in the future. Tokenomics Built for Growth The pre-sale for WPonke is picking up speed. Since $330,000 has already been pledged and the target is $698,000, it’s clear that many are interested. USDT, ETH or BNB can be used to purchase the token in the pre-sale period, where staking is also an option. At $0.000263, the token is largely considered a good entry point for those looking to join early. Significantly, WPonke’s tokenomics reflects a balanced strategy. Thirty-five per cent of tokens are allocated to community-based “Frog Funds.” Another 15% each supports marketing and staking rewards. Project development gets a 10% share, while 25% ensures liquidity. This structure promotes sustainability, rewarding both early supporters and long-term holders. Forward-Looking Roadmap The roadmap drawn out by WPonke is both notable in depth and clear. The focus in the first phase, occurring in Q1 and Q2 of 2025, is to release the smart contract detector and trade platform. In Phase two, scheduled for Q3, the first preview versions of trading tools and learning materials will be presented. By the end of 2025, the team aims to have both platforms up and running, add privacy tools and give users greater incentives. By 2026, WPonke plans to introduce decentralized governance by including DAO functions and becoming compatible with different blockchains.

Enthusiasts and investors are closely watching these assets, speculating on their potential to hit the $10, $15, and $3 marks. This article delves into the forces driving their surge and evaluates the likelihood of these price targets becoming reality. Uniswap: Past Volatility and Current Key Levels Uniswap saw a gain of about 15.64% over the last month, accompanied by a modest increase of 0.54% in the past week. However, in the last six months, the coin dropped approximately 56.07%, signaling a significant decline despite occasional recoveries. This history showcases volatility, with short-term gains contrasting against longer-term losses, reflecting market instability and uncertainty. The current trading range is between $4.62 and $7.59, featuring immediate resistance at $9.12 and support at $3.20. Bulls may attempt to push prices toward the resistance level, while bears could take advantage of any retracement toward support. Oscillators exhibit a slight bearish tilt, with momentum at -0.280 and a moving average around -0.533, despite an RSI near 50 at 49.77. The lack of a defined trend suggests traders should remain vigilant, ready to act on breaks above $9.12 for bullish strategies or below $3.20 for potential bearish plays. Celestia: Recent Declines and Key Price Levels Celestia experienced a stark decline over the past month with a drop of nearly 17% and an even larger decline of over 70% in the last six months. The price range moved between $1.70 and $3.05, demonstrating pronounced volatility. These moves highlight a period where downward pressure has weighed significantly on investor sentiment, indicating a shift towards a bearish outlook over these time frames. The current trading range focuses on a support level at $1.21 and a first resistance near $3.91, with a higher resistance at $5.26. Technical indicators show a subdued momentum, with the RSI standing at 36.18, suggesting oversold conditions. Bears remain in control following recent losses of 14% and nearly 17%. The lack of a clear upward trend has kept bulls at bay. Traders might consider opportunities near the $1.21 support while monitoring potential rebounds toward $3.91. Upward Surge Amid Volatility and Key Levels Define Hyperliquid Strong performance over the last month showed a notable 62% price increase, while the half-year figure surged by 224%, reflecting significant investor interest and market momentum. A minor setback appeared during the past week with a drop of nearly 7%, indicating short-term corrections amid the overall upward trajectory. Price action over these periods outlined clear bullish advances despite intermittent dips. Analysis highlights that Hyperliquid has demonstrated its capacity for quick gains in a volatile market. The current HYPE price sits within a range of $21.20 to $42.08, with resistance at $51.47 and support at $9.73. Indicators suggest cautious optimism among bulls, although there are mixed signals from a slightly negative Momentum Indicator. This pattern indicates that buyers can push prices near support, while sellers may find opportunities around resistance. The market lacks a clear trend, reflecting both bullish energy in longer-term gains and short-term pullbacks, inviting strategic entry points for traders. Conclusion The recent strong performance of UNI , TIA , and HYPE suggests positive momentum. Achieving the price targets of $10 for UNI, $15 for TIA, and $3 for HYPE appears feasible if the current trends persist. Robust activity and investor interest are key drivers for these gains. The continued development and innovation in their respective projects will likely play a crucial role in maintaining upward movement. Investors are keeping a close eye on these assets, anticipating potential growth and evaluating the trajectory of these tokens. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

But in the background, Unilabs is quietly building momentum with over $30 million in AUM and a game-changing AI model. Both projects have massive upside potential, and both offer a compelling case for transforming a modest $200 investment into a five-figure return, but Unilabs might have an edge here. Continue reading this article to find out more about it. Unilabs AI Engine Redefines DeFi: Here’s Why It’s Trending While Ripple Foundation calls out the US SEC, and XRP price predictions turn bullish, investors have found a hidden gem named Unilabs, which can be their key to massive profits. Unilabs is the first completely AI-backed asset manager that is here to transform the way investors invest, manage, and optimize their capital. It stands out in the competitive market by offering a wide range of investment funds that align with different investor categories. These funds include the AI Fund, BTC Fund, RWA Fund, and Mining Fund. These also come along with a launchpad that offers detailed 24/7 insights on different assets across different markets. The platform’s investors also get the opportunity to earn passively by staking their UNIL tokens, multiplying their potential returns. One of the leading features of Unilabs is its AI-powered portfolio management model. It lets investors reduce risk exposure to a greater extent, as this tool automatically updates investors’ portfolios with the ongoing market trends and shifts. While prominent crypto projects have limited transparency, Unilabs is the only asset management platform that operates on a fully transparent profit-sharing system. It provides various investment options, such as yield and arbitrage, which are pooled and given to investors. This provides a regular source of profit and open access to fund performance. XRP Drama Continues: Ripple Foundation Fuels Bullish XRP Price Prediction Stuart Alderoty, Ripple’s Foundation Chief Legal Officer, has made a strong call for the US SEC to issue clear and fair regulations on how cryptocurrencies, particularly tokens like XRP, should be treated. His call comes as demand for XRP ETFs rises, making legal certainty critical for their timely launch. Ripple Foundation wants to make sure that XRP is not unfairly held back in comparison to other crypto assets during this period of regulatory uncertainty. Alderoty argues that the SEC should not act alone in determining cryptocurrency rules. He wants Congress to intervene and establish a legal framework to meet the unique nature of crypto. In addition, Ripple Foundation offered a new idea called the ‘network maturity’ test to help in determining whether a token should be categorized as a security. Meanwhile, XRP price prediction is gaining attention as analysts draw comparisons to previous bull cycles that resulted in incredible profits. According to Egrag Crypto’s XRP price prediction, XRP appears to be following a typical trend, first falling below the 21-month EMA, then rebounding rapidly before experiencing a temporary setback. In prior cycles, this setup resulted in massive rallies: one surge soared 5,500%, while another increased 500%. If history repeats itself, Egrag predicts XRP might reach prices ranging from $12 to $46 in 2025, with a target of $27 and an average expectation of $30. Meanwhile, Crypto Yoddha provides a different but equally bullish XRP price prediction. He emphasizes a developing bull pennant, a technical pattern that frequently leads to another big upward move. Based on this chart structure, Yoddha thinks that XRP will reach $5 to $10 soon. Unilabs Presale Crosses $1.75M: Early Adopters Eye Massive Gains Unilabs , although being a new project, has raised over $30 million in assets under management (AUM) as smart investors take advantage of its Early Access Scoring System (EASS). Using this tool, the platform collects the top emerging crypto projects by extensively analyzing their utility potential, tokenomics, and even team credibility. The next leading DeFi asset manager is currently under the spotlight for its viral presale that has raised over $1.75M in funding within two presale rounds only. Leading market analysts claim that if Unilabs continues to offer such real-life utility, it could potentially be the next market leader.

The spotlight shifts to Dogwifhat (WIF) as speculation mounts over its potential to hit $4 this summer. This article delves into the current market dynamics, examining which of these standout coins are poised for substantial gains. BRETT Token Analysis: Past Declines and Key Levels in Focus BRETT experienced a 15.43% drop within one month and a 72.74% decline over six months. Price data shows a marked underperformance characterized by steep losses and low momentum. Historical performance indicates that the token struggled with sustaining gains, leaving investors cautious as market sentiment turned negative. Recent weekly movements, with a decline of 16.51 percent, further underscore the persistent downward pressure experienced during this period. Currently, the price of BRETT fluctuates between $0.035 and $0.0814, hovering near key levels. The nearest support stands at $0.0171, while immediate resistance appears at $0.11, with a second resistance at $0.1563. Indicators suggest a bearish outlook, with the Relative Strength Index currently at 42.14. Bulls struggle to push prices upward, while bears maintain market control. There is no clear trend as price action remains uncertain. Traders might watch for a break below $0.0171 to signal further declines or a potential bounce for short-term trades, while a test at the $0.11 resistance could be an entry point if buying momentum returns. Dogwifhat: Volatile Performance Amid Key Levels and Market Uncertainty A one-month increase of 35.93% contrasts sharply with a six-month decline of 73.17%. A sudden one-week drop of 25.50% underscores the volatile nature of the asset. The recovery following a significant dip indicates rapid shifts in investor sentiment that contribute to inconsistent performance. These mixed results reveal a market struggling to establish a reliable upward trajectory. The stark difference between recent gains and long-term losses highlights the coin's vulnerability to swift changes in mood without a sustained rally or downturn. Current price levels show Dogwifhat trading between $0.45 and $1.32. Resistance is at $1.79, with a target of $2.66, while support is weak around $0.05. Technical indicators suggest bearish pressures, marked by low momentum and an RSI of 42.95. The absence of a definitive trend puts bulls and bears at a tactical standstill. Traders observe the $1.79 resistance for possible breakouts, while caution is warranted due to fluctuating momentum. Buyers might consider positions near the thin $0.05 support, but they must balance the potential for gains against the risk of further declines. Conclusion Brett (BRETT) is gaining attention while Dogwifhat (WIF) shows potential to hit $4 this summer. Memecoins are driving a strong market rotation. As investors look for novel opportunities in the crypto space, watch for how BRETT and WIF perform in the coming months. Their movements could highlight emerging trends and investor sentiment.

At the time of writing, Cardano price trades near $0.6610, having shed over 3% in the past 24 hours. This renewed weakness positions ADA at the edge of a critical support region, raising concerns about further downside momentum heading into early June. What’s Happening With Cardano’s Price? ADAUSD price dynamics (Source: TradingView) ADA’s recent performance reflects a broader risk-off sentiment across the altcoin space. On the 30-minute chart, Cardano price action has broken below a short-term ascending support line, invalidating the recent bullish pennant pattern. A failed retest of the $0.6785 zone has triggered an impulsive breakdown, putting pressure on the $0.6600 support floor. The 4-hour chart shows this move in context of a larger descending channel.

Georgia-based LexisNexis Risk Solutions (LNRS) says 364,333 customers are affected, according to a new filing with the Office of the Maine Attorney General. The firm says an unknown attacker breached the systems of a third-party platform that LexisNexis uses, exposing various customer data, including names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, postal details, Social Security numbers and driver’s license numbers. “On April 1st, 2025, we learned that on December 25th, 2024, an unauthorized third party acquired certain LNRS data from a third-party platform used for software development. The issue did not affect LNRS’s own networks or systems.” LexisNexis is a global data and analytics firm that helps companies manage risks, enhance compliance, prevent fraud and improve operational efficiency. The firm says it promptly sent letters to affected customers to provide more information on the security incident while offering free credit monitoring and identity protection services for 24 months. For now, LexisNexis says it is taking steps to review and revamp its security protocols to avoid a potential repeat of the incident. The firm is also urging customers to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity that may indicate fraud or identity theft.

Once hailed as the “presale king,” Solaxy is starting to lose its shine, while a new challenger with frog-fueled meme energy is turning heads across crypto social media. Meet Wall Street Ponke, a rebellion, and memecoin virality poised to become the best crypto to buy for 100x gains this cycle. Why Solaxy Whales Have Turned to Wall Street Ponke Solaxy is Solana’s first layer-2 scaling solution, and it has raised over $26 million in its presale with solid support from the infrastructure crowd. It promises faster transactions, lower fees, and developer-friendly features. But the new project lacks what every memecoin moonshot needs: a culture, a narrative, and meme momentum. It’s all code and no charisma. And in a market driven by community and virality, charisma pays. Solaxy’s whales are now pivoting to a project with more than just tech on its side. Wall Street Ponke is inspired by the chaos of the stock market and the meme-stock era, and captures the spirit of traders, degenerates, and crypto believers who turned stonks into history. With a presale price of $0.000263, Wall Street Ponke is giving retail and whales alike a chance to grab a massive bag before listings launch. The presale has already passed the halfway mark, and the hype is only getting stronger. Tokenomics That Feed the Community Here’s what makes Wall Street Ponke a beast under the hood: Presale Allocation: 35% of the token supply is being distributed during the presale rounds, giving early investors strong exposure. Liquidity & Staking: 20% is locked for liquidity, and another 20% is committed to staking rewards, fueling long-term incentives and price stability. Marketing War Chest: 15% is reserved for aggressive marketing to push the brand across platforms. This is a token built to reward early believers and incentivize holding, not just pump-and-dump action. Ponke’s staking platform is also in the pipeline, adding long-term value and usability. Final Rounds Are Closing Fast The writing’s on the wall. Solaxy may still be solid for the tech crowd, but the whales are rotating into Wall Street Ponke because they see what retail sees: energy, narrative, and upside. Welcome to Wall Street Ponke . WITH THE $WPONKE TRADING PLATFORM YOU’RE NOT JUST TRADING, YOU’RE TRADING SMARTER SAFER AND WITH PEACE OF MIND #WPONKE $WPONKE 🔗: https://t.co/lQk6PYik7O pic.twitter.com/30dUCoIcsU — Wall Street Ponke (@Wallstreetponke) May 14, 2025 Time is short. The presale is flying, followers are surging, and analysts are lining up to call this summer’s breakout crypto. For those chasing the next memecoin moonshot with real community strength and tokenomics to back it, Wall Street Ponke is the token to buy in 2025. About Wall Street Ponke Wall Street Ponke is a memecoin project born from the chaos and culture of modern trading. Blending frog meme aesthetics with the rebellious spirit of Wall Street, Ponke represents a new generation of crypto: bold, viral, and built to go the distance. With a tokenomics model designed to reward early believers, a fast-moving presale, and an engaged global community, Ponke is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects of 2025.

45379099,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69287,1748797208,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Shiba Inu (SHIB) Likely Price if Bitcoin Hits $4.87 Million by 2040,https://timestabloid.com/shiba-inu-shib-likely-price-if-bitcoin-hits-4-87-million-by-2040/,"The possibility of Bitcoin reaching $4.87 million by 2040 is drawing attention not only for its implications on BTC itself but also for the potential impact on other digital assets. One such asset is Shiba Inu (SHIB), which has demonstrated a notable correlation with Bitcoin’s price action since its inception. If Bitcoin sees this predicted level of growth, Shiba Inu could also experience significant appreciation in value. SHIB and Bitcoin Price Action Correlation Recent data highlights Shiba Inu’s close alignment with Bitcoin in terms of price action. Over the past 30 days, the token has shown a correlation coefficient of 0.72 with Bitcoin, according to analytics from IntoTheBlock . In about 60 days, this correlation reached 0.86, indicating a stronger connection between the two cryptocurrencies. This high degree of correlation means Shiba Inu often mirrors Bitcoin’s market movements, sometimes with amplified effects. For example, a modest increase in Bitcoin’s price may result in a greater percentage gain for SHIB. Therefore, a dramatic increase in Bitcoin’s price could serve as a strong catalyst for Shiba Inu (SHIB). Projected Value of SHIB if Bitcoin Reaches $4.87 Million A recent forecast from analysts at cryptocurrency platform Changelly places Bitcoin’s average price at approximately $4.87 million by January 2040. This figure represents a 4,400% increase compared to its current price of around $105,000. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Using this projection as a benchmark, ChatGPT applied the same percentage increase to Shiba Inu’s current value. If SHIB were to follow a similar growth trajectory, its price could reach approximately $0.000632. With its circulating supply remaining at around 589.25 trillion, this implies a market capitalization of $372.4 billion, up from its current market cap of $8.27 billion. Additional Forecasts from Grok AI Another artificial intelligence model, Grok, incorporated predictions from various sources, such as CoinCodex, Changelly, Coinpedia Markets, and Telegaon, to develop a more comprehensive outlook for Shiba Inu by 2040. According to Grok’s analysis, SHIB may trade within a conservative range of $0.00001911 to $0.054 by 2040. The AI model also proposed a mid-range price forecast between $0.00002157 and $0.076, while offering a highly optimistic scenario in which Shiba Inu could trade between $0.0000310 and $0.089. These projections consider not only SHIB’s correlation with Bitcoin but also potential internal developments , such as token burns, growth within the ecosystem, and favourable market sentiment. Despite these promising forecasts, Grok emphasized the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While historical data and correlations provide useful insights, long-term predictions remain speculative and subject to numerous variables. Shiba Inu’s future may hinge significantly on both broader market conditions and its ecosystem developments.

Chances are, you’d do it in a heartbeat. But in the fast-moving world of crypto, these moments don’t knock twice. The frustration of missing out on life-changing returns is familiar to many. If you’re still searching for the next big win, then it’s time to pay attention. There’s one name being echoed across crypto circles in 2025 — Qubetics . Qubetics is fast emerging as a top crypto asset, and its momentum is impossible to ignore. Built to eliminate one of blockchain’s most notorious bottlenecks — interoperability — Qubetics brings a unified solution that enhances data flow and decentralized utility across networks. Its current presale has created serious buzz among savvy investors, who understand what’s at stake: a real shot at joining a next-generation protocol before its mainnet hits in Q2 2025. With rapid stage changes and discounted pricing, urgency isn’t optional — it’s essential. Qubetics Is Building Momentum as a Top Crypto Asset — Don’t Miss This Stage Missing Qubetics ’ earliest phases is a decision many regret. When the $TICS presale kicked off in September 2024, investors had access to tokens at just $0.01. That window is gone — and so are multiple low-cost stages that offered unbelievable ROI potential. Still, this top crypto asset hasn’t escaped affordability just yet. Qubetics is currently in Stage 36 of its presale, with tokens priced at $0.3064. The project has already secured over $17.5 million in funding, with more than 514 million tokens sold and a growing holder base of 27,300+ — clear signs that momentum is building fast for this top crypto asset. With only seven days between each stage and a 10% price hike as stages progress, the urgency to act is palpable. Investors can still secure a 10% discount at the current price before the next shift. At the current rate, $2,000 gets you 6,528 $TICS tokens. If the token hits $1 post-presale, that equates to $6,528 — a 226.32% ROI. But the real excitement builds when projecting post-mainnet prices. At $5, it becomes $32,640 (1,531.58% ROI). If Qubetics climbs to $10, you’re looking at $65,280 (3,163.16% ROI). And if it hits $15? You’re staring at $97,920 — a whopping 4,794.74% return. These projections are not just promising, they’re transformative for early participants in this top crypto asset . The core strength of Qubetics lies in its real-world application. One of its most impressive utilities is interoperability — solving a crucial pain point in blockchain. Most blockchains operate in silos, unable to communicate seamlessly. Qubetics integrates networks like Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin under a singular framework, enabling asset transfers, smart contract executions, and cross-platform operations without friction. For businesses, this means supply chain systems on different blockchains can exchange data securely and in real-time. For developers, it translates to wider market reach and app functionality across multiple chains. And for users, it’s the difference between fragmented experiences and cohesive engagement across DeFi, NFTs, and enterprise-grade dApps. This isn’t theoretical — it’s already being built. Polkadot Had Its Moment, But the Spotlight in 2025 Belongs to Others Polkadot took the crypto world by storm in 2021 with a unique vision for interoperability. Launched through a highly anticipated ICO at just $0.29, the asset reached an all-time high of $55.09 — delivering astronomical returns for early believers. The DOT ecosystem gained popularity for its parachain auctions and scalable multi-chain infrastructure, earning it a top-tier position among layer-0 protocols. By 2022, institutional money and individual investors alike had their sights set on Polkadot, which quickly became a darling in the decentralized tech movement. However, much of that explosive growth is now history. While DOT continues to be a respected player in the interoperability space, it’s no longer the lone innovator. The crypto landscape of 2025 demands more: seamless user experiences, broader integration capabilities, and sustainable tokenomics. Polkadot’s early-mover advantage gave rise to impressive milestones, but new projects — ones with clearer utility and better strategic positioning — are stealing the limelight. Today, investors are no longer just chasing name recognition; they’re chasing relevance. And that’s shifting attention toward newer entrants with superior execution and opportunity. The Verdict: Qubetics and the Rise of a New Top Crypto Asset The world of crypto doesn’t reward hesitation — it rewards insight backed by action. Qubetics is earning its reputation not just as another presale, but as a top crypto asset with utility, vision, and community-driven potential. With its presale in full swing and a mainnet on the near horizon, this isn’t just a concept — it’s an emerging standard. And while Polkadot’s 2021 run was unforgettable, 2025 is shaping up to be the year Qubetics commands the spotlight. Those seeking the next major opportunity should consider this a strong call to action. This is the time to join this top crypto presale while the numbers still make sense and the ROI potential remains exponential. Crypto doesn’t pause, and Qubetics isn’t waiting either. The next phase is always just seven days away — are you ready for it?

Shiba Inu and Dogecoin , both born from internet culture, are vying for the spotlight. This article delves into the factors that could propel each coin to new heights, sparking curiosity and anticipation among investors. Shiba Inu Faces Steep Declines Amid Bearish Signals SHIB price moved between $0.0000108 and $0.0000162, dropping 5.40% over the past month and suffering a 57.30% decline over the last six months. The one-week decrease of 11.13% shows the growing pressure on the coin, with performance reflecting sustained weakness. A persistent downtrend is evident, indicating little sign of recovery during these periods. Price currently fluctuates in a narrow band from $0.0000108 to $0.0000162, with key resistance at $0.0000196 and secondary resistance at $0.000025. A firm support level is around $0.0000088, with additional cushion near $0.00000347. Indicators reveal a Relative Strength Index near 37.78, suggesting bear dominance. No clear upward trend is observable, and trading strategies may involve monitoring breakouts above $0.0000196 while being cautious around the $0.0000108 support. Buyers may consider accumulating near $0.0000088, but risk management is vital in this volatile market. Dogecoin’s Volatile Journey: Balancing Recovery and Resistance Dogecoin showed a 5.04% gain over the past month after a steep 55.41% decline over the last six months. Price moves fluctuated between roughly $0.15 and $0.25, hinting at sudden rallies that were quickly met by selling pressure. Historic swings reveal a coin trying to regain footing while still wrestling with deep-seated bearish trends. The mixed performance flags both short-term resilience and longer-term vulnerability, as fluctuations indicate that corrections are yet to be fully resolved. Current price action sees Dogecoin riding a trading range between approximately $0.15 and $0.25, with a clear resistance around $0.30 and a solid support level near $0.11. Sellers still hold significant sway, although the coin shows signs of brief relief. The trend appears range-bound, with no firm dominance from either bulls or bears. Watch for a bounce from the support near $0.11 in hopes of testing the $0.30 level. Conversely, a breakdown below support may open the door to short trades, prompting a cautious approach amid ongoing market uncertainty. Conclusion SHIB and DOGE have both shown potential for growth this summer. SHIB's recent developments and strong community support provide it with a promising outlook. On the other hand, DOGE benefits from its established popularity and influential endorsements. Both coins have unique strengths, making it difficult to predict a clear leader. Their performance will largely depend on future market trends and community engagement. Keeping an eye on their updates and reactions to market conditions will be crucial in determining which might see a surge first. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

As of writing, Pi Network price is trading near $0.629, slipping over 4% on the day and decisively below its short-term trendline support. This persistent weakness below key moving averages and structure zones suggests sellers are regaining control ahead of the week’s close. What’s Happening With Pi Network’s Price? Pi Network price dynamics (Source: TradingView) On the daily timeframe, Pi Network price action is developing beneath a descending triangle structure. The recent rejection from $0.756 and the inability to reclaim that zone has opened room for a drop into the broader demand range between $0.58 and $0.60. This red-to-green zone transition is critical—historically acting as a re-accumulation pocket before the May rally began.

In this post, which he posts almost every Sunday, Saylor pointed to the “orange dots” that mark each purchase on a chart showing his company Strategy’s Bitcoin purchases, and said that “orange is his favorite color,” meaning that Strategy will likely be buying BTC tomorrow. On the other hand, with the BTC price repeatedly breaking the all-time high price level record and the Strategy's assets also increasing, the company's current Bitcoin assets are a matter of curiosity.

The company paid approximately $40 billion in total for these assets, and with current data, they have made a profit of 50%, or $20 billion, from BTC investors.

While it started as a meme, it became one of the top cryptocurrencies almost overnight, driven by viral hype, community strength, and surprising resilience. Now, with the crypto market heating up ahead of 2025, investors are on the hunt for the next big crypto that could deliver similar life-changing gains. One cheap altcoin, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , is gaining buzz for its explosive potential, low market cap, and early-stage momentum, making it a strong candidate for the best crypto to buy now before the next bull run. Far higher than average, the project’s support comes from more than 11,500 investors who have contributed $9.7 million during the ongoing presale. Investors taking part in the Mutuum Finance Phase 5 presale will see their investment doubled to $0.06 when the token is launched in exchanges. Mutuum Finance into Phase 5 of its Presale. The fifth phase of Mutuum Finance presale has started as the platform attracts increasing investor interest. The DeFi solution provided by Mutuum Finance operates as a scalable long-term solution instead of risky meme coins. Investor confidence remains high since Phase 5 of the presale has surpassed $9.7 million total sales and attracted more than 11,500 token holders before the following price adjustment. The presale token price has reached $0.03 during Phase 5 of the presale while the launch will bring it to $0.06. Revolutionizing DeFi Lending with an Advanced Dual-Model System The non-custodial liquidity protocol of Mutuum Finance delivers decentralized lending which grants users absolute control of their assets. Through lending activities users accumulate passive earnings from lenders and borrowers instantly access funds by placing multiple assets above their loan value. The automatic interest rate adjustments of the system optimize capital structure and sustainability for the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance operates a dual-lending framework that delivers exceptional flexibility to users which features Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P). The Peer-to-Contract (P2C) system enables smart contracts to regulate lending pools that shift interest rates in harmony with market conditions. Lenders can depend on regular income, while borrowers find safe options when they borrow money. The P2P approach takes out middlemen by enabling direct communication between borrowing parties and lending participants. Any asset with volatility needs this complete decentralized model which provides maximum flexibility to users.

A conversation between Saylor and Rogan would likely cover fundamental Bitcoin ( BTC ) concepts.

Strategy also holds over $60 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. During a recent CNBC interview , Saylor highlighted his vision for the crypto industry and stressed the need for clear regulatory definitions of four distinct asset classes. Saylor advocated for legal frameworks that would distinguish between digital commodities like Bitcoin, digital currencies such as regulated stablecoins, digital securities including tokenized stocks, and digital tokens that could serve as utility instruments for businesses. Saylor stressed that proper regulatory clarity could unlock the industry’s massive growth potential. He also suggested that clearly defined categories would allow the sector to expand by factors of 100 or even 1,000. Rogan has previously shown interest in cryptocurrency topics, though he has not yet featured a dedicated Bitcoin-focused episode with a major industry figure. In 2023, the comedian called Bitcoin the most “fascinating” cryptocurrency and a top contender to become a universal viable currency.

Quant , VeChain , and Hedera are nearing key levels. Investors are keenly watching for signs of movement. Will these coins break out or pull back? The article explores whether these digital assets are set for a surge or retreat. Discover which coins show promise for growth. Quant Crypto Outlook: Past Trends and Current Key Levels Quant showed a mixed trend over the last month and the past six months. A significant one-month surge of 31.77% pushed its price upward, while a six-month decline of 15.79% indicates a period of correction and volatility. A one-week increase of 13.70% suggests that recent momentum has sparked renewed interest. Historical price fluctuations reveal a coin that has experienced rapid shifts within a wide trading range. The interplay between gains and setbacks reflects market participants testing new levels and adapting to evolving trends. Presently, Quant trades within a price range of $81.94 to $126.83, with its nearest resistance at $145.85 and support at $56.07. The second resistance point is at $190.74, while a second support level rests at $11.18. Indicators such as a moderate RSI of 61.10 show that bulls are gaining strength despite previous bearish pressures. A lack of a clearly defined trend allows for tactical moves within these levels. Traders might capitalize on short-term surges by targeting immediate resistance while managing positions near support levels. VeChain Market Insights: Decline Trends and Key Price Levels VeChain experienced a decline of roughly 10.64% over the last month, with a similar drop of about 10.75% in the recent week. Over the past six months, the coin saw a significant decrease of nearly 56.5%, showing a sustained bearish trend. Price action remained confined between $0.02 and $0.03, reflecting weak market sentiment and diminished trading interest. This period of contraction indicates the challenges faced by VeChain, as low trading activity and notable declines suggest caution among market participants, supported by recent technical signals. Currently, VeChain trades within a range of $0.02 to $0.03, with significant caution from market participants amid ongoing volatility. The primary resistance is at $0.04, while a secondary resistance is near $0.05, limiting potential short-term gains. Immediate support stands at $0.02 dollars with deeper support around $0.003 dollars. Indicators such as the Awesome Oscillator and Momentum Indicator show subdued momentum, while the Relative Strength Index indicates bearish pressure. Although bears dominate the current market, a clear trend direction is lacking, allowing for potential reversals if buying interest increases. Short-term trading strategies targeting these levels may provide opportunities, but close attention to market conditions and risk management remains crucial. Hedera HBAR Market Overview: Price Trends and Key Levels HBAR experienced a one-month decline of nearly 10% and a six-month drop of over 46% while trading in a range of $0.14 to $0.21. Price action showed weak momentum and low enthusiasm as indicators pointed to bearish pressure. A recent Awesome Oscillator reading of -0.015 and an RSI of 36.03 suggested that selling pressure has remained strong, pushing the coin into oversold territory. This performance indicates a continued decline with no clear signs of recovery. Current trading for Hedera HBAR sees the price trapped between immediate support at $0.12 and secondary support around $0.05, while resistance is encountered at $0.25 and a stronger level at $0.32. A recent drop of over 10 percent highlights ongoing bearish control. With the Awesome Oscillator at -0.015 and momentum at -0.038, the downward trend remains significant. Although bears dominate, oversold levels may spark selective buying. The absence of a clear trend suggests a range-based strategy, focusing on key levels for potential trades while remaining cautious amid short-term uncertainty. Conclusion Quant (QNT) , VeChain (VET) , and Hedera (HBAR) are showing trading patterns near resistance levels. The behavior at these points often hints at potential market direction. Observing volume and price movements is crucial. If momentum strengthens, a breakthrough may occur, signaling continued growth. On the other hand, if buying power weakens, a reversal could take place, leading to declines. Monitoring market sentiment and external factors will help determine which scenario is more probable for these cryptocurrencies. Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Daniel Liu, a respected market commentator known for his work under the VirtualBacon alias, believes XRP is still lacking the final condition that would make it a compelling buy. In a detailed analysis shared in his May 30 video update, Liu addressed XRP’s recent underperformance and explained why the ongoing consolidation phase may be constructive for the asset in the long term. However, he made it clear that he is still waiting for a major confirmation before reentering. My buy signal for $XRP is a further 20 percent drop against $BTC . This would either come from XRP falling while BTC holds, or from BTC rallying while XRP stays flat. Both cases push XRP into a strong value range. It’s a mid-cycle pattern we’ve seen before, and it often… pic.twitter.com/PAtLo49Cq4 — VirtualBacon (@VirtualBacon0x) May 30, 2025 A 22% Retracement Could Trigger Liu’s Buy Signal Liu pointed to XRP’s recent 37% decline from its January high as a normal pattern for strong-performing altcoins that surged early in the bull cycle. These coins, he said, typically correct against Bitcoin as the cycle progresses. He anticipates XRP will resume outperforming Bitcoin but not until it undergoes another 22% correction. According to Liu, “The XRP/BTC ratio chart will retrace 22% if Bitcoin stays steadily above $100,000 and XRP corrects 22% against the dollar.” Under this scenario, XRP could fall to around $1.85, a price he identified as his optimal entry point. Liu added that $1.85 is the lowest value he expects for XRP in the current cycle. He also noted that XRP has already tested its demand zone seven times since December, each time rebounding strongly. That zone, he suggested, is becoming increasingly reliable as a support level. Alternative Path to Liu’s Buy Trigger Liu also proposed a second path that could trigger the same XRP/BTC retracement. In this case, XRP would remain mostly flat around its current price, while Bitcoin would rally another 22% to reach new highs. The net result would still be a 22% decline in XRP’s ratio to Bitcoin. Liu argued that in such a scenario, many investors may lose confidence in XRP’s ability to outperform. He commented, “Market users took a similar position against Solana and Ethereum a few months back, only for the assets to stun them with face-melting rallies.” This kind of disbelief, he implied, often precedes significant upside. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Only after this retracement—whether through a direct XRP correction or a Bitcoin-led divergence—would Liu consider XRP a strong buy relative to Bitcoin. Until then, he is remaining cautious. Bullish Outlooks Remain While Liu’s strategy is conservative, other analysts remain firmly bullish. Notably, Peter Brandt has called XRP “everyone’s favorite.” Within the XRP community, several prominent figures have issued ambitious price targets for the asset. Researcher SMQKE recently predicted that XRP could surpass Ethereum in market value this year, a move that would imply a rally to at least $6. Meanwhile, analyst Egrag Crypto has outlined targets of $13 and even $22 for XRP, referencing a “bullish engulfing” pattern on the yearly chart. He added that he expects a strong “13th candle performance” for XRP during this market cycle. Although there is growing enthusiasm for XRP’s long-term potential, Daniel Liu’s current stance highlights the importance of timing and market positioning. His forecast suggests that while XRP may ultimately experience a powerful rally, a specific retracement—either through a direct price drop or a Bitcoin surge—is needed to confirm a low-risk, high-reward entry point. Until that condition is met, Liu is not ready to call XRP a buy. Disclaimer : This content is meant to inform and should not be considered financial advice.

For example, Maxi and Crypto GEMs have made bold price predictions for Solana and Ripple. While these predictions have made some heads turn for these top crypto coins, traders are also fascinated by Unilabs (UNIL) . This phase two presale star has already experienced a 30% price increase while selling over 300M UNIL tokens in one stage alone. Since it also changed the market with its DeFi asset management platform fueled by AI tech, traders are looking at UNIL as the crypto coin to watch this year. Unilabs (UNIL) Sells Over 300M Tokens (So Far!) Unilabs (UNIL) is gaining attention as it made positive headlines, while the price of SOL and Ripple price are also seeing action. Notably, this is all thanks to its outstanding initial coin offering performance, which has sold over 300M UNIL tokens in just the second presale round. During that time, Unilabs raised over $1.6M and may hit $3M before June ends. Interest in this project is high as it recently brought something new to the DeFI market – the first AI-driven DeFi asset manager. Unilabs is different because it has a Launchpad that uses advanced AI insights to spot high-potential crypto coins. It also has four specialized funds: Mining, RWA, BTC, and AI. These give users new profit streams strategically positioned in some of the most innovative sectors of the DeFi market. Demand for UNIL is rising since holding this crypto coin brings many benefits. Some include staking rewards of up to 122% APY and governance voting rights. Plus, 30% of the total fees generated on the platform will be redistributed back to UNIL holders. Currently, one UNIL costs just $0.0051, but this price will soar to $0.0062. The fact that a Tier-1 CEX will soon list it makes UNIL one of the top crypto coins to watch this year. Crypto GEMs: The Price of SOL May Soar to $1,000 Solana (SOL) is one of the best cryptos, showing some green charts. CoinMarketCap shows that the price of SOL increased by over 15% in the past 30 days. During that time, the Solana value grew from around $150 to over $170. Market expert Crypto GEMs thinks this bullish upswing will continue for Solana (SOL). According to his X post, the price of SOL is going much higher than people expect. Crypto GEMs even foresees the price of SOL increasing to $1,000. While this Solana price prediction is making waves, some traders are still cautiously optimistic. Since it has a high market cap of around $90B, a lot of new money must come in for the price of SOL to see big gains. Thus, people are looking at crypto coins like UNIL instead of Solana. Analyst Claims the Ripple Price Could Pump Soon Meanwhile, Ripple (XRP) is seeing some slight dips, although being one of the top 5 cryptocurrencies. The Ripple price fell from around $2.40 in the past seven days to below $2.30. In other words, over a 5% drop in just a few short days for Ripple. Nevertheless, the community is watching this token because of analyst Maxi’s bullish Ripple price prediction. In a recent post, Maxi told his X followers that the Ripple price could pump anytime. He predicts that the Ripple price can go as high as $5. Although this statement has turned some heads for Ripple (XRP), many investors are putting it on the back burner for UNIL. This could be because the Ripple price has soared over 330% in the past 12 months. In other words, the highest upswings could be behind Ripple. Can Unilabs (UNIL) Experience Faster Upswings Than Crypto Coins Like Solana (SOL) and Ripple (XRP)? As the price of SOL and the Ripple price could see a bullish rally soon, Unilabs (UNIL) is stealing their spotlight. Its referral layer provides users extra rewards if they spread the word about it. This factor will benefit UNIL holders since the more people join the platform, the more fees and returns there will be. Plus, UNIL boasts a smaller market cap than both Solana and Ripple. This means faster price gains with less new money. Because of this, there is a rise in trader activity as people rush to buy the UNIL crypto coin before the price shoots up.

Both Shiba Inu and Solana dipped by double-digits on the weekly charts. Amid this movement, whales are migrating to a new crypto coin that could outshine them both – Unilabs (UNIL) . This phase two presale gem has already given early buyers nearly a 30% return. Unilabs also has ties to the growing AI market as it launched the first AI-powered DeFi asset management platform with over $30M AUM. Thus, traders are considering UNIL a good crypto to buy this year. Unilabs (UNIL) Gains Attention With Presale Performance Unilabs (UNIL) is picking up steam while the Shiba Inu price and the price of Solana are struggling to pump right now. It is making headlines as its presale has already raised over $1.5M while selling over 300M UNIL crypto coins in the second presale phase alone. Projections indicate these numbers will continue rising before a Tier-1 CEX lists UNIL. Interest in Unilabs is rising as they created the first AI-enabled DeFi asset manager and have over $30M in AUM. Users particularly enjoy the Launchpad feature, which uses proprietary AI to identify new crypto coins with the greatest potential. There is even a tool that specializes in meme coins and evaluates new ones for their potential virality and risks to help users make smarter decisions. The UNIL crypto coin is the real attraction here. Holding UNIL comes with benefits such as governance voting rights. Unilabs also announced that 30% of its total fees will be distributed to UNIL holders through a five-tiered model. The more UNIL people hold, the higher the tier and rewards. It is currently worth $0.0051, but this crypto coin will soar to $0.0062 once the third presale round begins. This 21% growth makes UNIL a promising crypto to buy in 2025. Analyst Foresees the Shiba Inu Price Soaring Soon Despite being among the meme coin titans, Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen some red price charts. CoinMarketCap shows that the Shiba Inu price dipped nearly 15% in the past seven days. Shiba Inu fell from around $0.000015 to almost $0.000013 during that time. Nevertheless, market analyst Cantonese Cat remains bullish for Shiba Inu (SHIB). According to his X post, this meme coin shows a rising three-method pattern. He predicts that the Shiba Inu price may soar to $0.000021 soon. Despite this bullish Shiba Inu price prediction, some traders are still sidestepping it for UNIL. This could be because the Shiba Inu price has dipped nearly 50% on the YTD chart, which means it may be unable to maintain a rally in the long run. Gordon: The Price of Solana (SOL) May Skyrocket Soon Solana (SOL) is another crypto coin that is showing some volatility. On the one-week chart, the price of Solana decreased from around $190 to nearly $160, as per CoinMarketCap. In other words, over a 10% drop for Solana in just a few days. The community is watching this token because of analyst Gordon’s bullish Solana price prediction. In a recent post, Gordon told his X followers they are not bullish enough for this crypto coin. He foresees the price of Solana potentially soaring to $380. Although this statement has turned some heads for Solana (SOL), many investors are still skeptical. Since it has a high market cap of around $85B, the price of Solana may need to see a lot of new money rolling in for a big pump. Can Unilabs (UNIL) Provide Faster Returns Than Crypto Coins Like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Solana (SOL)? While the Shiba Inu price and the price of Solana may rebound soon, Unilabs (UNIL) could provide faster returns. For example, its referral layer lets traders spread the word about it and earn extra rewards. Plus, UNIL crypto coin stakers will enjoy up to 122% APY in staking rewards. All these factors make the passive income opportunities on Unilabs amazing. Additionally, UNIL boasts more utility than Shiba Inu and a lower market cap than Solana. This indicates faster price growth with less new money and a quicker adoption rate. As a result, whales rush to get this crypto coin before a Tier-1 CEX listing happens and a massive price spike comes.

Here’s the Significance,https://timestabloid.com/500-million-xrp-in-24-hours-heres-the-significance/,"XRP recently witnessed a remarkable surge in on-chain movement, with over 500 million tokens transacted within a single day on May 30, 2025. While such a spike typically sparks excitement about rising demand or major settlements, the market’s price behavior tells a far less optimistic story. XRP Price Wobbles Despite On-Chain Surge On-chain activity for XRP surged impressively, but the price charts reveal a far less enthusiastic picture. Despite the wave of transfers, XRP’s price action remains subdued, clinging just above a crucial support zone. On the daily XRP/USDT chart, the asset has slipped below its 50-day moving average, a key short-term indicator. The asset is now testing the 200-day moving average, which traditionally acts as a longer-term support level. Earlier in May, XRP managed a short-lived breakout from a descending triangle, only to fizzle out. By the close of May 30, XRP settled at $2.14, reflecting a 1.5% daily loss, evidence of the ongoing weakness that continues to dog the asset despite on-chain fireworks. Technicals Hint at Weak Momentum Looking deeper into momentum indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) currently hovers at 38.55, hovering just above oversold territory. This suggests that while sellers retain the upper hand, bearish momentum may be fading. This is further complicated by a significant drop in trading volume since April, indicating waning interest from both retail traders and speculators. Importantly, the sharp increase in on-chain movement isn’t necessarily reflective of fresh market demand. The 500 million XRP transfer on May 30 was likely related to exchange activity or internal wallet restructuring by major holders, rather than organic buying pressure. Without a corresponding price increase, these large transactions typically indicate internal movements rather than a genuine bullish signal. Potential Price Scenarios Ahead From a technical perspective, XRP remains precariously positioned. A decisive break below the 200-day moving average could open the door to further declines, with the next support levels sitting near $2.00 and possibly even $1.90. For bulls to regain control, a strong push back above the 50-day moving average, around $2.26, is essential. Without that, the broader trend remains corrective rather than impulsive.

Currently, those conditions are not yet in place. Noise or Signal? In summary, while the headlines may focus on the massive 500 million XRP moved within 24 hours, the absence of meaningful price confirmation makes this more of a back-end event than a market-moving one. For traders and investors, the takeaway is clear: unless on-chain spikes translate into price action, they’re often just noise. Though the current setup is not particularly bullish, XRP still commands attention; the sheer size of its on-chain transactions keeps it central to the broader market narrative. For now, the asset remains in a waiting game, needing stronger price signals before any meaningful recovery can take shape.
