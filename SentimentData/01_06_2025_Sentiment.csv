45343071,https://timestabloid.com/?p=69230,1748726109,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/67/default.png,Here’s how XRP Could Hit $100 Price Milestone,https://timestabloid.com/heres-how-xrp-could-hit-100-price-milestone/,"The XRP Ledger is beginning to realize its foundational goal of supporting asset tokenization on a large scale. In 2025, the network has witnessed increased traction from institutions seeking to digitize real-world assets, and this trend could become a key factor in propelling XRP to a significantly higher valuation, potentially as high as $100 . Effect of Increased Institutional Adoption XRP’s price movement has historically been influenced by its utility in cross-border transactions, but tokenization may now represent a new growth catalyst. Analysts argue that as more institutions adopt XRPL to digitize real-world assets, such as real estate, private equity, or government bonds, XRP will be in greater demand to facilitate these transactions. Because XRP serves as a bridge asset on the ledger, large-scale tokenization may require institutional participants to hold substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency. This would effectively remove a portion of XRP’s circulating supply from open markets. As demand increases and accessible supply diminishes, market dynamics could shift in favour of higher prices. This scenario, grounded in classic supply and demand theory, suggests that if XRPL’s utility in tokenization continues to expand and institutions continue accumulating XRP, the resulting scarcity could put strong upward pressure on the token’s value. Technological Enhancements Supporting XRPL Tokenization To support these developments, Ripple has implemented multiple updates aimed at making XRPL more suitable for institutional use. In Q3 2024, Ripple introduced the Multi-Purpose Token (MPT) standard. MPTs are designed to function as hybrid tokens, offering both fungible and non-fungible characteristics. They also enable the inclusion of additional data, such as legal terms or asset-specific metadata, making them highly useful for financial institutions. Another critical upgrade came in October 2024, when XRPL integrated Decentralized Identity (DID) capabilities. This feature ensures that tokenized assets on the ledger can comply with regulatory frameworks, including Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) policies. These improvements are essential for attracting serious institutional participants seeking regulatory-compliant infrastructure for asset digitization. Practical Implementations Gaining Traction Several initiatives launched in 2025 reflect growing institutional interest in XRPL-based tokenization. One major example is a collaboration between the Dubai Land Department and the Dubai Future Foundation. This partnership resulted in a $16 billion real estate tokenization platform built on XRPL, allowing individuals to invest in property with as little as AED 2,000. The project has already attracted over 3,000 investors and offers reduced transaction costs. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Other firms are also exploring the ledger’s capabilities. Aurum Equity Partners has introduced a $1 billion tokenized fund encompassing private equity and debt instruments, while Ripple’s partnership with Ondo Finance aims to bring tokenized U.S. Treasury products to XRPL. Ripple’s Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, has emphasized the growing role of XRPL in facilitating real-world asset tokenization. His remarks at the Apex 2023 developer summit affirmed that the network is increasingly being viewed as a reliable platform for institutional-grade projects. Market Limitations and Cautionary Notes While the long-term prospects appear promising, there are notable limitations to the idea that XRP could reach $100 in the near term. Such a valuation would imply a market capitalization of approximately $5.9 trillion, far exceeding the current total cryptocurrency market cap, which is around $3.33 trillion. For XRP to attain that value, the entire digital asset market would need to grow substantially. At present, the token is priced at $2.19. Achieving the $100 milestone would require a 4,466% increase, which analysts agree would only be plausible under conditions of explosive industry-wide growth and sustained institutional demand. The XRPL’s expanding role in tokenization and its technological upgrades have positioned it as a viable platform for institutional adoption. If demand continues to rise while the available XRP supply contracts due to increased holding by institutions, upward price movement could follow. However, reaching the $100 target would depend heavily on broader market growth and continued utility-driven adoption.

For new participants in digital assets, choosing the right entry points is crucial. The ideal assets for beginners combine usability, clear utility, and community-driven growth, rather than simply chasing hype or volatility.This week, three standout projects exemplify this principle. Qubetics ($TICS) is emerging as a breakout leader, offering a feature-rich ecosystem that prioritizes accessibility and privacy, notably through its decentralized VPN. Meanwhile, Bittensor (TAO) and Cosmos (ATOM) represent cornerstone protocols with proven infrastructure and network effects. Each serves a distinct role in the blockchain world, but all are considered among the best cryptos for beginners seeking long-term utility and technological credibility. Qubetics (TICS): Redefining Privacy with a Decentralized VPN Network Qubetics continues to attract significant attention as one of the best cryptos for beginners , driven by a practical approach to digital privacy and cross-chain access. Among its most compelling features is the Decentralized VPN (dVPN) built into the Qubetics ecosystem. This innovative infrastructure offers secure, anonymous internet access without relying on centralized VPN providers—effectively eliminating single points of failure, censorship risks, and user tracking. The Qubetics dVPN allows users to route traffic through decentralized nodes, creating a dynamic network that enhances anonymity and resilience. For professionals handling sensitive client data, journalists operating in restrictive jurisdictions, or everyday users accessing geo-restricted content, the Qubetics VPN provides uncompromised security. It also opens new revenue models, enabling individuals to monetize unused bandwidth as node operators—fostering a community-powered privacy economy. Enterprises can integrate this decentralized VPN directly into internal systems, ensuring that employees and departments across geographies connect through secure channels without dependence on legacy providers. For example, a fintech startup managing international transactions can utilize Qubetics’ VPN for encrypted backend operations, reducing vulnerability to surveillance and cyber-attacks. Analysts’ Projections for $TICS In parallel with these utility-driven innovations, Qubetics is executing the most successful crypto presale of 2025. The platform has now entered its 36th stage, selling over 514 million $TICS tokens to more than 27,300 holders, with $17.5 million raised. The current price is $0.3064 per token. Analysts tracking Qubetics have forecasted various growth trajectories depending on user adoption and integration levels. A post-presale valuation of $1 suggests a 226% ROI, while mid-range targets of $5 and $6 offer 1,531% and 1,857% returns respectively. At $10, the return exceeds 3,163%, and at $15 following the mainnet launch, community participants could see up to 4,794% ROI. Qubetics combines essential digital privacy through decentralized VPNs with real-world interoperability and growing early adoption.

Ryan Yi, a former member of Coinbase Ventures, the investment arm of the U.S.’s largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, thinks that the exchange could still acquire Circle. Coinbase USDC Shares Records Growth According to an X post, Yi suggested that Coinbase would capitalize on USDC’s growing importance by acquiring Circle. The publicly traded company has a share of USDC circulation, and over the years, this share has experienced tremendous growth. In Q1 2025 alone, Coinbase USDC shares increased to 23% of the total supply of the stablecoin, reflecting massive growth. It is, therefore, little wonder that the USD-pegged stablecoin ranks as the second-largest source of Coinbase revenue. On this basis, Yi says that the acquisition of Circle would help the crypto exchange fully capture the revenue around USDC. Coinbase and Ripple in Battle to Acquire Circle Unfortunately, Coinbase is not the only company bidding to take over Circle’s stablecoin system . While the crypto exchange is having informal talks with the USDC issuer, San Francisco-based Ripple offered Circle $5 billion. The firm later rejected this particular offer because it was small. At first, Ripple was unsure whether to try again or walk away from the bid. However, once Coinbase came into the picture, the competition became steep, and the blockchain payment firm more than doubled its offer to $11 billion in cash and XRP. Until now, the terms of Coinbase’s offer remain unknown. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently stated that Ripple’s acquisition of Circle will benefit the broader crypto market. He noted that it could make the industry more open and fair. Circle Files For IPO, Plans to List Shares on NYSE Amidst these acquisition talks, Coinbase is focusing its attention on going public before this year ends. The company officially filed for an IPO just before the end of May , citing that it plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “CRCL.” The firm is targeting an IPO valuation of up to $5.65 billion. This fund will come from the company selling about 9.6 million new shares, while current shareholders will sell another 14.4 million. Circle is looking forward to getting support from some of the biggest names in finance, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and many others. The IPO filing suggests that neither Coinbase nor Ripple will acquire the company.

45343946,https://nulltx.com/?p=150129,1748727765,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Wallet Connect Token Experiences Volatile Price Movements Amid High Trading and Staking Activity,https://nulltx.com/wallet-connect-token-experiences-volatile-price-movements-amid-high-trading-and-staking-activity/,"The Wallet Connect Token (WCT) has been one of the most discussed cryptocurrencies in the past month, exhibiting pronounced price volatility that has caught the attention of traders and investors far and wide. According to a May 20 article on the Binance blog, WCT’s price pumped from a meager $0.35 at the start of the month to a stunning (and suspicious, in retrospect) peak above $1.30 – an approximately 270 percent increase in just two weeks. According to Binance data, WCT surged from $0.35 to above $1.3 over the past month, but in the last two days, WCT has plummeted sharply, halving to around $0.65. In the past 24 hours, South Korea's largest exchange, Upbit, recorded a WCT/KRW trading volume of $558 million,… — Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) May 31, 2025 However, WCT’s price promptly plummeted over the weekend, falling back down to around $0.65 by May 21 and thus appearing to have given back about half its earlier gains in what some might call a “get-rich-quick scheme” gone wrong. Even with the actual price movements, we see an ecosystem that is highly active and engaged around WCT. South Korea’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, Upbit, has emerged as a major venue for trading WCT. They account for a large part of the global WCT trading volume right now. And staking with Wallet Connect continues to see robust participation in my opinion; tens of thousands of stakers have locked up millions of tokens for long-term holds. Sharp Price Surge and Sudden Correction WCT’s price moved in surprising ways over the last month. Starting from near $0.35, the token surged ahead, seemingly unanchored by anything other than the rising interest in and adoption of the Wallet Connect protocol. By half-past the month, WCT crossed the $1.3 threshold, making it appear as if WCT might be a solid buy at some point last month. The positive progress of the Wallet Connect ecosystem helped partly to fuel this rally. It has, for one, extended its partnerships to a much greater degree than before. And it is now celebrating an upsurge in the use of its decentralized wallet connection technology. Traders sensibly concluded that the development was an opportunity to invade the exchanges en masse and push prices higher. The euphoria was, however, short-lived. Within just 48 hours, WCT witnessed a sharp turnaround. The token’s price sank to nearly 50%, before recovering to the mid-$0.60 levels. Mid-level market corrections of this nature are not uncommon in the crypto space. But the suddenness and size of this downturn have certainly captured the attention of more than just WCT investors. Market analysts are now casting shared speculative nets over a few probable causes, including: 1. Profit-taking by early investors. 2. Broad market conditions. 3. Concentrated trading on certain exchanges. WCT Upbit Leads with Massive Trading Volume The recent price action has a key element, which is the oversized role that Upbit, South Korea’s largest exchange, has been playing. Just in the last 24 hours, the trading volume clocked by Upbit for WCT/KRW was $558 million. That figure is not just a number; it makes Upbit that much more relevant a player in the WCT space, as this accounts for about 35% of the total global trading volume for WCT. This gives insight into something that had not been in focus, which is the role of South Korean traders in WCT. WCT trading is concentrated at Upbit, which means there is regional interest and liquidity in the token. South Korean crypto investors have been major players in many digital asset markets. For this reason, and because WCT has been trading at a premium on Upbit, we take the above as indications of investor confidence in the long-term performance of this token. Upbit’s trading volume is high. This means that if someone decides to buy a large amount of something and a few people working for the exchange also decide to buy, then by the time you could buy, the price has already gone up. And conversely, if a big sell order comes through, these kinds of price movements can influence the sentiment that others have about the whole market. Wallet Connect Staking Growth Reflects Strong Community Engagement Apart from trading, the staking platform of Wallet Connect portrays an enlightening picture depicting a devoted and burgeoning user base. At present, there exist 47,439 stakers who have collectively committed an excess of 120 million WCT tokens to the staking contract. This sizeable amount of staked tokens bodes well for the sorts of governance and security undertaken by the Wallet Connect network. 47,439 stakers. 120M+ WCT already staked. 119,839 WCT rewards distributed this week alone. Staking takes seconds, secures the network, and puts your WCT to work. Here's how pic.twitter.com/jmhKkh46XR — WalletConnect (@WalletConnect) May 30, 2025 Complementing this image of the platform’s active engagement with the community, it distributed rewards in the past week alone of nearly 120,000 WCT in staking rewards. This ongoing incentive for holders to stake their tokens, thus contributing to a reduced circulating supply, is yet another potential mechanism for price stability over time. Since we started discussing this, by the way, I’ve noticed price actions seemingly toning down as well. The increase in staking activity shows that, in spite of recent price swings, the Wallet Connect ecosystem is growing and allowing us to participate in a way that feels now, as it did in the past, much more intimate. For holders, staking is a way to gain when the protocol gains but also a way to bolster the protocol’s long-term resilience. Looking Ahead: Navigating Volatility and Opportunity The recent surge in price and the subsequent correction of WCT offer a clear view of the challenges and opportunities of moving too quickly in the crypto markets. Not every project is as firmly rooted in a community, and not every project offers as much exposure to future price action as WCT does. But for investors in projects like WCT, this is a lesson to be learned. People in the market will probably keep a close eye on how the token does in the next several weeks—especially since the broader market is changing. For holders who are in it for the long term and for fresh investors, figuring out the imbrication of trading activity, regional markets, and staking will be crucial to making any kind of assessment about WCT’s future. At the same time, the expanding network of Wallet Connect and the continuing staking rewards present a strong and compelling base that may enable the token to ride out its present volatility and possibly command further upward price action in the next several months.

45344009,https://nulltx.com/?p=150128,1748727862,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,FTX Begins Second Phase of $5 Billion Fund Distribution to Creditors,https://nulltx.com/ftx-begins-second-phase-of-5-billion-fund-distribution-to-creditors/,"FTX , the cryptocurrency exchange, has now started round two of sending back funds to its users. The exchange has returned to the convenience class creditors and is considering the next steps for those in the non-convenience class. That means if you traded on the exchange and didn’t send over a passport picture, you might still get some crypto back. To the extent that FTX can return some of these assets, that’s a positive development, said James Murphy, an associate professor at American University’s Washington College of Law. The firm has announced that qualifying customers should see their funds credited to their accounts within one to three business days from the time of the announcement. This is an initial step in what promises to be a rather long recovery for creditors following FTX’s sudden collapse. Understanding the Second Distribution: Who Benefits and What to Expect The second distribution from FTX bankrupt estate marks one of the biggest single-payout moments of the whole bankruptcy case. This time, 5 billion dollars is being handed over in a kind of 50-50 split between two main categories of creditors: the convenient class and the non-convenient class. Now, the convenient class, according to FTX and its lawyers, generally includes smaller account holders with balances below 1 million dollars, while the non-convenient class includes anyone with an account balance above that threshold. So, in the convenient class, we’ve got a bunch of smaller account holders, and in the non-convenient class, we’ve got larger account holders and what seems to be a lot of institutional clients. (1/3) FTX today announced that it has commenced the Second Distribution of more than $5 billion to holders of allowed claims in the Plan’s Convenience and Non-Convenience Classes that have completed the pre-distribution requirements. — FTX (@FTX_Official) May 30, 2025 For creditors to be included in this second distribution, they were required to finish some verification steps and submit the essential documentation that confirms their claims as valid. Payouts only went to accounts that had completed these steps and were therefore eligible for distributions. Meanwhile, FTX’s attorneys and restructuring team have been working intensively behind the scenes to verify as many claims as possible and ensure that the integrity of the process is above board. Cash should arrive in creditors’ accounts within a few days, so lots of folks are apparently seeing movement on their accounts. For most, movement means something along the lines of this tweet from BlackLine customer account recovery director Joe Kavanagh: “@BlackLine has processed and successfully accounted for the cash received from our unsecured creditors. Thank you for your hard work and transparency in this process!” Security Alert: FTX Warns Against Phishing Scams In conjunction with the announcement of the distribution, FTX also issued an essential security reminder. This reminder was aimed at protecting customers from the upsurge of phishing scams and fraudulent websites attempting to mimic official FTX communications. Since the exchange’s collapse, scam actors have exploited the customer uncertainty created by these events. They have done so by sending deceptive emails and creating fake portals that look like FTX’s official platforms. FTX advises users to exercise extreme caution when receiving any email or link purporting to be from the company. The announcement emphasized that all legitimate communications will originate from verified channels, and implored customers not to click on any links that look even somewhat suspicious or to furnish any amount of sensitive information on sites that are not quite as secure as Fort Knox. This warning comes as an especially critical reminder because customers are getting ready to receive large amounts of money back into their accounts. During times of high customer activity, scammers step up their game in trying to steal login info and personal details. Customers can stay a couple of steps ahead of these threats by being on the lookout and confirming that the communications they’re receiving are actually from the companies they do business with. What the Future Holds for FTX Creditors Although the second distribution is a momentous step, it is just one part of what is an all-too-regular appearance of this ongoing, larger process. The appearances may seem familiar, but the plot is not yet resolved. As FTX keeps going with its long, somewhat drawn-out bankruptcy saga, it and we too can expect some more asset-recovery appearances and creditor claim-finalization appearances, with some releases in between. Here is the latest appearance. For a lot of people, this second payment could almost be like a hug. It may be as close to an apology as we get from FTX. And in the absence of such an apology, companies going under historically haven’t been very good at saying sorry. My excuse-making earlier in this piece aside, this payment could almost position FTX as a better actor than the normal Chapter 11 players. Figuring out what happens next requires remembering that FTX is a global company. Meanwhile, clients must keep themselves updated via FTX’s official communication channels, make sure they complete any remaining tasks that concern them, and follow any and all security notifications that come from the exchange. FTX’s promise to be as upfront and engaging with its creditors as possible is, within my view, crucial to the rebuilding of trust that is necessary for any kind of meaningful resolution to occur. This latest distribution marks a crucial step forward in an unprecedented chapter of crypto history. For the thousands affected, it brings hope that the recovery process is tangible and progressing, even as many challenges remain to be addressed in the months to come.

45344060,https://nulltx.com/?p=150127,1748727973,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,NATIX and Bittensor Unite to Pioneer Decentralized AI Mining for Real-World Autonomy,https://nulltx.com/natix-and-bittensor-unite-to-pioneer-decentralized-ai-mining-for-real-world-autonomy/,"A new decentralized AI frontier is forming that combines the gathering of physical data, a distributed machine learning infrastructure, and tokenized incentives to produce even smarter, real-world artificial intelligence. Leading this evolution is NATIX Network, a decentralized sensor platform that is changing how we gather, process, and deploy the kind of data that underpins autonomous driving. NATIX is moving from merely gathering sensor data to using it to train artificial intelligence models in earnest, and it has done this by establishing a dedicated subnet on Bittensor, a decentralized AI compute protocol. This move is nothing less than a leap in the architecture of AI, an evolution that emphasizes the use of real-world data over synthetic “training sets” and, in this case, “rewards” competitive performance with “real” economic value. Street-Level Video Becomes Training Fuel in Subnet 72 This development’s beating heart is Subnet 72, known as StreetVision. It is NATIX’s new home for crowdsourced video data. This data, when raw and freshly captured, comes from a global fleet of a quarter of a million drivers who have signed on to participate in NATIX’s venture. These drivers have mapped over 170 million kilometers. Their trajectory takes them through every conceivable real-world context—from journeys that are unremarkable to those encompassing something really unusual. These are the kinds of adventures that yield traffic signals, construction detours, and other road videos—such as the footage that an American driver made of the unfurling of a tornado while he was inside the funnel cloud. On Subnet 72, decentralized AI participants — often referred to as miners — compete to process the incoming video data, pinpointing aspects of the feed that it is essential to recognize if one is going to navigate the virtual world constructed from this real-world input. Each participant runs a particular model or set of models, usually within the family of AI algorithms known as deep learning, to derive the insights that Bittensor needs to make sense of the data it receives. 1/ Decentralized Physical AI meets AI mining. @natixnetwork ’s new Bittensor subnet transforms crowdsourced street-level video into deployable AI models for autonomous driving and mapmaking. Real-world sensors → decentralized training → smarter AI agents. pic.twitter.com/IXcvFxPzYw — Blockworks Research (@blockworksres) May 30, 2025 The continuous feedback loop is created through this process. Data collected from the real world immediately trains and fine-tunes AI models, which are then put back into NATIX’s edge devices. These include intelligent dashcams and the mobile sensors that drivers in the network use. The result is a system where the development of the AI doesn’t happen in some far-off lab but is intimately connected to real-world usage and is tested in the kinds of environments that serve its purpose. Decentralization, Incentives, and Real-Time Deployment What differentiates NATIX’s approach is its devotion to every layer of decentralization—from data acquisition to model training and deployment. Where centralized systems demand proprietary infrastructure and siloed datasets, NATIX and Bittensor rely on open participation and competition to propel innovation. Not only does this structure make AI development accessible for all, but it also democratizes the process when it comes to performance. With miners pitted against one another in a contest to see who can build the best model, the subnet is setting up an incredibly effective incentive to continuously iterate and optimize. The outcome? Better models, better data extraction, and better navigation tools—and then some. It is significant that this procedure does not merely end with the formation of the model. The outputs from the subnet are put to work immediately in real time on the edge device. This means that the AI isn’t just trained on the most recent data; it’s actual learning from it live and using it to continuously shape its own future performance. The implication of this is of massive magnitude: self-updating maps, self-driving cars that can shift with the changing environment, and urban analytics that are created as a kind of continuous performance from street-level devices. Tokenomics Reinforce Long-Term Alignment Driving this innovation is a meticulously designed incentive system. Emissions from the $TAO token power Subnet 72, which compensates AI miners for their work. But NATIX has gone a step further, committing to reinvest emissions back into the ecosystem via buybacks and token burns. This deflationary mechanism adds long-term value to the system and keeps platform growth and token health in alignment. At the same time, parallel liquidity pools for dynamic TAOs help maintain value and stimulate even more participation. These pools are set up to allow the AI miners and participants to have immediate access to liquidity. At the same time, they’re set up to allow long-term staking strategies and reinvestment strategies, which are designed to benefit the network as a whole. The mechanisms work in unison to create a closed economic loop. Data provides the fuel; AI provides the power; insights generate the value. And that value reinforces the system that made it possible. A Glimpse Into the Future of Decentralized AI The collaboration between NATIX and Bittensor shows a daring vision of what decentralized AI can be when it’s based on real-world data, near real-time feedback, and economic incentives. This isn’t just about training better, more intelligent models — it’s about constructing a system that can learn from the real world, get better with every passing moment, and make intelligent use of the contributions that its various denizens make to its workings. This model could completely change our conception of autonomous navigation, and even infrastructure planning, the sorts of things one might be tempted to call maps. NATIX is an AI living system — a loop, not in the lab, but with the streets of an urban world as its setup. Subnet 72 is developing toward something that could well be a new kind of AI: decentralized, deployable, and not driven by confined research-lab innovation but by the kinds of street-level realness that makes everything we talk about with respect to crypto and web3 a potential reality. Where does that leave your average AI researcher? Well, for just a moment, let’s leave the average researcher out of it. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

No more has this been true than on the fresh frontier of Virtuals Genesis, a speculative new zone for on-chain launches. As some virtual projects seek to establish themselves, a handful of contenders has vaulted to the front of the pack, reaping outsized returns on early investments and catching the eye of discerning critics. The front-runners are two tokens: $VIRGEN from the Virgen ecosystem and $SOLACE from Solace Launch. Counting these two as the leading tokens, at their peak, they have rewarded their presale participants with incredible returns, with $VIRGEN delivering a 132x return on investment (ROI) and $SOLACE not far behind at 130x. Top Virtuals Genesis performers as per their ATH ROI's Which one did you participate? $Virgen @virgen_official is the top performer with a 132x return (at peak price) for presale participants, closely followed by $Solace @solacelaunch at 130x Data provided by @WhaleintelAI … pic.twitter.com/MrrECSd6Nd — 100xDarren (@100xDarren) May 31, 2025 Virgen ($VIRGEN): The Best Performer of the Bunch Leading the ROI leaderboard is $VIRGEN, with an impressive peak return of 132x for early investors. In fact, it’s the most successful token launch to date under the Virtuals Genesis framework — a shining example of not just market enthusiasm, but project execution as well. Virgen’s place in the broader ecosystem seems to be hitting all the right notes. It’s a blend of utility, tokenomics, and community that is, at least for now, taking $VIRGEN places. However, it is not just the record-breaking price of $VIRGEN that makes it stand out; it’s also the fact that large stakeholders are consistently and confidently accumulating it. And the on-chain data from last month says it all. In a very clear and unmistakable signal of confidence, the top 100 wallets, holding the largest amounts of $VIRGEN, increased their holdings by a staggering over 254 million tokens in just eight days. That is not a typo. They went from holding a collective approximately 388.45 million tokens on May 22 to now holding a collective approximately 642.86 million tokens as of May 30. $VIRGEN holders are stacking. Over the past 30 days, the top 100 addresses increased their $VIRGEN holdings from approximately 388.45M on May 22 to 642.86M by May 30. That’s a +254M token increase, or +65% growth in holdings. Clear sign: large holders are accumulating. pic.twitter.com/Dk84ndRrzq — Nansen (@nansen_ai) May 30, 2025 This signals a 65% increase in the strength of support held by the largest holders, a group that includes many insiders and also well-capitalized market participants. It is both unusual and praiseworthy for these key holders not to take profits and instead to “double down”—to maintain or increase their positions in what is often a very early- and very superficial-selloff market. Their not taking profits and instead doubling down signals a long-term belief in this project and in the idea that its current path promises to pay off in a way that will make headlines. Solace ($SOLACE): Close Contender with 130x ROI Just behind $VIRGEN in the Virtuals Genesis rankings is $SOLACE, the native token of the Solace Launch platform. With a peak return of 130x for presale buyers, Solace has quickly become one of the most closely observed tokens within its niche. Its success reflects the growing demand for launchpad-driven projects that have well-structured tokenomics, transparent rollout plans, and governance models that put the community first. The allure of Solace is not solely in its stellar finances but in its far-reaching mission to help rebuild a broken system. It adopts a decentralized model, which directly addresses one of the crypto industry’s most pressing problems — access to the very tools and resources that make putting together a new project feasible and safe in today’s perilous climate. Solace is, in effect, acting as a launchpad, but in a way that saves its users from the many hazards en route to achieving lift-off. Although the same level of detail as in $VIRGEN has not been disclosed about specific whale activity concerning $SOLACE, the fact that it almost matched $VIRGEN’s ROI at peak strongly suggests that confidence in the market is quite high. In the coming weeks, it will be important to keep an eye on just how much early adopters are still participating in and engaging with the platform as it begins to scale its launch offerings. What These Returns Say About the Current Market What we see with the $VIRGEN and $SOLACE launches is something extraordinary. Even in today’s market, where many timely projects are having trouble finding post-launch traction, these two do—finding it in a major way. So if you didn’t catch these vibes in real-time, that’s the value of this piece: to put you on to the clear and present value of what are now $VIRGEN and $SOLACE. Furthermore, the accumulation of $VIRGEN by top holders indicates a change in behavior. In a landscape often characterized by short-term flipping and exit liquidity games, seeing major addresses accumulate rather than offload signals a level of strategic conviction not frequently observed in new token launches. This may suggest we are at a point where some sophisticated players are treating certain assets far beyond the speculative realm and as real long-term plays. As the Virtuals Genesis fringes continues to grow, the performance of early leaders like $VIRGEN and $SOLACE sets a high bar — not just in ROI, but in community trust, project delivery, and token holder behavior. Whether this trend continues will depend on market conditions, upcoming launches, and the ability of these projects to scale without losing their early momentum. At present, they have displayed what can occur when nascent crypto comprehends how to behave — and they have significantly elevated the standard every subsequent token must attempt to meet.

Through a set of imaginative applications, the Stellar blockchain is witnessing an upsurge in on-chain activity that, to many observers, seems to signal a fresh wave of adoption by developers and users who are actually diversified in use cases. This also seems to signal an emerging ecosystem of sorts. Although Ethereum and other big chains get most of the publicity, Stellar’s DeFi protocols are asserting themselves in more low-key fashion. They don’t get much in the way of good publicity. Yet, when you take a look at them, and you pull up their statistics, you can see that they’re getting some pretty decent traction. Respectable January volumes have made their way into February. Liquidity Grows Across Aquarius and Soroswap Stellar’s two most active platforms that focus on liquidity — Aquarius and Soroswap — are showing that a solid DeFi infrastructure is building on-chain. Aquarius, which aims to increase the decentralized exchange (DEX) liquidity on Stellar, has seen the total volume of swaps reach the $50 million milestone. With the volume of swaps remaining alive and active on a weekly basis, questions are being asked about whether this liquidity is truly deep and sustainable or just temporary flotsam and jetsam. That said, we will give Aquarius the credit it is due for being quite obviously the local automated market maker (AMM) in the Oasis ecosystem when looking across the total landscape. Soroswap, meanwhile, is operating as a full-scale liquidity engine. It has recorded more than $21 million in total swap volume, and the protocol is picking up speed. Weekly pool-specific volume reveals a broadening distribution of liquidity, supporting a much wider range of token pairs. Besides, it has not been in the news, and that’s fine. Soroswap’s is a growth story, and what’s important here is that it’s a quiet one. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝘁𝗲𝗹𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗘𝗰𝗼𝘀𝘆𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗺: 𝗔 𝗦𝗻𝗮𝗽𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘁 𝗶𝗻 𝗗𝗮𝘁𝗮 @StellarOrg , the payments powerhouse, is expanding!

Their growth points to an emerging DEX economy that’s maturing with time. Blend and Phoenix Show User Engagement on the Rise Decentralized finance is not simply a matter of where to find liquidity; it concerns users, their wallets, and the interaction they will sustain over time in a given platform or app. Two platforms that show strong signals on this front are Blend and Phoenix. Blend infuses experimental energy into the DeFi universe wowed by Stellar. Similar to a mad scientist in a lab, with a dash of DeFi’s unconventional nature, everything blends, or rather mixes, together. The ingredients are on-chain indicators that matter to users. The big one is wallets. Wallet activity is up, and the addressable surge is likely to help DeFi users address major deficiencies in the current address system. The next ingredient in the address surge is NFTs. Top wallet net flows further illuminate these communities. They demonstrate everything from the amount of liquidity being supplied to the platform to the quantity being yanked out. And in between those two extremes, they’re a pretty good indicator of whether the platform’s user base is made up of true believers who’ve been, like the Blend team, in for the long haul, or short-termers who could be punking out at any moment. At the other end of the spectrum, Phoenix is on the fast track to heating up. Known for its rapid-fire swaps and fiery pool combos, Phoenix is stacking up almost $900K in 30-day volume. Its weekly swap activity also shows signs of a breakout moment, with pairs like USDC-PHO and XLM-USDC leading the charge. Phoenix’s dynamic market share growth among pools signals a rising competitive landscape and shifting user preferences. Both platforms tell a critical story for Stellar: DeFi on this network isn’t just a sit-back-and-watch affair. It’s interactive and even more engaging than before, with users finding new ways to earn, swap, and engage. It’s the future, and it’s happening now. FXDao Brings Debt Markets to Stellar One of the most intriguing developments in Stellar’s DeFi ecosystem is FXDao. This stable debt protocol isn’t just a copy of MakerDAO or any other pre-existing decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for that matter. FXDao has a structure that is both similar to the aforementioned systems and also very different from them in a few key respects. It is a system auditing itself in real-time with the assistance of a few Stellar specialists. FXDao is creating a small but expanding market for overcollateralized loans, with total debt issued exceeding $4.3 million. Users have the option to deposit digital assets and mint stable debt tokens in return. These include USDx, EURx, and GBPx — tokens that collectively offer multi-currency exposure in a decentralized format. The collateral mix indicates that the protocol is attempting to serve a variety of user needs, with backing that comes from both stable and volatile assets. Although the number of active vaults is growing, it is doing so at a rather slow pace. This suggests that Stellar DeFi is still in a niche, but also indicates that there is potential for significant expansion if the conditions in the broader ecosystem improve. FXDao is distinguished by its stability and balance. What we see in FXDao is an experimental approach to DeFi, but one that is firmly grounded in the sorts of practices and patterns that make DeFi work—and not crash, as some in the space do. A Network Poised for Broader DeFi Adoption Altogether, these data points paint a decisive picture: Stellar’s DeFi ecosystem is no longer just a concept in development. It is an increasingly concrete thing, comprised of a mix of liquidity protocols, user-focused platforms, and a nascent debt market, serving up the very infrastructure of a self-sustaining DeFi economy. Even if the overall numbers come up a little short compared to what some of the larger networks are doing, in terms of actual, real-life adoption, Stellar is showing up in some intriguing ways. That’s evident in the apparent Lighthouse navigation of DeFi the network is engaging in. Above all, it seems to me that we’re looking at a quiet DeFi breakout in the Stellar ecosystem.

45344234,https://nulltx.com/?p=150124,1748728338,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Smart Money Signals: Ethereum and Base Networks Dominate Netflows in Past 24 Hours,https://nulltx.com/smart-money-signals-ethereum-and-base-networks-dominate-netflows-in-past-24-hours/,"On-chain trading and the movement of smart money are diversifying. The past 24 hours have seen a balance of maturity and speculative experimentation. Overall capital flows remain relatively light, but the bulk of smart net buying is concentrated on Ethereum and Base. These two protocols, and the ecosystems therein, are attracting serious attention from high-level wallets and advanced trading ops. Leading the charge of top performers are established DeFi projects like Maker (MKR), Aave (AAVE), and Uniswap (UNI), which directed net inflows on Ethereum toward those assets. Meanwhile, on the Base network, a totally new story is taking shape right now, with AI tokens and meme tokens emerging among the most purchased assets. Ethereum’s DeFi Majors Still Command Respect Smart money activity remains strongly concentrated in Ethereum’s DeFi protocols. Over the past 24 hours, the leading protocol for net buying was Maker (MKR), with net inflows of $100.61K. The project, which is renowned for its decentralized stablecoin DAI, seems to have been stirring up quite a bit of interest from savvy investors looking for stable-yield protocols and some governance exposure. After the Maker protocol, the next highest net buys were Aave (AAVE) with $68.56K and Uniswap (UNI) with $59.04K. These protocols have long reigned as pillars of the DeFi ecosystem, and while the sizes of these flows surely look moderate compared to past market highs, this continued interest probably indicates that some smart traders see value in positioning within trusted, functioning infrastructure. These inflows also underscore a much larger trend of allocating money with caution. In a calmer market, capital seems to be flowing into just a few projects—namely, those that are dependable and useful. Instead of pursuing shiny new trends, the smart money is flowing into the sorts of assets that have long been considered reliable and are, quite literally, in use. Base Network Assets Make a Statement Even though Ethereum is still at the forefront, the Base network is swiftly emerging as a suitable space for trial and niche innovation. Among the 10 cryptocurrencies that had the highest net inflows, four were on Base. The leading inflow came from AIXBT, which had $55.20K in inflows. AIXBT positions itself as an AI-powered trading agent, and its strong showing makes for a very interesting development. Another project based on Base, Solace (SOLACE), launched not long ago and secured its place at the number six spot on the leaderboard with net inflows of $36.13K. Its appearance so soon after launch signals growing confidence in early-stage assets deployed on Base, especially as the Coinbase L2 gains developer traction and user adoption. Completing the top ten for Base were NOICE with net buys of $33.70K and COCORO with $28.28K in net buys. This is a good reflection of something that looks to be a very consistent trend: Base is becoming a hub for smart money to explore speculative plays and frontier concepts outside the Ethereum mainnet. https://x.com/Chyan/status/1928796176498806813?t=Ma8mfg1VC3FRxvDlEIPz9g&s=19 Having several Base tokens among the net top buys shows the growing popularity of the network. While Ethereum hosts established DeFi projects, Base is doing an impressive job of establishing itself as a network with a unique identity, one that often features innovative tokens and savvy financial maneuvers. Memes, AI Agents, and New Narratives Rise Beyond the conventional DeFi assets, new stories are starting to pull in the attention. SPX6900, a meme coin on Ethereum, notched up $44.89K in net smart money buys, placing it firmly in the top five. While meme tokens often rely on community enthusiasm and go viral, their inclusion in smart money activity suggests that some investors are making calculated, short-term bets on momentum and social traction. The AI agent category is topped by AIXBT, which also leads in Base-based assets. Its growing traction is part of a larger movement in DeFi toward on-chain automation and artificial intelligence. As DeFi users seek new ways to generate yield, AI-native protocols and agent-driven financial tools are likely to see sustained and perhaps even burgeoning interest. The sole token not on Ethereum or Base found in the top ten was ABCPHAR on Avalanche. The net inflows were a measly $26.52K. Its presence in the top ten is a gentle reminder of the kinds of opportunities smaller chains serve up. Even as flows grow concentrated around the major ecosystems, the smaller chains still give us chances for niche plays and pocket allocations with tokens like ABCPHAR. Final Takeaways Sophisticated capital movement can be seen in real time with the net inflows and outflows of smart money over 24 hours. The latest data show Ethereum and Base courting all of this attention, with nine of the ten top tokens issued or being used on these two blockchains. Core DeFi tokens—those that serve as backbone elements of decentralized finance—are still very much in the picture, acting as safe havens for capital. With market tranquility comes a choosiness about where to put capital. Yet, in this period of relative calm, there’s also an opportunity to see clearly what investors with a brain and a backbone think is worthy of putting in the ground now — and what’s really set up to blast off when the market gets its groove back.

45344287,https://nulltx.com/?p=150123,1748728483,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,Real DeFi in Action: Folks Finance Shows Strong Growth on Algorand,https://nulltx.com/real-defi-in-action-folks-finance-shows-strong-growth-on-algorand/,"Even though many in the crypto world pay attention only to Ethereum and its burgeoning layer-2 ecosystem, there is a world of decentralized finance (DeFi) activity that is quietly and steadily taking root elsewhere. For a perfect case study, look at Algorand. DeFi users on the Algorand blockchain have a rapidly maturing protocol that they can rely on for the kinds of DeFi activities that many in the crypto world associate primarily with Ethereum. Folks Finance is not just an Algorand case study; it is a DeFi protocol that is quietly and steadily serving a clear and growing purpose for a specific user base. From user engagement to capital deployment, Folks Finance is demonstrating what sustainable DeFi growth can look like outside the traditional hotspots. With rising transaction volumes, growing deposits, and high utilization rates, the platform is a clear sign that serious financial activity is happening on-chain within the Algorand ecosystem. User Activity and On-Chain Engagement Are Rising An unmistakable sign of the increasing attention on Folks Finance is the activity of users on the platform. In just the past week, the protocol has netted over 240,000 transactions — a number that is impressive for any DeFi dApp to reportedly handle, and even more so for one operating on an alternative layer-1 network. When considering unique user participation, Folks Finance sees nearly 1,500 individual users weekly engaging with the platform’s lending, borrowing, and staking functions. This ongoing, regular, and organic interaction with the platform places it among the most-used decentralized applications across the Algorand blockchain today. Unlike many smaller DeFi platforms, where on-chain interaction can be sparse, Folks Finance is a sign of a healthy and growing community that actively engages with its financial products on a daily basis. Deposits and Utilization Reflect Strong Capital Efficiency User confidence isn’t just shown in transactions — it’s evident in the real capital being put to work. Total deposits on Folks Finance have now topped $3.2 million — a significant milestone for a project that’s not operating in the high-profile Ethereum network. Two major pools are the focus of much of that activity: the ALGO pool and the USDC pool. The ALGO pool remains one of the most popular, with it consistently enticing over 100 users that are active on a daily basis. Users seem to have established the ALGO pool as a destination for either earning yield or accessing liquidity with no reason to leave the Algorand network. Also significant is the current utilization rate of the USDC pool, which operates at over 85%. As with any lending pool in DeFi, this is key to understanding how capital is being used. A capital-efficient pool doesn’t just sit there with lots of capital waiting to be deployed; it has lots of borrowers taking loans and lots of lenders earning interest on those loans. The same holds true for the DeFi protocol as a whole: until it gets more DC, it’s not going to be capital efficient. To summarize, the platform doesn’t merely hold user assets but works them in a way that generates value across the ecosystem. Staking and xALGO Adoption Show Real Demand One of the biggest successes for Folks Finance is staking ALGO — the native asset of the Algorand network. At the moment, over 280 million ALGO tokens are staked via the platform. That’s a huge number. And it tells us a lot. That people are confident in the Folks Finance protocol. That they believe in the long-term value of Algorand’s DeFi infrastructure. The most telling signal of adoption for Folks Finance is the growth of xALGO, its liquid staking token. Users are opting to stake their ALGO in a way that permits them to stay flexible and continue DeFi-ing without locking up their assets. This is something that has become a hallmark of our user base. Folks who choose to interact with our protocol are mature users of DeFi who understand the benefits of capital efficiency and are actively pursuing it. Liquid staking, once thought of as an advanced feature of DeFi, is now becoming a baseline user expectation, even among the most active DeFi users. Folks Finance isn’t just making a splash with xALGO and grabbing headlines. The protocol seems to be pulling in participants who are taking a long, hard look under the hood and deciding to stick around, quite possibly because they understand and appreciate the DeFi landscape in which they are now fully engaged. A Model for DeFi Beyond Ethereum Despite DeFi narratives typically being centered around Ethereum scaling solutions or newer, faster, more performant chains, Folks Finance, a DeFi protocol built on Algorand, is demonstrating that real DeFi adoption is occurring on this chain. If you are examining the real on-chain economic activity behind the hype, then the data coming from Folks Finance is inescapable. It’s a prime example of how DeFi can work — and work well — in an ecosystem that emphasizes speed, low costs, and security. And it gives us a window into the future of decentralized finance on alternative networks. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

45344395,https://nulltx.com/?p=150122,1748728631,https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/nulltx.png,$2.7 Billion in Tokens Set to Unlock in June: What Investors Need to Know,https://nulltx.com/2-7-billion-in-tokens-set-to-unlock-in-june-what-investors-need-to-know/,"$2.7 Billion in Tokens Set to Unlock in June: What Investors Need to Know The crypto markets are preparing for a substantial oncoming wave of June token unlocks, with a combined total of token value amounting to $2.7 billion set to flood into the markets for a number of very well-known projects. This month comprises unlocks for Layer 1 behemoths, startups, and everything in between. Bundled together, the June unlocks raise many questions about investor sentiment and price resilience. Can the unlocked tokens be absorbed by the market? Will we see any price drops this month as the unlocked tokens start to hit the market? At the head of the list are initiatives such as SUI, ZRO, APT, and ZK, with each releasing token amounts in the tens of millions. Altogether, they represent a significant number of very recent events that are as yet poorly understood and whose potential effects on the broader market can best be described as up for grabs. The Heavyweights: SUI, ZRO, and APT Lead the Pack The biggest release of tokens in June will come from Sui (SUI), with $206.33 million worth of tokens being unleashed. This layer-1 blockchain, developed by a team from Mysten Labs, has made a name for itself in the crypto community thanks to its high throughput capabilities and an architecture based on the Move programming language. Despite these strengths, though, Sui’s huge token unlock this month calls to mind potential sell pressure and liquidity issues it might have. LayerZero’s ZRO, next on the list, plans to unlock $64.29 million worth of tokens. LayerZero has been a central player in cross-chain messaging protocols, and its much-anticipated token is closely watched by investors and users who have interacted with the protocol across dozens of chains. This unlock could have strong implications for both retail participants and many early contributors, who are looking to capitalize on early participation. Aptos (APT), a prominent layer-1 blockchain originally part of Facebook’s Diem project, is set to release tokens worth $58.52 million. Happenings at Aptos have historically shown to be good indicators for market price movements; that’s why holders and market analysts are keeping a close watch on this particular moment. Mid-Tier Unlocks: ZK, SAROS, VANA, and More Several mid-sized unlocks are planned for June, encompassing projects such as ZK, SAROS, VANA, and ARB, that are together releasing to the public more than $160 million worth of new tokens. ZK, an initiative centered on zero knowledge, will release 46.58 million tokens. Since the majority of ZK’s circulating supply is distributed community-wise via airdrop, this release might lead to more market activity in the immediate term. As we pointed out earlier, community-heavy token models often experience a much rockier road because low holding incentives and high market liquidity lead to heightened volatility. Saros (SAROS) and Vana (VANA) will release a total of $43.75 million and $37.02 million tokens, respectively. Both, recent projects, are looking to develop a following. Should these token unlocks serve as any kind of litmus test, we could expect Saros and Vana to behave more like traditional startups — i.e., find a way to generate some buzz and attention while also sometimes losing the same. For projects with $40 million to $50 million in market cap, like Saros and Vana, the next unlock may be a price-sensitive moment. Also on the schedule for this month is Arbitrum (ARB), one of the leading Ethereum layer-2 solutions, unfastening $36.91 million. Arbitrum has made a name for itself as a major player in the rollup space, and even though its market cap is quite hefty, any substantial release of tokens could sway short-term price action. That’s especially true now that investor sentiment is sensitive to any sort of macro shifts or risk-off behavior. Smaller But Notable: ENA, ZKJ, and OP Round Out the List Even smaller unlocks can create ripples, particularly when community sentiment or larger narratives are involved. Also in June, ENA will unlock $35.23 million, ZKJ will release $31.22 million, and OP (Optimism) will unlock $23.63 million. Even though these unlocks are of relatively low value compared to those in the past, they still constitute a noticeable jump in circulating supply for the tokens in question. The performance of the market in response to this latest unlock should tell us something about the resilience of layer-2 tokens in the face of mounting competition and the development of Ethereum’s roadmap. Notably, the amount of funds locked up in yield-generating contracts on Optimism, since the day of the token unlock, has actually not decreased. What This Means for the Market Misunderstanding token unlocks as simply bearish is common, but their effect mostly hinges on context: how they fit into the larger picture of not just current, but also expected future demand for a given token. Take, for instance, the supply and demand dynamics of a token whose total market cap and ideal price are already known, because, say, Bitcoin is a very low volatility investment. Now, couple that with the fact that the highest demand for a given token is almost always way back at its pre-ICO (Initial Coin Offering) price. Well, with context like that in mind, what do you think the average impact of token unlocks is on a given token’s price? The $2.7 billion wave of June unlocks could serve as a stress test for the crypto markets. They are already under pressure because of regulatory uncertainties, the surge in the price of Bitcoin and its effects on other coins, and the recent turbulence in the transition from a $0 interest-rate world to one where rates aren’t at or near zero. Investors in tokens should watch the unlock schedules closely and try to understand what is happening in real-time on-chain with the projects they are invested in. In the present cycle, the compellingness of a project’s narrative, the level of developer engagement, and the extent of ecosystem utilization can at times counterbalance that inevitable trigger along the road to short-term supply that shocks the market. But only if those projects have taken the necessary steps to establish a foundation of demand. Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

At the time of writing, Floki’s price is hovering around $0.00007950, having slipped sharply from its late May high near $0.00010670. The latest Floki price action indicates a breakdown below the 100-day exponential moving average, with multiple indicators suggesting a continuation of the broader downtrend through June. What’s Happening With Floki’s Price? Floki price forecast (Source: TradingView) On the weekly chart, Floki’s price has been stuck within a long-term descending channel since 2024. A brief breakout attempt in April 2025 was rejected below the $0.000120 level, triggering a swift return to the lower half of the range.

DOGE has seen its momentum wane despite increased social buzz, while SHIB is hovering in consolidation territory with technicals hinting at either a breakout or deeper correction. Both remain top crypto assets by market cap, but traders searching for the next crypto to explode are increasingly rotating into low-cap coins with better ROI potential. One such coin grabbing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM) , a sub-$0.03 token that’s quietly gaining ground ahead of the 2025 bull cycle. The MUTM presale has witnessed over 11,500 participants before a token price rise to $0.035 at the start of the next phase. Investors at this level can potentially return up to 100% in profit when the estimated launch price of $0.06 is achieved. DOGE and SHIB: Meme Coins at a Crossroads Amid Market Shifts Dogecoin (DOGE) trades at a price of $0.2228, depreciating by around 1.3% within the past 24 hours. The coin is facing significant support levels, and technical indicators are indicating opposing signals whether the coin will be positive or negative in the near term. Shiba Inu (SHIB) currently trades at a price of $0.00001429, depreciating by around 0.012% over the past day. However, SHIB has built up a bull flag pattern, which is a potential breakout that will push its price to the resistance of $0.000022. While DOGE and SHIB struggle with these market forces, new coins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM), whose price is at the moment $0.03, are catching investors’ eyes with their potential high returns. Mutuum Finance Presale: A Growing DeFi Solution Mutuum Finance has attracted more investors with its DeFi lending solutions. Through innovative decentralized finance mechanisms and crypto lending services the platform has collected more than $9.4 million and accumulated 11,500 holders in its community. MUTM tokens currently sell for $0.03 before their value will grow to $0.035 within the next round of the presale. Investors will achieve a substantial gain of 100% when Mutuum Finance hits its official launch price of $0.06. The advanced lending system of Mutuum Finance drives the transformation of decentralized markets while it consolidates its market position. Mutuum’s P2C and P2P Lending Mutuum Finance’s (MUTM) technological edge is its hybrid lending model. Its Peer-to-Contract (P2C) model permits users to make passive income by loaning the USDT to liquidity pools operated through the use of smart contracts. The Peer-to-Peer (P2P) model on the other hand removes the middleman. It allows users to lend and borrow directly. This gives them more control and privacy. By combining these two systems, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) positions itself as one of the best cryptos to invest in today. It offers decentralization, security, and efficiency. Certik Audit Officially Completed, Stablecoin Secures Trust and Stability Mutuum Finance is building a fully collateralized, USD-backed stablecoin to be issued on the Ethereum network.

Several new platforms with solid use cases, high TVL growth, and technical breakouts are pulling attention. From mobile mining to presales gaining traction, this year is shaping into a pivotal moment for altcoins. This guide looks at four standout names: BlockDAG, SUI, Hyperliquid (HYPE), and TRON (TRX). Each coin brings unique strengths, and together they highlight some of the best crypto coins for 2025. Whether it’s fast-growing ecosystems or high-return entry points, these projects are shaping up as ones to watch. Here’s a closer look at why these picks deserve your radar. BlockDAG: GO LIVE Reveal and $0.0018 Entry Deadline BlockDAG is getting major attention in 2025 as its presale enters its final stages. The project has already raised over $279 million, with more than 21.6 billion BDAG coins sold. Right now, the price is frozen at $0.0018 until June 13. That’s when BlockDAG will host its highly anticipated GO LIVE reveal, confirming the 20 centralized exchanges where BDAG will be listed. After this reveal, pricing will switch to the standard batch structure, with Batch 28 priced at $0.0262. This creates a huge potential gain compared to the $0.05 launch price, placing it among the best crypto coins for 2025. What makes BlockDAG more than just a presale is its working product suite. It’s powered by a hybrid DAG + PoW system, delivering both speed and decentralization. The live testnet includes a block explorer, smart contract deployment, and a no-code token builder. Over 1 million users are mining BDAG through the X1 mobile app , while more than 17,750 ASIC miners are being shipped to further secure the network. The presale’s structure also includes a 25% referral bonus, helping users earn more without spending extra. With tech, scale, and listings in place, BlockDAG offers real value. If you’re tracking the best crypto coins for 2025, this entry window might be the most time-sensitive one on the list. SUI: Technical Setup Signals Strength SUI now sits at a $10.8 billion market cap, trading between $3.62 and $3.72. Its current price of $3.69 aligns with May’s projected average of $3.08, while short-term targets stretch to $3.44. On a broader scale, 2025 predictions suggest the coin could move between $2.55 and $8.75, hinting on how it handles resistance levels like the $3.33 Fibonacci extension. SUI stands out due to its scalability and growing usage on-chain. Many still see it as undervalued, especially when compared to other coins in the same tier. Its chart has stayed steady, with no big dips or spikes recently, adding to its reputation as a consistent mover. For those evaluating the best crypto coins for 2025, SUI checks multiple boxes: solid fundamentals, tight trading bands, and long-term upside without excess risk. Hyperliquid: Accumulation Phase in Progress HYPE is currently priced at $32.70 and trading between $32.09 and $38.62. With a market cap of about $10.9 billion, the project has room to grow. 2025 price predictions place HYPE anywhere from $25.30 to $35.72, with some high-end forecasts hitting $41.35. That puts the current level in a key range for accumulation. The Hyperliquid platform is gaining attention for delivering deep liquidity and smooth trading experiences. It’s getting recognition in the DeFi world, especially for those looking at low-risk entries below $36. If platform growth continues through Q3, HYPE could break out of its current range. While it may not dominate headlines, HYPE is shaping up as one of the best crypto coins for 2025 for those targeting emerging players with solid growth patterns. TRON: Stable Gains and ETF Speculation TRX is holding at $0.2752, with a recent range of $0.2742 to $0.2793. Market cap is at $23.95 billion, and analysts are optimistic. Projections show TRX could rise to $0.3409 by June 1, almost 24% higher in a matter of days. Broader models place the average price around $0.368 for 2025 and suggest it could reach up to $1.67 by 2030. TRON continues to see strong usage, especially across Asia, thanks to high speeds and scalability. Its daily volumes and developer activity remain strong, and the coin is often linked with potential ETF speculation. If those rumors get traction, it could act as a price driver later this year. Among large caps, TRX deserves a place on any list of the best crypto coins for 2025. The Bottom Line Each of these coins brings something valuable. SUI stands out with technical reliability, HYPE adds liquidity and strong growth signs, and TRX offers price strength with long-term upside. But BlockDAG delivers a rare opportunity, an entry at $0.0018 with the chance to ride it to $0.05, backed by over $279 million raised and real tech already in action. With its GO LIVE reveal set for June 13 and confirmed listings ahead, BlockDAG combines utility, upside, and urgency. That’s why it leads the pack when picking the best crypto coins for 2025 .

While market volatility is nothing new in the cryptocurrency space, downturns like this often prompt investors to seek out alternative opportunities with greater growth potential. This shift in focus has put the spotlight on Ruvi AI , a rising star in the crypto landscape that combines innovation, real-world utility, and exceptional ROI possibilities. What Happened to Cardano? Cardano’s recent dip reflects the tight competition among cryptocurrencies as well as market reactions to broader economic factors. While many believe in Cardano’s long-term potential due to its robust proof-of-stake mechanism and sustainability efforts, the platform’s scalability challenges and evolving use cases contribute to its price fluctuations. The dip has left some Cardano investors questioning whether to hold, sell, or reallocate their investments. For those looking to diversify their portfolio, Ruvi AI stands as an attractive option that addresses some of the pain points currently holding back more established coins. Ruvi AI’s Promising Growth Ruvi AI has quickly made its mark in the crypto world by achieving what many projects fail to do early on—build momentum. During its presale phase, Ruvi AI successfully sold over 130 million tokens , raising nearly $1.5 million . With an entry price of just $0.015 per token , it has created a low-risk entry point for a wide range of investors. What makes Ruvi AI unique is its impressive projected growth to $1 by Q4 2025 . This would represent an ROI exceeding 12,800% , offering investors exponential returns not often seen in the current market climate. Such figures clearly set Ruvi AI apart as a high-growth opportunity for those seeking a lucrative alternative investment to projects like Cardano. Real-World Applications of Ruvi AI One of Ruvi AI’s most compelling strengths is its practical utility beyond just being a tradable asset. The token powers an AI-driven platform that addresses key challenges across healthcare , logistics , and finance . These industries stand to benefit greatly from Ruvi AI’s innovative solutions, ensuring its long-term demand. Healthcare: Ruvi AI uses artificial intelligence to enhance diagnostics, improve efficiency in patient care, and streamline treatment workflows. Logistics: From optimizing supply chain operations to cutting overhead costs, Ruvi AI is transforming how businesses handle logistics challenges. Finance: Security and transparency are prioritized through Ruvi AI’s fraud detection tools and decentralized payment solutions, catering to modern financial systems. This emphasis on solving real-world problems ensures Ruvi AI builds sustainable value, making it a standout choice for investors looking for more than speculative gains. VIP Investment Tiers That Maximize Returns For those ready to take advantage of Ruvi AI’s growth potential, the VIP investment program presents a tailored opportunity to maximize returns. Here’s how the key tiers work: VIP Tier 2 ($750 investment, 40% bonus): Tokens awarded: 70,000 (50,000 base + 20,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token during presale valuation: $4,900. Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $70,000. VIP Tier 3 ($2,100 investment, 60% bonus): Tokens awarded: 224,000 (140,000 base + 84,000 bonus). Value at $0.07 per token during presale valuation: $15,680. Projected value at $1 per token by Q4 2025: $224,000.

This tiered approach rewards higher investments while offering remarkable ROI potential, making it a great fit for those looking to maximize the impact of their crypto portfolios. Expanding Reach Through WEEX Partnership Ruvi AI has also partnered with WEEX Exchange to enhance its accessibility and market visibility. This collaboration ensures smooth trading and robust liquidity for Ruvi AI tokens, which further contributes to its appeal among global investors. Partnerships like these build trust and scalability, essential elements for any successful cryptocurrency project. Why Ruvi AI Stands Out Cardano may remain a significant player in the blockchain space, but its recent dip highlights the need for investors to diversify and explore new opportunities. Ruvi AI delivers a rare combination of low entry cost, practical applications, and unprecedented growth potential. With a strategic roadmap, exceptional presale performance, and projections pointing to $1 per token by Q4 2025 , Ruvi AI is emerging as the smarter choice for those seeking high returns and real-world impact.

Based on reports, some users saw a hidden reference to the Pepe meme coin (PEPE). Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin? Analyst Says It’s Not A Dream—It’s ‘Coded’ In the next few hours, PEPE shot up by 5% but then fell back by 15%. Traders are now watching to see if this social push can do what Elon Musk once did for Dogecoin. Pepe Price Moves According to market data, PEPE’s price hit its upper resistance after the Trump post. A short surge brought a 5% gain. Then profit-taking and wider market pressure drove an 18% correction. The flip in momentum shows how fast things can change in meme-coin land. A small tweet or post can send prices soaring, but it only takes a bit of selling to push them down again. 🚨 Wait, what Trump just dropped a $PEPE pic on Truth Social 🚨 Is this a secret crypto endorsement or just trolling the internet? Either way the $PEPE rocket might just have a new co-pilot. What’s next a $PEPE rally or a Twitter melt down Stay tuned👀 pic.twitter.com/cu8RF7D55b — Josh Mair (@WizzOfCrypto) May 29, 2025 On Drama & Speculation Trump’s message saying he’s “on a mission from God” makes him sound like he has a special purpose, not just a political goal. The dark street scene and the words “nothing can stop what is coming” hint that something big is coming, even if he doesn’t explain it. This kind of talk can fire up his most loyal supporters – especially PEPE aficionados – because it feels dramatic and urgent. Chart Patterns In Focus Based on reports from chart watchers, PEPE appears to be forming a cup-and-handle pattern that began about five months ago. If the coin breaks above the handle, some say it could reach $0.000026—double its current level. Right now, the MACD line sits below the signal line after a recent death cross, hinting at a near-term downtrend. The RSI has dipped toward 52 and may cross below it soon, which could keep sellers in control. The 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level sits at $0.00001 and could act as a bounce point. If that level gives way, traders will look at $0.000008 as the next support. Tariff Ruling Adds Pressure Based on US Court of International Trade filings, the court reversed Trump’s tariff suspensions right around the same time that PEPE spiked. That move seems to have dampened the market’s risk-on mood. For many traders, broader trade news can be a bigger factor than any single tweet. If traders worry about tariffs and slower growth, they often sell off riskier assets like meme coins. That mix of social hype and market worry helped push PEPE down after its brief rally. Looking Ahead For Traders Based on this mix of social buzz and chart signals, it’ll take more than a hint in a post to keep PEPE climbing. If the coin can break above its current resistance by mid-June, $0.000026 seems to be the main target. But a falling MACD and RSI point toward more selling pressure first. Traders should watch the 0.618 level at $0.00001 for signs of a bounce. If that level breaks, they’ll likely aim for $0.000008 next.

Solana (SOL) historic price sentiment Solana Price History Source: Coinmarketcap Solana was launched in April 2020 and has gained popularity over the last 18 months. Its price surged from $0.75 to a high of $214.96 in early September. Following NFT hype and growing demand in the DeFi community, the cryptocurrency Solana (SOL) price more than tripled during the summer of 2021. Solana (SOL) token became the fastest-growing cryptocurrency and is currently ranked fifth with a live market cap of nearly $66 billion. 2022 saw Solana leap to its all-time high of $260, but SOL failed to close the year anywhere near that high, as the price came crashing down to below $40 by June. The bearish markets were marked by high skepticism as trading volumes declined throughout the crypto markets. The price continued to trade below the $40 level until November 2023, when Solana gained momentum and started a bullish rally again to close the year at $101.84. In 2024, Solana (SOL) saw significant growth, with its price rising from $83.62 in January to a high of $202.87, fueled by its dominance in DeFi, NFTs, and decentralized exchanges. However, the price fluctuated through the year, retracing to $131 in September after struggling to maintain key levels. October brought a positive rebound as SOL rose from $152 to close at $167, but early November started bearish, with the price dipping to $160. However, Solana bounced back sharply and closed the month above the $230 mark. December, on the other hand, has observed a slow start as price volatility remains low. Solana’s (SOL) price rose significantly in January 2025 from below the $190 level to close the month above $210. However, the latter half of the month saw the price decline from the $230 mark, a trend that continued through February ending the month below $150. In March the price continued falling as the bears continued dominating the short to mid term markets ending the month below $125. In April the bearish rally has only continued as the price falls towards $100. However, the bulls bounced back in the middle of the month and ended the month around $150.",Crypto Price Predictions|Solana,EN,0,0,BLOCKCHAIN|BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|SOL|TRADING,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-31 22:30:00

Bowen Wang, who leads the team at NEAR One, shared this plan. It could make NEAR Protocol stand out from other blockchains that want to support new Web3 and AI services. Sharding Upgrade Set to Boost NEAR Protocol’s Performance In his recent post on X, Wang said that NEAR Protocol’s new sharding design, known as Nightshade 2.0, has shown it can handle high transaction volumes. Sharding divides the blockchain into interconnected sub-chains, or shards, which share the workload. This approach enables NEAR Protocol to process a large number of transactions efficiently. However, NEAR Protocol plans to take dynamic resharding a step further. This technology allows shards to split or merge automatically, depending on network demand. As a result, the blockchain can adapt to heavy traffic without sacrificing speed or performance. This capability is expected to be first rolled out on the testnet before being fully deployed on the main network. In line with the current development, we covered recently that Near Protocol (NEAR) is riding a 20% monthly gain as it tests the neckline of an inverse Head and Shoulders pattern. Zero-Knowledge Proofs Poised to Enhance Validation It is worth mentioning that NEAR Protocol is also exploring the integration of zero-knowledge proofs (ZK proofs) to strengthen its validation process. ZK proofs promise to replace the traditional Merkle proof-based state witness. It was stated that this provides faster and more secure transaction confirmations. More importantly, this shift could reduce overhead and improve scalability. This is especially necessary as AI and machine learning applications expand within Web3. Near Protocol has also started working on cross-chain bridges with Ethereum and other blockchain s. The aim is to improve how assets and data move between platforms. Community Reaction Remains Mixed Despite Progress It is essential to state that despite these ambitious plans, some community members have expressed doubts about the practical adoption of NEAR Protocol’s high TPS target. Concerns revolve around the number of users and the potential complexities introduced by cross-chain and cross-rollup interactions. Even with its new partnership with DWF Labs, NEAR Protocol still faces skepticism about whether these developments can attract a more extensive user base. Nevertheless, Wang remains confident that dynamic resharding and other improvements will make NEAR Protocol a leading platform in blockchain innovation. In other news, Rhea Finance and Intellex introduced the first vesting contract for Near Protocol. This offers a secure way for projects to manage token releases.

However, it has charted a minor loss daily, but remains strong on a monthly scale. Starting the second quarter of the year on a strong note after crashing to a year-low in April, Ethereum recovered briefly above $1,800 and took a break due to a shrink in volatility, which later led to a 15-day squeeze. Following the second week’s surge, which saw the market through its biggest gain during the buying phase, ETH appears highly bullish again and tapped $2,750 as the price broke through a crucial resistance line. A rejection at this level cooled off the buying, and the market pulled back. Since then, the next market move has remained indecisive as the market continues to move sideways on the daily chart. Although it attempted to break higher on Thursday, but failed after rejecting the $2,788 level. It is currently down following a slight loss in the last 48 hours. Despite that, the asset remains in a buying range. A strong recovery above the $2,300 level could bring hope for more bullish rally on the daily chart. Otherwise, Ethereum may revisit $1,900 before regaining momentum. ETH’s Key Level To Watch Source: Tradingview Closing this month neutral-bullish, the key resistance level to watch for a break up is $2,788. A surge above it could rally us through $3,000 to retest the $3,213 level. The next buy target above this level is $3,744. If the price continues to decline, especially below the important $2,320 support, the lower discount price to keep in mind would be the $2,104 and $2,873 support levels, bringing a retest at the broken resistance line. Key Resistance Levels: $2,788, $3,213, $3,744 Key Support Levels: $2,320, $2,104, $1,873 Spot Price: $2,536 Trend: Bullish Volatility: Moderate Disclosure: This is not trading or investment advice.

Elon Musk exited the White House and immediately got himself caught up in more political drama, this time in his home country of South Africa. The South African government is reportedly in the process of loosening its empowerment laws to accommodate Starlink , a feat that the South African telecom company, Vodacom failed to achieve. Backlash over Starlink deal The South African government has proposed to loosen its Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) laws to accommodate Elon Musk’s Starlink. This proposal has sparked public outrage and caused opposition parties to accuse the acting government of striking a “backdoor deal” to give the US tech giant preferential treatment. Under existing regulations, telecom companies are required to sell at least 30% of their local equity to historically disadvantaged South Africans to operate in the country. The government intends to loosen the laws just enough to allow telecom companies to bypass that strict 30% Black ownership requirement by investing in alternative empowerment initiatives. The government has been under pressure to improve internet access and modernize telecommunications, and argues that the law change is part of its economic reform strategy. Critics have warned that the government’s decision sets a dangerous precedent by prioritizing foreign capital over domestic equity. Opposition parties like Build One South Africa (BOSA) and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are leading the growing backlash against the government’s proposal. The BOSA deputy leader, Nobuntu Hlazo-Webster, said that the party has formally requested a public record of the decision from parliament to ensure transparency. “The message being sent is that if you are a powerful foreign billionaire, you can sidestep South Africa’s laws, while our local businesses are forced to jump through hoops,” she said. “We cannot build an economy based on exceptions. Our laws must apply equally to all—foreign or domestic, rich or poor.” Roger Solomons, a BOSA spokesperson, described the move as “impulsive” and accused the government of rewriting long-standing transformation rules to make Starlink’s market entry “favorable to them, and not the country.” The EFF’s Julius Malema warned that he would oppose the decision in parliament. “We cannot be dictated to by business,” he said. South Africa’s BEE laws The loosening of rules in the telecom sector has inspired other industries to seek similar treatment. In the mining sector, the Minerals Council South Africa has urged the government to exclude exploration companies from proposed Black ownership requirements. A new mining bill seeks to enshrine into law a 30% Black ownership target for mining companies. Allan Seccombe, the communications director at the Minerals Council, said: “Prospecting is extremely high risk. There’s no guarantee they’re going to find something that’s economically viable. Every cent they raise should ideally go towards drilling out or finding a resource.” The Democratic Alliance (DA), the second-largest party in the ANC-led coalition government, is currently challenging the BEE laws in court. James Lorimer, a DA Member of Parliament, said that the proposed mining legislation will “effectively end the already tottering case for foreign investment in South African mining.” He added that the bill “seeks to double down on racial transformation and brings back a legion of bad ideas.” Despite mounting pressure, President Cyril Ramaphosa has remained firm in his defense of the BEE laws. In a parliamentary session this week, he rejected claims that the empowerment policies were stifling economic growth. “I find it very worrying that we continue to have this notion that BEE is the one that’s holding our economy back,” he said. “It is the partial and exclusive ownership of the means of production in our country that is holding this economy from growing.” KEY Difference Wire helps crypto brands break through and dominate headlines fast",Tech|Elon Musk|Starlink,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|MARKET|MINING|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-05-31 23:05:37

The ministry vowed to crack down on what it describes as “involution-style” competition threatening the country’s fast-growing electric vehicle (EV) and auto sectors. The statement, issued on Saturday, comes shortly after the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) launched an industry-wide initiative urging auto companies to preserve fair competition and avoid practices that could destabilize the market. The MIIT said it will step up regulatory oversight and intervene where necessary to restore order to the market. Escalating concerns over China’s EV price wars At the core of MIIT’s warning is the escalating discount frenzy that has swept across China’s EV landscape . Over the past year, automakers, from EV leader BYD, to traditional players like Geely and Chery have slashed prices on dozens of models to hold or grow market share. BYD , for instance, cut prices across more than 20 models in late May, setting off a new wave of markdowns throughout the industry. The MIIT’s intervention is a deviation from the norm for how China manages its production sector. The regulatory approach for the auto market appears to have gone from fostering growth at any cost to ensuring long-term sustainability and quality across its strategic industries, including new energy vehicles (NEVs), which now account for over 40% of new car sales in the country. The CAAM echoed the ministry’s concerns in a statement last week. While it acknowledged the impressive growth of the NEV sector, the association said profitability is declining due to the rise of destructive pricing tactics. While competitive pricing is legal and expected, the group cautioned that it should not come at the expense of industry fundamentals. Tu Le, managing director of Sino Auto Insights, provided insights into the ongoing price wars, stating that the current pricing strategies could lead to a “bloodbath” later this year, particularly affecting weaker players like Neta and Polestar. Industry analysts say the MIIT’s intervention is timely, though the effectiveness of its new regulatory push remains to be seen. Some fear that without enforceable penalties or an overhaul of pricing policies, companies may continue prioritizing volume over value.

Notably, XRP prices have dipped by over 7% in the past week amidst a general crypto price correction. However, CasiTrades predicts there may be a window for quick price relief provided a specific support level remains valid. Related Reading: Ethereum Pulls Back To 20DMA After $2,700 Rejection: Testing Strength At Key Support Scalp Setup Tips XRP For $2.25 Price Target In an X post on May 30, CasiTrades outlines a XRP trade set up that presents a potentially lucrative short-term trading opportunity. Notably, the analyst explains that XRP decline to its 0.118 Fibonacci retracement level at $2.196 has pushed into a familiar price region for short-term scalp trades. Based on CasiTrades’ analysis, the perfect entry zone for many investors lied at $2.20, with a price target of $2.253 at the 0.236 Fibonacci retracement level acting as the take-profit zone. The analyst explains that this is scalp setup that operates on the high chance of securing quick price relief. Therefore, a price surge to $2.253 is not indicative of impending price reversal. However, in the presence of strong bullish momentum, XRP is well-poised to move beyond $2.253 with potential targets set at $2.333, $2.395 and $2.456. Notably, CasiTrades has identified the stop-loss for this trade set-up at $2.13. The analyst explains that market bulls must prevent a decisive price fall below this level as it would neutralize the validity of the entire scalp trade setup. In such a negative scenario, the altcoin is likely to experience further price decline with the next major support set around $1.77. Related Reading: Uniswap Rally Loading—Here’s Why The Next Move Could Be Explosive XRP Price Overview At press time, XRP trades at $2.14 following a significant 4.86% decline in the past one day and 3.01% in the past thirty days. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume has increased by 57.32% suggesting a surge in selling pressure in relation to the ongoing price crash. Based on its daily trading chart, XRP lies below its 200-day moving average indicating there is strong potential for the altcoin to maintain a downward trajectory and invalidate CasiTrades’ scalp relief projection. Meanwhile, the token’s Relative Strength Index currently stands at 36.47 and is headed for the oversold region which could potentially trigger a price rebound to around $2.30. With a market cap of $125.04 billion, XRP continues to rank as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency. Interestingly, market analyst with X username Crypto V backs the altcoin’s bullish potential projecting a market cap of $790 billion before 2025 runs out.

CRO is the native asset of the Cronos layer-1 blockchain, which was developed by the exchange Crypto.com. Canary filed an S-1 Form with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), proposing an ETF that would offer investors exposure to CRO. If approved, the product would also stake a portion of its CRO holdings to earn rewards. The new S-1 statement represents the latest in a spree of recent ETF filings for Canary, which is also attempting to launch Solana ( SOL ), XRP , Sui ( SUI ), Litecoin ( LTC ), Axelar ( AXL ), Hedera ( HBAR ) and Pudgy Penguins ( PENGU ) funds. The SEC greenlit the first spot market Bitcoin ( BTC ) ETFs in January 2024, bringing in billions of dollars worth of inflows to the top digital asset by market cap. The regulator subsequently approved Ethereum ( ETH ) ETFs for trading last July. Two financial firms, Franklin Templeton and Hashdex, also launched joint BTC-ETH ETFs earlier this year. CRO is trading at $0.102 at time of writing and is up more than 8% in the past 24 hours. By comparison, the overall crypto market cap slumped by more than 4% over the same period.

Looking forward, the price of Ethereum could climb to a new level soon. CryptoGoos forecasts the Ethereum price may soar to $3,000 soon based on a bullish flag pattern. Also, Sensei believes the Ethereum price is gearing up for a breakout. The analyst posted a chart that showed the altcoin price soaring to $3,400 after a long period of consolidation. However, the Ethereum price has to cross the barrier around $2,850 first. Doing so could spark investors’ interest and buying activity. Tron (TRX) Eyes Rally To $0.30 After Breakout While the Ethereum market could see a significant increase soon, the Tron price jumped 3.0% over the last week. The Tron price, according to CoinMarketCap, has stayed close to $0.26 to $0.28 in the last week. The Tron price has made two attempts to break past the upper level but failed. However, indicators reveal that the cryptocurrency’s price action is still bullish. The relative strength index is above 60, signaling a potential Tron coin price rally. Meanwhile, Four Crypto Spaces predicts the Tron price may rise to $0.30 soon. Other market experts who believe that the TRX price could rally to $0.30 are Dendorion and CW. In a different post, AltCryptoGems noted the Tron price has broken out of a long consolidation. He believes the value of Tron might rise to $0.32 in the next few days if the uptrend continues. However, investors should watch out for a clear breakout above $0.27. Investors Turn to Unilabs (UNIL) for High-Yield DeFi Opportunities While the Tron price has broken out of a long consolidation, investors seeking greater upside are now eyeing Unilabs (UNIL) , an AI-powered DeFi platform with advanced earning potential. Unlike traditional tokens, Unilabs delivers more than price speculation. It offers structured yield-generating opportunities backed by intelligent automation. At its core, Unilabs combines AI with DeFi to manage multiple specialized funds, each tailored to different risk levels and investor profiles. From AI-powered portfolio rebalancing to its Mining Fund, Unilabs creates multiple income streams. These funds are driven by real-time market scanning, sentiment tracking, and tokenomics evaluations. The presale, currently at $0.0051 per UNIL, has attracted early backers. Those who join the crypto ICO will be able to enjoy staking rewards, a 12-tier referral bonus structure and a share of the platform’s revenue. Over $30 million in assets are already under management, signaling strong early confidence. To show how much interest there is in Unilabs, it has raised over $1.5 million in its first presale week. If Unilabs reaches just 0.5% of Ethereum’s current market cap, its price could potentially grow by 10x in the long term, which is why now is the time to get in. The Top Crypto Coins To Buy Now With the Ethereum price eyeing a $3,000 milestone and Tron racing toward $0.30, the altcoin season is heating up. They emerge as the best coins to invest in for June gains. On the other hand, Unilabs could be the breakout star, leveraging AI and DeFi to deliver real utility and earning potential. As early backers snap up tokens at presale rates, the window to join this new DeFi project before mainstream adoption closes fast.

ADA trading volume declined by more than 9%, and options trading declined by 93% in 24 hours. SEC delayed Cardano ETF’s decision to July 13, adding short-term pressure on ADA price. Cardano (ADA) is trading below a significant support level, currently around $0.68. The token’s decline happened after its various attempts to maintain above $0.73 failed, marking a reversal from its brief recovery in early May. Technical indicators suggest that prices may continue to decline. The daily chart shows ADA failing at major moving averages and breaking below the $0.70 psychological level. Analysts identify the $0.58–$0.65 region as the next likely support zone, using Fibonacci retracement levels and historical reaction points. Unless the token reclaims $0.70 in the near term, traders may prepare for more short-term weakness.

XRP has maintained solid momentum, driven by optimism around potential ETF approvals and a favorable regulatory climate. This has reinforced XRP as one of the best cryptocurrencies to invest in, especially for those seeking assets with strong institutional backing and real-world utility. Meanwhile, newer altcoin Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is drawing investor interest as a potential breakout star. The project is presently at Presale Phase 5 and has already raised over $9.4 million with over 11,500 investors. With a public launch price of $0.06 after subsequent phases, phase 5 investors at the prevailing price of $0.03 can realize potential returns of 100% by the time the token launches on exchanges. XRP Holds Steady at $2.29 Amid Bullish 2025 Forecasts As of writing on May 28, 2025, XRP stands at $2.29, stable despite the recent market volatility. Speculators expect a bright future for XRP, with projections setting aside a likely rise to $4 upon consolidation breakout. Bullish forecasts have XRP rising to $5 to $10 by year-end 2025, contingent on favorable market conditions and increased adoption. While XRP continues to be in the limelight for investors, upcoming altcoins like Mutuum Finance (MUTM) are also in the radar with prospects to deliver high returns. Mutuum Finance: Genuine Innovation in DeFi Lending Mutuum Finance distinguishes itself by being the innovative two-lending scheme that includes Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) functionality. With P2C, individuals get to freeze stablecoins in smart contract pools whose interest rates automatically adjust dynamically. The P2P, as opposed to that, bypasses intermediaries so that lending contract control rests directly with users. It all gives rise to an extremely effective and variable lending system. Certik Audit Completed: Mutuum Finance Solidifies Trust and Transparency Security and transparency are built into the core of the project. Mutuum Finance has now officially completed its Certik smart contract audit, reinforcing the platform’s commitment to safety and reliability. Their open-source smart contracts are secure in design, instilling trust among users. Presale Momentum Many early investors have become very interested in MUTM following the price drop of the token to $0.03. In the upcoming phase, a 16.67% increase will make the token worth $0.035. Experts who expect post-launch prices to go up to $3 are pointing out that $0.03 is a great time to buy the token. That is why Mutuum Finance is preferred by DeFi enthusiasts who watch for affordable altcoins in the market. Mutuum Finance adds a Buy-and-Distribute system to its structure which is not typical for most speculation projects. It buys tokens on the market at set intervals and gives them to MUTM stakers, helping to gradually reduce the supply and drive people to stake for a longer time. It supports plans that help prices rise over the years and allow people to be part of the market for the long term. Engagement by using the leaderboard Along with building a strong community, Mutuum Finance has launched a leaderboard that continually highlights the 50 biggest holders of the token. MUTM allows users from the top 50 ranks to get bonus tokens, making everyone want to hold their positions and work their way higher in the rankings. It connects the benefits of DeFi together with community engagement. Currently, XRP is trading at $2.29 and Ripple enthusiasts are predicting it could scale up to $10 throughout 2025. At the same time, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is picking up speed, having raised $9.4M with more than 11,500 investors backing it. With its initial price at $0.03, MUTM may reach $0.06 by launch, giving investors a chance to double their money. Buy and distribute systems reward owners in addition to its exclusive DeFi lending, because the token is also certified by Certik.

Notably, signs of exhaustion are also beginning to surface for Bitcoin, especially in the past 48 hours. While long-term indicators suggest a bullish continuation for the Bitcoin price, short-term models indicate a breakdown of bullish strength, particularly as the cryptocurrency approaches the critical $100,000 support zone. Related Reading: $10 Million Fix? SUI Network Moves Fast After Cetus Exploit Scare This sentiment is relayed by popular crypto analyst Willy Woo, who shared the good and bad news based on Bitcoin’s current technicals. Good News: A Bullish Long-Term Signal Still Intact According to Woo, one of the strongest long-term signals, the Bitcoin Risk Signal, is currently trending downwards. This drop indicates that buy-side liquidity is currently dominant in the long-term environment, setting the stage for another strong leg upward. The lower the risk reading, the safer it is to hold or accumulate Bitcoin, and this signal’s current decline shows a relatively low-risk environment for long-term investors. Woo noted that this long-term setup is intact, and with Bitcoin trading well above the psychological six-figure mark, the momentum is still in favor of the bulls in the long term. At the time of writing, the local risk model, as shown in the chart below, is currently in the mid-range, having declined from peak levels in early 2025, and is expected to continue trending downwards. In another analysis, Willy Woo noted the next significant move could push it above $114,000 and trigger liquidations of short positions. Bad News For Bitcoin Price Although the long-term picture is still favorable, the short-term models, including the Speculation and SOPR (Spent Output Profit Ratio) metrics, are flashing caution. Using this indicator, Woo noted that the strength of the rally from $75,000 to $112,000 has started to weaken, especially with flat capital inflow in the past three days. Keeping this in mind, Bitcoin’s price action this week is critical. “If we do not get follow through, then we will be up for another consolidation period,” the analyst said. If spot buying fails to pick up strongly in the coming week, which is the first week of June, especially with U.S. markets reopening after a long weekend, there will be a chance for a bearish pivot. The good and bad news can be summed up as follows: if buying pressure opens up quickly, Bitcoin could break above $114,000 and head toward the next major liquidity zone between $118,000 and $120,000. Failure to push higher could confirm bearish divergences and set the stage for another round of consolidation. Related Reading: $400K Bitcoin?

Real value comes from projects showing results, whether it’s in development progress, user growth, or smart integrations. Many coins make noise, but only a few deliver substance. This guide looks at 4 different picks, Unstaked, Filecoin, Litecoin, and Toncoin, that are standing out in distinct ways. From AI-powered platforms to real utility in storage and payments, each one shows strong momentum. If you’re interested in spotting the top crypto gems to buy now, this list gives you a smart place to begin, with names that are doing more than just riding trends. 1. Unstaked: AI Agents Ready After Presale Ends Unstaked brings a unique twist by preparing real-time AI automation for crypto communities. Its autonomous agents, set to go live after the presale concludes, will run nonstop on apps like Telegram and X, handling support, posting updates, and boosting community activity without human staff. Each action they take will be logged on-chain, and users will earn $UNSD for engagement. These agents cost between $10 and $25 per month, much cheaper than hiring a team, and could save users up to 100 times their annual spending. Now in stage 17 of presale, Unstaked is priced at $0.01043. So far, it has raised over $8 million and sold more than 1 billion $UNSD. The expected launch price is $0.1819, offering a projected return of 2700% for early holders. It follows a fair launch model with no private allocations or VC rounds, keeping it widely accessible. Since $UNSD will be essential to run, improve, and oversee the agents, the usage of the coin is built into daily operations. While the agents haven’t launched yet, the structure and progress place Unstaked among the top crypto gems to buy now with solid future use. 2. Filecoin: Pushing Web3 Storage Further In 2025, Filecoin is staying relevant by providing decentralized storage that’s actually being used. Prices hover between $2.80 and $2.85 as of May, and the team is growing the network through real tools. The Avalanche bridge launched this month lets Avalanche smart contracts link directly to Filecoin storage, offering cheaper, provable, and compliant data solutions. The recent “Teep” upgrade also brings faster settlement, easier terms for storage hosts, and upgraded tools for builders. On top of that, the Fil+ system is speeding up how developers access Datacap with a new Metaallocator setup. AI platforms like SingularityNET and GoKite AI are now using Filecoin’s storage model, which adds another layer of traction. When blockchain and AI work together, that’s usually a strong sign. With solid tech steps and a roadmap that holds up, Filecoin keeps its place among the top crypto gems to buy now. 3. Litecoin: Long-Running and Still Relevant Litecoin may not grab headlines, but it keeps proving its strength with stable network use and price movement. As of now, LTC is at $96.47, seeing a 1.57% daily rise. It’s pushing against resistance at $96, and if that breaks, analysts are suggesting possible climbs to $120 or even $128. If Bitcoin heads toward $150K this year, some forecasts even see Litecoin above $200. The chain still records over 500,000 daily transactions, which speaks volumes about usage. Beyond this, platforms like BitPay and NOWPayments continue to support Litecoin, helping expand its presence in online commerce. An ETF proposal from Canary Capital is also in play, though currently awaiting regulatory clearance. For people looking for a reliable and active project, Litecoin is still one of the top crypto gems to buy now, especially if you prefer steady performance over hype. 4. Toncoin: Scaling Fast with Real Numbers Toncoin’s recent activity points to real traction, not just headlines. Its May 2025 price stands near $2.96 after a 0.71% uptick in a day, though it remains 6.57% down for the month and nearly 54% below its all-time high of $8.27. But while the price dropped, usage spiked. Daily transactions rocketed from 100,000 to 1.2 million, a huge jump for any chain. This rise in network activity is tied to several new features: integration with USDT, fresh tools like TON DNS and TON Storage, and a more focused ecosystem after removing its cross-chain bridge. Technical watchers are watching for a breakout above $3.20, which could push the price toward $5. Currently valued at $7.37 billion in market cap, Toncoin is just behind Monero. With growing utility and strong development, Toncoin clearly fits among the top crypto gems to buy now. Final Say! From planned AI rollouts and strong storage tech to proven payment systems and fast-growing chains, each of these names reflects practical growth, not empty talk. Filecoin’s role in AI and storage blends is expanding fast, while Litecoin continues to offer reliable performance. Toncoin, despite price dips, is seeing real user growth, and Unstaked’s AI model, set to launch after presale, could change how crypto projects manage communities. For anyone aiming to find the most promising cryptos in 2025 , these are the top crypto gems to buy now that deserve attention for their actual progress and usage, not just marketing noise.

Recent global economic uncertainties and blockchain innovations have reignited interest in altcoins that demonstrate real utility and growth potential. One project steadily capturing attention is Qubetics ($TICS), which is positioned to solve persistent blockchain challenges that predecessors like Injective could not fully address. As the crypto sphere moves toward greater interoperability and usability, identifying the top cryptos to buy for 2025 involves recognizing those with robust technology and market traction. Qubetics is rapidly emerging as a front-runner, with its ongoing crypto presale making it an accessible and compelling option in this increasingly competitive market. Injective Protocol: A Missed Opportunity in Decentralized Finance Injective Protocol once stood at the forefront of decentralized finance (DeFi), offering a fully decentralized exchange (DEX) with advanced features like cross-chain trading and zero gas fees. Its innovative Layer-2 scalability solutions positioned it as a pioneer capable of transforming derivatives and spot trading on the blockchain. The token’s crypto presale and early phases saw significant enthusiasm, fueling rapid price appreciation. Yet, many did not capitalize on Injective’s rise during this critical period, resulting in a missed opportunity as the token surged before stabilizing. While Injective remains an influential player with ongoing development, the token’s most explosive gains have likely passed. Why does Injective still appear among the top cryptos to buy for 2025? Its core technology continues to underpin decentralized exchanges, but the maturation of the market and increased competition have tempered expectations for similar rapid growth in the near term. Qubetics ($TICS): The New Rising Star Among Top Cryptos to Buy for 2025 Qubetics stands out as a promising entry on the list of top cryptos to buy for 2025. Currently in its 36th presale stage, Qubetics has sold over 514 million tokens to more than 27,300 holders, raising upwards of $17.5 million. At a token price of $0.3064, the project remains accessible to a broad audience eager to participate before the mainnet launch. Analyst projections for Qubetics are particularly optimistic. The token is forecasted to reach $1 after the presale, suggesting a 226% return. Post-presale predictions indicate a surge to $5, equating to a 1531% ROI, while the mainnet launch could potentially push the price between $10 and $15, delivering an impressive 4794% return. Such forecasts place Qubetics among the most compelling top cryptos to buy for 2025. Qubetics’ Technological Edge: QubeQode and Qubetics IDE Qubetics offers a dual-pronged technological innovation through its QubeQode platform and Qubetics Integrated Development Environment (IDE). These tools aim to simplify blockchain adoption and empower businesses, professionals, and individuals with versatile solutions. For businesses, QubeQode enables seamless cross-chain asset management and smart contract deployment, fostering interoperability that reduces operational friction. Professionals benefit from customizable workflows and secure, decentralized applications facilitated by Qubetics IDE, increasing efficiency and control over digital operations. On the individual level, Qubetics prioritizes privacy and control, allowing users to engage with blockchain ecosystems without relinquishing custody of their assets. The crypto presale’s affordability and growing community support accentuate Qubetics’ potential to reshape blockchain usability and adoption in 2025. Why did Qubetics secure a spot among the top cryptos to buy for 2025? Its innovative platforms combined with an accessible crypto presale provide a gateway to exponential growth opportunities previously unseen. Conclusion: Based on Research and Analysis Based on research and analysis, the missed opportunity with Injective highlights the importance of early participation in promising projects. In contrast, Qubetics emerges as a compelling candidate among the top cryptos to buy for 2025 , blending cutting-edge technology with real-world applications and an affordable crypto presale phase. Analyst forecasts support significant growth potential, making Qubetics an attractive option for market entrants seeking substantial upside. Market participants should consider Qubetics’ unique positioning alongside established projects, maintaining awareness of the volatile nature of cryptocurrency investments. This period offers a rare chance to engage with a project poised to redefine blockchain interoperability and adoption.

Amidst the crypto market euphoria seen in the past two months, TRX has maintained a steady price growth reporting percentage increase of 17.39% since the beginning of April. Interestingly, prominent crypto analyst Burak Kesmeci has shared an intriguing market insight that indicates TRX is likely to remain on the uptrend for the foreseeable future. Related Reading: Bullish Candle Formation Suggests The XRP Price Could Touch $22 TRX Futures Market Signals Good Accumulation Opportunity In an X post on May 30, Burak Kesmeci postulated that TRX remains in a prime position for further price gains based on developments in futures retail activity. Using data from CryptoQuant, the analyst explains that TRX previously reached a market of $0.45 in December 2024 which aligned with a period of peak retail speculation as indicated by the cluster of red dots on the chart. During this period, many traders likely leveraged long, trading the rally in anticipation of a sustained price uptrend. However, TRX prices soon crashed to $0.21 during a broader market correction that lasted for the majority of the first trimester of 2025. This period is marked by a sparse amount of gray dots suggesting a neutral retail participation in the futures market. Amidst resumed crypto bull market rebound, TRX prices have risen to around $0.27. However, retail activity has remained neutral with no significant uptick in speculation or emergence of a “mad crowd” as seen in December 2024. According to Burak Kesmeci, these findings indicate there is significant potential for an upswing in the TRX market as retail futures activity is far from overheated. However, there is a need for macroeconomic and geopolitical tensions to subside before these projected gains can occur. Recently, the crypto market produced a negative reaction to reports of the US and China failing to find a common ground in an ongoing trade talk amidst a 90-day truce before both countries. Related Reading: Ethereum Pulls Back To 20DMA After $2,700 Rejection: Testing Strength At Key Support TRX Price Prediction At the time of writing, TRX trades at $0.26 reflecting a 2.87% decline in the past day. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume is valued at $806.98 million. According to data from CoinCodex, TRX investors are strongly bullish despite recent losses as evidenced by the Fear & Greed Index of 60. Coincodex analysts project TRX to soon rediscover its bullish form with forecasted price targets of $0.32 and $0.29 in the next five and thirty days respectively. In addition, they paint a positive long-term outlook with a price target of $0.51 in six months.

33767162,[object Object],1748745049,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,Dogecoin Technical Analysis Reveals What Could Happen To Price From Here,https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-technical-analysis-reveals-what-could-happen-to-price-from-here/,"Crypto analyst Jmorg has provided an in-depth technical analysis, which shows what could happen to the Dogecoin price from its current levels. The top meme coin has already dropped below the psychological $0.2 level as part of a broader crypto market correction. What The Dogecoin Price Might Look Like From Current Levels In a TradingView post , Jmorg stated that Dogecoin has meaningful momentum behind its current price action , which is evident in the Money Flow Index (MFI). He noted that the indicator is accelerating off a very low momentum and trending higher on the weekly timeframe. The analyst further remarked that the Bollinger band width is narrowing to historical lows, which could eventually be the catalyst for the necessary volatility needed for DOGE to return to or exceed its current all-time high (ATH). He claimed that Dogecoin could reach $1 based on a Cup-and-Handle measured move . Meanwhile, the foremost meme coin could touch $0.95 based on the measured move from a breakout of the rectangle. Commenting on the Fibonacci retracement , Jmorg stated that given the momentum and potential increase of volume, a retracement to the current ATH of $0.73 seems likely. The analyst added that a pause and continuation of the advance higher would put Dogecoin near $1.20. He went on to allude to Dogecoin’s historical pattern , which saw the meme coin record gains of 8,000% and 2,000%. The analyst noted that an 8,000% gain would take DOGE to $15, or a market cap of $2.3 trillion. Jmorg remarked that it seems unlikely, as BTC has a market cap of about $2,2 trillion. However, the analyst highlighted a scenario where the Bitcoin price rallies to $200,000 and then a breakout of the wedge pattern sends Dogecoin to $15. He remarked that such a scenario makes the $15 price target more realistic and that, since crypto is unpredictable, anything is possible. Factors That Could Send DOGE To New Highs In his analysis, Jmorg also outlined factors that could send the Dogecoin price to new highs. First, he stated that the midterm elections will matter and that he suspects the Trump administration will do everything possible to retain control of DC, which would likely lead to pro-crypto policies . The analyst added that pro-crypto policies and deregulation could be a powerful tailwind for the US economy, which would help keep people employed and ultimately maintain high asset prices. Another factor which Jmorg outlined is the Dogecoin ETF . He noted that approval for these funds appears likely, and this could provide a significant source of demand. The DOGE ETFs would drive institutional inflows, which could spark a price surge for the meme coin. The last factor is the potential integration of Dogecoin payments on the X social media platform . The crypto analyst noted that this doesn’t seem unrealistic, given that Elon Musk is a huge fan of the meme coin. Like the DOGE ETFs, he said that this could provide a source of demand for the meme coin. At the time of writing, the Dogecoin price is trading at around $0.1897, down over 7% in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

Let’s break down what’s happening with XRP’s price action and the important support and resistance levels to watch. XRP Bounces from Key Support Zone On the daily chart, XRP recently bounced from a key support area between $2.10 and $2.15. This zone has been flagged as an important level, and for now, the price is holding steady above that range. If XRP falls below this support, the next levels to watch would be around $2.05 and $2.00. A drop under $2.00 could signal a bigger decline in the coming days or weeks. Inverse Head and Shoulders Pattern in Progress? Technically, XRP is possibly forming an inverse head and shoulders pattern on the daily timeframe. This is often seen as a bullish setup. For this pattern to confirm, XRP needs to bounce higher in the coming days and break through the golden pocket resistance zone between $2.56 and $2.62. A confirmed breakout above $2.62 could open the doors for a strong rally toward new all-time highs. However, for now, this pattern is only a possibility — it hasn’t been confirmed yet. Resistance Areas That Could Slow XRP’s Progress Before XRP reaches the golden pocket resistance, it will face other challenges. The price will need to clear resistance levels around $2.33 to $2.34 and then again near $2.43 to $2.44. Another major barrier stands at $2.48, which has been a key swing level in the past. These areas could lead to short-term pullbacks or pauses as traders take profits and reassess the market situation. Market Reaction: A Bounce in Progress In the shorter term, XRP is showing a minor bounce, often called a wave-four bounce in technical analysis. This small move upward happened after the price tested support around $2.07 to $2.08. Although the price didn’t fully hit the expected $2.06 mark, the reaction suggests traders are still active around these levels.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Price Analysis|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,ALTCOIN|MARKET|TRADING|XRP,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-01 03:05:55

BTC/USD fell by 8% as of May 31, retreating to levels below its previous all-time high. This decline leaves the token nearly $9,000 below its recent record peak, putting short-term sentiment to the test. Demand Metrics Signal a Cooling Trend A report from CryptoQuant shared with Cointelegraph suggests that Bitcoin’s demand growth may be hitting a temporary ceiling. The analytics platform estimates that Bitcoin demand has increased by 229,000 BTC in the last 30 days, nearing the 279,000 BTC peak seen in December 2024. “Some of Bitcoin’s demand metrics may be reaching a short-term top, which could imply a pause in the current rally,” the report stated. It also noted that whale balances have risen by 2.8% over the past month, a pattern often followed by reduced accumulation from major holders. Additionally, average unrealized profits hovered around 30% when prices neared $111,000—another sign of an imminent slowdown. Analysts Eye Key Technical Levels Prominent trader Mags highlighted the importance of the upcoming weekly candle close. “On the daily chart, BTC has broken below the previous all-time high and is facing rejection at that same level,” Mags observed. “This might look like the start of a deeper correction.” If Bitcoin closes the week below the December 2024 high of $104,450, it may form a bearish pattern before climbing again, he added. Bull Market Outlook Remains Intact for Now Despite the current retreat, broader sentiment remains optimistic. Trader Aksel Kibar said the bull market structure is still intact, provided prices remain above $73,700. He reiterated his 2025 target of $137,000 for BTC, aligning with a midterm bullish outlook. CryptoQuant analysts see $120,000 as a key level where many investors might choose to lock in profits. While the path forward could involve further short-term losses, most analysts agree the bull market has not been derailed.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-06-01 03:36:34

According to customs office data released on Sunday, exports declined by 1.3% compared to May last year, better than the 2.4% drop economists had forecast in a Bloomberg survey . Imports fell 5.3% over the same period, widening the country’s trade surplus to $6.9 billion. The slide in exports comes as South Korea prepares for the full effect of US duties. In April, Trump slapped a 25% tariff on Korean imports—one of the harshest levies placed on a US ally—though this was temporarily cut to 10% for 90 days. He has also threatened to extend the tariffs to cover Samsung Electronics Co.’s mobile phones. South Korea’s first priority will be to navigate US tariffs Navigating Trump’s trade policy will be among the first tasks for the incoming South Korean president after the June 3 election. Seoul’s trade officials have been trying to secure a revised tariff agreement with Washington, but talks have made little headway. Officials say a leadership gap in Seoul has stalled progress. If no new deal is reached, the tariff will revert to 25%. There is also uncertainty over whether the tariffs can take effect at all. A US federal appeals court has paused a ruling that could overturn much of Trump’s tariff strategy, yet the administration insists the duties will stand in one form or another. Breaking down the May figures, the customs office reported auto exports dropped 4.4% year-on-year, while semiconductor shipments jumped 21.2%. Since chips and cars drive much of South Korea’s overseas sales, these shifts were significant. Exports to the US fell 8.1%, and sales to China were down 8.4%. Meanwhile, the broader economy remains fragile. On Thursday, the Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rate to support growth and almost halved its forecast for 2025 amid concerns over trade uncertainty and weak domestic consumption. Governor Rhee Chang-yong indicated that further rate cuts could follow, pointing to slowing growth momentum. Cryptopolitan Academy: Coming Soon - A New Way to Earn Passive Income with DeFi in 2025.

While Hedera (HBAR) shows signs of a 26% pullback and Pi Network aims for a $0.90 breakout, Web3 ai is moving in a different direction. It is building an AI-powered platform focused on real use, not just price charts. Web3 ai is not chasing trends. Its presale supports a full product suite with trading support, risk tools, and DeFi features all in one place. Having raised over $6.6 million, the project is shifting focus from fast price changes to long-term value. A possible 1747% return shows that some are looking beyond the next chart move. Web3 ai Draws Interest as a Smart All-in-One Crypto Tool While many still switch between different tools for research and DeFi planning, Web3 ai is creating one smart system for it all. The presale offers more than early access. It is a chance to support a full AI system designed to improve the way people interact with crypto. Powered by machine learning and natural language tools, Web3 ai includes a scam checker, yield planner, and risk alert features. All of this comes together in one easy-to-use platform. The goal is to replace complexity with clarity and help users manage crypto smarter. That vision is drawing attention. The presale has passed $6.6 million in funding. With a current stage 7 price of $0.000402 and launch set at $0.005242, early users could see a 1747% gain. Those tracking future trends or the next major platform may find Web3 ai a smart place to start. In the end, this isn’t just another crypto launch. It’s a move toward a smarter platform that aims to understand what traders need before the market even shifts. Hedera Watchlist: Bearish Pattern Raises Concerns The Hedera (HBAR) price outlook is facing uncertainty as key chart signals point to a possible dip. A bearish flag has appeared, often seen as a continuation of an earlier drop, and it suggests that a 26% decline could happen if the pattern holds. This risk becomes more serious due to a $55 million liquidation level that could add pressure and speed up a fall. HBAR is finding it tough to move higher, as trading activity slows and sellers take control. Important support levels are now in focus. If they fail, the price could drop more sharply. Traders watching Hedera (HBAR) should pay close attention to the next move. The flag pattern is nearing a critical point. How the token reacts could decide how the market feels about it in the near future. Pi Network Moves Toward Possible Breakout from Triangle Pattern Pi Network price activity is building interest as a symmetrical triangle forms on the chart. This pattern often shows a quiet period before a breakout. If the price moves above the top trendline, it could rise by 20%. PI is trading near $0.75 and approaching a key area that may decide its short-term trend. This triangle, with its tightening lines, points to a decision moment. If PI breaks above the upper line, it might reach $0.90, in line with the 20% gain. But if it fails to do that, it could fall back to test the lower edge, which might slow its momentum. Investors are closely watching volume and overall market tone. A strong jump in buyer activity would support a breakout. If that support doesn’t show up, PI may stay within the pattern for a while longer. Final Say While traders follow price swings in tokens like Hedera and Pi Network, others are exploring a different path. Web3 ai’s crypto presale stands out for its focus on building tools that solve real problems, not just reacting to charts. Instead of aiming for fast gains, Web3 ai is developing AI-powered tools for the crypto space. These tools are designed to help users with things like trading support and risk alerts, all in one system. It reflects a shift in interest from short-term action to long-term value.

All eyes are now on a crucial support level around $0.60. The big question — will Pi manage to hold this line, or are we about to see a sharper correction if it slips below this mark? Current Status of Pi Coin Launched in 2019, Pi Coin is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency that allows mining via smartphones, making it widely accessible. After years of anticipation, it was finally listed on exchanges in February 2025. Although initial expectations suggested a listing price of $50, the coin launched at around $3, only to fall to nearly $0.60 — a sharp 78% drop from its peak. Despite this, Pi Coin still commands attention due to its unique mobile-first mining model and a massive user base of over 35 million. Pi has been struggling to break past resistance levels near $0.79, while buyers are showing signs of hesitation at lower levels. Key indicators like the RSI, MACD, and Stochastic RSI reflect weakening momentum, with most metrics leaning bearish. Additionally, a descending wedge pattern has formed since mid-May, yet the price remains trapped inside it. Pi Network Price Prediction For Year End According to CoinDCX, Pi Network is expected to start November 2025 on a bullish note, reclaiming the $2.00 mark and potentially rising to around $2.38 to $2.40 by month’s end. In December, the bullish momentum may strengthen, pushing the price to $2.75 to $2.80. Challenges Facing Pi Coin Mainnet Still Pending : Despite its listing, Pi Network’s full mainnet has not been launched. This raises doubts about its real-world capabilities and long-term viability. Limited Exchange Listings : Pi Coin is available on very few exchanges, restricting access and limiting trading volume. Regulatory Uncertainty : Like many cryptocurrencies, Pi Coin faces regulatory hurdles, adding to investor caution. Overhyped Comparisons to Bitcoin : Although some claim Pi Coin could reach $1,000 or more, such projections seem far-fetched. At that price, its market cap would exceed $6 trillion — compared to its current estimated valuation of just $500 million.",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|EXCHANGE|MINING|TRADING,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-06-01 04:16:05
