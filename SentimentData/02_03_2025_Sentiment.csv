The Bollinger Bands, a widely used technical analysis tool created by John Bollinger, indicate that the token entered oversold territory after a sharp decline over the past few days. XRP price fell 15.6% in just four days, dropping from $2.60 to $2.158 before touching the lower boundary of the Bollinger Bands on the daily chart. At one point, XRP even moved outside this range, a signal that suggests overselling. Historically, when an asset deviates from the lower band, price turnaround ensues. Signs of Strength and a Potential Trend Reversal XRP is reacting in line with this historical trend. After briefly falling outside the lower Bollinger Band, the cryptocurrency has since recovered and re-entered the range. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has gained 8%, reinforcing the possibility of a rebound. Traders closely watch this type of movement, as it typically indicates a change in market sentiment. Beyond technical indicators, broader market trends may further support a price recovery. Historical data suggests that the coming months could be favorable for the asset.

On average, XRP has delivered 20% gains in March, followed by 27% in April and May. This pattern has been consistent over the years, with the last instance of negative returns across all three months in 2016. While historical trends do not guarantee future outcomes, a potential technical rebound and a historically bullish period create a compelling case for the token’s recovery. If the current setup aligns with past patterns, XRP could be positioned for a significant upward movement in the coming weeks.

Tron price predictions indicate a recovery in progress, as it holds above the 200-day EMA and displays a bullish falling wedge formation. Meanwhile, Ethereum surged to $2,850 but has since lost momentum, raising doubts about continued growth. At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) Network’s presale is climbing fast, inching toward the $200 million milestone, fueled by the excitement surrounding its upcoming Keynote 3 event in March. The community is eagerly awaiting major announcements, pushing many to secure BDAG now before potential price spikes from the event’s revelations. Tron Price Prediction: Indications of a Market Rebound Tron’s price recently fell by over 45% from its peak, currently standing at $0.24. Despite this decline, Tron’s price prediction remains optimistic as it stays above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), showing strong buyer activity. Additionally, the asset is forming a falling wedge pattern, often considered a bullish sign. As the trendlines narrow, the likelihood of a price increase grows. Should this pattern play out, it aligns with forecasts predicting a climb back to $0.4485, an 86% potential rise. Ethereum (ETH) Price Surge: A Temporary Rise or a Stronger Trend? Ethereum’s price surge recently lifted ETH to $2,850, standing out as a strong performer despite the broader market’s struggles. However, it has since corrected, leaving many wondering whether this momentum can continue. This Ethereum price surge coincides with difficulties in Solana’s meme coin market, prompting increased interest in Ethereum. Even so, analysts such as Aran Hawker believe this surge is more of a “catch-up” rather than a breakout, with ETH adjusting to its fair value. A key support level sits at $2,425, where over 10 million wallets have accumulated ETH. Meanwhile, ETH is leaving exchanges at a rapid pace, reflecting confidence in its long-term worth. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Sparks Excitement— $600M Milestone in Sight! The upcoming Keynote 3 event, scheduled for March 2025, is poised to be one of the most anticipated crypto events. With a cinematic presentation style, it aims to capture the attention of crypto followers worldwide. Reports suggest that major updates, possibly including new blockchain features, will give holders a clearer understanding of BlockDAG’s direction. The project is witnessing remarkable progress, with its presale currently at $199.7 million and steadily climbing toward its $600 million objective. Analysts expect BDAG, priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, to reach $20 by 2027. Those purchasing now could see returns exceeding 800 times in just two years, cementing BlockDAG’s status as the best crypto of 2025. With the mainnet launch approaching, Keynote 3 is a crucial event for those looking to get ahead in the market. The announcements made during the event are expected to influence prices significantly, making it an important moment to watch. Many are already securing BDAG before Keynote 3, aiming for the highest possible gains, as any updates could lead to a surge in demand. As a result, batch 27 is nearly sold out, and once it ends, BDAG will no longer be available at its current $0.02348 price. Still, Confused About the Best Crypto in 2025? Despite its 45% drop, Tron price predictions remain strong, with technical signs pointing toward recovery. Meanwhile, ETH’s pullback after its recent Ethereum price surge suggests a stabilization, lowering expectations for an extended rally. For those searching for the best crypto of 2025 , BlockDAG stands out as the top contender. With Keynote 3 just around the corner, many are securing BDAG at its current batch 27 price of $0.0248, aiming for substantial future gains. As BDAG is predicted to reach $20 by 2027, demand is surging, pushing the presale closer to its $600 million target.

The analyst previously set the bottom target between $1.88 and $1.91, and XRP hit this range when it fell early in the week. Dark Defender referenced his analysis from February 22 and shared the chart outlining XRP’s price structure and projected movement, reinforcing his long-standing prediction. The chart illustrates a wave correction pattern, where XRP’s price has moved through significant Fibonacci retracement levels. Dark Defender compared this dip to a prior $0.3917 level, which previously led to a sharp reversal in price. Hi all. We set the bottom to $1.88 to $1.91 long ago and want to share the structure discussed last Tuesday, February 22nd. We hit our target correction level. The similar Fibonacci dip level was $0.3917, and then #XRP had a tremendous reversal. I see this level as identical to… pic.twitter.com/0NvfbLziLn — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) February 28, 2025 This crucial resistance level contributed to XRP’s massive surge in late 2024. Given this historical context, the analyst suggests that XRP could be positioned for a similar bullish move. Technical Structure and Fibonacci Levels The chart shared by Dark Defender shows a three-wave corrective structure labeled A-B-C. XRP completed Wave A after its price drop in the first few days of February when tariff threats from the Trump administration pushed the entire market downward. The digital asset is currently at the peak of Wave B, and before any positive price movements, Dark Defender expects a pullback. The chart shows Wave C bottoming at the $1.88–$1.91. Fibonacci retracement levels indicate wave B peaked near the 61.8% retracement at approximately $2.44 before price action moved lower. The 70.2% Fibonacci level at $2.34 also appears to play a role in this correction phase.

The asset has begun its recovery and could experience a significant bullish move soon. This multi-wave formation aligns with broader market trends and historical price movements. The reference to the $0.3917 correction and subsequent rally suggests similar technical dynamics may unfold. The implication is that XRP could be in a pre-reversal phase, contingent on whether support at the projected bottom holds. XRP’s Next Steps XRP is trading at $2.14, and Dark Defender’s analysis aligns with other recent perspectives on its market structure. The analyst recently noted that XRP is at a critical decision point , identifying $2.6052 and $2.77 as crucial levels that could contribute to the digital asset’s growth. His recent review of the weekly Heikin Ashi chart supports the notion of an impending price shift. This analysis suggests that XRP’s price structure is in a formation that could lead to significant movement, echoing broader bullish sentiment.

Will it survive and recover its price in the future, let’s find out. Table of Contents What is Tezos? Tezos crypto price prediction Tezos price prediction 2025 Tezos price prediction 2030 The native token of Tezos ( XTZ ) is currently trading at $0.765 which is about a 21.90% drop from its previous weekly high of $0.920. Its current market cap stands at $801.94 million with a 24-hour trading volume of $34.63 million. Tezos chart, March 01 2025 | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the Tezos price prediction by giving you its short and price forecasts, and explore whether this coin can continue its bullish run. What is Tezos? As per its official website , Tezos is defined as an open-source platform that tackles the main obstacles to blockchain adoption for assets and applications, supported by a global community of validators, academics, and developers. Tezos is claimed to be created with long-term upgradeability, open participation, teamwork, and smart contract security in mind. The native token of the Tezos blockchain is called Tez (XTZ). On the Tezos platform, it is utilized to communicate with dApps, pay fees, secure the network through staking, and offer a simple accounting unit.

Let’s dive into the Tezos price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Tezos coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s Tezos price expectation for the near future, the token is projected to rise by 9.37% and reach $0.857821 by March 28, 2025. As of Feb. 26, 2025, the overall sentiment of the XTZ price prediction remains bearish, with 21 technical analysis indicators showing bearish signals, 7 indicating bullish trends, and 7 indicators showing neutral forecasts. Now let’s discuss Tezos price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Tezos price prediction 2025 According to DigitalCoinPrice in 2025, the XTZ token’s price could fluctuate between $0.70 and $1.71, and may likely hold a yearly average of $1.65. CoinCodex projects that the XTZ token can trade in the price channel of $0.643043 and $1.342898 in 2025. According to Changelly’s analysis of Tezos’s recent price trends, the coin is projected to have a minimum price of $0.618 and a maximum price of $1.13 in 2025. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence it is advised to do your research before investing in XTZ or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Tezos price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Tezos coin price prediction for 2030, XTZ’s price could vary between $0.100438 and $0.701187. DigitalCoinPrice expects that XTZ’s price could climb to $3.69 or $4.22 by the end of 2030. Changelly predicts that by 2030, the XTZ’s token could range between $4.73 and $1.94. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict Tezos price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and like all other tokens, the XTZ token’s price can be highly volatile. This means that no one knows if this token can survive the next five years as there have been many instances where crypto tokens have lost their entire value while some are clear cases of rug pull. You should also note that crypto tokens experience higher volatility than other financial markets and this can cause big price fluctuations in its price.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency including XTZ, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrency in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals which may very well decide the future of the Tezos token. Will Tezos go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the XTZ token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Tezos crypto price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low XTZ can go. Should I invest in Tezos? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Tezos price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community.

The feature, known as Duel Mode, allows players to engage in competitive battles with the assets and rewards at stake. Beyond enhancing user participation, this mode incorporates a structured burn mechanism that permanently removes tokens from circulation. How Duel Mode Works Duel Mode is a player-versus-player (PvP) feature where two participants compete in Shiba Eternity’s collectible card game (CCG). Each player must pay an entry fee of 50,000 SHIB, creating a total duel pool of 100,000 SHIB per match. Once a battle concludes, the winning player receives 80,000 SHIB, while 10,000 SHIB is burned, reducing the circulating supply. The remaining 10,000 SHIB is allocated to platform fees, ensuring continued game development and support. According to Lucie , the ecosystem’s marketing lead, Duel Mode is currently available only in the Web3 version of Shiba Eternity, which remains in its beta phase. The development team has not yet announced an official release date for the full version. Potential Impact on Token’s Supply The introduction of Duel Mode brings the potential for significant SHIB token burns . Lucie outlined an ambitious goal for the feature, emphasizing the importance of reaching millions of duels daily rather than just thousands. If at least one million duels occur daily, 10 billion SHIB could be burned every 24 hours. Assuming the current exchange rate ($0.00001390 per token), approximately $139,000 worth of SHIB would be removed from circulation daily. This translates to 70 billion SHIB ($1.03 million) burned in a week and 280 billion SHIB ($4.12 million) removed in a month. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 By reducing the overall supply, this burn mechanism has the potential to impact the token’s value positively over time. Current Burn Rate and Circulating Supply In addition to the anticipated burns from Duel Mode, the token’s burn rate has recently surged over 1,300%. Within 48 hours, 30.18 million tokens have been permanently removed from circulation. The token burn strategy has removed 410.74 trillion tokens from circulation, reducing the total supply to 589.25 trillion SHIB . As Shiba Eternity Duel Mode gains popularity, its deflationary mechanism may accelerate, reducing the asset’s supply while incentivizing players with rewards. The combination of competitive gameplay and a structured burn initiative presents a unique strategy to enhance the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.

Ver, a prominent advocate of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), has long been a critic of government control and taxation policies in the U.S. Buterin suggested that Ver was being unfairly targeted because of his vocal opposition to coercive government power and his advocacy of financial freedom. “It’s ridiculous to spend the rest of your life in prison for nonviolent tax crimes,” Buterin said. “The case against Roger seems very politically motivated; there have been many people and companies accused of much worse crimes, as with Ross Ulbricht, and sentenced to much lesser sentences than Roger is facing.” Related News: Elon Musk Talks About Dogecoin and Other Memecoins - Unexpected Statements Buterin also argued that selective prosecution of political opponents in the United States is a common tactic used by governments to suppress dissent. Buterin expressed concerns about the U.S. tax system, particularly the citizenship-based taxation model and high exit taxes, which he described as “excessive” and “harsh” compared to other countries. “The US citizenship tax and associated exit tax regime is extreme; the former is shared by almost no other country in the world and the latter is at the high end of what countries do,” Buterin said, citing the UK’s capital gains tax rule as a milder alternative. Buterin concluded his remarks by stating that tax-related offences should be dealt with through financial penalties and compensation rather than criminal prosecution. *This is not investment advice.

In an update shared on X, EF named two new co-executive Directors to drive the ecosystem’s core principles. New Leadership at Ethereum Foundation Notably, Ethereum Foundation has appointed Hsaio-Wei Wang, a researcher, and Tomasz Stanczak, Nethermind founder, as the new co-Directors. The duo will oversee the organization’s affairs and replace Aya Miyaguchi, the former EF Executive Director. According to the Ethereum Foundation, the new directors will pilot the affairs and promote the core values that birthed Ethereum’s existence. The foundation maintained that Ethereum is evolving into a robust, permissionless, and censorship-resistant network for global finance. In her reaction to the appointment, Wang, a researcher and community organizer, insisted the core principles of EF would not change. She, however, acknowledged that EF would continue to evolve alongside Ethereum for growth. On his part, Stanczak hinted he would step down from some of his official functions to assume the new role on March 17. He, however, assured that, pending the necessary paperwork, his work will continue uninterrupted. Miyaguchi’s Transition and Community Reactions The former Executive Director, Miyaguchi, had served in the capacity at EF for seven years before her elevation to the position of president. Miyaguchi’s elevation occurred despite criticism of her leadership style and seeming lack of competitiveness. Others also criticized her inability to deliver on Ethereum’s scaling solution. Many in the Ethereum community had rooted for Danny Ryan as the new lead director. Ryan had received 99% of voters’ support at an informal poll. Danny Ryan’s Etherealize Initiative Ryan, a researcher with EF, led the ecosystem’s switch to proof-of-stake . He now returns as co-founder of Etherealize.

Brett has seen a surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions, cementing its role in the Base blockchain ecosystem. Meanwhile, Floki Inu continues to dominate Web3, integrating DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse into its rapidly growing ecosystem. But the biggest star of the moment is BTFD Coin . With $6.23 million raised in presale, a 100% bonus code live, and a referral program offering major rewards, it’s no wonder investors are rushing in before the presale ends. With a $0.006 moon target and 3650% ROI potential, this is the meme coin everyone is watching. BTFD Coin’s Referral Program and $0.006 Moon Target Fuel Investor Frenzy Ever seen a meme coin reward investors like this? BTFD Coin is turning heads with its massive referral program , offering 10% of the total raise to top referrers each month. Investors who share their unique referral codes can earn extra rewards, and every new buyer using a code gets a 10% bonus on their purchase. And let’s talk about the crazy ROI potential. Analysts predict BTFD could hit $0.006 post-launch, making early-stage buyers the biggest winners. With $6.23 million already raised and over 70 billion BTFD tokens sold, investors aren’t waiting around. A $10,000 investment at $0.00016 per BTFD secures 62.5 million tokens. At the listing price of $0.0006, that would be $37,500. But if BTFD hits its $0.006 moon price, that’s an insane $375,000 potential return. With a 100% bonus on tokens available now, this is a rare shot at life-changing gains. Getting in before the final presale stage is easy. Investors need to set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, connect to the presale page , and purchase BTFD using BNB, ETH, or USDT. Once the presale ends, tokens can be claimed and staked for rewards. Brett Expands DeFi Use on Base Blockchain Brett is more than just another meme coin—it’s powering DeFi transactions on the Base blockchain, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution known for its low-cost and lightning-fast transactions. Unlike traditional meme coins, Brett operates within decentralized exchanges (DEXs), enabling users to trade, swap, and interact with DeFi platforms seamlessly. Its rapid rise on Base proves that meme coins can be more than just hype—they can also drive real blockchain adoption. As interest in Ethereum Layer 2 solutions grows, Brett is positioning itself as a major player in the DeFi movement, making it one of the top new meme coins to invest in this weekend for those seeking both utility and meme culture. Floki Inu Fuels Metaverse and Web3 Adoption Floki Inu has evolved beyond its meme coin origins, becoming a full-fledged Web3 powerhouse. With integrations in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and the Metaverse, Floki Inu is more than just a token—it’s an entire ecosystem.

The project is now expanding into Metaverse applications, allowing users to buy digital assets, trade NFTs, and participate in Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming experiences.

Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, meme coins are no longer just internet jokes—they are shaping the next generation of blockchain applications. BTFD Coin’s explosive presale momentum, 3650% ROI potential, and referral rewards make it the biggest crypto opportunity right now. With Stage 14 in full swing and a $0.006 moon price target, this is the last chance for investors to grab BTFD at a low price before it takes off. Brett is bridging meme culture and DeFi, showing how meme coins can fuel real blockchain adoption on Base. Meanwhile, Floki Inu is redefining Web3, integrating DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse into one powerful ecosystem.

Back when Dogwifhat (WIF) launched, many ignored it as just another meme coin. Those who believed in its potential early on are now sitting on massive gains. But for those who missed out, another major opportunity is here: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). With an innovative presale model and explosive growth potential, it’s quickly becoming one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. Dogwifhat: A Once-Overlooked Meme Coin That Took Off When Dogwifhat launched, few expected it to become a dominant player in the meme coin space. It started trading at just fractions of a cent, and many dismissed it as a passing trend. However, early adopters saw the vision and held onto their tokens. Fast forward, and Dogwifhat has skyrocketed in value, rewarding those early believers with enormous returns. Traders who hesitated now look back with regret, wondering how they missed such an obvious opportunity. But as one door closes, another opens. Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as the next meme coin with game-changing potential, offering an early entry point that could lead to life-changing gains. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Best New Meme Coin to Invest in Now For those searching for the next big meme coin, Arctic Pablo meme coin’s presale is a rare chance to get in before prices surge. Unlike typical presales that move through predictable stages, Arctic Pablo Coin “travels” through different locations. Right now, it’s in Penguinopolis, with a price of just $0.000067 per token. With over $1.64 million raised, Arctic Pablo Coin is proving that investors are eager to be part of this journey. The expected launch price is $0.008, meaning those who enter now could see gains of over 11,844% when it goes live. Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out While meme coins often rely on community hype, Arctic Pablo Coin is taking a unique approach: Innovative Presale – Instead of standard presale rounds, Arctic Pablo Coin progresses through different locations, keeping engagement high. Massive Growth Potential – With an entry price this low, investors have a chance at exponential gains by launch. Strong Community – Arctic Pablo Coin is attracting dedicated supporters who see the long-term potential of this new meme coin. With its creative model and significant momentum, Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly becoming one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. The Presale is Gaining Momentum – Don’t Miss Out Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is generating serious excitement, and those who wait too long may find themselves regretting it—just like those who passed on Dogwifhat. As soon as the presale moves to the next location, the price will increase, making now the best time to secure tokens at the lowest possible price. With over $1.64 million already raised, this isn’t just another hype-driven project; it’s a fast-growing ecosystem with the potential to deliver massive gains. Conclusion The best time to buy a meme coin is before it takes off. Dogwifhat rewarded early believers with life-changing returns, and Arctic Pablo Coin could be following the same path. With a presale model designed to build long-term momentum and an entry price that’s still incredibly low, Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly becoming the best new meme coin to invest in now. As the presale moves through different locations, the price will keep rising. The opportunity is here today—don’t be the one looking back wishing you had taken action.

Earlier, the token recorded a 1.4% gain, suggesting short-term bullish momentum. However, over the past seven days, SHIB has declined by 13.22%, extending its losses over the last month to over 24%. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001363, reflecting ongoing volatility in the market. Analyst Highlights Potential for Significant Price Increase According to crypto analyst Javon Marks, SHIB is maintaining its l ong-term breakout pattern , which began in early 2023 when it surpassed a descending trendline. Following this breakout, a retest of the trendline confirmed a shift in market sentiment, as buyers gained control and selling pressure diminished. Marks also pointed out a hidden bullish divergence, a technical signal that often precedes upward price movements. Based on this pattern, he projects a price target of $0.000081, which represents a potential gain of over 450% from current levels. The analyst maintains that, despite the tomen’s recent volatility, the broader trend remains positive, supporting the possibility of sustained price appreciation into late 2025. Whale Accumulation Signals Institutional Confidence Shiba Inu’s ownership distribution data provides additional insight into market dynamics. Over the past month, large holders—commonly referred to as whales—have increased their SHIB holdings by 0.35%. This trend suggests that institutional and high-net-worth investors are accumulating the token, a sign of confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. Similarly, mid-sized holders have expanded their positions by 0.30%. This investor category, which typically consists of strategic buyers focusing on medium-to-long-term gains, appears to be strengthening its commitment to SHIB. Conversely, retail participation has declined by 0.67%, indicating that smaller investors may be exiting the market. Historically, a reduction in retail activity alongside increased whale accumulation suggests a shift in ownership toward more stable, long-term holders.

According to TradingView analyst Paul Endeo , several bearish factors, including a potential head and shoulders pattern, weak network growth, and declining institutional interest, have contributed to the token’s recent struggles. Additionally, lower profitability among existing holders has put further pressure on the token’s price. Endeo identified $0.0000147 as a critical support level for SHIB. He stated that if the token maintains this level, it could see a 20% rebound toward its monthly high of $0.00001718. However, if support fails, SHIB’s price could decline toward $0.00001261. His analysis appears to be playing out, as SHIB has struggled to hold above the $0.0000147 support level. The token currently trading at $0.00001381, signaling a potential breakdown toward the $0.00001261 target he predicted. This decline suggests that bearish pressure remains strong, and unless the token regains momentum, further downside could be imminent.

41026226,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=684777,1740870000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41026226.jpeg,"Dogecoin Whales Move Millions of DOGE From Crypto Exchanges, What Are They Buying?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-whales-move-millions-of-doge-from-crypto-exchanges-what-are-they-buying/,"The cryptocurrency market is rife with speculation because to the massive movements of Dogecoin (DOGE) by huge investors. Millions of DOGE were moved from exchanges to private wallets in a series of massive transactions during the past week, according to blockchain researchers. This pattern often indicates stockpiling or a deliberate reorganization of a portfolio. Although the reasons are unclear, new data shows that demand for presale products with larger short-term payments is increasing. Among them, investors have been paying particular attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which reroutes money from meme coins into DeFi initiatives that have real-world applications. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is currently in its second presale phase, has raised $1.85 million since its launch and has more than 3,550 holders. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at the forefront of DeFi solutions that combine lending efficiency with passive sources of revenue. Its two-stage presale mechanism gradually raises token prices to incentivize early adopters with rapid returns. When phase three enters the scene at $0.02, investors at $0.015 are looking to gain 33.3%, and the eventual listing price of $0.06 ensures threefold returns. Such numbers, based on transparent tokenomics, shun speculative guessing of names in an attempt to create a stampede for digit security. The project’s historic $1.85 million presale monies raised within weeks are testimonies to the trust of institutional and individual investors. Phase one sold out sooner than anticipated, and demand is driven by shortage as phase two picks up speed. More than 3,550 holders now back the ecosystem, and figures rise each day as Dogecoin whales and institutional investors move reserves to MUTM’s presale. Lending Model Fuels Sustainable Demand The focal point of Mutuum Finance’s appeal is its overcollateralized lending protocol, where users are able to borrow assets against collateral that has been locked up and earn interest on deposits. Borrowers who use $5,000 worth of USDT, for instance, need to lock up $7,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH), reducing default risks and balancing liquidity pools. Lenders, on the other hand, are paid with mtTokens; dynamic assets that grow in value as interest is earned. These tokens, liquid on every DeFi platform, encourage long-term interaction with compounding benefits without the necessity of liquidating holdings. A peer-to-peer (P2P) lending option brings further diversification of utility with direct negotiation on non-traditional assets like Dogecoin. Such adaptability, unprovided by regular platforms, turns MUTM into a middle point between meme coin liquidity and structured DeFi markets. Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism Anchors Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates a high-margin business model with platform revenue employed in automatically repurchasing the token. Purchased MUTM tokens are rewarded to mtToken stakers, inducing consistent buy pressure and avoiding sell-outs. Paired with a $100,000 ten-participant presale giveaway, holder incentive is optimized, rewarding short-term buys as loyal stakeholders. Token distribution also increases longevity: 35% to liquidity mining, 20% to partnerships, and 15% to stabilize post-launch trade. It is such an approach that bypasses volatility that has dogged meme coins and provides a logical solution for investors who do not want growth to be uneven. Exponential Returns Signal in Post-Launch Trajectory Whereas the $0.06 listing price promises a 400% return to early investors, Mutuum Finance’s roadmap has far greater potential. The introduction of an overcollateralized stablecoin, auditing by top blockchain security firms, and dynamic interest rates responding to market conditions can propel MUTM to over $10 by 2025. At that level, a presale investment of $1,000 increases to $66,600; a 6,500% increase eclipsing much of the performances of meme coins. Veteran cryptocurrency players know such presale periods are rare chances to join at grassroots prices. With phase two creeping towards its cap raise, the time to gain access to MUTM under $0.02 becomes increasingly diminished each day. As Dogecoin whales turn into projects that couple profitability with innovation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is among the best candidates for redirected funds. Its presale, already compelling thousands of buyers, combines mathematical return guarantees with a utility-focused ecosystem poised to overwhelm the long term.

After navigating a challenging period marked by regulatory hurdles and market volatility, XRP is now breaking through key resistance levels with undeniable momentum. The spotlight is firmly fixed on the $2.25 mark, a critical barrier that could unlock the next chapter of XRP’s bullish journey. With technical indicators flashing green, institutional interest on the rise, and a broader crypto market recovery underway, XRP’s journey to $2.25 and beyond could be one of the most exciting narratives in crypto this year. Breaking $2.25: A Gateway To New Highs? The $2.25 level holds immense technical and psychological importance for XRP. Historically, this zone has acted as a formidable resistance point, often dictating the direction of XRP’s price action. Breaking above it would validate the current bullish momentum and signal a potential shift in market sentiment toward stronger buying pressure, opening the door for further gains. Related Reading: XRP Price Wobbles at $2.00—Will Bulls Step In to Save The Week? A successful breakout above this zone would confirm strong bullish momentum, opening the door for growth toward $2.92 and even $3.4 in the near term. Historically, breaking key psychological and technical resistance levels has often triggered accelerated price action, as sidelined buyers step in and short sellers unwind their positions. As XRP builds momentum, technical indicators suggest that the rally could extend beyond $2.25, reinforcing a bullish outlook. One key indicator, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), is attempting to break above the 55 threshold. Once the altcoin moves above this level, it may spur demand for XRP, potentially fueling further upside momentum. Additionally, a rising RSI often aligns with strengthening price action, suggesting that buyers are gaining control. If the RSI continues to trend higher and crosses into the overbought territory (above 70), bullish momentum tends to build, increasing the likelihood of XRP challenging higher resistance levels. Bearish Possibilities While XRP’s recent rally has been impressive, the cryptocurrency is not immune to bearish pressures. As the market watches the asset challenge key resistance levels, attention is also turning to critical support zones that could determine whether the uptrend holds or gives way to a bearish breakdown. Related Reading: XRP Bears Resurface—Key Levels to Watch Now Weakening momentum, combined with failure to break above the $2.25 resistance level, points to renewed selling pressure, leading to a possible decline toward the $1.97 support zone. A rejection at this key resistance could signal exhaustion among buyers, allowing bears to regain control and push the price lower. In the event of a drop below $1.97, the next critical support levels to watch would be $1.85 and $1.75. Failure to hold these zones might reinforce a more extended bearish phase, exposing XRP to deeper corrections.

Web3Bay Presale Closes Soon & XRP ETF Draws Attention,https://thecoinrise.com/will-solana-hit-200-web3bay-presale-closes-soon-xrp-etf-draws-attention/,"Are we witnessing strength in Solana, or is XRP preparing for a surge? And what role does Web3Bay play? Recent activity shows that large Solana holders are buying during price dips, despite current challenges. At the same time, XRP is drawing attention as rumors about an ETF grow. If the ETF is approved, it could invite major institutional investors and push XRP to new levels. Even as Solana and XRP face market challenges, Web3Bay’s crypto presale moves into a crucial stage. In contrast to well-known coins, the price of Web3Bay is not yet affected by market volatility, as it climbs with each phase of the presale. With costs rising and a shrinking number of tokens available, now might be the last chance to invest before public trading drives up the value of 3BAY. Web3Bay Stage 5 Set to End Soon – Traders Act Quickly Web3Bay is approaching its launch date and its presale is nearly sold out. At the moment, 3BAY tokens are available for $0.00524, but this rate will not be around for much longer. As each stage of the presale is completed, the price increases and the final public launch is expected to be at $0.1959 per token. Early participants are already in a strong position if they buy at lower rates, and those who decide to invest now still have the chance to gain before the public sale. To date, over $1.5 million has been collected, and more than 390 million tokens have been sold. The appeal of Web3Bay lies in its plan to transform online shopping by offering a decentralized platform. This system removes the need for middlemen, lowers fees, and makes it possible to use both digital currency and traditional payments in the future. The presale model is set up so that increased buyer participation naturally pushes up the token price. This creates a sense of urgency for anyone wishing to invest before the next rise. The trend is similar to the buying activity seen in Solana, where large investors purchase tokens in anticipation of a future surge. For Web3Bay, the upcoming phase marks an important turning point as it shifts from presale to a market-ready asset. Once the platform launches, early token buyers will benefit as the market adjusts. With a limited supply remaining, this phase could be one of the last opportunities to secure 3BAY at a lower cost before its value climbs. Traders are acting quickly as the presale nears its conclusion, aware that each moment counts in building a strong position for the future. Solana Whale Buying Activity Points to Major Shifts Ahead Recent changes in Solana’s price have kept market participants alert. Despite the volatility, large holders continue to increase their SOL positions, showing belief in the long-term prospects of the network. However, an upcoming event — the FTX unlock of 11.2 million SOL scheduled for March 1 — may introduce selling pressure. Even so, there remains strong interest from institutional players. Coinbase has recently introduced Solana futures contracts, expanding options for market entry. Analysts remain divided on Solana’s future. Some predict that SOL could reach $200, while others warn it might fall below $150. Although short-term swings are expected, consistent large-scale purchases indicate that substantial progress may still be ahead for Solana. XRP ETF Discussion Intensifies as Price Forecasts Split XRP is gaining attention as the Bitwise application for an XRP ETF moves forward. If approved, the ETF could allow more institutional investment, similar to Bitcoin ETFs for BTC. Brazil has already approved the first spot XRP ETF, which may pave the way for approvals in other markets. A recent article about Ripple shared by Donald Trump has fueled debate over XRP’s role in global finance. Analysts remain divided: some expect XRP to rise to between $5 and $7, while others warn that without sustained interest, XRP could fall to $0.60. Unlike the steady buying seen with Solana, XRP’s near-term performance largely depends on regulatory decisions. Should these hurdles be overcome, XRP might experience a strong upward move. Essential Takeaways Market changes could spark new trends for Solana and XRP. Large Solana holders continue to build positions, even as the upcoming FTX unlock may affect prices. Meanwhile, the XRP ETF decision will play a key role in determining whether XRP climbs or drops. Web3Bay’s crypto presale follows its own course, with prices rising at every stage. With the final phase nearing, little time remains to buy tokens at a lower rate before public trading drives prices up. For those planning to invest, now is the time to act.

Cardano and Solana have been solid choices for years, but many investors are now exploring fresh alternatives with bigger upside potential and Propichain is at the forefront. This project is turning heads with its real-world use cases and early investment potential. With blockchain-powered real estate at its core, could this be the next big crypto? Why Cardano and Solana Traders Are Exploring New Options For years, Cardano and Solana have been go-to projects for blockchain enthusiasts. Cardano’s research-driven approach has made it one of the most methodical and scalable networks, while Solana’s lightning-fast transactions have attracted developers and traders alike. But even strong projects face challenges. Cardano’s roadmap has been slow to unfold, frustrating some investors looking for faster progress. Solana, on the other hand, has had its share of network outages, raising concerns about long-term stability. With the crypto market evolving, many traders are eyeing fresh opportunities that combine innovation, utility, and growth potential. This is where PropiChain comes in. Unlike traditional blockchain networks that focus primarily on DeFi and smart contracts, PropiChain is bridging the gap between crypto and real estate, offering investors something tangible and sustainable. PropiChain’s Real-World Use Cases Are Turning Heads What sets PropiChain apart is its ability to bring blockchain technology into real estate investing. While Cardano and Solana have revolutionized decentralized applications, PropiChain is doing the same for property ownership. One of its most exciting features is fractional ownership. In the traditional real estate market, high prices often lock out smaller investors. PropiChain changes that by allowing users to buy a fraction of a high-value property, making real estate investing more accessible. You can own part of a luxury apartment without needing millions of dollars. Then there’s AI-powered analytics, a game-changer for investors who want smarter decision-making. Instead of manually researching market trends, PropiChain’s AI scans real estate data, predicts trends, and highlights lucrative investment opportunities. For traders used to analyzing crypto charts, this adds a layer of intelligence to property investments. Another major draw is metaverse integration. As digital real estate grows in value, PropiChain lets you buy and trade virtual properties alongside physical ones. You can also get income from renting or leasing these virtual properties to digital companies. The tokenization feature is also shaking up the industry. Traditionally, property transfers involve banks, brokers, and weeks of paperwork. PropiChain speeds up the process by turning real estate ownership into blockchain-based tokens, making buying and selling property as easy as trading crypto. Smart contracts take things a step further by automating transactions, reducing the need for intermediaries. That means lower fees, faster processing times, and fewer hurdles for investors. And for those looking for financial flexibility, DeFi integration allows users to borrow against their real estate-backed assets, much like how crypto holders use their tokens as collateral for loans. This opens up new possibilities for leveraging investments without selling assets outright. Cardano and Solana Traders Trust PropiChain’s Secure Foundation Security is always a top concern in crypto, and PropiChain has made it a priority. The project has undergone a comprehensive security audit, giving investors confidence in its blockchain infrastructure. Its listing on CoinMarketCap further boosts its credibility, making it easier for traders to track its performance and evaluate its potential. These steps are reassuring for investors moving from Cardano and Solana, who are used to well-established projects. PropiChain’s Presale Could Be a Golden Opportunity Right now, PropiChain is in Stage 2 of its presale, with tokens selling at $0.011. Early investors have a unique chance to get in before the wider market catches on. To put things into perspective: A $2,000 investment today secures 181,818 tokens. If the token price hits $3, that investment would be worth over $545,000. A $10,000 investment could potentially grow to $2.7 million if PropiChain reaches that same price target. These numbers explain why traders from Cardano and Solana are shifting gears—they see the potential for massive returns. Is PropiChain the Next Big Crypto Opportunity? As traders from Cardano and Solana look beyond their usual investments, PropiChain is emerging as an exciting alternative. Its combination of tokenization, AI, and metaverse is reshaping the way people invest in real estate. The crypto market has always rewarded early adopters, and PropiChain’s presale offers a rare chance to get in at the ground floor. If the project continues on its current trajectory, it could become one of the biggest success stories of 2025. The question is; will you seize the opportunity, or will you watch from the sidelines?

Two names that keep coming up are XRP and WallitIQ (WLTQ) . Many investors want to know when these two will hit major price milestones, and GrokAI has stepped in with its predictions. Based on market trends, adoption rates, and investor sentiment, GrokAI suggests XRP could climb to $6, and WallitIQ (WLTQ), which is currently in presale, has a shot at reaching $1 much sooner. WallitIQ (WLTQ) On Track for $1 GrokAI made bullish speculations about WallitIQ (WLTQ) as its presale gained more traction in the crypto market. In this presale, it offers its token to everyone in the crypto community at a very low price of $0.0420 per coin. As investors from several regions hurry to buy the token, GrokAI predicted it would skyrocket in value to the $1 mark in the next few months. However, aside from the profit early investors will make when they buy the token now, all token holders will gain access to an AI-powered crypto wallet that changes how users interact with crypto wallets. WallitIQ (WLTQ) aims to transform the functionality of crypto wallets by incorporating AI-driven security, intelligent investment suggestions, and a user-friendly interface. Unlike traditional wallets, its AI-based features help users make better trading and staking decisions, protect against fraud, and upgrade overall security . The platform’s Escrow Connect technology offers an extra layer of security, allowing users to engage in transactions confidently, free from worries about smart contract vulnerabilities. Also, the use of its platform, like the Physical2Digital feature sets the token apart from many other presale projects that offer little more than theoretical whitepapers. Furthermore, the token has been listed on the asset tracking platform CoinMarketCap, and the beta version of its crypto wallet is now live, another factor driving it towards the $1 mark predicted by GrokAI. Additionally, recognizing the importance of security in a network, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has upgrade its platform by implementing regular audits of its smart contract for added protection. SolidProof, a highly regarded blockchain security firm, assessed the platform’s smart contract and confirmed it is free from vulnerabilities that could expose it to cyber attacks, enhancing its credibility as a secured network The Potential of XRP: A Pathway To $6 XRP has been around for years, making waves with its role in cross-border payments. It has seen strong rallies in the past, but regulatory challenges and market volatility have slowed its growth. After its legal battles with the SEC, it regained some momentum, but the price remains far from its previous all-time high. GrokAI predicts that it could see a new all-time high of $6 within the next 12 to 18 months, provided the broader market continues to recover and institutional interest grows. Factors influencing the XRP price movement include adoption by financial institutions, increased utility within cross-border payments, and overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market. If trading volume remains strong and it solidifies its position as a leader in blockchain payments, it could reach the $6 target sooner than expected. What This Means For WallitIQ (WLTQ) Investors GrokAI’s predictions highlight two very different investment opportunities. XRP is a well-established asset with a strong foundation, but its price movements are slower and more dependent on external factors. Investors who are willing to hold long-term could see it hit $6, but it may take a while. WallitIQ (WLTQ) , on the other hand, is a high-potential presale token with the chance for much faster gains. Since it’s still in the early stages, investors who get in now are positioning themselves for a potential breakout before it hits major exchanges. The crypto market moves fast, and opportunities don’t last forever. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale is still open at $0.0420 , but as demand increases, the price won’t stay this low for long. Investors looking to take advantage of its growth potential might not want to wait too long before making a move.

According to sources, Chinese authorities worry that their AI experts may inadvertently reveal sensitive information on the country’s economic progress while abroad. Additionally, Chinese authorities are concerned that their experts may be detained when they travel overseas or even used in negotiations between the US and China. During Trump’s first term, some of Huawei’s executives were detained in Canada at the US request, and China does not want a repeat of the same with its AI experts. China requires AI experts travelling abroad to detail their leaving and returning plans AI executives and even those from the robotics industry have been told not to travel to the US unless absolutely necessary. Then again, any AI executive wanting to travel abroad must report to authorities on their plans to leave and return, including details on what they did and who they met overseas. Source: ryanswansonlaw Key AI executives have already started changing their travel plans. Liang Weifang, the founder of DeepSeek, declined an invitation to an AI summit in Paris in February. Meanwhile, another major AI startup founder abruptly cancelled a planned US trip last year after receiving direct instructions from Beijing. However, China’s travel restrictions for its AI experts have cultivated uncertainty over future international collaborations , as the country now seems less interested in the global sharing of AI knowledge. The Chinese travel industry is worried other countries may impose visa and travel limitations on their nationals The Chinese travel sector has expressed concerns about the impact of the government’s travel restrictions. Some have cited that they could lead to fewer cross-border innovation and networking opportunities. At the same time, some suggested that other Western nations could impose travel restrictions on Chinese business entrepreneurs. The travel industry also worries that the government may continue interfering with international travel freedom for months. Some travellers believe the US could even impose visa limitations on Chinese AI experts or introduce strict export controls on AI-related technologies. With growing tensions between the two nations, any retaliatory measure could worsen their divide. In February, China implemented tariffs against the US, including a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine car imports. This, however, was a response to Donald Trump’s introduction of a 10% levy on all Chinese goods entering the US. Meanwhile, analysts fear Trump could raise tariffs to 60% as he had promised during his campaign trail, or at least threaten to implement them to gain a diplomatic advantage over Xi. However, a tariff rise could escalate tensions between the two nations and even lead to a full-blown trade war. For now, the country’s leading AI experts are treading carefully — skipping major international summits and facing tight travel reporting requirements. But this caution begs a broader question: Does restricting global engagement enhance China’s AI dreams, or will nationalism, by isolating its top talents, weigh down advancements?

While some projects fade into obscurity, others rise through the ranks, attracting both institutional and retail interest. The question on everyone’s mind is simple: where’s the next big win? If you’re searching for the top cryptos to join now, you need to pay attention to Qubetics, XRP, and Algorand. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, with game-changing technology, strategic partnerships, and serious potential for long-term growth. Qubetics, in particular, has been making serious waves in the crypto space. With its presale already raising over $14.3 million, investors are rushing in to secure their tokens before the price jumps again. Unlike many projects that promise the moon but deliver little, Qubetics is already laying the groundwork for a financial revolution. Meanwhile, XRP continues to battle regulatory challenges while proving its use case in cross-border payments, and Algorand is solidifying its role as one of the most advanced blockchain ecosystems in existence. Let’s break down why these three cryptos should be on your radar right now. Qubetics: The Future of Web3 Finance and Cross-Chain Trading Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency project—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem that aims to revolutionize how people interact with decentralized finance. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics connects multiple blockchain networks, ensuring seamless and secure transactions across different chains. For businesses and individuals alike, this technology opens up new possibilities that were once unthinkable. Imagine being able to move assets across chains without the usual headaches of liquidity fragmentation, slow transactions, or high fees. Qubetics is making this vision a reality. For instance, consider a startup launching its token on multiple blockchains. Traditionally, this would require complex integrations and liquidity pools that can be costly and inefficient. With Qubetics , developers and businesses can access an all-in-one solution, where assets move effortlessly between networks. This innovation is powered by its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, which ensures users retain full control over their funds while benefiting from Qubetics’ ultra-fast transaction speeds. The platform has already secured strategic partnerships with SWFT Blockchain and 1inch, further enhancing its capabilities. Security is another major concern in the crypto space, and Qubetics is tackling it head-on. By leveraging SWFT Blockchain’s encryption technology, Qubetics ensures that all transactions are executed with the highest level of security. This is a game-changer for businesses handling large amounts of crypto, as it drastically reduces the risk of hacks and exploits. At the same time, Qubetics’ partnership with 1inch enhances decentralized trading by providing access to the best liquidity pools and lowest possible fees across multiple DEXs. Whether you’re a trader, an investor, or a business owner, the Qubetics ecosystem offers unparalleled benefits. Qubetics Wallet and Blockchain Audit A standout feature of the Qubetics ecosystem is its multi-chain wallet. Designed with user convenience in mind, the Qubetics Wallet allows users to manage assets across various blockchains from a single interface. No more juggling multiple wallets or dealing with cumbersome transfers; everything is streamlined for efficiency. To further bolster trust, Qubetics has partnered with CertiK for a thorough audit of its blockchain and wallet infrastructure. CertiK, established in 2018, has a stellar reputation for enhancing the security of blockchain ecosystems. Their rigorous assessment of Qubetics not only identifies potential vulnerabilities but also reinforces the project’s commitment to providing a secure environment for its users. The impact of this audit is already evident. News of CertiK’s involvement has sparked increased interest, leading to a surge in token holders and presale participation. As Qubetics approaches its mainnet launch in Q2 2025, this foundation of security and interoperability positions it as a frontrunner in the crypto space. Qubetics Presale: Your Chance to Lock in Early Gains The crypto presale is taking off, with Stage 23 already in motion and an impressive $14.3 million raised so far. With 21,700+ token holders and a staggering 492 million $TICS tokens sold, demand is soaring. Currently priced at $0.0888, Qubetics follows a strict 7-day presale stage structure, where prices increase by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM. This means those who jump in now are locking in the best possible entry point before $TICS hits the open market. Crypto analysts have high expectations, predicting $TICS will reach $0.25 at the presale’s end, giving holders a 181.52% ROI. After the presale, projections suggest $1 per TICS (1,026.09% return), $5 per TICS (5,530.44% gain), and an eye-watering $15 target (16,791.32% ROI) after mainnet launch. A $1,000 investment today at $0.0888 could balloon into $168,000 at the $15 mark. With such massive potential, Qubetics is quickly emerging as the most lucrative crypto presale of 2025! XRP: A Veteran Crypto with Massive Utility While Qubetics is making headlines with its presale success, XRP remains one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies in the world. Created by Ripple, XRP has positioned itself as the go-to digital asset for cross-border payments. Unlike traditional banking systems that take days to settle international transactions, XRP enables near-instant settlements at a fraction of the cost. This has made it a favorite among financial institutions and payment processors. Despite facing regulatory challenges, XRP continues to prove its resilience. Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC has cast uncertainty over the project, but recent developments suggest a positive outcome may be on the horizon. If Ripple secures a favorable ruling, XRP could see a massive price surge as institutional investors pile in. Additionally, Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with major banks and fintech firms further solidify XRP’s position as a leading crypto asset. With its strong fundamentals and growing adoption, XRP remains a solid choice for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the future of digital payments. Algorand: The Green Blockchain Powering DeFi Algorand is another top contender in the crypto space, particularly for those who value sustainability and efficiency. Unlike energy-intensive blockchains like Bitcoin, Algorand operates on a pure proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which drastically reduces its carbon footprint. This makes it one of the most eco-friendly blockchains available today. But sustainability isn’t its only strength—Algorand is also incredibly fast, processing thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. One of Algorand’s biggest selling points is its ability to support decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Its technology is already being used in various sectors, including finance, gaming, and supply chain management. For instance, Algorand is the backbone of several DeFi projects, enabling users to lend, borrow, and trade assets with ease. As institutional adoption of blockchain technology grows, Algorand is well-positioned to become a key player in the next wave of crypto innovation. Conclusion: The Time to Act is Now With the crypto market gearing up for another major rally, now is the perfect time to position yourself for future gains. Qubetics is leading the charge with its explosive presale, providing investors with a rare opportunity to get in before the price surges. XRP continues to prove its value in the cross-border payment space, and Algorand’s eco-friendly technology is attracting major interest from the DeFi sector. If you’re looking for the top cryptos to join now , these three should be at the top of your list. Don’t wait too long—opportunities like this don’t come around often, and the next big breakout could be just around the corner.

The crypto market is fast-paced, and BlockDAG’s progress is impressively swift. During its fifth AMA in February 2025, the project disclosed several updates that highlight its drive and strategic market entry. With nearly $199.7 million collected through its presale, 18.6 billion BDAG coins distributed, and a 2,380% ROI since its first release, BlockDAG is transitioning from initial excitement to tangible achievements. The AMA revealed that mining hardware is almost complete, a worldwide beta testing initiative is active, and the project’s dedication to decentralization and environmental sustainability is stronger than ever. BlockDAG Sets the Stage with Bitmain for Exclusive Mining Revolution The standout announcement involved BlockDAG’s potential collaboration with Bitmain, a leader in the crypto mining industry, and another top manufacturer. They aim to develop unique mining rigs tailored for the BlockDAG network. These rigs will be exclusive to BlockDAG, unlike typical mining equipment which can be adapted for various blockchains. Why this exclusivity? For enhanced security and decentralization. By limiting the network to specific rigs, BlockDAG aims to counteract the centralization issues that have affected other proof-of-work networks. This strategic decision helps maintain a dispersed and secure mining environment. This concept is already proving its worth. Over 16,000 miners have been sold, bringing in $6.5 million—a clear indicator of the community’s strong engagement and commitment. Global Beta Testing Initiative Launches with 100 Participants While hardware innovation is crucial, it’s the real-world application that truly tests its mettle. Recognizing this, BlockDAG has initiated a beta testing program, handpicking 100 miners globally to put their equipment through rigorous real-life conditions before commencing mass production. The selected testers—mostly seasoned node operators and mining experts—will evaluate: Performance: Do the rigs meet their expected hash rates and efficiency levels? Energy Efficiency: How well do they manage power consumption against profitability? Decentralization: Is the mining activity evenly spread out across various regions? Durability: Are the devices resilient during continuous operation? BlockDAG’s approach of integrating its community in the testing process not only serves to refine their hardware but also strengthens trust and transparency within its user base. This method contrasts sharply with projects that prematurely launch their hardware, often having to retreat and revise when real-world performance doesn’t meet the hype. The takeaway from the AMA is clear: BlockDAG is not just progressing quickly—it’s progressing wisely. Presale Momentum Climbs Beyond $199.7M, Sparking Market Excitement The presale figures alone are turning heads. BlockDAG has successfully gathered almost $199.7 million, steadily advancing towards the ambitious $600 million goal. With 18.6 billion BDAG already sold and the price now at $0.0248—a significant jump from the initial price—the enthusiasm is palpable. What’s driving this surge? A notable factor is the anticipated listings on ten centralized exchanges (CEXs), set to potentially boost liquidity and market visibility. Previous early adopters in Layer 1 projects like Solana and Avalanche have experienced dramatic price surges post-listing, and BlockDAG is positioned to follow a similar path. The Strategic Timing of BDAG Mining Before Mainnet Activation The recent AMA highlighted a crucial insight: now is the prime time to start mining BDAG, with the mainnet slated for release later this year. Early miners stand to gain much higher rewards as they get in before the network’s difficulty increases. The development of the hardware, prioritizing energy efficiency, goes beyond mere profitability—it champions sustainability. This emphasis on environmentally friendly mining practices is increasingly vital in a world where the ecological footprint of blockchain is a growing concern. Miners engaging now are not only bolstering the network but are also securing early advantages that could bring significant long-term benefits. BlockDAG’s distinction lies not just in its ability to raise funds or secure hardware partnerships but in its methodical plan for sustained growth. Instead of pursuing fleeting advantages, BlockDAG’s strategy involves a robust integration of technology, community engagement, and economic benefits. Aligning with first-rate manufacturers like Bitmain demonstrates a dedication to quality and durability. Additionally, the beta testing initiative ensures that, by the time the mainnet is operational, both the miners and the network at large are optimized for the demands of real-world application. This approach, focused on solid execution rather than mere hype, sets BlockDAG apart in a sector where genuine substance is often overshadowed by speculation. Upcoming Milestones: Mainnet Launch and Exchange Debut The recent AMA concluded with key updates on the roadmap: Results from beta testing will be announced soon. Final details on hardware specs are expected to follow. The mainnet is scheduled to go live in 2025. Up to ten centralized exchange listings are anticipated before the end of the year. For those still deciding, the chance to purchase BDAG for under $0.0248 is dwindling quickly. With the upcoming listings, prices are poised to surge, potentially leaving those hesitating to face higher costs in the near future. Wrapping Up: Seize the Moment or Miss Out? BlockDAG’s 5th AMA was more than a routine update—it marked a pivotal declaration of progress. With nearly $199.7 million about to be secured, established hardware collaborations, and active real-world tests, this Layer 1 initiative is moving from theoretical potential to practical implementation. Those choosing to back BlockDAG now are not merely gambling but are trusting a project that stands true to its commitments and is setting itself up for enduring significance in the market. As the mainnet launch and exchange listings approach, the focus will shift from whether BDAG will surpass $1 to just how rapidly and extensively it will grow.

Top Presale Cryptos to Invest in 2025 – Big Opportunities Knock!,https://thecoinrise.com/dive-into-future-crypto-market-leaders-top-presale-cryptos-to-invest-in-2025-big-opportunities-knock/,"As the cryptocurrency sector draws investors seeking high-growth avenues, engaging in presales has proven to be an effective strategy. These stages often present a chance for considerable gains prior to a broader exchange launch. If you are on the lookout for the top presale cryptos to back in 2025, these four initiatives are notable for their innovative applications, market prospects, and appeal to investors. 1. Web3Bay – Revolutionizing E-Commerce with Enhanced Blockchain Security Online sellers face ongoing challenges with chargeback fraud, especially on major platforms like PayPal and Amazon, where transactions can be contested, leading to unjustified refunds. Web3Bay addresses this issue using blockchain technology and smart contract-based escrow to secure and finalize transactions, eliminating disputes. Web3Bay’s use of smart contracts ensures that payments are withheld until buyers confirm the delivery of their purchase. Should a dispute occur, the blockchain’s immutable ledger records provide indisputable evidence of the transaction, curtailing fraudulent claims. Unlike traditional platforms which often side with buyers, Web3Bay ensures impartial resolutions through verifiable data. The project has attracted investor attention, securing $1.5 million in its ongoing Stage 5 presale with over 390 million tokens distributed at $0.00524 each. As conventional e-commerce struggles with fraud, Web3Bay’s blockchain solution stands out among top presale cryptos, promising significant returns for early backers with an anticipated listing price of $0.1959. 2. Dawgz AI – Enhancing Crypto Trading with AI Technology Dawgz AI is set to revolutionize automated trading by blending artificial intelligence with real-time market insights. Users of this platform gain access to AI-powered trading bots that deploy tactics rooted in historical analysis and forward-looking predictions. A standout feature of Dawgz AI is its staking program, which lets investors earn passive income while their tokens appreciate in value. The initiative has successfully raised over $1.5 million during its presale, drawing attention from both retail and institutional investors. As AI-driven trading emerges as a key development in the crypto sector, Dawgz AI provides tools that improve investment decisions. Those interested in sophisticated trading solutions with solid economic foundations might view this presale as a prime choice among top presale cryptos. 3. iDEGEN – Revolutionizing Social Media with Web3 and Token Rewards iDEGEN ushers in a novel approach to social interaction by rewarding users with cryptocurrency for their online activities. This contrasts with conventional social platforms, which profit from user content without offering financial rewards, as iDEGEN compensates users directly for their engagement and contributions. The system employs a token-based rewards mechanism that financially benefits both content creators and community participants with iDEGEN tokens. This move towards a decentralized social media format is attracting users eager to manage their digital earnings. The enthusiasm for iDEGEN’s presale indicates a strong market entry, with its tokens anticipated to launch at a higher value due to robust demand. As Web3 social platforms gain traction, iDEGEN is poised to become a prominent player. 4. Mind of Pepe – A Meme Coin with a Twist of AI Mind of Pepe combines the viral nature of meme coins with innovative artificial intelligence, adding a unique element to a popular trend. Unlike typical meme coins, which rely primarily on community enthusiasm, Mind of Pepe incorporates AI-driven content and interactive elements to maintain interest over time. The initiative has developed an AI chatbot that enhances its ecosystem by providing fun and engagement for its token holders. Those who have benefited from prior meme coin trends see potential in Mind of Pepe for its added AI features. With strong backing in its presale, especially from retail investors keen on dynamic, community-focused projects, Mind of Pepe is carving out a niche. As meme coins continue to captivate the market, this project introduces an innovative variant. Wrapping Up Investing in top presale cryptos for 2025 could yield substantial gains for early participants. Leading the charge, Web3Bay innovates with blockchain solutions for e-commerce, Dawgz AI leverages AI in trading, iDEGEN integrates token rewards in social media, and Mind of Pepe blends meme appeal with AI functionality.

According to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin price at $0.2532 has faced downward pressure as investors offload holdings, anticipating further declines. While Dogecoin has maintained relevance due to its strong community and high-profile endorsements, its lack of significant technological advancements has raised concerns about its long-term viability in a rapidly evolving market.

Market analysts predict the altcoin will shortly approach $5,000. Ethereum price prediction for 2025 is being driven by its increasing acceptance in Latin America, forthcoming Pectra upgrade, and debates on a staking-enabled ETF. Concurrently, the new cross-border payment system, Remittix (RTX), has drawn attention in the market. Investors seem to be mostly drawn to the Remittix early 2025 presale since more individuals find the next outstanding company with enormous potential. Ethereum Price Prediction: Ethereum Set To Reach $5K Ethereum is on its track to reach the $5,000 mark now priced over $2,226 with its increasing practical use. Many are tracking these developments to see whether Ethereum price prediction might cross this significant mark. ETH has found stability for forty million individuals in Latin America, where inflation and financial uncertainties abound. While stablecoins help locals to hedge against depreciation of currencies, DeFi finance businesses such as EthicHub fairly credit small-scale farmers. Additionally growing its infrastructure as use rises is Ethereum. Additionally in development by 21Shares is a spot Ethereum ETF with staking so that ETH owners could be rewarded. Should approval be granted, this ETF may liberate institutional money and raise Ethereum price prediction. In a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure, 21Shares declared their plan to stake parts of the Ether ownership via certified staking providers. The fund management noted that this approach would increase investor returns while maintaining proper Ether performance monitoring. Ethereum price prediction keeps an eye on real-world usage, network improvements, and institutional interest growing because it might hit the $5,000 barrier. How Remittix Is Revolutionizing PayFi While exact numbers are not known, early Remittix (RTX) investors talk about 300% Remittix returns. Still, PayFi possibilities are generating buzz. Unlike some altcoins, RTX aims to solve a big problem: too expensive wiring costs. Analysts believe that strong alliances created by cryptocurrencies could replace coins driven by enthusiasm. Some analysts argue that coins with practical value—like Remittix (RTX)—have a more consistent increase than meme-based or totally tech-driven tokens. Should remittances from abroad remain a primary source, RTX might keep a constant user base instead of riding the rollercoaster of brief excitement cycles. Though no currency is expected to soar overnight, PayFi tokens can pass more speculative competitors with a mix of pragmatic application and strong advocates. Both crypto-exclusive systems like Coinbase Wallet and Remittix ensure accessibility and inclusiveness for companies and consumers; Remittix is the better option to conventional payment providers like Stripe and Wise. Notable also is the platform's open flat-fee strategy, which provides savings and openness over absurd rates of exchange of traditional banks. Why Now is the Best Time to Buy $RTX Remittix is groundbreaking in the payments sector since it ensures that the entire amount paid reaches the recipient, therefore tackling unethical behavior all too often. The RTX coin offers high investment worth with a pre-sale of $0.0694. Forecasts show a fascinating boom; demand for creative cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25x multiplier in the presale phase and over 1,500% growth following launch.

One new project, Remittix, has become somewhat well-known with its innovative approach to cross-border payments while ADA and SHIB fight against bearish trends and declining on-chain statistics. Looking at the most recent advancements in Cardano, Shiba Inu, and Remittix will help us to understand why both significant institutional and worldwide retail investors are experiencing increasing FOMO anxiety. Cardano: On the Edge of Further Declines ADA/USDT daily chart Cardano (ADA) has extended its weekly decline by 7%, having already tumbled 23% in recent sessions. This drop aligns with Santiment data revealing a downturn in daily active addresses, a sign of waning network demand. Bearish momentum surfaced when ADA broke below a key support level at $0.74, continuing its descent. Technical analysts anticipate a potential 16% plunge toward the February low of $0.50 if downward pressure persists. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index stands at an oversold 28, signaling caution as the token’s correction deepens. Starting early February, Santiment's Daily Active Addresses statistic dropped from 49, 585 to 24,609, implying declining on-chain activity. This lack of user involvement aggravates ADA's pricing problems and can open the path for continuous selling pressure and more losses. Shiba Inu: Bracing for a Potential Crash Under increasing selling pressure, Shiba Inus (SHIB) are under closer examination. Two important support zones at $0.000012 and $0.00000094 where buyers could intervene to stop or reverse the fall are highlighted by certain analysts. More general market downturn, meanwhile, adds to the ambiguity. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that 58% of SHIB holders are underwater, increasing the likelihood of capitulation if losses worsen. Additionally, 74% of SHIB tokens are held by large investors, heightening volatility and the risk of significant price swings. Given the declining correlation between SHIB and Bitcoin, it might not gain from any more general market recovery. A little decline in Telegram membership suggests even more disappearing community involvement. Shiba Inu owners should be alert for now since there is no assurance of a quick return. Remittix: A Rising Star in DeFi While Cardano and Shiba Inu struggle, Remittix continues to flourish, positioning itself as one of the DeFi market’s most promising newcomers. Its ongoing presale has already notched record-breaking figures, selling over 510 million tokens and raising more than $13.2 million. Early participants have enjoyed gains exceeding 1000%, despite adverse crypto conditions. Remittix's popularity stems mostly from its cross-border payment system, which lets customers turn over more than 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and transmit them all around free from hidden costs. Often finishing transfers far faster than conventional banking systems, this solution uses local payment networks and blockchain technology to simplify transactions. The Remittix Pay API, which lets companies accept crypto payments and settle them in fiat, is another great advantage. The open ledger of the platform lets everyone see every transaction, therefore lowering fraud possibilities. With major gains already on the board, analysts predict that Remittix could see further 200% increase in the coming month. What Lies Ahead Amid volatility in the crypto space, communities behind major tokens like Cardano and Shiba Inu are on the lookout for new gems. Remittix’s swift rise and practical use cases have sparked optimism that it could mirror XRP’s meteoric success. As the DeFi sector evolves, projects offering real-world applications are poised to thrive. Remittix’s surge during a bearish period suggests that its momentum may continue, fueled by a strong community, practical payment solutions, and an unwavering commitment to transparent financial transactions. If it manages to maintain this trajectory, the stage is set for Remittix to become a standout performer well into 2025 and beyond.

These coins are gaining attention and could soon experience significant growth. Key insights and factors driving this potential surge are explored, offering valuable information for those looking to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the cryptocurrency world. Aptos Price Dynamics: Key Levels and Recent Trends Over the past month, Aptos faced a decline of about 14%, while the six-month change shows a modest gain near 4%. A 7% rally in the past week, combined with these longer trends, highlights the volatility in the market. The balance between short-term drops and longer gains suggests an adjustment period, with traders reacting to broader cryptocurrency movements. Currently, Aptos trades between approximately $4.77 and $8.01, with immediate resistance at $9.55 and key support around $3.07. The signals are mixed, indicating slight upward momentum, while oscillators do not show strong extremes. This reflects a balance between bulls and bears. Traders may consider range-bound strategies, watching for breakouts above resistance or pullbacks to support. Sui Moves: 6-Month Rally vs Recent Decline, Key Levels to Watch The coin lost about 13% in one week and dropped nearly 23.5% in one month while registering a strong 271.65% gain over the past six months. Price swings reflect a volatile journey with substantial long-term gains contrasted by short-term pressure. Recent performance underlines the struggle traders face as the strong rally shifts to a more concerning trend. Current trading sees prices bouncing between $2.12 and $3.84 with nearby support at $1.40 and resistance at $4.84. Negative signals on momentum and moving averages indicate a bearish slant without a clear trend. Trading ideas include looking for bounces off support while approaching resistance cautiously for potential profit-taking. Conclusion APT and SUI show promising signs of gaining bullish momentum. Analysts observe that both coins have strong development teams and innovative technology. The market trends appear favorable for their potential growth. Keeping an eye on these coins might be beneficial for those interested in emerging cryptocurrencies. As APT and SUI continue to evolve, they could attract more attention from investors. Conclusively, these assets have the ingredients needed to make significant gains in the near future. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Ethereum has been one of the hardest-hit assets, experiencing a massive decline of over 27% in less than five days. Investors are growing cautious as ETH struggles to hold key support levels, fueling uncertainty about its short-term direction. Related Reading: Is Solana In A Macro Trend Move? Charts Show Potential Shift Despite the widespread panic, large investors appear to be taking advantage of the dip. Data from Santiment reveals that whales have accumulated significant amounts of ETH in the last 24 hours, suggesting that institutional players and high-net-worth individuals are positioning for a potential recovery. Historically, such accumulation phases by big players have preceded strong reversals, indicating that smart money might be betting on an eventual rebound. While selling pressure remains high, this whale activity could provide a foundation for ETH to stabilize and regain lost ground. However, for a bullish recovery to take shape, Ethereum needs to reclaim crucial levels above $2,500. The next few days will be critical in determining whether ETH can bounce back or if the market will continue to slide further down. Ethereum Accumulation Signals Trust Ethereum is trading slightly above the most critical support level since December 2023, a price zone that could determine its short-term direction. Bulls must hold this level to prevent further declines and initiate a recovery phase, but selling pressure remains strong. Analysts are divided, with some expecting a prolonged bear market while others see potential for a rebound. Crypto expert Ali Martinez shared Santiment data on X, revealing that whales bought another 190,000 ETH in the last 24 hours. This adds to the broader trend of accumulation that has been ongoing for the past month. Historically, such whale activity signals confidence from large investors, who often accumulate at discounted prices before an uptrend resumes. If this trend continues, Ethereum could be setting up for a strong recovery rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Declines 67% In Three Months – Can Meme Coins Recover? However, bullish momentum remains uncertain. ETH needs to reclaim key levels above $2,500 to confirm a reversal, and failing to do so could lead to further corrections. The market is currently driven by fear and uncertainty, but the continuous whale accumulation suggests that smart money is positioning for future gains. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum can bounce back or if the bearish trend will persist. ETH Testing Crucial Long-Term Demand Ethereum is trading at $2,220 after reaching its lowest level since late November 2023. The recent sell-off has pushed ETH below critical support zones, and bulls are struggling to regain control. The price is now below the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) at around $2,290 and the 200-week moving average (MA) at around $2,480, signaling a bearish outlook unless a strong recovery takes place soon. For Ethereum to regain momentum, bulls must reclaim the $2,500 level in the coming days. A breakout above this level would signal renewed strength, potentially leading to a massive recovery rally as traders regain confidence. However, ETH remains under pressure, and failing to reclaim the $2,300 mark could confirm further declines. If this scenario unfolds, Ethereum could face a deeper correction toward the $2,000 psychological support, or even lower, depending on market sentiment. Related Reading: Ethereum Retraces To Critical Monthly Demand Level – Can ETH Hold Selling Pressure? With the market still dominated by fear and uncertainty, traders are watching key technical levels closely. If ETH can stabilize above $2,200 and push higher, a relief rally could be on the horizon. Otherwise, Ethereum could remain trapped in a prolonged downtrend, testing investor patience and market resilience. The next few days will be critical for ETH’s price action.

For them, Solana and XRP do not promise the level of growth this new PayFi sensation promises. Hence, the latter is what their money is on to deliver the goodies to early adopters in 2025. This article examines the motivations behind their perspective, considering the Solana priceprediction, XRP's latest news, and Remittix's robust market fundamentals. Solana Price Might Replicate 2022 Bear Market Since the last time in 2024, Solana has once again seen its value fall below $135 briefly before rebounding above $140 . The sharp drop follows the crypto asset's failure to hit a new all-time high. Rather, the SOL crypto plunged by 43% in February. Considering historical patterns, the Solana price performance demonstrates that a severe downtrend could be imminent. According to the experts, the altcoin’s technical indicators display similarities to what preceded the 2022 bear market run. In that cycle, the Solana price crossed $260 in November 2021 and plummeted below $10. This run also witnessed the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossing over the 12 EMA, which confirmed the lengthy bearish cycle. Should history repeat itself, continuous crossover and negative MACD readings might stifle the SOL price potential. XRP Price Analysis XRP price performance has taken over the latest crypto news after the crypto lost the bullish momentum it exhibited in the fourth quarter. The Ripple crypto is now facing a deeper risk of continuous meltdown . The constant drop is primarily attributed to macroeconomic tension in the United States as President Trump set new hefty tariffs . As a result, there's been stagflation, and the Federal Reserve was compelled to cut interest rates before the supposed time. Still, technical indicators show that the chances of a solid bearish breakout in the coming days remain high despite the XRP coin trading within a danger zone. Meanwhile, the token could still crash below the $2.00 level if the performance turns bearish . Considering this reality, the altcoin might slump further towards $1.6230, where it may witness a rebound. Remittix (RTX): Next Crypto Heavyweight While Solana and Ripple's price performances are heavily influenced by their robust brand appeal and market share, Remittix is rapidly stealing the spotlight thanks to its game-changing PayFi platform, which combines cryptocurrencies with day-to-day finance. Remittix enables users to convert crypto into FIAT currencies and deposit funds directly to any bank account globally. This project solves the biggest drawbacks of a multi-trillion-dollar PayFi market, a sector burdened by overhead costs, exclusion of the unbanked, and lengthy transfer processing. Now, users can convert over 40+ crypto pairs into 30+ fiat currencies and make cross-border payments effortlessly. Thanks to this real-world utility, Remittix distinguishes itself from speculative tokens currently facing bearish market momentum and turbulence. Thanks to its tangible benefits and banking offer to millions of unbanked individuals, Remittix is well-positioned for massive real-world adoption. This potential is evident in its presale as the massive appeal confirms the project’s growth potential. The presale has amassed over $13.2 million in presale funding as investors’ confidence remains high. Moreover, as early $RTX adopters, you will already have enjoyed over 362% value growth following the token’s price increase in the presale to $0.0694 from its starting price of $0.015. Indeed, there's no investment without risk. Still, market insiders are super confident that Remittix is poised to be the next crypto heavyweight, potentially outperforming Rippleand Solana in terms of ROI. By combining utility and potential for a meteoric rise, the RTX token is where profit-driven investors put their money in 2025.

While XRP grabs headlines with its legal breakthroughs and fresh partnerships, Dogecoin finds itself in a slump after its earlier success. In the meantime, Remittix is turning heads by focusing on actual, real-life uses for crypto payments. Many investors see this as a positive sign, given that meme tokens, AI coins, and Real World Asset (RWA) cryptos have lost billions of dollars since January. XRP Latest News: Big Shifts in the Legal Arena In a legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP has been at the centre. Now, rumors say the SEC might ease up on its appeal against Ripple , which could reshape how digital assets are handled by regulators. John Reed Stark has observed that the SEC is no longer pushing as hard to label tokens as securities, hinting at a possible new plan for regulating crypto. Meanwhile, Ripple has teamed with BDACS in South Korea to offer safe, institutional-level custody for XRP and RLUSD. Through Ripple Custody’s bank-like services, BDACS hopes to welcome more large-scale investors to the table. At the same time, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is getting an upgrade, adding programmability that won’t slow down the network. According to Jack Claver , this could let developers make customized solutions for large companies, boosting XRP’s standing among global businesses. Over the last day, XRP rose to $2.14, with trading volume at $8.53 billion . Dogecoin Price Prediction: Tough Times for Meme Coins Dogecoin, one of the original meme coins, isn’t looking so stable these days. The SEC recently said that meme tokens like Dogecoin aren’t securities . Still, Dogecoin slid by 12.4% last Friday , falling below $0.19 for the first time since November 2024. Some data shows small retail holders may be panic-selling, causing prices to drop even more. A “death cross” has now formed on Dogecoin’s daily chart, where the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. This is often seen as a sign of more downside. Some link this fall to the negative mood in the market and political news tied to former President Trump. Source: tradingview If DOGE wants to recover, it must get back above $0.20 , but many think the real test is around $0.29. If Dogecoin can’t hold $0.20, it may head down to $0.15, and even a high trading volume may not be enough to revive it unless there’s a strong reason for investors to jump back in. Remittix Steals the Spotlight: An ICO Raising $13.2M in Weeks As XRP adapts to possible changes from the SEC and Dogecoin fights to recover, Remittix has popped up as the real success story. Many people call it the next big thing in the payment sector. Rather than banking on internet buzz, Remittix takes a “PayFi-first” path, solving real problems in day-to-day money use. As meme coins, AI cryptos, and RWA tokens bleed out billions in total value, Remittix has attracted those who want more than hype. The numbers are clear: $13.2 million raised in only a few weeks proves there’s a big demand for coins that truly handle payment challenges. Remittix’s system allows smooth crypto-to-fiat conversions and is built for easy merchant adoption. It also emphasizes following rules and regulations, giving big investors more peace of mind. This is something many meme or AI coins never really managed to do. Why Remittix Could Be the Top Crypto Pick As the market gets weary of meme coins and projects stuck in legal chaos, payment-focused tokens like Remittix are on the rise. XRP might do well if it clears its legal issues, and Dogecoinstill has fans despite its recent price troubles. Yet the swift growth and practical use cases of Remittix show that investors crave real-world value. Raising $13.2 million so quickly shows there is strong interest in bridging crypto with everyday finance.

Many believe that the best crypto to buy now should have the potential to change the way we handle money. Reports show that Solana, Pi Network, Remittix, PEPE, and AVAX are some of the tokens picked to be the best options in 2025. Investors see these tokens as promising picks with potential for strong gains. Remittix, in particular, stands out with a real-world solution that cuts through many financial hurdles. Solana: The Prospects of One of The Fastest Networks In Crypto Recent Solana news shows that the network continues to work hard towards improvement. Many users enjoy the speed of Solana when they send crypto or use dApps. This is one of the reasons why SOL is reportedly one of the first altcoins to show signs of recovery following the recent market downturn. SOL is up 12% from the last 24 hours and is primed for more in the coming days. Despite the strong start, Solana’s recovery is expected to unfold gradually with a surge by 2.10% to $147.39 by March 6. Investors watch the Solana price as a sign of strong technology and growing adoption. Solana remains a solid choice for those who want a token with a clear function and steady improvements. Pi Network: The New Altcoin On The Block Pi Network appears to be immune to the recent market downturn. It was reported to have surged nearly 80% within 24 hours and has reached a new all-time high of $2.99. This surge coincides with a huge increase in 24-hour trading volume, which has now surpassed $3.2 billion. Pi network is a project that brings crypto to everyday life. It aims to give people a chance to join a digital network with low barriers. Investors see Pi Network as a potential growth story and keep an eye on its progress. If Pi Network continues in its current trajectory, it could rise by 231.79% and reach $ 7.68 by March 31. PEPE: The Potential For Recovery PEPE has become well known in the market for its wild early gains. Over time, its value has seen dramatic ups and downs. Recently, it has been noted as one of the major drivers behind the market recovery following the market-wide downturn. While PEPE has faced its fair share of setbacks, it still holds a spot in many portfolios. It currently trades at $0.000007867, which is up over 7% from 24 hours ago. Pepe price predictions are quite optimistic with expectations that it could rise by 228.25% and reach $0.00002607 by March 31. AVAX: Prospects For Recovery AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, is known for supporting a range of decentralized apps and finance tools. AVAX offers fast and secure transactions with a design that supports a growing number of dApps. Investors watch AVAX price trends closely, as the token has shown strong growth over time. AVAX plays an important role in a broad ecosystem and remains a favorite for those who want steady, long-term gains. Its use in various finance projects gives AVAX a solid base, and many see it as an attractive option in a diverse portfolio. AVAX's recovery is said to unfold gradually. Avalanche is predicted to rise by 6.94% and reach $ 23.96 by March 31. Remittix: The Revolutionary Payment Solution Remittix is a new DeFi project that tackles a big problem in global finance. Many people around the world do not have access to a bank. They often use services like Western Union to get cash. Remittix fixes this by making crypto-to-FIAT transfers simple and fast. The system, called PayFi, cuts out extra steps and removes the risk of reversal. This means funds go where they need to be without delay or extra cost. Remittix gives users full control over their assets while keeping their identity private. It ties modern crypto into traditional finance so that people keep their anonymity and asset control. The project has already sold over 510 million tokens in its ICO. This strong start has drawn attention from both retail and institutional investors. Its current DeFi coin price sits at around $0.0694, a low entry point that many see as a good chance to invest. Remittix is not only about moving money quickly; it also makes cross-border payments easier by cutting out extra fees and delays common in the traditional system. With these benefits, Remittixhas the potential to boost crypto adoption as a payment method and may even drive widespread change in global finance.

41029892,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/here-are-3-cryptos-cheaper-to-buy-than-dogecoin-doge-that-will-hit-1-first,1740876837,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/41029892.jpeg,Here Are 3 Cryptos Cheaper To Buy Than Dogecoin (DOGE) That Will Hit $1 First,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/here-are-3-cryptos-cheaper-to-buy-than-dogecoin-doge-that-will-hit-1-first,"With its price declining 12.4% on Friday, below $0.19, Dogecoin (DOGE) has suffered losses, lowest since November 2024. While DOGE struggles, three undervalued cryptocurrencies—Kaspa (KAS), Brett (BRETT), and Remittix (RTX)—are cheaper than DOGE and poised to hit $1 first, offering strong potential for growth amidst Dogecoin’s challenges. Let’s explore why these tokens could outperform DOGE. Kaspa (KAS) – Speed Meets Scalability At $0.07944 , Kaspa (KAS) is attracting interest for addressing one of blockchain's main problems: scalability. Kaspa handles thousands of transactions per second using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, providing great speed free from the bottlenecks encountered in conventional blockchains. With a $2.2 billion market capitalization, currently ranked 54th on CoinGecko, it is notable for cheap transaction costs and effective network. Kaspa's capacity to manage massive transaction volumes with almost instantaneous finality sets it to satisfy the growing need for scalable blockchain solutions. With the market poised for a possible bull run, Kaspa might explode and be a fierce competitor to reach $1 before Dogecoin, especially as businesses progressively embrace blockchain technology and analysts are positive about its future. Brett (BRETT) – Meme Coin with Staying Power Brett (BRETT) is a meme coin that’s gaining traction due to its vibrant community and growing interest in meme coins. Priced at $0.03858, it’s cheaper than Dogecoin and has seen impressive market activity with over $34 million in daily trading volume. Despite a recent 23.8% drop, Brett’s strong social media presence and loyal community help it weather market turbulence. Unlike other meme coins that fade, Brett’s ability to sustain momentum suggests long-term growth potential. If it can overcome the current downturn, Brett could hit $1 faster than expected, making it an attractive option for investors seeking value in the meme coin market. Why Dogecoin is Falling Behind Dogecoin’s recent price decline to below $0.19 is a stark reminder of the volatility that meme coins can face. Despite initial success driven by Elon Musk's high-profile support and a post-election surge, Dogecoin's price has now suffered a 46% drop in February alone. Factors such as the controversial government role taken by Musk and President Trump's recent tariff policies on Mexico and Canada have added downward pressure. The ongoing retail panic selling, as evidenced by the surge in active Dogecoin addresses, indicates a lack of confidence among smaller traders. Furthermore, the ""death cross"" technical pattern on DOGE’s charts and its low RSI (Relative Strength Index) signal that the downward momentum may continue, leading analysts to predict further losses for Dogecoin. With Dogecoin’s price struggling to reclaim key support levels, it may take longer for it to hit the $1 mark than other cryptocurrencies like Kaspa, Brett, or Remittix. Remittix (RTX) – A Game-Changer in Global Payments While Dogecoin struggles, Remittix (RTX) is gaining attention for its potential to revolutionize the remittance sector. This altcoin offers a fast, cost-effective solution for cross-border payments, having raised $13.2 million in presale funding. With 510 million RTX tokens sold, Remittix is currently valued at $0.0694 per token. Positioned below its future value, Remittix addresses the global remittance market, worth trillions, by providing cheap and quick payments. With traditional services charging high fees, Remittix fills a critical gap, offering scalability and efficiency. As more underbanked regions adopt its solution, the demand for Remittix tokens will likely increase, potentially pushing it to $1 faster than even Dogecoin. The Race to $1 While Dogecoin remains a popular meme coin with a passionate community, it is facing significant hurdles in its path to $1. In contrast, Kaspa, Brett, and Remittix represent undervalued cryptocurrencies with solid use cases, strong communities, and growing interest from investors. Whether you’re looking for speed and scalability with Kaspa, meme coin potential with Brett, or the game-changing financial solutions of Remittix, these three tokens are cheaper to buy than Dogecoin and may very well hit $1 first. For investors looking to position themselves in the next big crypto trend, it’s time to take a closer look at these three contenders before Dogecoin’s downward slide extends further.

The trading value of PEPE coin settled at $0.0000085 on February 27, 2025 while the industry experienced general market instability. Experts speculate what PEPE's potential price drop could yield as Bitcoin price approaches $65,000 after sinking to $85,000. Despite these bearish forecasts, a new Defi project with its $13 million presale and 4x surge is offering a smarter play. Pepe’s Recent Struggles and Market Sentiment The frog-themed PEPE token has endured a rough patch lately. It’s down over 10% in the past week , slipping to $0.0000084 after a high of $0.0000147 in December. A massive 175 billion PEPE token dump by an institutional player has added pressure, per on-chain data. Trading volume spiked to $871 million recently, signaling heightened activity. Yet, this surge hasn’t stemmed the tide of losses. The PEPE market cap hovers around $3.55 billion, ranking it 37th among top meme coins. Analysts note a bearish pattern forming on PEPE’s chart. If support at $0.000007 cracks, a steeper decline looms. Investors eye Bitcoin’s next move closely. A drop in the leading crypto could drag PEPE down further, as BTC’s trajectory often dictates the fate of smaller tokens. Bitcoin’s Slide Toward $65,000 Bitcoin, the market bellwether, stands at $85,201 as of February 26, 2025. It’s shed nearly 8% in a week, per recent reports, hitting a three-week low. Global jitters and a $1.5 billion Bybithack fueled this retreat. If Bitcoin falls to $65,000, a 23% drop from its current level, altcoins could suffer. Historically, meme coins like PEPE amplify such moves. A 30-40% decline wouldn’t be surprising, pushing PEPE toward $0.000006-$0.000007, based on past correlations. Market watchers point to upcoming U.S. tariffs as a risk factor. These could further sour sentiment, driving Bitcoin lower. For PEPE holders, this spells a potential storm.. The $80.3 billion meme coin sector shows resilience but cracks are evident. PEPE’s path remains tied to Bitcoin’s fortunes. Remittix , however, carves its own lane. Its practical approach could outlast fleeting meme coin trends. Remittix: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments While Bitcoin and PEPE suffer constraints, Remittix is quietly emerging as a contender. Priced below $0.0671, this altcoin tackles the $700 billion remittance market with flair. Its top Defi project enables instant crypto-to-fiat swaps, slashing costs and delays. Remittix offers real-world value that’s hard to ignore, the project’s presale has raked in $13 million, signaling robust investor trust. Analysts project a 100x surge after launch, fueled by its practical focus. Unlike many speculative coins, Remittix’s utility in streamlining global payments makes it a sleeper hit. Security is a cornerstone for Remittix. Its institutional-grade protections inspire confidence in a hack-prone industry. With a capped supply, demand could skyrocket. This stability draws eyes as Bitcoin and PEPE falter under market strain. Remittix’s appeal lies in its problem-solving prowess. By simplifying remittances, it bridges crypto and everyday needs seamlessly. A capped supply and top-tier security add to its allure. While Bitcoin and PEPE face volatility, Remittix charts a steadier ascent. If Bitcoin hits $65,000, PEPE’s drop could be stark. A 35% decline from $0.00001026 lands it near $0.0000067. Past downturns suggest even steeper falls are possible. The meme coin’s fate hinges on Bitcoin’s next steps. Investors eyeing alternatives might favor Remittix’s consistency. With a clear vision and tangible benefits, Remittix could outpace many peers in 2025.

However, a new trend is quietly emerging. The Shiba Inu and Dogecoin whales are now rotating their profits into a low cap crypto that’s making waves: RCO Finance (RCOF) . As Dogecoin aims for stability and Shiba Inu battles criticism over its utility, RCO Finance is capturing attention for its innovative DeFi platform and explosive growth potential. Whale Activity: Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Investors Position for the Next Move As Dogecoin’s price struggles to stabilize after a 6% drop, large investors, commonly called whales, are making moves that could signal the next phase of price action. Historically, Dogecoin whales have played a crucial role in price swings, often accumulating at key support levels before triggering major rallies. On-chain data suggests a slowdown in network activity, with new DOGE addresses dropping from 1.29 million in November to just over 30,000. However, some analysts see this as a potential accumulation phase, setting the stage for a bullish reversal. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu whales are taking a different approach. On-chain data shows a surge in large SHIB transactions, with over 101 transfers exceeding $100,000 in the past 24 hours, more than doubling from just a week ago. This increased activity aligns with predictions of a 450% price surge by 2025, as analysts highlight key support levels and ongoing token burns reducing SHIB’s circulating supply. The renewed whale interest suggests that while Dogecoin struggles with short-term volatility, Shiba Inu attracts more institutional-sized bets, potentially positioning itself as the stronger contender among meme coins in the months ahead. RCO Finance: The Low Cap Crypto Aiming to Surpass Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Identified as the next big thing by Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales, RCO Finance (RCOF) is carving out its path as a game-changing low cap altcoin that offers more than just speculative opportunities. Unlike other low cap cryptos, RCOF leverages AI to revolutionize decentralized finance, providing investors with a sophisticated, data-driven approach to navigating the volatile crypto landscape. At the heart of RCO Finance is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, a unique system designed to customize investment strategies based on live market insights, personal risk preferences, and long-term financial goals. Unlike traditional algorithmic trading models, this technology processes massive datasets from reputable sources like Reuters, eliminating emotional decision-making that often leads to poor trading outcomes. Continuously analyzing market conditions, the Robo Advisor identifies lucrative opportunities, similar to the rapid rise of Pi (PI) before its recent surge by over 150%, ensuring investors can capitalize on high-momentum assets. One of RCO Finance’s standout features is its dynamic risk management framework. During market turbulence, the Robo Advisor swiftly adjusts portfolios, reallocating assets into more promising opportunities to shield investors from potential losses. But it doesn’t stop at risk mitigation; it proactively scans the crypto ecosystem for high-growth projects, executing trades autonomously through RCOF’s automated market-making system. This ensures optimal transactions with maximum profitability, positioning RCO Finance as a next-generation DeFi platform. What truly sets RCOF apart is its vision of bridging the gap between decentralized and traditional finance. The platform grants users access to an extensive suite of over 120,000 financial instruments, spanning cryptos, stocks, bonds, and tokenized real-world assets such as real estate and commodities. Unlike many DeFi projects that require intrusive verification processes, RCOF offers a KYC-free ecosystem, allowing investors to maintain anonymity while engaging with the platform. To reinforce trust, SolidProof rigorously audits its smart contracts, ensuring robust protection for users and their assets. The momentum behind RCO Finance is already building, with its beta platform attracting over 10,000 active users. As anticipation grows for its alpha launch and upcoming feature expansions, early investors are positioning themselves to capitalize on the platform’s advanced market-monitoring capabilities. The RCO Finance (RCOF) Targets $6 Post Token Presale RCO Finance’s presale has reached its fifth stage, with RCOF tokens currently priced at $0.10. This stage presents a strategic opportunity for investors to acquire tokens before the price jumps to $0.13 in the next round. To encourage early participation, buyers who use the WELCOME40 code will receive an exclusive 40% bonus, significantly increasing their holdings before RCOF enters the open market. Market analysts project that once RCOF officially launches, its price could surge to $0.60, translating to an impressive 600% return on investment for early adopters. Even more bullish predictions suggest that by mid-2025, RCOF could experience a staggering $6 price appreciation, making it one of the most explosive opportunities in the low cap crypto market. Beyond its financial upside, RCOF holders can access numerous benefits, including reduced transaction fees, governance voting rights, and eligibility for quarterly dividends. Investors who stake their tokens can earn APYs of up to 86%, creating a sustainable source of passive income. With increasing support from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu whales, RCO Finance is emerging as a rare, high-potential investment opportunity.

Although Bitcoin and Ethereum still lead, emerging projects are transforming sectors with significant prospects. Here are the best cryptos to invest in long-term, featuring Web3Bay prominently. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY): Dominating E-Commerce Domain As online selling costs climb with platforms like eBay and Amazon upping fees, sellers lose much of their profit to listing fees, final value fees, and payment processing charges. Web3Bay uses blockchain to facilitate direct seller-to-buyer interactions without middlemen. UWeb3Bay, in contrast to conventional platforms that can charge up to 15% per transaction plus extra for processing, cuts out these charges. Its use of smart contracts helps secure transactions, lessening chargeback and dispute risks. This model appeals to sellers looking for more economical ways to operate. The market has shown enthusiasm. In its Stage 5 presale, Web3Bay has garnered $1.5 million, selling over 390 million 3BAY tokens at $0.00524 each. Early adopters believe in the platform’s capability to disrupt centralized markets and enhance sellers’ control over their profits. With rising adoption, Web3Bay is marked as one of the best cryptos to invest in long-term. 2. Binance Coin (BNB) BNB stands out as a solid investment choice tied closely to the functionality of the Binance ecosystem, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange by volume. This token is essential for reduced trading fees, payments, and various DeFi applications on Binance. The Binance network is ever-expanding, incorporating BNB in decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and blockchain gaming. Binance’s strategy of periodic token burns also contributes to a potentially reduced supply and an increase in value over time. Due to Binance’s significant role in the cryptocurrency arena, BNB is marked as one of the best cryptos to invest in long-term. 3. Cardano (ADA) Cardano stands out through its research-oriented approach to blockchain technology, prioritizing scalability, security, and decentralization. Cardano is distinctive for its development process, which is rigorously peer-reviewed, aiming for high stability and dependability. The platform is increasingly utilized for smart contracts, DeFi initiatives, and corporate collaborations. With continuous improvements, such as the Hydra scaling solution, Cardano is geared to handle large-scale transactions efficiently and cost-effectively. For investors focused on sustained growth, ADA is considered a strong candidate for long-term investment. 4. Solana (SOL) Known for its exceptionally fast and cost-efficient transaction capabilities, Solana supports thousands of transactions per second, making it attractive for developers of decentralized apps, DeFi, and NFT marketplaces. Despite previous issues with network congestion, ongoing enhancements to improve Solana’s infrastructure are underway, boosting its reliability and scalability. With growing institutional support and expanded applications, Solana is increasingly seen as a top choice for long-term investment. Leading Cryptos for Sustained Investment For those exploring the best cryptos to invest in long-term, Web3Bay emerges as a standout with its practical use in e-commerce. It addresses core seller issues by cutting out excessive fees, offering a strong alternative to traditional online market platforms. BNB, Cardano, and Solana also show great promise, supported by robust ecosystems and increasing adoption. Investors are encouraged to thoroughly research and assess the long-term viability of these options before investing. The post Considering Best Cryptos to Invest in Long-Term?

Both have felt recent market pressures Cardano struggles to regain critical resistance while XRP remains on edge, awaiting potential SEC developments. As these popular assets face uncertainty, some of their holders are turning to a new altcoin that promises to shake up the industry this year. Crypto enthusiasts are calling this token a direct challenger to big names, thanks to its growing utility and swift adoption. While ADA and XRP may still bounce back, investors who crave fresh opportunities are shifting attention elsewhere. Get on board before Remittix’s presale ends! Cardano: Searching for Bullish Momentum Cardano’s price has fought a losing battle against downward pressure, trading in a descending wedge and hovering near critical support around $0.60. A recent report highlights how ADA’s daily chart remains bearish with multiple failed attempts at breaking above $0.72 - $0.75. Unless ADA reclaims these levels, the token risks further drops if sellers push below $0.60. On shorter time frames, the 4-hour chart shows lower highs and lower lows, confirming a persistent sell trend. Cardano’s major moving averages also loom overhead, reinforcing a negative outlook until the coin secures a firmer grip above $0.75 - $0.80. Even the RSI, drifting into oversold territory, has only sparked minimal bounces. Unless Cardano can reverse this pattern, some ADA holders might look for alternatives that offer a better risk-to-reward ratio. ADA/USDT Source: Coinmarketcap XRP in the Spotlight as SEC Mulls Its Next Move XRP’s community is buzzing ahead of a closed-door SEC meeting scheduled for February 27. Rumors swirl that the agency could drop its appeal related to Ripple’s legal battle, potentially giving XRP a clear runway to reclaim higher prices above $2.1970. Yet the coin remains sensitive to external factors, including shifts in U.S. economic policy and broader market sentiment. Recent dips in the crypto market fueled by concerns over interest rates and tariffs knocked XRP down over 5% in just one session. While many expect a rally if the SEC changes course, there’s no guarantee. If legal uncertainty lingers, XRP might stay capped below its all-time high of $3.5505. Eager for steadier prospects, some holders have begun exploring a new altcoin that boasts immediate real-world use. XRP/USDT Source: Coinmarketcap Remittix: A Rising Star in the World of Payments While Cardano and XRP wrestle with market headwinds, an emerging token named Remittix has gained traction among investors. Priced at $0.0694, it has raised nearly $13 million in its presale, with over half a billion tokens sold so far. Unlike many speculative projects, Remittix tackles a straightforward issue: making crypto payments easy, quick, and cheap. Picture a consulting firm in Eastern Europe with clients in North America. Handling multiple currencies often involves slow bank transfers and unwieldy fees. With Remittix, clients can pay in various cryptos, and the firm instantly converts that crypto into local money. This system slashes transaction costs and eliminates currency guesswork, letting the business focus on its core services. Moreover, Remittix’s traction isn’t limited to small businesses. Enterprises dealing with cross-border supply chains can integrate the PayFi solution to settle invoices faster. Travel agencies, e-commerce sites, and digital marketplaces can reduce overhead linked to international payments, benefiting both customers and providers. Could This New Altcoin Truly Rival the Giants? Though calling any token a rival to top-tier cryptos might seem bold, Remittix’s rise has caught the eye of Cardano and XRP holders who feel stuck in the current slump. If it continues expanding partnerships and demonstrating the value of PayFi, the project could carve out a sizable niche. Still, no coin is immune to the crypto market’s ups and downs, so delivering on promises will be essential for lasting success. ADA hopes to break out of its bearish channel, while XRP awaits possible relief if the SEC abandons its appeal. Yet as they wrestle with uncertainties, Remittix provides a compelling alternative one built on everyday usefulness rather than speculation. If it can maintain its momentum, this altcoin might indeed push its way into the top ranks before the year is out. Remittix could be the next XRP!

Attention centers on Near Protocol , Render , and Sei , with investors keen to see how these coins will perform. This piece uncovers if these digital assets are poised for significant growth in the coming months. Discover insights into potential market leaders this season. NEAR Protocol: Recent Trends and Key Price Boundaries Price movements over the last month and six months show a steady pullback with a sharp decline of nearly 30% over the past month and about a 20% drop in the half-year view. Volatility is evident, with trading occurring between $2.31 and $4.25, indicating a market that has struggled to find a steady upward move even as weekly changes hovered near -6.58%. Price stagnation and significant declines highlight ongoing uncertainty over the medium term. Current price action sees resistance at $5.44 and strong support around $1.55. The market appears to be under selling pressure without a clear upward trend, as technical indicators remain weak. Traders might consider short-term moves between these levels, watching for a potential bounce near $1.55 or a decisive break towards $5.44. Crypto Altcoin: Past Trends and Current Levels Analysis Over the past month, the coin experienced a steep decline with a drop of 30.62%. The six-month change shows a 20.95% loss, reflecting sustained weakness. A one-week decrease of 8.14% highlights the recent sell-off and downward pressure. These numbers indicate prolonged bearish behavior, stressing the coin’s vulnerability despite occasional minor rebounds. At the current price range of $2.72 to $5.48, immediate support sits at $1.61 while resistance is marked at $7.13. Technical indicators such as the RSI at 35.15 signal clear bear control without a defined upward trend. Traders might consider buying opportunities near support and cautious exits near resistance, awaiting a potential shift in market sentiment. Sei Coin Faces Decline Amid Bearish Pressure Sei experienced a month drop of nearly 18% and a six-month decline of around 6%. A weekly decrease of close to 0.9% highlights the downward trend across various periods. This pattern indicates growing caution, as investors react to the recent negative momentum and overall soft performance indicators. Currently, Sei trades between $0.18 and $0.33, with resistance at $0.40 and strong support around $0.11. A secondary resistance level is found at $0.55. The indicators show an RSI of about 45 and minimal oscillator signals, revealing a market where bears are dominant and no clear trend is present. Traders should exercise caution while positioning near these support and resistance levels. Conclusion NEAR, RENDER, and SEI are set to show interesting movements this spring. NEAR may benefit from new updates and partnerships. RENDER could see growth driven by increasing adoption in creative industries. SEI might experience a boost from new integrations and ecosystem expansions. Each of these coins has unique strengths that may contribute to their rise. Investors will likely watch these developments closely as the season progresses. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

The impressive rally came amid a broader market downturn, making BERA one of the best-performing assets of the week. Here are three key market indicators that drove Berachain’s price surge and what to expect in March 2025. Berachain (BERA) Emerges Standout Performer amid Crypto Market Crash Despite major sell-offs in global financial markets last week, Berachain’s price action stood out. On February 28, as Bitcoin plunged below $80,000 for the first time in four months, BERA surged 35% to weekly timeframe peak $9, in stark contrast to major assets like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL), which all hit new 2025 lows last week. Macroeconomic fears, particularly new tariffs announced by Trump’s administration, spooked investors and triggered over $879 million in leveraged position liquidations on February 28 alone. Most altcoins followed Bitcoin’s lead, suffering double-digit declines, yet BERA defied this trend by gaining 35%, rising from $6 on February 25 to $9 by February 28. Why Is Berachain (BERA) Price Going Up? Several factors contributed to Berachain’s resilience and impressive price performance last week. TVL Surge from Yield-Seeking Investors Berachain’s ecosystem showed notable strength through its Total Value Locked (TVL), which remained above $3 billion, peaking at $3.32 billion, according to on-chain data. This stability was driven by its Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) mechanism, where users stake BERA to earn governance tokens (BGT) and provide liquidity, securing high annual rewards of up to 18%. Berachain TVL, March 1, 2025 | Source: DeFiLlama Unlike traditional staking models, PoL incentivizes active capital deployment, creating a flywheel effect that kept liquidity flowing even as other projects suffered capital outflows. Data from DeFiLlama indicated an additional $150 million in deposits within 24 hours, pushing TVL to $3.3 billion by March 1. Historically, a rising TVL correlates with upward price action, suggesting more potential upside for BERA. Recovery from Airdrop Backlash Berachain’s price trajectory post-launch also supports its bullish outlook. After its February 6, 2025, mainnet debut, BERA soared to $14.99 before crashing to $5.57 by February 11, as users reacted negatively to airdrop distribution. However, by February 19, it had rebounded to $6.60—a 31% recovery—driven by growing TVL and broader ecosystem traction. The network has since attracted 5.18 million active wallets and holds a stablecoin market cap of $930 million. This positive momentum likely carried into late February, positioning BERA as an outlier amid the market crash. X users noted Berachain’s “uncorrelated” nature, suggesting it acted as a safe-haven asset while Bitcoin and Ethereum collapsed. Strong Community Influence Berachain’s meme-driven, tight-knit community, originating from the Bong Bears NFT project, played a key role in its stability. Unlike other projects that rely heavily on institutional backing, Berachain’s grassroots movement has built an investor base that is less influenced by broader market panic. On social media, X users praised BERA’s resilience, calling it an asset that “copes extraordinarily well” during Bitcoin downturns. This unique identity, combined with strong fundamentals and DeFi integrations such as Infrared Finance, helped sustain investor confidence when fear gripped the wider crypto market. Can Berachain Extend Its Gains in March? In summary, BERA price rally last week was driven by its PoL-driven ecosystem maintaining TVL stability, a price rebound from a prior bottom, and strong community backing insulating it from panic selling. Additionally, its fundamentals shone amid market chaos, positioning it as a refuge for capital exiting riskier assets. With tariffs on Canada and Mexico set to begin on Monday, BERA could receive further capital inflows if the market starts the week on a bearish note. If macroeconomic conditions worsen and Bitcoin struggles to regain momentum, Berachain may continue attracting liquidity from investors seeking a more resilient crypto asset. Berachain Price Forecast: $12 breakout ahead if $8 support holds Berachain price forecast suggests a potential move toward $12 if the $8 support level holds firm, as the Bollinger Bands (BB) and Bull-Bear Power (BBP) signal continued strength. The price is currently testing the mid-BB level at $8.16, aligning with short-term support. If buyers maintain control above this zone, upside momentum could accelerate toward the upper BB at $8.93 before challenging $10 and, ultimately, the psychological $12 mark. Berachain Price Forecast Volume analysis reveals declining bearish pressure following a 9.31% retracement, while BBP remains positive at 0.869, reflecting lingering bullish control. A decisive move above $9 with strong volume confirmation could trigger a fresh rally, mirroring the prior 34.91% surge in just three days. The risk, however, lies in a breakdown below $8, which could expose Berachain to the 50-day moving average near $7.57. For now, Berachain’s bullish structure remains intact, with consolidation at key levels suggesting accumulation rather than weakness. A confirmed breakout above resistance could see momentum traders driving the next leg toward $12, provided market sentiment remains favorable.

Investors are keen to see if Bitcoin will regain its strength or if Ethereum will take the lead. Insights and trends in this article will reveal which cryptocurrencies are set for potential growth. Dive in to discover the frontrunners and what could drive their performance this month. Bitcoin Price Recap: Long-Term Recovery Amid Short-Term Weakness Bitcoin dropped nearly 18% in the past month, reflecting a short-term downturn amid caution. Over the last six months, the coin rebounded with a rise of almost 50%, indicating a strong long-term recovery despite recent pressure. The current price is between $74,054 and $98,804, with immediate support at $63,742 and resistance near $113,241. Bearish indicators are present, including a low RSI around 27.6 and negative momentum signals, making the trend uncertain. Traders might consider movements within these levels for strategic entries and exits, while anticipating clearer signs of reversal or sustained downward momentum. Ethereum Behavior: 28.56% Drop Over the Last Month, Bearish Trends Persist Ethereum price tumbled by about 28.56% over the last month while showing an 8.41% drop in the half-year span. The data reflects a period marked by bearish sentiment, with technical oscillators indicating ongoing decline and volatility. These past moves highlight the market's sensitivity to downside pressure and investor caution as the coin attempted to stabilize amid fluctuating momentum. Currently, Ethereum trades within a range of $1766 to $3021, with nearby support at $1294.59 and resistance at $3803.80. Bears dominate as clear downward pressure persists without a strong trend emerging. Traders might focus on short-term opportunities by monitoring price movements around these levels and positioning for potential breakouts or reversals. Conclusion March opens on a positive note for both BTC and ETH. There is potential for significant growth. BTC has shown resilience and could continue its upward trend. However, ETH also presents strong prospects, especially with upcoming technological updates. Both cryptocurrencies hold promise, making it hard to predict a clear frontrunner. Investors will need to watch market trends closely. The month could see strong performance from either or both coins.

BTFD Coin’s P2E Game Sends Bulls Charging Toward a 3650% ROI Potential Ever played a game that pays you in crypto? BTFD Coin is turning that into a reality. With its full P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, players can now earn $BTFD tokens just by playing. The game rewards users for competing, staking, and growing their in-game assets, making BTFD one of the few meme coins to integrate a functional gaming ecosystem. While most meme coins rely purely on hype, BTFD’s real utility is driving demand. Investors aren’t just jumping in for the laughs—they’re chasing real, long-term earning potential. At a current presale price of $0.00016, BTFD is projected to hit a listing price of $0.0006, with a moon target of $0.006—a massive 3650% potential ROI.

A $15,000 investment at $0.00016 bags 93.75 million tokens—worth $562,500 at the $0.006 moon price. The real question is: are you in, or are you missing the ride? Neiro Rides the Dogecoin Hype as a Next-Gen Meme Sensation If there’s one thing crypto has shown, the Doge brand is unbeatable. Enter Neiro, a fresh dog-themed meme coin gaining traction as a spiritual successor to Dogecoin. Its adoption by Kabosu’s owner—the real-life Shiba Inu behind Doge—has given Neiro instant credibility. Unlike Dogecoin, Neiro is taking a more community-driven approach, tapping into social media movements and viral content to attract investors. The project has no fixed roadmap, keeping it fluid and adaptable to trends. With memecoin mania rising again, Neiro is positioning itself as a serious player in the space. Neiro’s focus on meme culture and viral marketing means its price action is driven by its growing fanbase. While it hasn’t announced staking or gaming utilities yet, its organic adoption and connection to Doge history give it the kind of momentum that only meme coins with strong communities can maintain. Floki Inu’s Metaverse Expansion Strengthens Its Market Position Floki Inu has evolved from a meme coin into a full-blown Web3 powerhouse. Originally inspired by Elon Musk’s dog, Floki has transformed into a multi-chain utility token spanning DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse. Its biggest strength? Real-world utility. Unlike many meme projects, Floki Inu integrates seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) and has partnerships focused on education, gaming, and blockchain adoption. Recent expansions in the Metaverse and NFT gaming sector have positioned Floki Inu as a serious contender beyond just meme culture. With Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain compatibility, its accessibility is driving more investors toward its ecosystem. While Floki’s price action remains highly volatile, its long-term value proposition is undeniable. As Metaverse adoption increases, Floki Inu could see another wave of investor interest, making it a strong meme coin for those eyeing long-term potential. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the best new meme coins to buy this month are delivering high-stakes investment opportunities, and BTFD Coin is leading the charge. Its P2E game, staking rewards, and referral program create a perfect storm for rapid adoption and serious gains. Neiro is proving that Doge-inspired coins still have massive appeal, while Floki Inu continues to build its Metaverse and Web3 empire. With BTFD’s presale offering a 100% bonus, a projected $0.006 moon price, and a 3650% ROI potential, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are not far behind, dropping 14.1% and 18.2% respectively. The declining sentiment as investors switch to alternatives is attributed by experts. One of the alternatives that investors are currently going for is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi lending protocol selling below $0.02 presale. With $1.85 million and 3,550 holders stuck, project’s basic tokenomics and buy pressure structures are fueling hype for a 400% splash on launch; and potential rise to $7 in two months. XRP’s Drop As Market Jitters Grow XRP’s recent fall to $2.14 simply reflects broader jitters in crypto. Despite showing a buy signal on its TD Sequential indicator, the token is still near crucial support levels, as per analyst Ali Martinez. Crypto Bitlord, a popular trader, issues a warning that a breakdown of $2 will have it plunge to $0.20. CrediBULL Crypto has closed hedges and waits for potential long entries at $1.60. These uncertainties have been sharply contrasted with the momentum being generated around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale, in which investors are taking advantage of presale discounts before exchange listings. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gone live with its second presale, selling tokens at $0.015. Investors purchasing now can enjoy a 33.3% return when the price rises to $0.02 in the next phase. The project’s tokenomics ensure a 400% return on its $0.06 listing on an exchange, turning an overnight $1,000 investment into $4,000. Apart from this, according to expert estimates, it is expected to reach $7 as of mid-2025 on the strength of its buy-and-distribute model. The model funnels platform revenue towards MUTM token repurchase, which are rewarded back to stakers; sustaining demand while discouraging sell-offs. Tokenomics Fueling Hope The universe of Mutuum Finance is built around mtTokens, income-generating deposits made by users. Supplying ETH can accrete mtETH, value accumulation over time. Tokens enable liquidity and can be exchanged between DeFi networks. Loans are then used by borrowers through overcollateralizing assets, balancing out the system. A $7,000 ETH deposit could make someone eligible for a $5,000 USDT loan, with minimal risk of defaults. These systems put MUTM at a working level compared to value-varying memecoins. ROI Projections Grab Heads Long-term projections envision MUTM to be worth up to $7, returning an awe-inspiring 46,566% profit over its existing presale worth. The $500 investment from initial $0.015-phase buyers would come in at $233,333 in the event this target is hit. Minimal returns of some $1.50 are sure enough to produce life-altering dividends. FOMO created when the presale went as quickly as it did; Phase 1 moved in a snap; has seen only 20% of tokens go in Phase 2. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi interaction through the merging of lending power with intentional token burning. As XRP investors protect themselves against further losses, MUTM presale offers a prudent entry into a project for long-term success. Time is short: the next price hike is on its way, and with it, the last chance to lock tokens below sub-$0.02 prices.

Despite market ups and downs, its resilience and utility keep investor interest alive, securing its place as a staple in crypto portfolios. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu has made significant strides from its origins as a meme coin to a cryptocurrency with a burgeoning ecosystem. Initiatives like Shibarium are enhancing its functionality, with features such as staking, DeFi applications, and NFT integrations contributing to its long-term appeal. Community-driven initiatives such as token burning and supply reduction strategies are poised to boost its valuation over time. As it broadens its functionality, Shiba Inu offers a compelling choice for investors looking to broaden their crypto holdings.

The token’s value climbed 9%, reaching roughly $137. A large numbers of moneyed people, “whales” they are called, is gobbling up huge amounts of the Solana crypto. Technical signals suggest a strong momentum and growing open interest, keeping traders upbeat and glued on their celphone or PC screens.

The Relative Strength Index is approaching the overbought zone, as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence flashes a strong signal. There are technical signs that support the upward trend. After going up to 68, the RSI is now close to the zone where prices are too high. Some traders may think it will go down if it breaks above the 70 mark. The MACD indicates that the buying momentum remains robust. Traders frequently employ this to determine whether an asset has potential for further growth or if a reversal is imminent. Historical Whale Accumulations And SOL Price Increases Whale activity has historically been a significant factor in the price movement of Solana. SOL reached an all-time peak of $262 in November 2024 as a result of a $35 million purchase of the token by whales in a mere two days. Since late October 2024, a single whale has amassed over 257k SOL, to the tune of almost $54 million. This contributed to Solana’s market capitalization surpassing $100 billion, making it as one of the most prominent altcoins in the market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees 95% Drop In Network Activity—Trouble Ahead? The Road Ahead For SOL Solana’s short-term outlook is favorable, as whales continue to increase their holdings and open interest is increasing. Traders should keep a watchful eye out on indications of a potential correction as the RSI approaches overbought territory. Currently, the bullish momentum is unabated, and as past trends indicate, whale accumulation could be pointing to more upside movement. Solana’s ability to sustain this trend is contingent upon the duration of the purchasing pressure and the influx of new investors.

More on TRX Rally & Shiba Inu Future Outlook,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-hackerearth-take-web3-to-the-next-level-with-200-dapps-more-on-trx-rally-shiba-inu-future-outlook/,"Meme coins, established projects, and emerging blockchain networks are all in a heated battle for market attention. The Shiba Inu future outlook remains fragile as the coin fails to sustain momentum after hitting a key resistance. Meanwhile, the TRON (TRX) breakout potential keeps traders alert as TRX inches toward the $0.25 mark, with a possibility of reaching $0.30 if buying pressure remains steady. For those searching what is the next big crypto in Web3, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making strong moves. The network has raised over $199 million and secured a groundbreaking collaboration with HackerEarth, paving the way for over 200 new dApps through a pool of 10,000 developers. Shiba Inu Future Outlook: Can SHIB Regain Strength? Shiba Inu’s future outlook remains uncertain after its repeated failures to break past the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA). Historically, struggling at this level has often signaled a lack of confidence in a potential price recovery. Some market watchers suggest that unless SHIB clears the 26 EMA, it could risk sliding toward the $0.00001500 mark. While short-term signals present mixed indications, surpassing this critical level may allow Shiba Inu to aim for the 50 EMA resistance, a key threshold for bullish momentum. Tron’s Breakout Potential: Is TRX Gearing Up for a Rally? The TRON (TRX) breakout potential continues to capture attention as the coin trades near $0.2470. Analysts believe a solid move past $0.25 could pave the way for a rise to $0.30, provided bullish activity persists. The ability of TRX to hold above $0.22 remains a critical factor, as this level is considered essential for maintaining upward momentum. Additionally, a surge in stablecoin transactions on the Tron network signals improved liquidity, strengthening its breakout potential. If TRX decisively clears $0.2470, a sustained rally may follow, but some remain cautious while others bank on its ecosystem’s steady expansion to drive long-term gains. BlockDAG Set to Expand Web3 with HackerEarth Collaboration! BlockDAG is not just accumulating millions in presale—it is strategically positioning itself to dominate Web3. The latest partnership with HackerEarth is bringing together 10,000 skilled developers to roll out over 200 decentralized applications, aiming to solidify its presence as a premier Layer 1 blockchain with strong Web3 integrations. Currently priced at $0.0248 in presale batch 27, BlockDAG’s total presale revenue has already surpassed $199 million, with 18.6 billion BDAG coins sold since batch 1. Early participants have witnessed a remarkable 2,380% return, sparking discussions about BDAG’s long-term potential to deliver a 30,000x return. With a dedicated community of 170,000 holders continuously backing the project and expanding their holdings, BlockDAG’s influence continues to grow. A focus on scalability remains central to BlockDAG’s mission, ensuring lightning-fast transactions, seamless functionality, and a robust developer ecosystem. With over 200 new dApps set to launch on its network, BlockDAG is reinforcing its position as a top contender in Web3. When the question arises—what is the next big crypto?—BlockDAG presents a compelling answer. The saying goes, two heads are better than one, and with 10,000 developers on board, BDAG’s presale success could evolve into something far greater. The collaboration with HackerEarth and a strong community drive cement BlockDAG’s ambitions to stand out as a dominant Layer 1 blockchain in Web3. Next Big Crypto in Web3– Final Say! Shiba Inu’s future outlook remains in question as its price movement stays restricted below the 26 EMA, leaving many uncertain about its next move. At the same time, TRX’s breakout potential remains a topic of interest as traders monitor whether it can solidify gains past $0.25 and edge closer to $0.30. Meanwhile, BlockDAG continues making strides to become the next big crypto in Web3 . The HackerEarth partnership is a game-changer, bringing in 10,000 developers to launch 200+ new dApps. With over $199 million already raised, BlockDAG shows no signs of slowing down. Those looking for substantial returns with lower risk might find BDAG an attractive choice—especially with the presale still ongoing.

The ETH coin was trading at the extreme oversold level of the Murrey Mathe Lines at $2,220, down by almost 50% from its highest level in December last year. So, is it safe to buy the ETH dip? Ethereum price technical analysis The daily chart shows that the ETH coin price has crashed in the past two months. After peaking a $4,088 in November last year, the coin has moved to $2,220. It has crashed slightly below the key support at $2,182, the lowest swing on February 13. ETH price has crashed below the 50-day moving average, a sign that bears remain in control for now. It has also moved below the Ichimoku cloud indicator. There are signs that the coin has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a popular bearish continuation sign. Oscillators have continued to move downwards. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped and moved to the oversold level, while the percentage price oscillator (PPO) has moved below the zero line. Therefore, the outlook for the Ethereum coin is bearish. Measuring the distance between the November highest point in November and the current level shows that it is about 50%. The same distance from the current level gives the next Ethereum price target at $1,125. This bearish Ethereum price target will become invalid if the coin rises above the strong, pivot, reverse level at $2,812. A move above that level will point to more gains, with the next point to watch being at $3,500. Ethereum price chart Why ETH price is crashing There are a few reasons why the ETH coin is crashing. First, there are signs that it is seeing weak demand from retail and instititutional demand. A good example of this is looking at the spot Ethereum ETF inflows and outflows data . It has had outflows in the past seven consecutive days, moving its total inflows since inception at $2.28 and the total Ethereum ETF assets at about $8 billion. Looking at Ethereum ETF inflows and outflows data is a good indicator of demand from the US. The same is happening in the staking market, where Ethereum ETF outflows have risen in the past few months. Ethereum has a staking market cap if $74 billion, down by almost 20% in the last seven days. Further data shows that Ethereum balances on exchanges have risen in the past few days. They rose to 15.38 million, up from 14.9 million last month. Rising balances is a sign that investors are selling their coins by moving them to exchanges. ETH balances on exchanges | Source: Coinglass Ethereum futures open interest has also plunged in the past few months. It slumped to $19 billion on Sunday, down from over $30 billion last year. Therefore, this performance is a sign that demand is waning. There are other reasons why the ETH price has crashed. For example, the drop is in sync with other cryptocurrencies have plunged in the past few months, with Bitcoin’s price falling from $109,200 to $85,000 today. Further, the ongoing Ethereum price plunge happened as the blockchain came under strong competition from the likes of Solana and BNB. Most notably, it is seeing strong competition from top layer-2 networks like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism.

But things went off the rails when mid-discussion, Elon told Rogan to ask Grok—his AI chatbot—whether there was any gold left in Fort Knox. “Are you a f—— conspiracy theorist?” Grok shot back. Rogan laughed, Elon smirked, and the internet exploded with hilarious memes. The “Is the gold still there?” question has been floating around for a few weeks now, and Elon has even shown his openness to replacing the gold with Bitcoin, as Cryptopolitan reported last month. That was just one of the many bizarre, headline-grabbing moments from the interview, which covered everything from Elon’s role in Trump’s administration to unverified claims of rampant fraud in federal agencies. Elon, as usual, came armed with big statements, vague details, and no shortage of controversy. Elon dodges specifics on DOGE’s government cuts Elon’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been slashing its way through federal agencies, but exactly how it operates remains a mystery. Rogan pushed Elon for details, but he dodged specifics. “These are cuts that DOGE recommends to the department,” Elon said. “Usually these recommendations are followed, but these are recommendations that are then confirmed by the department.” The exact number of DOGE employees? Unclear. Elon said the team started with 40 to 100 people but didn’t specify how large it has grown. Some reports suggest the workforce has expanded significantly. Congress and federal officials have raised serious concerns about DOGE’s hiring process, which has brought in staff as young as 19. DOGE’s access to federal data has also triggered nearly a dozen lawsuits. Elon defended the agency’s vetting process, insisting that “anyone from DOGE has to go through the same vetting process that those federal employees went through.” He added , “If for example there’s a security clearance needed, the DOGE person has to have that same security clearance, so there’s no reduction in security.” Fraud claims, missing gold theories, and social security chaos Elon doubled down on claims that fraud is running rampant in Social Security. He told Rogan that DOGE found “20 million dead people marked as alive” in the system. Rogan asked if those people were actually receiving benefits. Elon’s response? “Yes.” But when pressed for specifics—like what percentage of those 20 million were actually getting money—Elon didn’t have an answer. Social Security’s acting commissioner, Lee Dudek, later pushed back on Elon’s claims. “The reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits,” Dudek said . Elon then pivoted to FEMA, claiming the agency spent $59 million on migrant housing. A few days earlier, Elon had posted the same claim on X, crediting DOGE with uncovering the spending. But the funding had already been made public and approved by Congress. Despite this, four FEMA officials were fired the day after Elon’s post. The officials were reportedly tied to hotel funding for migrants in New York City. Then came the Fort Knox moment. Elon talks Trump, secret tech, and the Nazi controversy Though the administration has said that Elon is a White House advisor, President Donald Trump has said that Elon is leading the way with DOGE’s efforts to slash the federal government. At Trump’s first Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Elon had an outsized role, with Trump giving him the floor for a large chunk of it. “This is a revolutionary Cabinet and maybe the most revolutionary Cabinet since the first revolution,” Elon said. The conversation then shifted to secret technology. Elon, who has long pushed for transparency in space tech, was asked whether private contractors were hiding advanced propulsion technology. “I don’t think they’re hiding it from me,” Elon said, implying he’d know if they were. He didn’t expand on the subject, leaving plenty of room for speculation. One of the more heated moments came when Rogan brought up a recent controversy. During Trump’s inauguration celebration, Elon made a gesture that some compared to a Nazi salute. The legacy media latched onto the moment, especially after Elon followed it up by posting Nazi-related puns on X. Elon denied any wrongdoing. “It was obviously meant in the most positive spirit possible,” Elon told Rogan. “Now I can never point at things diagonally.” He went further, accusing the media of deliberately twisting the story. “It’s deliberate propaganda,” Elon said. “They know it was obviously not meant in a negative way. I’d literally said, ‘my heart goes out to you.’ It was very positive. My entire speech was very positive.” Despite the backlash, Elon refused to back down. The controversy has only added to the growing political storm surrounding his government role. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

As investors and enthusiasts navigate this unpredictable landscape, all eyes are on the upcoming US job data release. The community remains anxious as a weaker job data could result in increased volatility. Notably, initial jobless claims surged to their highest level of the year last week, potentially signaling a slowdown in the labor market. With President Donald Trump reducing the government workforce, a weaker jobs report is expected. Let’s uncover how the upcoming jobs report could influence the crypto market. Is a Weaker US Jobs Data Ahead? According to a Labor Department report on Thursday, new jobless claims jumped to 242,000 for the week ending February 22, surpassing expectations and reaching the highest level of 2023. The latest data hints at a slowdown in the labor market, potentially leading to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts. Notably, jobless claims for the week ended February 22 jumped by 22,000 to 242,000, exceeding analysts’ forecasts of 225,000. Washington, D.C. saw a significant surge in new unemployment claims, totaling 2,047, which marks a 26% increase from the previous week. Unemployment filings in Massachusetts jumped by 3,731 to 9,179, while Rhode Island saw claims skyrocket by more than 200% to 2,964. All these inputs suggest that the upcoming US jobs data will report a weaker employment data, potentially leading to a significant Fed decision and a crypto market volatility. How Will the US Jobs Data Impact Federal Reserve’s Interest Rate Decision? Interestingly, the US employment data is a critical factor that significantly influences the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates. If the upcoming US jobs data reveals an increased unemployment rate, there is a higher possibility for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates. On the other hand, a strong job market can fuel inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve to take action to curb it, which may delay interest rate cuts. Additionally, the significant decline in the US consumer confidence in February has sparked anticipations of Fed’s interest rate cuts in June and September. The Conference Board survey revealed that the consumer confidence drop marked the sharpest in 3.5 years largely driven by growing concerns over President Donald Trump’s economic policies. Further fueling speculations, Raphael Bostic, the President of the Atlanta Federal Reserve, shared his insights on the Fed’s possible moves. He stated that the Fed will reduce interest rates twice this year while some factors could affect the decision. He posited, “While that’s my baseline expectation, there’s a lot that is going to happen that could influence that really in both directions.” Will the Crypto Market See Another Turmoil? Over the past few weeks, the crypto market has been experiencing vast changes, with prices of top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum fluctuating rapidly . With anticipations of slower US jobs data, the market is expected to have a resurgence despite volatility. As President Donald Trump is reducing the government workforce through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, there is a higher chance for an increased unemployment rate. This could push the Fed to further reduce interest rates, paving the way for a stronger crypto market.

During his first term, he made sure everyone knew when the S&P 500 hit new highs. But things have changed. Since returning to the White House in January, the president has been unusually quiet about Wall Street, even when the market briefly hit a record on February 19. Now? The S&P 500 has fallen almost every day, sinking below the level it was at when he took office in January. Other indexes tied to the real economy are sliding, and Bitcoin, which once rode the Trump wave, has dropped 20% in a month. Markets react as investor confidence tumbles Stocks are moving differently than they did in Trump’s first term. In 2017, the economy was still recovering from an energy crisis, and interest rates were four percentage points lower than they are now. The Federal Reserve was trying to pump life into the markets, and when Trump unleashed tax cuts, stocks took off. The S&P 500 saw two consecutive years of more than 20% growth in 2023 and 2024—the first time that had happened since 1996. But markets can’t keep climbing forever. Now, valuations are sky-high, and the stocks that fueled the last rally aren’t pulling their weight. The Magnificent Seven, the elite group of AI-driven tech stocks that have dominated markets, make up about a third of the S&P 500’s total value. But they’re no longer pushing things upward. Nvidia, the AI chip powerhouse, has dropped nearly 10% since Trump’s inauguration. Only two out of 11 sectors in the S&P 500 are in the red this year, and tech is one of them. Trump’s new tariffs shake global markets Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities, summed up the mood among traders. “The tariff rhetoric has become daily and extreme, sentiment is awful and trading is on edge.” On Thursday, Trump reignited trade war fears by announcing a new 10% tariff on Chinese imports, set to take effect on March 4, and also confirmed plans for tariffs on Canada and Mexico, keeping investors on edge about future trade disputes. The Nasdaq, which is heavy with tech stocks, has already lost 4% this month. European markets felt the pressure too. Germany’s DAX and the Stoxx Europe 600 opened lower on the news, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 2.9%, South Korea’s Kospi fell 3.4%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slid 3.3%. Even China’s CSI 300 benchmark lost 2%. Almost 90 percent of survey respondents said that stocks are overvalued. The CBOE Skew Index, which measures how much investors are girding for a sell-off by tracking trades in options markets that would buffer against a sudden plunge in the value of the S&P 500, reached its highest level ever on February 18, the day before that index hit its record high. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta revised its first-quarter GDP forecast, now expecting the U.S. economy to shrink by 1.5%. That’s a sharp turnaround from its previous forecast of 2.3% growth just two weeks ago. Trump’s economic policies are already having a measurable impact, and traders are scrambling to adjust. Late rally gives temporary relief, but concerns are still there Friday brought some relief to the markets. The S&P 500 closed 1.6% higher, cutting its February decline to 1.4%. The Nasdaq also rose 1.6%. Nvidia rebounded 4% after an 8.4% drop on Thursday, though its recent losses have raised questions about the strength of the AI boom. European markets recovered as well. Germany’s DAX and the Stoxx Europe 600 ended the day flat, regaining earlier losses. Then on Friday, during a tense Oval meeting, Trump accused Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of “gambling with World War Three,” then chastised him and kicked him out of the White House, canceling their economic partnership and the joint press conference they had planned later in the day. Later on Truth Social, Trump said , “We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today. Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It’s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.” Despite everything, Trump told supporters in Miami on February 19, “I think the stock market’s going to be great.” But he also exaggerated the numbers, claiming the Dow had jumped 10% since his election when the actual increase was less than 7%. The S&P 500 surged by 6.25% between election night (November 5) and February 19, but now it’s up by only 3% since November 5.

According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, GDP is on track to contract by 1.5% in the first quarter, a drop from the 2.3% growth estimate made just five weeks ago. The GDPNow tracker , which updates in real-time based on incoming data, used to point to 3.9% growth, but new numbers from the Commerce Department sent it plunging. An economic report released on Friday morning showed that personal spending fell 0.2% in January, missing the Dow Jones estimate of a 0.1% increase. After adjusting for inflation, it was even worse—a 0.5% drop, enough to wipe an entire percentage point off GDP expectations. The US economy relies heavily on consumer spending, as it makes up for more than two-thirds of GDP. A 0.2% decline might seem small, but it’s the largest monthly drop in four years. The hit came from weaker-than-expected retail sales, as Americans pulled back on spending due to high inflation, policy uncertainty, and market volatility. “This is sobering notwithstanding the inherent volatility of the very high frequency ‘nowcast’ maintained by the Atlanta Fed,” Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz and president of Queens’ College Cambridge, said in a post on social media site X. At the same time, exports took a major hit, dragging down GDP even further. The Commerce Department reported that net exports’ contribution to GDP collapsed from -0.41 percentage points to -3.7. The reason? A record $153.3 billion trade deficit in January. Economists say this could be the result of businesses stockpiling imports ahead of Trump’s potential tariffs, making the trade gap even worse. Markets react as bond yields invert and stocks swing Wall Street isn’t ignoring the warning signs. The bond market is flashing its most reliable recession indicator: an inverted yield curve. The 3-month Treasury yield has climbed above the 10-year note, a pattern that has historically signaled an economic downturn within 12 to 18 months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been on a rollercoaster. The index is still up 2% for the year, but it’s been wildly volatile, reacting to every new piece of economic data. The S&P 500, which surged by 6% between Election Day and February 19, has tumbled by 3.1% as of press time, according to data from Google Finance. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is coming under pressure as traders in the fed funds futures market are now pricing in an 80% chance of a rate cut in June, with expectations of three total cuts by the end of 2025. If Fed Chair Jerome Powell moves too fast with rate cuts, inflation could flare up again. If he waits too long, the slowdown could spiral into a full-blown recession. Economists at Piper Sandler had previously expected 2% growth, but now they’re predicting a 2% contraction. Some economists aren’t convinced the slowdown will last. As recently as early January, a Wall Street Journal survey of economists projected 2.2% GDP growth in the first quarter. Many of those forecasts haven’t changed despite the Atlanta Fed’s gloomy outlook. Trump’s policies add uncertainty to the economic outlook The economic slowdown isn’t happening in a vacuum. Trump’s return to the White House has shaken up policy expectations, and businesses aren’t sure what’s coming next. His tariff threats have already pushed inflation expectations higher, something that could complicate the Fed’s response. “With inflation just recently at a 40-year high, now is not the time to let down our guard,” said Jeff Schmid, president of the Kansas City Fed. The central bank has spent the last two years fighting inflation, and if expectations start rising again, it could force Powell to hold off on rate cuts even as the economy weakens. The uncertainty is showing up in business sentiment data. The Conference Board found that CEO confidence hit a three-year high in early February. But not everyone is so optimistic—S&P Global’s February survey of purchasing managers showed a sharp drop in optimism for the coming year. Meanwhile, the labor market is showing early signs of trouble. Initial unemployment claims just hit their highest level since early October. The unemployment rate, which dropped to 4% in January, is still historically low, but layoffs are starting to tick up.

Investors are eager to know which of these digital assets might see their value multiply fourfold first. The article explores the potential of each one, analyzing their strengths and current momentum to uncover which might lead the next big surge. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.002 by Stage 10, with over 90% of the $7.5 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Cardano’s ADA: A Sustainable Frontier in Cryptocurrency Cardano’s ADA is turning heads in the cryptocurrency world. As a flexible and scalable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, Cardano enables the creation of decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, rivals Ethereum’s ETH, allowing users to store value, make payments, and participate in staking on the network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is energy-efficient compared to the energy-intensive proof-of-work models used by some other blockchains. The blockchain’s innovative design divides it into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This structure enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially reaching up to a million per second. Since the introduction of native tokens in March 2021, Cardano has offered secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, setting new standards for efficiency and scalability. In the current market cycle, ADA’s combination of advanced technology and sustainability makes it an intriguing option. As market trends lean towards eco-friendly and scalable solutions, Cardano’s unique features position it as a strong contender in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. XRP: Unlocking Borderless Payments in the Digital Age XRP is a digital currency designed to make money transfers fast and easy. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it aims to be quick, low-cost, and accessible to everyone. Operating without a central authority, XRP ensures transactions are secure and can’t be reversed or tampered with. You don’t even need a bank account to use it. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP launched with 100 billion units, gifting 80 billion to Ripple to boost network development. Ripple uses XRP to enhance liquidity and support the ecosystem, releasing the currency in a controlled way through escrow. So, what makes XRP stand out in today’s market? Its technology focuses on seamless payment transfers across different currencies, which is a big plus in our global economy. Compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can be slow and expensive to transfer, XRP offers speed and low fees. Ripple’s efforts to manage the supply might also help stabilize its value. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, coins with real-world applications like XRP are gaining attention. While the market can be unpredictable, XRP’s potential to revolutionize global payments makes it an interesting option to watch. Conclusion Though ADA and XRP are strong, XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme blend and ambitious growth goals make it a standout for significant gains.

For consumers, Web3Bay offers the chance to earn crypto on daily transactions. Sellers avoid high fees and accrue tokens with potential value appreciation. As blockchain technology becomes more widespread, Web3Bay’s earn-while-you-shop model could become a viable alternative to traditional online marketplaces. Investors looking for the upcoming crypto projects with 1000x potential might want to consider getting into Web3Bay’s presale early before broader market adoption escalates prices. 2. Dawgz AI (DAGZ): Redefining Meme Coins with AI Dawgz AI steps up as a meme coin that integrates artificial intelligence to facilitate automated trading strategies and rewarding staking systems.

It is not simply that speculation exists. In essence, it is that very same speculation that is the market itself. The entire structure of the financial ecosystem, from early-stage presales to all-time highs and eventual retractions, operates within a probability field of perceived inevitability. The difference between success and failure is often just how well a project understands its own narrative. FloppyPepe (FPPE): A Dip-Resistant Meme Coin? The vast majority of meme coins are fragile constructs. They exist in states of boom and bust, reliant on external hype cycles rather than intrinsic momentum. At their best rise rapidly, and at their worst they collapse even faster. It’s only the rarest projects that emerge from the chaos with actual staying power. FloppyPepe (FPPE) may be different. Unlike standard meme coins, which require external participants to generate engagement, FloppyPepe operates under an entirely different model: AI-driven content perpetuation. It does not wait for the market to decide whether it is relevant; it is built to create its own relevance. Case in point: the Meme-o-Matic AI tool. This makes sure that FloppyPepe’s memetic presence is constant, self-sustaining, and built for virality. If traditional meme coins depend on market irrationality, FloppyPepe exploits it. It does not merely exist within speculative cycles; it feeds them, to its benefit. Where the Market Stands: A Game of Asymmetry The broader meme coin market has entered a paradoxical state; simultaneously saturated yet desperate for the next thing. The liquidity influx into AI-powered assets has already begun, yet the most asymmetric bets remain untouched. PEPE → Still has life in it, but fully priced in. DOGE → Institutionalized, no longer a speculative trade. BONK → A case study in volatility, but without structural longevity and reliant on SOL. FloppyPepe → AI-powered, self-generating, and only just beginning its cycle. The presence of burn mechanics and redistribution models in FloppyPepe’s tokenomics is not merely a structural advantage. It is most importantly a hedge against collapse. Whereas DOGE relied on its cultural inertia to make its way to its $35 billion market cap, and PEPE depended on pre-existing meme capital, FloppyPepe exists as a self-contained system. It is antifragile, and it thrives in volatility. $900K Raised and The Asymmetry of Early-Stage Entry It is not simply that FloppyPepe’s presale has raised over $900,000. Though this is an impressive achievement in its own right. it is more that it has done so in a market where most speculative assets are failing to capture sustained capital inflows. This is indicated by the simple fact that all of the top 6 meme coins in the market have been in the red over the past 7 days. For those considering entry, the asymmetry of the FPPE trade is even clearer: Early-stage entry price → Lower risk, exponential upside. AI-powered content generation → Sustained engagement, non-reliant on external trends. Burn mechanism → Engineered scarcity increasing long-term valuation potential. Welcome40 code bonus → A 40% additional token allocation for those entering now. What Happens Next? Understanding the Meme Coin Volatility Model The expected trajectory of FloppyPepe follows a model that is not entirely different from past meme coin explosions. That is, except for one key factor: AI. Phase One : Presale Asymmetry → Early entrants accumulate tokens before liquidity influxes distort price efficiency. Phase Two : Market Awareness → Meme-o-Matic floods social feeds with auto-generated, virality-ready content. Phase Three : Liquidity Migration → As market participants recognize the AI factor, capital moves from static meme coins to AI-powered alternatives. Phase Four : Exponential Growth or Consolidation → FloppyPepe’s core advantage is its ability to sustain engagement beyond speculative waves. Do Meme Coins Even Need a Use Case? The market has already proven that utility is not necessarily a requirement for exponential growth—but narrative control is. FloppyPepe does not merely offer a stronger narrative than its competitors. It manufactures its own story in real time. It is not a meme coin in the traditional sense, it is a financial abstraction of virality itself. In an industry where value is determined by speculative consensus, the only rationalization that remains is: if AI can create an endless feedback loop of attention, is there any limit to what FloppyPepe can achieve?

THE NEXT 1000X CRYPTO – CLICK HERE TO JOIN NOW! OFFICIALMAGACOIN: A New Entrant with Explosive Potential Launched recently, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has made a remarkable entrance by raising over $3.8 million within minutes during its presale phase. This rapid capital influx underscores strong investor confidence and suggests a robust demand for the token. The project’s exclusivity, being available solely through its official platform, enhances its scarcity and appeal among early adopters. XRP: Established Yet Facing Challenges XRP has long been a staple in the crypto market, primarily due to its focus on facilitating cross-border payments. However, ongoing legal challenges and regulatory uncertainties have somewhat dampened its growth prospects. While XRP maintains a solid user base, its potential for a 1000x increase appears constrained under current conditions. Solana (SOL): Technological Strengths with Reliability Concerns Solana is celebrated for its high-speed transactions and scalability, attracting numerous developers and projects to its ecosystem. Despite these technological advantages, Solana has experienced network outages, raising concerns about its reliability. While it holds promise, these issues may impact its ability to sustain the momentum required for a 1000x surge.

This projection, originating from a cryptocurrency research group, raises questions about its feasibility and the assumptions underpinning such a valuation. The Basis of the $18,000 Prediction A research paper published by a crypto-focused investment firm outlined multiple valuation models for XRP, with one scenario suggesting a price of $18,036 per token. This valuation was based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, assuming that Ripple’s technology would be integrated into a significant portion of global transactions over the next decade. Key assumptions in the model included: Global Transaction Volume : Estimated at $104 trillion Economic Growth Rate (2023-2032) : Projected at 2% Applied Discount Rate : Set at 10% Total Transaction Present Value : Calculated at $915 trillion XRP Circulating Supply : Approximately 50.7 billion tokens Projected Price per XRP : $18,036 This optimistic scenario relies on Ripple’s technology being widely adopted across financial systems, effectively replacing traditional payment networks. Adoption and Institutional Interest Despite these projections, major financial institutions have yet to confirm widespread adoption of XRP for cross-border transactions. While RippleNet has been associated with several banking institutions, full-scale integration remains limited. Some banks have expressed interest in exploring blockchain-based payment solutions, but no large-scale implementation of XRP for settlements has been officially documented. Market Sentiment and Community Reaction The forecast of XRP reaching five-figure valuations has been met with mixed reactions. Some members of the XRP community remain highly optimistic about its future, while skeptics argue that such projections are unrealistic given current adoption levels and regulatory challenges. Conclusion The possibility of XRP reaching $18,000 per token depends on several optimistic assumptions, including widespread global adoption and a major shift in financial infrastructure. While XRP continues to be a key player in blockchain-based payments, its future valuation remains speculative, and investors should consider multiple factors before making investment decisions.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,XRP|RESEARCH|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-02 03:26:41

The phishing text appeared within Binance’s official message thread, making it nearly indistinguishable from legitimate communications. User Reports Binance Phishing Incident One user, Joe Zhou, shared his experience in a LinkedIn post, stating, “I want to report a recent scam related to the Bybit incident and Binance.” Zhou described receiving an SMS from the same Binance number where he typically received verification codes. The message claimed that his account was being accessed from North Korea. Already dealing with the aftermath of the recent Bybit incident, he panicked and called the number provided. The call was answered by someone who instructed him to set up a SafePal wallet, saying it was a Binance partner and referencing an article to support the claim. The individual repeatedly asked about the assets in his account and insisted that he transfer all of them for an investigation. Following the instructions, Zhou set up the wallet and began withdrawing funds from Binance. However, he soon became suspicious and contacted an acquaintance from the exchange, who confirmed it was a scam. The user then attempted to recover his funds by transferring them out of the wallet, but the scammer began competing with him to move the assets. Eventually, Zhou ran out of gas fees. As he attempted to swap ETH for fees, his balance was cleared. The attack occurred just days after Bybit suffered an exploit that resulted in the loss of nearly $1.5 billion worth of ETH from its cold wallet. Blockchain analysts and the FBI have identified the North Korean hacking syndicate Lazarus Group as the likely perpetrator. Sophisticated Spoofing Attack SlowMist’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) analyzed the breach, stating that it involved a sophisticated method. He disclosed that his friend had also received identical phishing text and shared a screenshot that showed the precise forgery used. According to him, one possibility was that fraudsters faked official text sources through spoofing, using technical methods to manipulate the sender’s number and embed text messages into official conversations. Alternatively, they may have exploited SMS gateway vulnerabilities or conducted supply chain attacks by breaching the gateway, targeting operators or third-party providers, or collaborating with SMS providers to fake official replies, making detection difficult. Phishing remains a major threat to crypto users. Blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer reported that such scams drained $10.25 million from 9,220 victims in January. Although this marked a 56% decline from December’s $23.58 million losses, the report noted that scammers are evolving and implementing more intricate methods.

XRP and ADA are being watched closely as top contenders, along with a fresh altcoin with explosive potential.

XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The excitement for XYZVerse is palpable. Being the first meme token dedicated to all sports, it has both sports and crypto fans on board, and the crossover is becoming a force to be reckoned with. Already, with strong presale momentum and an active community, many investors are looking at major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike the majority of meme coins, which surf trends without support, XYZVerse is creating a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with meme culture, and it’s working. The presale is rapidly advancing as early investors secure tokens for a fraction of their potential future value.

Early investors have now locked in a considerable discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those figures have been attracting attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap , where users have expressed a significantly bullish stance regarding this coin, with 95% of voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. Reputable crypto influencers have also taken notice of XYZ. DanjoCapitalMaster , with nearly 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” While nothing is guaranteed in crypto, the excitement is certainly real. But while there is a lot of hype, XYZVerse has a clear and structured tokenomics model that guarantees long-term sustainability. 15% of its total supply is reserved for liquidity to establish strong, market-based support. The team holds 10% of the total supply aside for community rewards such as airdrops and bonuses. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is allocated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One aspect that makes XYZVerse stand out is its approach to community involvement. Recently, the team also launched the Ambassador Program, where users can earn free tokens just by supporting the project. And that’s merely the beginning—negotiations are already underway with notable sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the makings of a project with legitimate potential. Although the crypto market is never consistent, for many investors, this is an opportunity to jump on something big early on. The presale is not forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Cardano’s ADA: A Sustainable Frontier in Cryptocurrency Cardano’s ADA is causing a stir in the cryptocurrency space. Cardano is a flexible and scalable blockchain platform, which is designed for smart contracts, allowing for decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native token, ADA, performs similar functions to the ETH token on Ethereum, allowing holders to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. What differentiates Cardano from others is its eco-friendly method. It runs on the energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, unlike energy-intensive proof-of-work models deployed by some other blockchains. Cardano’s novel architecture separates the blockchain into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This allows it to handle transactions with a potential throughput of over a million per second. Since native tokens were introduced in March 2021, Cardano has maintained pristine, secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts—thus setting a new bar for performance and scalability. As the market continues in its current cycle, ADA’s blend of innovation and sustainability presents an enticing possibility. XRP: Unlocking Borderless Payments in the Digital Age XRP is a digital currency built for quick, affordable money transfers. Powered by the XRP Ledger, it runs without a central authority, providing secure and tamper-proof transactions. You can use it without a bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP launched with 100 billion units, with 80 billion given to Ripple to grow the network. Ripple releases XRP gradually through escrow to support liquidity and the ecosystem. What sets XRP apart is its focus on seamless currency transfers, making it ideal for global payments. Unlike Bitcoin, which can be slow and costly, XRP is fast and low-cost. Ripple’s controlled supply strategy may help stabilize its value. As the crypto market grows, practical solutions like XRP are getting noticed. Despite market volatility, XRP’s potential to transform global payments makes it worth watching. Conclusion While ADA and XRP have strong potential, XYZ’s sports-themed memecoin aims for huge returns by uniting sports fans and offering early adopters the chance to see significant profits.

Among these, blockchain technology has emerged as one of the most disruptive forces in the industry. From DeFi (decentralized finance) to digital currencies like Bitcoin , blockchain is reshaping how we perceive and interact with money, investments and financial systems. Understanding blockchain – A technological marvel At its core, blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a secure and transparent manner. Unlike traditional systems, where intermediaries like banks play a key role in processing and verifying transactions, blockchain allows peer-to-peer exchanges, ensuring that transactions are faster, more secure, and less costly. The technology offers multiple benefits, including greater transparency, reduced fraud and enhanced security. Its decentralized nature means that it is not controlled by any single authority, giving individuals more control over their financial activities. As a result, blockchain is increasingly seen as a viable alternative to traditional banking systems and financial institutions. Blockchain and the rise of DeFi DeFi refers to a new financial ecosystem that operates without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks, brokers and payment processors. DeFi platforms leverage blockchain technology to create financial products and services such as lending, borrowing and trading, all while ensuring users maintain control over their assets. DeFi is making it possible for anyone with an internet connection to access financial services – even in regions where traditional banking systems are either inadequate or inaccessible. With the rise of DeFi, the financial sector is becoming more inclusive, offering opportunities to individuals who have been historically excluded from the global financial system. Blockchain in traditional finance – A perfect partnership Despite the rapid rise of blockchain and DeFi, traditional financial institutions are not ignoring these advancements. In fact, many banks and financial organizations are embracing blockchain technology to enhance their own operations. For example, blockchain can be used to streamline the process of cross-border payments, reducing transaction times and costs. By removing intermediaries, blockchain enables instant and secure international money transfers, making global trade more efficient. Furthermore, blockchain’s ability to provide an immutable record of transactions ensures that financial institutions can reduce fraud and improve regulatory compliance. Another area where blockchain is making strides is in the field of securities trading. By tokenizing traditional assets like stocks, bonds and real estate, blockchain allows for more efficient and transparent trading. Tokenized assets can be traded on blockchain-based platforms, allowing for fractional ownership, faster settlement times and greater liquidity. The future of blockchain in finance As blockchain technology continues to evolve, it is expected to play an even more prominent role in shaping the future of finance. From enabling faster and more secure payments to creating new investment opportunities, the potential applications of blockchain are vast. For example, CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) – which are digital versions of traditional fiat currencies – are gaining traction. Countries like China and the European Union are already exploring the development of CBDCs, which could revolutionize how we think about money and payments. Blockchain could provide the underlying infrastructure for CBDCs, allowing for secure and transparent transactions on a global scale. Moreover, blockchain has the potential to enhance financial inclusion by offering affordable financial services to underserved populations. With blockchain-based solutions, individuals in developing countries could gain access to banking services, insurance and credit, helping to lift millions out of poverty. Conclusion Blockchain technology is undoubtedly changing the face of finance, making it more decentralized, transparent and secure. As we continue to witness the growth of DeFi, CBDCs and blockchain-based financial services, it’s clear that the technology is here to stay. Whether you’re an investor, a financial professional or just someone looking to learn more about the future of money, it’s important to understand how blockchain will shape the financial world in the coming years. As the industry continues to evolve, staying informed and adapting to new technologies like blockchain will be key to thriving in the future financial landscape. The transformation is just beginning, and its potential is limitless.

Despite the SEC’s recent activity, which saw cases dropped against major players like Coinbase, Gemini and Robinhood, the Ripple case remains unresolved—and it’s far from simple. The Ripple-XRP case has reached a crucial point where a judge has already issued a split decision. On one hand, the SEC won a portion of the case, while Ripple claimed victory on another. The biggest takeaway? XRP was not classified as a security—a significant win for Ripple and its community. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as the finding of securities law violations and the potential penalties Ripple could face. Legal expert James Murphy aka Metalawman has a theory on the unexpected delay. He suggests that Ripple could be in active negotiations with the SEC to have some of Judge Torres’s decision vacated. Ripple could be looking for a better deal, particularly if they’re eyeing future securities offerings or an IPO. If both sides were to dismiss their appeals, Ripple could potentially settle with a $125 million penalty—but could they push for more? https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1895899204134060538 However, Murphy also wrote, “It is far from a sure thing that a federal judge would agree to vacate a prior ruling as part of a settlement. This was fairly commonplace several years ago when I started in the law business, but judges started balking at this in more recent times.” Although this remains speculation, Murphy’s theory has gained support from figures like attorney John Deaton. And while the settlement process could drag on, Ripple may be strategically waiting for market conditions to improve. As XRP continues its downward trend, the timing for any positive announcement may need to align with a broader market recovery—especially when it comes to boosting the price of XRP.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-02 04:40:58

This price bounce comes after a rather bearish week marked by significant losses across the general crypto market. Interestingly, as these digital assets show some minor recovery, renowned market analyst Ali Martinez has postulated that XLM may be preparing for a major bullish swing. Related Reading: Solana Jumps 9% As Whales Quietly Accumulate Millions—Details XLM’s Bullish Flag Could Propel Prices To $1.20 – Analyst In an X post on March 1, Martinez shared an interesting technical analysis of the XLM market. According to the market expert, there is a bullish flag formation on the XLM/USDT 3-day trading chart signaling an incoming price surge. For context, the bullish flag pattern occurs when an asset experiences a steep rise in price representing the flagpole followed by a consolidation period with a declining price movement representing the flag. On the XLM/USDT chart, the bullish flag is formed following a price rally in November 2024 which is trailed by a price correction phase to date. However, while the bullish flag might signal a potential upward momentum ready to explode, Stellar must break beyond the upper boundary of the flag currently at $0.41 to confirm any price surge. Looking beyond this level, the altcoin will also face significant resistance to its upward movement at $1.00, $1.21, and $1.41 price levels respectively. However, in the presence of sufficient buying pressure, XLM could surge by at least 330% upon confirmation of bullish intent suggesting a minimum price of around $1.20. This projected rise of Stellar stems from historical data from which a bullish flag is expected to produce market gains similar to the length of its flagpole. Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the XLM/USDT daily chart also supports the bullish potential of the altcoin. According to data from Tradingview, this RSI is currently at 4.59 headed in the upward direction, signaling more room for XLM price gains following its recent recovery.

XLM Price Overview At the time of writing, XLM trades at $0.3141 after its 10% price increase in the last 24 hours as earlier stated. Meanwhile, there is a slight reduction in market engagement as indicated by a 1.12% decline in daily trading volume. It is worth noting that XLM still remains in the red zone on its weekly and monthly timeframes with losses of 5.94% and 27.28%, respectively suggesting larger bearish market control in recent times. For a bullish flag breakout to materialize, XLM traders must increase the current buying pressure and induce a higher trading volume.

41039001,https://invezz.com/?p=2595741,1740891958,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,XRP price prediction: Is Ripple a good buy in March?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/02/xrp-price-prediction-is-ripple-a-good-buy-in-march/,"The XRP price has moved from being one of the fourth quarter’s best-performing cryptocurrencies into a top laggard in 2025. Ripple has dropped from $3.42 in January this year to $2.2 as most cryptocurrencies dropped. This article explores whether the XRP price will recover after hitting the crucial support at $1.96 last week. XRP crashes despite crucial good news The ongoing XRP crash happened even though Ripple experienced some important good news. First, the XRP price plunge happened as the odds of a spot Ripple ETF jumped. Several companies like 21Shares, Canary, and Grayscale have all applied for a spot XRP ETF after seeing its popularity soar in the past few months. There is a likelihood that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the fund, a few months after it allowed the listings of a spot Ethereum fund. An XRP ETF approval will be a positive thing, albeit in the short term, as it will lead to more inflows. Second, XRP price has crashed as the XRP Ledger network sees some growth. It has started to witness more developer interest in the past few months. Some of the top tokens on the XRP Ledger network are Ripple USD (RLUSD), Sologenic, Crypto Trading Fund, Coreum, and XRP Army. The Crypto Trading Fund or CTF token price has soared by almost 20% in the last 7 days, while the RLUSD market cap jumped to $132 million. Its daily trading volume is usually more than $100 million, a sign that it has more demand. Third, there are rising odds that the SEC will end the litigation against Ripple Labs soon. It filed an appeal last year after Ripple secured a partial victory. This case stems in a 2020 lawsuit in which the SEC accused Ripple of selling unregistered securities. The overseeing judge said that XRP was not a security, but the company’s practice of selling the tokens to institutions was not right. She ordered Ripple to pay a $250 million fine, much lower than the $2 billion that the SEC wanted. The rising odds that the SEC will drop the Ripple charges are because of its recent decision to drop charges against other companies in the crypto industry like Gemini, Uniswap , and Coinbase. Read more: Coinbase says SEC set to drop enforcement case against the crypto exchange Why Ripple price crashed Therefore, there are three main reasons why the XRP price has crashed despite the good news in its ecosystem. First, XRP has plunged because of the ongoing softness in the crypto industry. Bitcoin and most altcoins have plunged this year, with the market cap of all coins falling to $2.7 trillion. Second, Ripple has crashed because of the ongoing state of fear in the crypto industry. The fear and greed index has moved to the extreme fear zone of 18. Crypto investors often remain in the sidelines when there is a sense of fear in the market. XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart by TradingView The XRP price has also plunged for technical reasons. For example, the coin has moved from the markup phase of the Wyckoff Theory into the distribution phase. This phase is characterized by investor pull and push and a lack of clear direction. Additionally, XRP has formed a head and shoulders chart pattern, a popular bearish sign in the market. This pattern comprises of a head, two shoulders, and a neckline. It has moved below the 50-day moving average. Therefore, the XRP price will likely continue falling as sellers target the 61.8% retracement level at $1.6215.

According to analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), the cryptocurrency is currently testing critical support levels while facing strong resistance, suggesting an impending breakout or breakdown. #XRP – Concept of Exhaustion in Bulls & Bears : #XRP Is Showing Strong Resilience! The price has dipped into the Blue Zone support 4-5 times, and each time, bulls have stepped in to defend it. This is a bullish signal, indicating that buy orders are stacked in this… pic.twitter.com/LeX0MkjRdF — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) February 28, 2025 The ongoing struggle between buyers and sellers shows some market exhaustion, where repeated support and resistance levels testings indicate potential trend shifts. XRP’s Resilience at Key Support Levels Since its rise in December 2024, the price of XRP has repeatedly tested a critical support zone highlighted by the analyst in blue. The asset has tested this zone four to five times, and each time, buyers have stepped in to defend this level, preventing further declines. This repeated defense is a bullish indicator, suggesting strong buy orders are present in this area. However, prolonged pressure on a support level can lead to exhaustion among buyers, making it increasingly vulnerable to a breakdown. EGRAG CRYPTO notes that the rule of repeated knocks applies to both support and resistance levels. The more frequently a level is tested, the greater the likelihood of an eventual breakout or breakdown. While XRP has demonstrated resilience , market participants’ continued attacks on the Blue Zone could weaken its ability to hold. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategic Attacks and Market Noise The analyst noted that market makers and large traders often employ a systematic approach to breaking strong support levels. By repeatedly testing these zones, they aim to exhaust bullish momentum, eventually forcing a move downward. The same strategy is applied at resistance levels, where persistent attempts to manipulate prices can wear down sellers. This dynamic is evident in XRP’s price movements, as bears apply pressure at lower price levels. From a broader perspective, the analyst considers the price range between $2.00 and $3.40 as market noise . This means that movements within this range do not necessarily indicate a strong directional trend. Instead, traders operate within this zone, executing short-term strategies while awaiting a decisive breakout or breakdown. Despite the fluctuations, key resistance levels remain intact, particularly at $3.40, which continues to cap bullish advances. EGRAG CRYPTO suggests that a successful break above this level would mark a significant shift in momentum for XRP. A potential bearish crossover of the 21-day EMA and 100-day MA could signal increased selling pressure. If XRP loses support, it may drop to $1.67. The asset is trading at $2.18, and for a bullish breakout, key resistance levels are $2.20, $2.30, $2.60, $2.83, and $3.10, with $3.40 being the most critical for a sustained rally.

The meme coin market never sleeps, and lately, Brett ($BRETT) and Floki Inu ($FLOKI) have been making waves in their respective ecosystems. Brett, the mascot of Base Chain, has gained an ever-growing community, while Floki Inu is expanding its DeFi offerings and NFT ecosystem. Both coins are rallying investor interest, but there’s another player stealing the show—BTFD Coin. Meme coins have evolved far beyond viral jokes. They now serve as serious investment vehicles, blending hype, community, and utility. That’s exactly what BTFD Coin ($BTFD) is doing with its presale, which has already surpassed $6.23 million. With 90% APY staking rewards, a strong Bulls community, and a projected moon price of $0.006 (a staggering 3,650% ROI potential), BTFD is proving itself as one of the top meme coins to invest in . Let’s dive into why this coin is turning heads. BTFD Coin’s 90% APY Staking Turns Meme Coin Investing Into Passive Wealth Picture this—you invest $5,000 in BTFD Coin during Stage 14 at $0.00016 per token. Once it hits the listing price of $0.0006, your investment skyrockets to $18,750—and that’s before staking rewards even come into play! Now, stack that with 90% APY, and suddenly, your passive earnings turn into an unstoppable wealth-building machine. By staking your tokens, you could earn an extra $4,500 in a year, making it one of the top meme coins to invest in for both price appreciation and passive income. The BTFD Coin presale is in full throttle, having skipped straight to Stage 14 after burning all unsold tokens from Stage 13. That means a tighter supply and higher demand, creating the perfect setup for a potential explosive price surge. With over 11,100 Bulls on board and 70 billion tokens already sold, this project is proving that it’s not just hype—it’s an investment with real momentum. How to Buy BTFD Coins? Buying BTFD is simple: Set up your MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load it with BNB or ETH. Connect your wallet to the presale page . Enter the amount and apply the LAUNCH100 bonus code for double tokens. Confirm the purchase and watch your investment grow. The 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100) is an absolute game-changer—every BTFD purchase during Stage 14 gets DOUBLED. That means if you buy $5,000 worth of BTFD, you actually receive $10,000 worth of tokens. But this insane offer won’t last forever. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a thriving Bulls community, BTFD Coin is setting a new standard among the top meme coins to invest in. The moon price of $0.006 is calling—will you answer, or will you be left chasing the next big opportunity? Brett Coin ($BRETT) Rallies as Base Chain’s Favorite Mascot Brett isn’t just a meme—it’s a cultural phenomenon. As the official mascot of Base Chain, $BRETT has become a community-driven powerhouse with a fixed 10 billion token supply. Recently, its market cap surged, fueled by increased activity on Base. The secret sauce? Brett’s meme status combined with strong network adoption. The Base Chain ecosystem is thriving, and $BRETT holders are seeing the benefits. Meme coin enthusiasts are flocking to Brett, seeing it as a Base-native alternative to Dogecoin and Pepe Coin. Brett’s limited supply and tight community engagement make it an attractive pick for those eyeing quick gains in the meme coin space. With transaction volumes spiking and Base Chain’s continued growth, Brett has positioned itself as a serious contender in the meme economy. Floki Inu ($FLOKI) Expands Its Utility With DeFi and NFT Growth Floki Inu started as just another Dogecoin-inspired meme, but it’s evolved into a full-fledged ecosystem. Between its Valhalla metaverse game, FlokiFi DeFi products, and Floki University educational platform, $FLOKI is now more than just a dog token. Recently, Floki Inu announced expanded staking options and liquidity pool integrations, strengthening its position in the DeFi sector. Investors have taken notice, and its trading volume has surged. Plus, with major adoption across exchanges and increased NFT game interest, Floki Inu is proving that meme coins don’t have to be just hype—they can have real utility. The Floki team’s strategic partnerships and innovative approach continue to drive its market expansion. As more investors look for meme coins with substance, Floki Inu is shaping up to be a long-term player in the space. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as a major opportunity among the top meme coins to invest in. With 90% APY staking, a presale that has already raised over $6.23 million, and a projected moon price of $0.006, this coin is making serious moves. The 100% LAUNCH100 bonus code is the cherry on top—offering double the tokens for every presale purchase. While Brett thrives as Base Chain’s mascot and Floki Inu builds a wider ecosystem, BTFD Coin is the only one offering high staking rewards and a 3650% ROI potential. The Bulls are charging ahead—but those who wait might miss the perfect dip to invest. The clock is ticking, and this price won’t last long. Secure your BTFD Coins before the presale ends and stake your way to massive gains. FAQs How does BTFD Coin’s staking work? BTFD Coin offers a 90% APY staking reward, meaning you earn extra tokens just for holding. Staking rewards are automatically distributed based on the number of BTFD tokens you stake. What is Brett Coin’s connection to Base Chain? Brett Coin ($BRETT) is the official mascot of Base Chain, with strong community support and a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens. It’s quickly gaining traction as Base Chain adoption increases. How is Floki Inu different from other meme coins? Floki Inu ($FLOKI) isn’t just a meme—it has a metaverse game (Valhalla), DeFi products (FlokiFi), and an education platform (Floki University), making it a well-rounded project in the meme coin space.

Bitcoin (BTC) price hit a $78K low before regaining back the $85K level, whereas altcoins mimicked the same volatile trend. Notably, the broader market volatility occurred due to macroeconomic heat and liquidity setbacks, urging a panic-selling sentiment among market participants. Mentioned below are some of this week’s top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape over the past week. Crypto Market Updates: Bitcoin & Altcoin Prices Ride Rollercoaster BTC price closes the week near the $85K level after touching a $78K low in the past seven days, as mentioned above. Further, Ethereum touched a $2100 level low this week. Solana saw a trading session at the $130 level. XRP price slipped to even lose $2 in the past seven days. Notably, the waning action comes against the backdrop of macro developments causing trade war tensions. U.S. President Donald Trump is set to forge ahead with new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and the EU. As a result, global markets took a hit, with even the crypto sector mirroring a slump. Moreover, CoinGape reported that the recent crypto market crash is also attributable to massive liquidations . The market saw over $1 billion in liquidations in just a day, with billions liquidated this week. Traders and investors further reflected a panic-selling sentiment amid massive liquidations. Nevertheless, BTC and altcoins showcased signs of recovery, with the flagship coin nearing $85K and ETH price closing the week near $2,200. Heightened Whale Activity Sparks Speculations Simultaneously, crypto whale activity rose substantially amid the recent market volatility, sparking market speculations. CoinGape reported that Dogecoin whales embarked on a massive buying spree amid DOGE price dip, signaling gains imminent. On the other hand, Solana whales also bought the recent dip, indicating price gains for the crypto looms. SOL whales’ also unstaked massive amounts amid the current volatility, adding a layer of intrigue among market participants. Also, Ethereum whales have taken on a buying spree, accumulating heavily amid the recent dip. Altogether, the massive accumulations signal renewed market interest in cryptocurrencies after the recent market turmoil. Traders and investors continue monitoring prices for further shifts.

As investors look more and more for quality opportunities in DeFi, this lending project is differentiated by its real-world utility and potential for long-term growth. With the current price still at $0.015 per token, early buyers are securing their positions before it reaches higher presale levels. Analysts further forecast Mutuum Finance could be among the spotlight projects for 2025 and thus is a possible market leader. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol that seeks to allow users to have complete ownership of their assets while exposing them to ways of earning passive income. Unlike traditional finance mechanisms that utilize intermediaries or banks, Mutuum Finance allows for lending crypto assets to sources of liquidity, the accrual of interest, and borrowing against an asset without having to sell. One of the most notable aspects of Mutuum Finance is its dual lending model consisting of peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. Using the P2C model, users are permitted to contribute assets to liquidity pools in exchange for competitive interest rates against market demand. At the same time, the P2P model facilitates direct lending agreements between lenders and borrowers to open borrowing possibilities to assets previously beyond ordinary liquidity pools, such as such novelty assets as meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) or Pepe (PEPE). Since over 150 million tokens have been sold, the presale for Mutuum Finance is full-steam ahead, having demonstrable demand from investors who are confident in its future outlook. The current price of $0.015 per MUTM offers early buyers the chance to secure their positions before the token advances to later presale phases. A total of 11 phases are planned, with the price gradually increasing to $0.06 at launch, ensuring that early investors benefit from lower entry costs and higher potential returns. The price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will further appreciate upon its launch, driven by increasing demand and significant developments as outlined in its roadmap. According to the team, a beta version of the platform will also be launched simultaneously with the launch of the token’s exchange, which will allow users to experiment with its decentralized lending and borrowing feature in real-time. This rollout is expected to attract more participants, boosting token utility and driving market demand. As more users engage with the platform, interest in MUTM’s lending pools, passive income features, and borrowing options will naturally increase, pushing its value higher in the post-launch phase. Experts believe that Mutuum Finance could be one of the biggest DeFi projects in 2025, as its structured lending system, passive income generation, and sustainable token model create consistent demand and price growth. With the team also developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be pegged to the US dollar and launched on the Ethereum network, the project is further strengthening its ecosystem and increasing utility for its token holders. Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects in the DeFi space, attracting both retail and institutional investors looking for long-term growth rather than short-term speculation. Its real-world financial applications, structured financial model, and passive income opportunities make it a compelling investment before the presale phases end. As the crypto market shifts toward utility-driven projects, many investors are positioning themselves early, recognizing the potential of a token designed to thrive in both bull and bear markets. With strong fundamentals, an active community, and a fast-selling presale, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be a major player in 2025.

Currently priced at $0.015, early supporters view it as a strategic entry point before an anticipated price surge once it launches on exchanges. Why Consider Holding Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance stands out in the DeFi sector by focusing on more than speculative gains. Its presale—already surpassing $1.8 million—prices each token at $0.015 in its second phase. Over 11 planned presale phases, the token will climb to $0.06 at launch, giving early buyers a chance to secure tokens at lower costs before listings on major exchanges. Initial presale performance was strong, selling 110 million tokens in under two weeks. Now in Phase 2, the project has sold over 40% of that allocation, stoking fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors. Each additional stage includes a price bump, so many see early participation as a path to maximize potential gains. Beyond near-term profits, experts believe MUTM offers a long-term option that could reap substantial rewards. Some forecasts suggest an initial 1,500% jump post-listing, with a price target of $4–$5 by mid-2025. These projections stem from Mutuum Finance’s core financial use cases, its demand-driven tokenomics, and robust passive income features, painting a picture of a token better suited to long-term holding than quick flips. A Practical and Transparent Lending Model Mutuum Finance enables users to deposit digital assets into liquidity pools to earn interest according to market demand. Lenders get mtTokens, representing their stake, which appreciate over time. Borrowers, meanwhile, can gain access to liquidity while keeping their crypto holdings. This offers a balanced ecosystem where both lenders and borrowers benefit. Two primary lending options are available: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) : Lenders contribute assets to pooled liquidity, earning interest based on usage. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) : Users can discuss and set loan terms directly, thereby expanding loan possibilities to more speculative tokens (like DOGE, PEPE, or SHIB) often absent from mainstream lending platforms. With these choices, holders can effortlessly earn passive yields by supplying their crypto holdings. This adaptability may appeal to a range of investor profiles, from large institutions to individual traders. Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism for Sustained Demand One element that sets Mutuum Finance apart is its buy-and-distribute approach. A portion of the platform’s revenue is allocated to repurchasing MUTM tokens, which are then shared with mtToken holders. This model consistently drives buy pressure, potentially lifting token demand while mitigating sell pressure—helping to ensure meaningful, enduring price support for MUTM. As the presale continues and the project nears its official launch, more investors are identifying MUTM’s potential. Observers anticipate a quick price spike once the token lists on exchanges. Additionally, a beta version of the platform set to launch concurrently with the token should stoke further demand. Given its steady financial model, built-in yield features, and a surging holder base, Mutuum Finance stands out as a noteworthy DeFi project in 2025. For those seeking a long-term crypto investment, holding MUTM might prove to be a highly worthwhile decision.

Bitcoin price has moved from last week’s low of $75,000 to over $85,000. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has moved to $2.8 trillion, while crypto fear and greed index has dropped to the extreme fear zone. This article explores the top forecast of coins like Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), Grass token (GRASS), and Binance Coin (BNB). Hedera Hashgraph price analysis HBAR price chart by TradingView The HBAR price dropped and bottomed at $0.1816 last week as demand for the token surged and other altcoins fell. This was a crucial level since it was the lowest swing on February 3rd, and the highest swing in April last year. HBAR price has formed a small double-bottom pattern at $0.1816. It has moved above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It has formed a break and retest pattern at $0.1816, a positive sign in the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), MACD, and the Stochastic Oscillator have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the Hedera Hashgraph price will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance point at $0.30. Hedera’s recent surge is mostly because the network partnered with Swift, an association of global banks that handles trillions of dollars a year. Swift will use Hedera as its main blockchain network for its payments.

BNB price has now plunged to low of $608, down by about 25% from the highest level in 2024. The coin remains above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swing since January last year. The Binance coin has remained slightly below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. It has moved to the bottom if trading range of the Murrey Math Lines at $593. The Average Directional Index (ADX) has risen slightly upwards to 22. The BNB coin price has formed a double-bottom pattern at $562, and the neckline at $735. A double-bottom is one of the most bullish patterns in the market. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the coming months. Such a move will point to more upside, with the next price to watch being at $735, up by about 20% from the current level. A drop below the key support at $560 will invalidate the bullish view.

The GRASS token price has jumped from a low of $0.9060 in February this year, as the daily data scrapped moved to over 1 billion. Grass price has moved above the key resistance level at $2.2717, its highest swing on February 22nd. It has moved above the 50-period moving average, while the Average Directional Index (ADX) has moved to 36, the highest swing on February 15. The coin has invalidated the double-top pattern. Grass price has moved to the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, the Grass price will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance at $2.8615, the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement point.

In a recent post on X, SMQKE emphasized that the necessary systems, licenses, and legal structures are already in place, allowing major banks to integrate XRP into their operations. Ripple is currently allowed to LEGALLY OFFER cross-border payment services using XRP and its RLUSD stablecoin through its over 50 licenses, including those in strict regulatory environments like New York and Texas. These licenses enable banks such as Bank of America and… https://t.co/IhqxQqUdS3 pic.twitter.com/tSR0b6gT7s — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) February 26, 2025 Regulatory Milestones Strengthen XRP’s Position SMQKE noted that Ripple has secured over 50 Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) across the U.S., including approvals in highly regulated states such as New York and Texas. These licenses give Ripple the legal authority to facilitate payment services using XRP and RLUSD, its newly launched stablecoin . This regulatory framework is crucial for financial institutions looking to integrate XRP into their payment networks. Ripple has eliminated many legal uncertainties that previously hindered institutional adoption by securing compliance with U.S. financial laws. This progress significantly strengthens XRP’s position as a viable asset for cross-border transactions. Institutional Adoption Gaining Traction SMQKE’s analysis suggests that with these regulatory approvals in place, major banks, including Bank of America and Santander, are now in a position to utilize XRP for international payments. The infrastructure required for institutional use is already established, making it easier for financial entities to adopt XRP without legal complications. Public discussion around XRP’s institutional use has intensified following comments from David Stryzewski of Sound Planning Group. During a televised segment, Stryzewski claimed that Bank of America runs 100% of its internal transactions using XRP . While this claim remains unverified, it has fueled speculation about the extent of XRP’s adoption by major financial players.

The company now holds 55 global licenses spanning 33 states, reinforcing its ability to operate within regulatory frameworks. Ripple’s growth is also reflected in its transaction volumes. In Q4 of 2024, the company processed $70 billion in payments. It is also actively increasing its U.S. workforce and expanding the issuance of RLUSD on the XRP Ledger. XRP Struggles Amid Institutional Growth Despite these regulatory and institutional advancements, some investors remain concerned about XRP’s performance. One user questioned why XRP’s price has not seen significant gains, despite institutional interest. XRP is trading at $2.19, after multiple significant drops during the week, and SMQKE addressed these concerns by pointing to XRP’s historical performance. He noted that XRP has surged tenfold from $0.30 to $3.30. Moreover, despite recent declines, XRP has posted a one-year gain of 247%, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum.

This price movement is largely driven by an increase in spot buying and leveraged long positions. Despite the bullish momentum, some analysts warn that further downside risks still exist, and the market may not have found its true bottom yet. Spot and Margin Longs Drive Price Recovery One of the key factors behind Bitcoin’s price recovery has been the surge in spot market demand. Large bids have been placed on major exchanges, signaling strong buying interest at these levels. Additionally, traders using margin and leveraged positions have contributed to the upward movement. This dynamic has resulted in a temporary shift in momentum, giving Bitcoin the support it needed to bounce back from its previous losses. Caution as Market Conditions Remain Uncertain Despite the recent gains, some market participants remain cautious. Many traders believe this recovery could be an oversold bounce rather than the beginning of a sustained rally. If buyers fail to maintain control and selling pressure returns, Bitcoin could revisit lower support levels. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments continue to influence investor sentiment. Any negative news could trigger another wave of selling, leading to further price corrections. Technical Indicators and Market Structure Bitcoin’s technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the recent rebound has pushed prices higher, the overall trend remains uncertain. The market has yet to establish a clear higher high on the daily timeframe, which would be necessary to confirm a bullish reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed from oversold levels, suggesting that selling pressure has eased for now. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold above key support zones, another downward move could be on the horizon. What’s Next for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s price action has improved in the short term, the broader market trend remains uncertain. If buying pressure continues, the cryptocurrency could attempt to consolidate above key levels, paving the way for further gains. On the other hand, if Bitcoin struggles to maintain its momentum, traders should prepare for potential retests of lower support zones. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether this recovery is the beginning of a new uptrend or just a temporary relief rally in a broader correction phase.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-02 06:34:40

There’s growing speculation that prices are about to move, and many experts believe that Pi Coin is on the verge of a major price surge. However, Pi has seen a dramatic drop after a huge price surge. Currently priced at $1.79, it’s down 40% from its peak of $2.90 and has crashed more than 22% in the last 24 hours. Despite the sharp decline, there’s speculation around future developments such as the upcoming mainnet launch, KYC unlocks, and potential exchange listings like Binance or Coinbase. If Pi can reclaim $2.20 , there’s potential for a bounce to $2.80+, but a drop below $1.50 could lead to further declines. Whale Accumulation: A Strong Indicator Whale accumulation is a key factor that suggests Pi Coin’s price may be on the verge of a breakout. Recent on-chain data shows that large holders (whales) are quietly accumulating Pi Coin in significant amounts. When whales buy up an asset, it often signals their confidence in the future price. Historically, this kind of accumulation precedes a price surge, as these investors are preparing to sell at higher prices in the future. Whale activity also helps boost market sentiment. When large investors show confidence in Pi Coin, it can create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) among retail investors, which drives prices even higher. Bitcoin’s Influence on the Market Bitcoin’s price movements often set the tone for the entire cryptocurrency market. If Bitcoin shows strength, it can pull altcoins like Pi Coin upward as well. With Bitcoin currently showing positive momentum, there’s a strong possibility that Pi Coin will follow suit. The combination of Bitcoin’s strength and Pi’s growing ecosystem creates the perfect conditions for a price surge.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-02 06:40:36

Large holders, those with between 1 million to 10 million XRP and 10 million to 100 million XRP, collectively acquired approximately 440 million XRP, valued at nearly $1 billion. This surge in accumulation suggests strategic positioning, possibly in anticipation of future price movements. Xaif shared a chart showing the whale activity, and pointed out that “whales have been buying the dip heavily since the market crashed.” This trend is not unusual in cryptocurrency markets, where large investors often accumulate assets following price corrections. BREAKING Whales bought $1 Billion #XRP XRP whales have been buying the dip heavily since the market crashed.

Historically, similar whale activity has preceded upward price movements. A comparable accumulation event occurred in early February after another market dip, reinforcing the pattern of large investors increasing their holdings during lower prices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Reports at the time revealed that 53 wallets holding over 1 million XRP were added overnight. Such an increase in large holders suggests a growing confidence among institutional or high-net-worth investors in the digital asset’s long-term potential, and the recent accumulation suggests something big is coming. Recent Whale Movements and Ecosystem Activity Beyond accumulation, there is evidence that whales actively move XRP within the ecosystem. A recent report highlighted a single whale transaction involving 65 million XRP . Such large transfers can indicate several possibilities, including strategic positioning for future liquidity events, institutional investments, or preparations for major market developments. While whale accumulation alone does not guarantee an immediate price increase, it often signals confidence from those with the most skin in the game. This pattern suggests that these significant market players are positioning themselves ahead of a potential shift in the digital asset’s market trajectory. What’s Next for XRP? The sustained accumulation of XRP by whales suggests that these investors anticipate favorable market conditions. Whether this translates into a price surge remains uncertain, but historical trends indicate that large-scale accumulation often precedes bullish movements. XRP is trading at $2.15, showing a slight 0.79% increase over the past 24 hours, and investors will be watching closely to see if these whales were right to accumulate tokens.

The analyst has issued a warning about the upcoming Tether (USDT) delisting, which will affect some cryptocurrency exchanges within the European Union. As it is known, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken will delist USDT, EURT, PYUSD, UST and TUSD stablecoins in the European Economic Area in accordance with MiCA rules, and users in this region will no longer be able to buy or sell these assets on the exchange. Starting from February 27, trading for these stablecoins on the exchange has switched to sell-only mode, and from March 31, all other stablecoins will be automatically converted to USDC. According to il Capo, although this situation is limited to Europe for now, the pressure on stablecoins could increase globally in 2025. According to the analyst, in such a scenario, USDT could face even more difficulties.

The 14th stage of BTFD’s presale is over 98% complete, and if you wait too long, you’ll watch its current $0.00016 price vanish before your eyes. BTFD isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a staking beast, boasting a 90% APY that turns passive holders into wealth-builders. Early buyers are staring at a 275% ROI when the presale ends at $0.0006, but that’s just the beginning. Analysts predict BTFD’s moonshot could hit $0.006, delivering a 3650% ROI. Miss this? You’ll be watching the best coin presale from the sidelines—again. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Best Coin Presale to Buy Before the Bull Run Begins Crypto isn’t just about hype—it’s about getting in at the right time. BTFD embodies the ultimate trading mantra: Buy The Dip . Unlike the pump-and-dump meme coins that fade into irrelevance, BTFD is a utility-driven powerhouse with a thriving ecosystem. Right now, the BTFD presale is the best entry point, offering ground-floor access before it explodes onto exchanges. It launched at $0.000004 per coin and now sits at $0.00016, yet presale investors will still lock in a 275% profit at launch. But why settle for that when the $0.006 moon price could turn a mere $8,500 investment into $318,750? Beyond just price speculation, BTFD’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game went live on January 1, 2025, allowing users to earn while they play. And then there’s staking—crypto’s golden goose. While most projects offer meager returns, BTFD cranks it up with a massive 90% APY, turning passive holdings into exponential gains. If that wasn’t enough, BTFD is a community-first project, with its Bulls Squad leading the charge. It’s built on Ethereum, ensuring security, liquidity, and long-term growth. The tokenomics are designed to reward early investors, with liquidity locked and staking incentives fueling sustained price appreciation. Earn More with BTFD’s Referral Program BTFD isn’t just about investing—it’s about bringing your circle into the profit zone with its lucrative referral program. Simply connect your wallet on the BTFD presale site to get a unique referral code, share it with friends, and start earning. When someone spends at least $50, they get 10% extra BTFD, while you earn 10% of their purchase. If you rank among the top 20 referrers, expect even bigger bonuses. This is the best coin presale to buy if you want to multiply your holdings before BTFD hits exchanges! Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Millionaire Maker You Missed Rewind to April 2023, when PEPE launched at an absurdly low price. Investors who threw in a couple of hundred bucks watched their portfolios balloon into six and seven figures within months. PEPE was brushed off as “just another meme coin,” but those who recognized its potential are now laughing all the way to the bank. PEPE’s meteoric rise wasn’t just hype—it was strategic timing. It launched in a meme-driven bull market, fueled by community excitement and viral traction. Back then, early believers snagged millions of PEPE tokens for mere pennies. Fast forward, and PEPE surged to an all-time high of $0.00000431, making many overnight millionaires. But if you think you can ride PEPE to similar gains again, think twice. Its days of 10,000% gains are in the past, and its massive market cap makes another explosive pump unlikely. While PEPE remains relevant, it’s not the next millionaire-maker. That’s why BTFD Coin is a real opportunity. It’s sitting at the same early stage PEPE once was but with far more lucrative staking rewards, an active ecosystem, and an engaged community. The biggest gains are always at the presale level—and this time, you’re here before the explosion. The Clock is Ticking—BTFD’s 3650% ROI Won’t Wait! Opportunities like this don’t knock twice. BTFD is the best coin presale to buy right now , and Stage 14 is nearly sold out. With over $6.21 million raised and more than 11,100 investors already in, the time to act is now. At $0.00016 per coin, it’s still dirt cheap—but when it launches at $0.0006, you’ll wish you grabbed more. And when it hits the predicted $0.006 moon price, you’ll either be counting your gains or watching from the sidelines—again. Don’t miss your second chance at a millionaire-making meme coin.

His recent post on X, accompanied by a technical chart, suggests that XLM may be positioned for a 330% breakout if the pattern plays out as expected. At the time of his analysis, XLM was trading at $0.30267. Based on this, a breakout of 330% would bring the price to approximately $1.3, pushing it above its all-time high of $0.9381. The chart illustrates a downward-sloping channel following a strong rally, a structure that fits the definition of a bullish flag—a continuation pattern often signaling further upward movement after consolidation. #Stellar $XLM is forming a bullish flag, which could trigger a 330% breakout! pic.twitter.com/hWuQSTkUj0 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 1, 2025 Technical Factors Supporting the Pattern The chart shared by Martinez highlights several technical indicators that reinforce this outlook. Fibonacci retracement levels suggest that XLM has been respecting key price zones, with the 0.618 retracement level around $0.30 acting as strong support. This level has historically been an accumulation zone for assets preparing for another move upward. If XLM maintains support here, it could build momentum for a breakout above the flag’s upper boundary near $0.42. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Martinez recently drew attention to a TD Sequential Indicator buy signal for XLM , arguing that the asset may be gearing up for a strong move. The report discusses how this indicator has historically preceded price increases, adding weight to the current technical setup. If the bullish flag plays out, the projected breakout target is calculated by applying the flagpole’s length to the breakout point. While Martinez predicts a 330% increase, the chart shows that this rally can extend as far as $1.8, almost doubling its all-time high. However, confirmation will be needed in increased volume and a decisive close above resistance levels. The Bullish Outlook for XLM The outlook for XLM is not solely reliant on technical patterns. A popular XRP proponent recently explained why the crypto world should not write off XLM . With historical ties with Ripple and potential involvement with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, XLM could become an even more notable player in the crypto space. Martinez’s analysis of XLM presents a compelling case for a potential breakout, with price targets reaching as high as $1.8. The bullish flag pattern with strong support at key Fibonacci levels, points toward a continuation of the previous uptrend.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Dogecoin struggles, Yeti Ouro emerges as a robust GameFi contender, capturing investors’ attention. Table of Contents Dogecoin price analysis YETIO: The GameFi contender The crypto market is bleeding after a series of adverse macroeconomic factors struck. Dogecoin (DOGE) and other meme coins have been the worst affected, but coins like Yeti Ouro (YETIO) could be the only silver lining. Yeti Ouro is a Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming meme coin still in its presale, creating waves in the crypto scene. Dogecoin price analysis Dogecoin has lost 36.81% of its value over the past month, currently trading at $0.21. December 2024 was a blast for the meme coin. However, all through 2025, Dogecoin has struggled to maintain its value. The Dogecoin price has hit its lowest in three months and continues to face resistance. Dogecoin reflects the larger market sentiment and often mimics Bitcoin’s price movements. A near-term respite seems unlikely, with Doge testing 50-week EMA as the critical support level. The sharp decline is obvious as Doge and most other meme coins drive their prices from hype and market momentum rather than any utility-driven price jumps. Metric-wise, overall transaction volume has dropped, while transactions exceeding $1 million have also seen a decline in February. Doge’s open interest also fell to $2.21 billion from $5.42 billion last month. You might also like: ETH volatility creates entry points for investors; Yeti Ouro gains whale attraction YETIO: The GameFi contender There’s so much to know about Yeti Ouro beyond the Yeti meme it is inspired by. Here’s why Yeti Ouro is the new GameFi idol. The power-packed Yeti Go game Yeti Ouro is redefining the Play-to-Earn gaming sector with Yeti Go, a high-octane game driven by multi-player performances, high-quality graphics, and audio from Grammy-award-winning musicians. Yeti Ouro is a racing game developed for high-octane gamers. It will give an adrenaline rush while rewarding wallets with the gold rush from in-game rewards. 15% of the total YETIO token supply is reserved strictly for game rewards. The game is built on the Unreal 5 Engine and being developed by industry-leading creators behind hit titles such as Spiderman, Call of Duty, The Witcher, and Dead Space, featuring AAA-quality graphics. Its audio is expertly produced by top sound engineers who have collaborated with Grammy-winning artists like Major Lazer, Kabaka Pyramid, and Vybz Kartel. Robust ergonomics and economics Yeti Ouro is based on Ethereum and shares its resilience and robustness. Its smart contract code is audited by SOLIDProof. This audit refurbishes asset protection and data security on the platform. The token supply is limited to 1 billion, and 50% of this supply goes to the immediate community as a part of the presale. YETIO’s 5% supply will undergo a burn with every transaction to keep inflationary pressures at ease. A presale that has doubled investments before listing Yeti Ouro’s presale has been highly successful so far. It has entered its third stage, with investors having bought over 201 million YETIO tokens and approximately $3 million in funds raised so far. Owing to the investors’ high demand and confidence, the YETIO token’s price rose to $0.024, with further price increases expected. Purchases are currently receiving a 10% bonus with an additional 5% for purchases over $500. The early investors have earned 100% ROI even before YETIO’s listing, reiterating the fact that it remains highly undervalued with great upside potential. Some experts suggest that YETIO could see a 600x growth in the coming months. For more information on Yeti Ouro, visit the website , X , Telegram , or Discord .

The focus of this investigation is if financial institutions were forced to avoid digital assets which could be hindering innovation and restricting people’s and businesses’ access to banking services. The FDIC’s new acting chairman, Travis Hill, has expressed worries that the agency under President Biden took an antagonistic view of banks trying to offer cryptocurrency services. A possible reason for this is reports of some businesses and individuals allegedly being debanked on account of their alleged involvement in crypto—which raised alarms over perceived overreach on the part of regulators. Comer has requested unredacted FDIC documents pertaining to its communication with banks Earlier in February, the FDIC released redacted versions of documents on their interactions with banks. 64 of those documents revealed the agency‘s correspondence with the 24 banks that received pause letters, and 111 documents showed FDIC correspondence and records on crypto-related activities of other regulated institutions. However, Chairman James Comer of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has insisted that full document disclosure is necessary to better understand the situation. He has already requested access to the FDIC’s uncensored records, hoping to see why the FDIC told banks to hold off on their crypto projects. He’s also reached out to some tech leaders in the crypto space, asking them to divulge their debanking stories and experience with the FDIC. First Lady Melania Trump are also alleged to have been unlawfully debanked for their crypto ties, and the Oversight Committee is also investigating her case as well. As for now, Chairman Comer has claimed that they have to know if the federal regulators threatened the banks to drop their crypto activities, and therefore, their investigations are important. He noted that the Committee is concerned about government regulators overreaching and arbitrarily suppressing industries they deem unfavorable. This has impacted business operations by restricting access to cash for payroll and driving technological and financial innovation overseas. Caitlin Long claims Trump’s administration has not addressed the debanking issues While Trump’s administration has maintained a pro-crypto stance from the start, Custodia Bank’s CEO Caitlin long feels that the administration has not done anything to address the debanking complications. She said that the problem is that banks are still afraid that crypto is a dangerous place to invest, and the president has not tried to make them change their minds. Caitlin Long speaking at ETHDenver in Denver, Colorado on Feb. 28. Source ETHDenver. She has, however, called for Trump’s administration to appoint another FDIC lead. Long said that the FDIC has only dragged down the banking system by refusing to accept technological alterations for over a decade under Martin Gruenberg’s leadership. She, however, appreciated the government’s efforts to make the Securities and Exchanges Commission more crypto-friendly and hopes the same can be done to banking regulations. She also wants the county to approve the stablecoin legislation, which will institute more consumer protection measures, including requiring banks to maintain their cash reserves to strengthen stablecoin liquidity. The FDIC inquiry may be a pacesetter for the future of US crypto regulation. The oversight committee could make some serious changes if they find substantiated evidence that banks were pressured down a wrong road, including repealing clauses preventing financial institutions from banking with crypto firms. On the other hand, if the investigation concludes that the FDIC acted within its mandate, it could further entrench skepticism toward crypto in the banking sector.",OP-ED|ETH|FDIC|USD,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ETH|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-02 07:45:29

Ethereum Price Analysis,https://cryptopotato.com/will-eth-stabilize-after-a-20-weekly-crash-ethereum-price-analysis/,"Ethereum has been experiencing a wild crash over the last few days, breaking below several significant support levels. Investors are now wondering when this downtrend will end. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the asset has been dropping rapidly since breaking below the 200-day moving average, located around the $2,900 mark. The $2,700 and $2,350 levels are also broken to the downside, as the price is currently testing the $2,100 support zone. If this level also gets broken to the downside, a deeper decline toward the $1,750 level could be expected in the coming months. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour chart, things are not looking good at all for ETH, as the asset has been making lower highs and lows consistently over the last couple of months. Currently, the $2,100 support level is holding the price. A temporary recovery could be probable if ETH breaks above the $2,400 level. However, if the $2,100 area is also lost, a much worse drop would be likely for Ethereum. Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Open Interest Many analysts and investors are blaming the futures market for Ethereum’s massive crash over the recent weeks. However, analyzing the open interest metric indicates this might not be the case this time. This chart demonstrates the open interest metric, which measures the number of open futures contracts. As the chart suggests, while the price has experienced a significant drop, the open interest is not declining as it should be and is still lagging. This indicates that the recent price action is not totally due to long liquidation cascades, and most of the selling pressure comes from the spot market. Also, it warns investors that things could get much worse in case a much bigger liquidation event occurs. The post Will ETH Stabilize After a 20% Weekly Crash?

According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, RUNE is likely far from a market recovery following a bearish flag pattern on its trading chart. Related Reading: Altcoin Transaction King? TRON Hits 42% Share As USDT, DeFi Explode RUNE Chart Hints At Major Sell-Off Ahead – Details In technical analysis, a bearish flag is a continuation pattern formed after a significant downtrend, followed by a period of consolidation, before another leg downward. This pattern is characterized by parallel or slightly supporting ascending levels thereby giving the shape of a flag. Based on an analysis by Martinez, a bearish flag has now appeared on the RUNE/USDT 12-hour trading chart following its recent consolidation pattern which came after the asset’s decline from mid-January to early February. Interestingly, RUNE has now broken below the lower boundary of the bearish flag at $1.27 reducing any immediate odds of a bullish price reversal. Unless investors can force a price reclaim of this lower boundary, Martinez’s prediction states RUNE could be headed for a price target of $0.38 representing a potential 69% decline on the asset’s current price. Lately, the RUNE market has seen a significant amount of unwanted developments. Aside from its obvious market woes, recent events in the THORChain community have cast more concerns over the asset. In the past week, one of THORChain’s developers nicknamed Pluto(9r) resigned from the decentralized exchange after a controversial decision involving transactions from North Korea. Notably, a vote by Pluto(9r) and two other validators to halt the Ethereum Network from running on THORChain to prevent transactions by North Korean hackers was quickly overturned by other network validators resulting in the resignation of the former. This development comes following the $1.5 billion hack of the Bybit exchange which has so far been linked to popular North Korean Lazarus Group. According to blockchain tracker, Lookonchain, the Bybit hacker laundered $605 million (54%) of the loot using the THORChain network.

As earlier stated, bearish forces are largely dominant in this asset market as evidenced by the 46.67% overall decline in the past 30 days. Interestingly, the crypto prediction site Coincodex presents an optimistic stance on the RUNE market. Their latest forecasts show a price recovery to $1.40 in 30 days and $1.66 in the next six months.

While Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) grapple with market volatility, BitLemons ($BLEM) emerges as the ultimate disruptor, bringing unprecedented excitement to the $450 billion gaming casino market. With institutional investors quietly positioning themselves, the question isn’t just about survival but who will dominate the next crypto revolution. Can BitLemons Rewrite the Crypto Playbook While Others Falter? BitLemons is more than just another crypto project—it’s a fully operational crypto casino platform generating revenue 24/7. Backed by a groundbreaking $1 million seed round and fortified with dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof, this platform offers a unique value proposition that sets it apart from traditional cryptocurrencies. The platform boasts an impressive arsenal of over 8,000 games from industry giants like Evolution and Pragmatic, implementing a game-changing 30% Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) allocation model. With 15% dedicated to token buyback and burn and another 15% allocated to staking rewards, BitLemons creates a sustainable ecosystem that benefits investors directly. Its presale performance tells a compelling story of rapid growth. Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days, with current Stage 2 tokens priced at a mere $0.02—and rumors circulating of a potential listing price between 17-18 cents. This isn’t just an investment opportunity; it’s an invitation to be part of a blockchain gaming revolution generating revenue. Solana’s Rollercoaster: CME Futures Launch Amidst Price Volatility Solana finds itself at a critical juncture, now trading at $149.30, recovering from a recent downturn with a 7-day decline of 12.64%. With a current market cap of $75.71B (up 16.12%) and a 24-hour trading volume of $7.35B (surging 81.82%), SOL is experiencing significant volatility but showing signs of recovery. In a major development, CME Group announced on Friday that it will introduce Solana futures on March 17, pending regulatory approval. U.S. traders will soon be able to access both micro-sized contracts of 25 SOL and larger-sized contracts of 500 SOL, potentially bringing more institutional interest to the asset. Despite this positive news, the blockchain’s recent performance challenges have some investors questioning its long-term stability, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty that smart money is using as an opportunity to explore more innovative platforms. Cardano’s Uphill Battle: Will ADA Find Its Footing? Cardano continues its uphill battle, currently priced at $0.6437, representing a significant 16.44% drop over the past week. With a market cap of $22.66B (up 4.45% in 24 hours) and a 24-hour trading volume of $1B (up 35.09%), ADA faces substantial market pressure. The total supply stands at 44.99B ADA out of a maximum 45B ADA, with 35.21B currently in circulation. While the recent Grayscale ETF filing offers hope, investors are looking for more than just potential—they’re seeking guaranteed value and stability in their investments. The Ultimate Crypto Opportunity: Are You Ready? While traditional cryptocurrencies struggle with market volatility, BitLemons shines as a beacon of innovation and potential. The platform isn’t just promising future returns—it’s delivering actual value right now. With a fully operational platform generating 24/7 revenue and a strategic approach to tokenomics, BitLemons is building an empire where others are merely weathering market storms. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, one critical question remains: Can you afford to miss the most promising investment opportunity of 2025? BitLemons isn’t just changing the game—it’s creating a new playing field. This is your moment to be part of a true crypto revolution.

Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 657,500 followers on the social media platform X that it is within the realm of possibility for BTC to repeat its 2021 mid-bull cycle collapse when it lost over 50% of its value in just three months. While Bitcoin eventually recovered all losses by November 2021, BTC failed to mount rallies above $69,000 before abruptly ending its bull market. If Bitcoin follows in the footsteps of its 2021 bull cycle, it would suggest that BTC will recover after a 50% drawdown and put in a new all-time high at slightly above $110,000 before giving up most of its gains as it enters bear territory. “To me, worst case [is] we’re here in the cycle. Excited to see how it plays out.” Source: DonAlt/X Alternatively, DonAlt says the best-case scenario for Bitcoin is that it moves away from its halving-based four-year cycle. Bitcoin’s halving is an event that slashes BTC miner reward in half, triggering an imbalance between supply and demand that has previously coincided with rallies. Without a four-year cycle, DonAlt appears to suggest that BTC will witness a steady uptrend without the need to time market tops and avoid brutal bear winters. “This cycle is so chill. Just take it easy. If the market is up? Great you make money. If the market is down? It is what it is, maybe it will go up again. Prior cycles were a constant struggle having to sell tops and bottoms, for this one, I’ve just chosen blissful complacency.” Looking at Bitcoin’s current state, the analyst says it is possible for Bitcoin to recover support at $90,000 before this week expires as BTC continues to bounce after briefly trading below $80,000. “No way they can push it back above $90,000 before the weekly close, right?” Source: DonAlt/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $86,351, up over 2% on the day.

Many altcoins have produced impressive gains over the past few days, and XLM stands in a league of its own with a surge past $0.3. BTC Calms at $86K A lot can and has been said about the events that transpired in the cryptocurrency market in the past week. Recall that BTC stood close to $100,000 on February 21, which was rejected and pushed down to $96,000 the previous weekend. However, the actual pain started on Tuesday morning with a drop to $86,000. After a minor recovery to $89,000, the cryptocurrency dumped once again to $82,000. The scenario repeated once again on Thursday, with a bounce-off to $86,000, and on Friday morning, with a massive price crash to $78,000. This became bitcoin’s lowest price tag in over three months. While many, including Arthur Hayes, predicted an even more painful performance during the weekend, BTC’s price actually reacted well to the latest massacre and now sits about eight grand higher. Its market capitalization has managed to defend the $1.7 trillion level, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 58% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XLM on a Roll The altcoins were hit the hardest during the days-long correction, but most have recovered some ground since Friday. XRP continues with its gradual ascent and now stands close to $2.3 after another 5% increase since yesterday. ADA has defended the $0.6 support and now trades above $0.65. SOL, BNB, DOGE, LINK, and SIU are also with minor gains, while XLM has soared by 7.5% in the past day and almost 30% since Friday’s low to over $0.32, In contrast, ETH, LTC, and TRX have charted insignificant losses over the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the total crypto market cap is more than $250 billion higher than the low on Friday. However, it’s still under the $3 trillion mark on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Analyzing 2 Altcoins To Buy In This Red Market,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-rebound-or-new-bull-run-analyzing-2-altcoins-to-buy-in-this-red-market/,"In the past seven days Ethereum (ETH) fell more than 15% in value and dropped below $2,500 because users panicked after Bybit experienced a $1.5 billion security vulnerability. The Wyckoff Accumulation Pattern can potentially create an ETH price recovery to $8,000 if investors are able to maintain ETH above $2,000 according to technical charts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to ignore market pessimism by securing $2 million in presales from 3,800 investors who bought tokens at $0.015 before awaiting its upcoming price increase. MUTM offers investors protection against market uncertainties through its defined token structure and successful presale operation which leads to an initial 400% value rise at launch and expected growth of up to 66,500% after the listing. Ethereum’s Precarious Position The Ethereum market faces its most substantial price drop of recent times as it sinks below $2,290 because of bearish market conditions. The Bybit exploit caused market fragmentation that rid investors of their confidence while negative MACD signals signaled the prolonged bearish market trend. ETH must pass or fail a vital assessment at the $2,000 support area as this region represents a turning point between recovery and a descent to $1,750. The Wyckoff pattern presents a potential opportunity because historical price accumulation patterns underwent rallies to $8,000 when Ethereum rose above $2,000 support level. Stochastic RSI indicators display the same bearish conditions that preceded previous market rebounds which suggest a forthcoming price recovery. The price targets at $2,500 and $4,250 present formidable obstacles which traders must overcome to confirm their positive market predictions. ETH’s potential revenue stream continues as a transformative risk for investors who must weigh analytical potential against risk factors from security weaknesses and macroeconomic challenges. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leveraging the Ethereum uncertainty to speed up through its second presale phase before the upcoming 33.3% price boost. Earliest purchasers of MUTM fulfillment at $0.015 will enjoy immediate gains when stage two begins at $0.02 before the final listing at $0.06 delivers 300% rewards. The project attracted $2 million from investors through its innovative token buyback system combined with the special lending model which raises long-term market demand. Phase one reached full capacity quickly which triggered a sense of urgency since available tokens numbers are decreasing rapidly. ETH’s volatile nature drives investors to subscribe to MUTM’s presale because of its fixed price allocations and resistant to market speculations. The roadmap for this project includes decentralized lending pools and peer-to-peer loan negotiations that give practical functionality not found in meme-based competitors. Engineered Scarcity and Demand The Mutuum Finance ecosystem enables a buy pressure system which operates independently. Platform fee transactions automatically support MUTM token purchases on open markets which distribute the purchased tokens to both stakers and liquidity providers. The loop executes supply reduction while simultaneously giving rewards that enhance user participation into a cycle which may support price appreciation during the launch phase. The mtTokens protocol establishes additional value through a process allowing users to exchange assets including ETH to generate mtETH that grows in value during duration and can circulate on multiple DeFi platforms. MUTM merges two functional benefits by generating returns and providing ongoing liquidity thus linking the passive investment world to active market trading. Timing the Entry Buyers can enter the market at its lowest price of $0.015 throughout the presale phase and before exchange listings take place. Following its launch the project plans to reach a price of $10 in 2025 which will deliver a remarkable 66,500% return for investors. In order to reach $8,000 after this bull market Ethereum would need to increase by a staggering 350% but MUTM requires only an 8,000% surge starting from its current $0.015 price. Mutuum Finance secures overcollateralized loans and conducts a $100,000 giveaway promotion that protects investors who wish to enter with caution while seeking stability. Phase two will approach maximum capacity soon which means the chance to purchase tokens at their initial starting price will soon end. While Ethereum’s technical signals hint at recovery, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a concrete growth blueprint immune to market sentiment. Its presale structure guarantees early backers a minimum 400% profit, while post-launch mechanisms aim for exponential returns.

Immutable X and Quant have established themselves in NFT gaming and enterprise blockchain solutions, but Qubetics is shaking up the space with its high-speed, interoperable ecosystem. The Qubetics presale is closing in on its next stage, triggering a 10% price jump, making it a top crypto to join for 2025. But how does it compare to the competition? Let’s dig in. Qubetics: The Future of Web3 Interoperability The blockchain world is fragmented. Most networks operate in isolation, limiting the seamless transfer of assets, data, and applications. Qubetics changes the game by introducing a powerful Layer 1 blockchain that unites top ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot under one roof. Think of it as the universal translator of blockchain technology. Instead of struggling with bridges and cross-chain swaps, Qubetics users enjoy instant transactions across networks. Now, imagine a freelancer working for multiple companies that pay in different cryptocurrencies. With Qubetics, they won’t need multiple wallets or complex swaps—funds move across chains in real-time, ensuring they always get paid in the token they prefer. Businesses can also use Qubetics to settle payments internationally without relying on traditional banking rails. This level of efficiency is why analysts are calling it the “Swiss Army knife” of blockchain transactions. Qubetics also leverages a tokenized marketplace, allowing users to trade assets, stake tokens, and engage in DeFi applications without the usual friction. The upcoming mainnet launch in Q2 2025 is set to unlock even more utilities, making Qubetics one of the top cryptos to join for 2025 . Qubetics Wallet & Certik Audit: Unmatched Security Security has always been a major concern in crypto, and Qubetics is proactively addressing it. The Qubetics Wallet offers a secure, multi-chain asset management experience, giving users full control over their crypto without relying on centralized exchanges. To further reinforce trust and credibility, Qubetics is undergoing a comprehensive security audit by CertiK, the leading blockchain security firm that has audited top projects like Binance, Polygon, Terra, Aave, and PancakeSwap. CertiK’s audit is expected to strengthen Qubetics’ security architecture, ensuring safe transactions, smart contract integrity, and robust asset protection. With billions of dollars in digital assets already safeguarded by CertiK’s technology, this audit puts Qubetics in an elite category of secure blockchain projects—a huge confidence boost for its growing community of over 21,700 token holders. With its wallet security and CertiK-backed credibility, Qubetics is easily one of the top cryptos to join for 2025 before its mainnet launch. Qubetics Presale: Why Investors Are Rushing In The Qubetics presale is on fire, with Stage 23 already in full swing and over $14.3 million raised so far. With more than 21,700 token holders and a whopping 492 million $TICS tokens sold, the momentum is building fast. The current presale price stands at $0.0888, but here’s the catch—each presale stage lasts only 7 days, and prices increase by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM. This means those who get in early secure the best possible entry point before the token skyrockets post-listing. Analysts have crunched the numbers, and the potential gains are staggering. At the end of the presale, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, translating to a 181.52% ROI. But the real fireworks start after the mainnet launch, where projections show $TICS hitting $1 for a 1,026.09% return, $5 for a 5,530.44% gain, and a jaw-dropping 16,791.32% ROI if it reaches $15. A $1,000 investment today at $0.0888 could turn into $168,000 if the price hits $15 post-mainnet. With such explosive potential, it’s no wonder that Qubetics is quickly becoming the most sought-after crypto presale of 2025! Immutable X: The Powerhouse of NFT Gaming While Qubetics focuses on interoperability, Immutable X is revolutionizing NFT gaming. The Ethereum Layer 2 solution eliminates gas fees while maintaining full security and decentralization. It’s a game-changer (literally) for developers who want to create high-performance blockchain games without frustrating costs for players. Titles like Gods Unchained, Illuvium, and Guild of Guardians have already adopted Immutable X, proving that the platform is a top choice for Web3 gaming. With mainstream gaming companies showing more interest in NFTs, Immutable X is positioned for long-term growth. However, its focus is limited to gaming, whereas Qubetics offers a broader application across industries. Quant: The Institutional Blockchain Solution Quant takes a different approach to blockchain by targeting enterprise adoption. Its Overledger technology allows businesses and governments to integrate blockchain without replacing existing infrastructure. This makes it appealing for financial institutions, supply chains, and even central banks experimenting with CBDCs. One of the biggest advantages of Quant is its partnerships. The project has secured collaborations with major institutions, proving that traditional finance sees blockchain as the future. However, Quant’s enterprise-focused model means it’s less accessible for everyday investors looking to engage in DeFi or Web3 applications. Final Verdict: Which Crypto Offers the Best Upside? Immutable X is dominating NFT gaming, and Quant is bringing blockchain to enterprises, but Qubetics is bridging the entire crypto world with its high-speed interoperability, decentralized payments, and tokenized marketplace, making it the best crypto presale to invest in now. With the Qubetics presale nearing its next stage and a 10% price jump on the horizon, it’s shaping up to be one of the top cryptos to join for 2025. If you’re looking to maximize gains, join the Qubetics presale now before the next price hike kicks in. With analysts predicting massive ROI potential, early investors could be in for a wild (and profitable) ride.

Its presale structure, with scheduled price increases every week, has fueled investor demand, making it one of the most promising crypto projects for 2025. 2. How does Qubetics compare to Immutable X and Quant? While Immutable X excels in NFT scaling and Quant enables seamless cross-chain transactions, Qubetics takes a broader approach by aggregating entire blockchain networks for enhanced interoperability, privacy, and real-world adoption.

According to his post on the social media website Bluesky, Cuban offered words of support and hinted that he could be open to helping them. His message, which has since become a talking point among users on and outside the platform, urged the displaced tech engineers and designers to turn their situation around. He also offered to help or invest in any venture that they may have in the future. “If you worked for 18F and got fired, Group together to start a consulting company,” wrote Cuban. “It’s just a matter of time before DOGE needs you to fix the mess they inevitably created. They will have to hire your company as a contractor to fix it. But on your terms. I’m happy to invest and/or help,” Cuban said. Mark Cuban wants to help affected federal tech workers Mark Cuban’s offer to help is coming from the decision of the federal government’s General Services Administration (GSA) to abruptly cut its 18F technology unit. Until the layoffs yesterday, the technology unit was responsible for building, buying, and sharing technology products for other government agencies. If you worked for 18F and got fired, Group together to start a consulting company. It’s just a matter of time before DOGE needs you to fix the mess they inevitably create. They will have to hire your company as a contractor to fix it. But on your terms. I’m happy to invest and/or help — Mark Cuban ( @mcuban.bsky.social ) March 2, 2025 at 3:34 AM According to a Politico report, the layoffs affected about 70 employees, who received the news around 1 AM Eastern time on Saturday. The report noted that it was part of the moves of the Trump administration to cut the federal workforce, reducing government spending. Laying off federal workers is in line with the directive that United States President Donald Trump has given to the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). A GSA manager who spoke anonymously highlighted that the employees affected included user interface engineers, researchers, content and service engineers, and procurement specialists. The 18F department was involved in the creation of key government services like Login.gov, a central login system that houses programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. According to the report, the cut will touch several agencies, noting that a ripple effect should be expected across the government. Cuban’s proposal and the community reaction This is the second time since the beginning of 2025 that the 18F has suffered cuts, with about 24 employees laid off in February when the GSA let probationary staff go, according to Politico. The workers impacted in this round of cut-offs also received the “What did you do last week? Part II” text from the D.O.G.E department. Politico highlighted that the emails, which required users to list their accomplishments for the week, were widely sent out to several agencies. However, the new opportunity being offered to the laid-off workers by Cuban presents a great chance for them to reshape the future of civic tech on their terms. While the D.O.G.E team has been swiftly working across the board, Elon Musk has noted the fallout tied to the speed with which his team has been moving. For example, with USAID, one of the things we accidentally canceled — very briefly — was Ebola prevention,” Musk said. The big question now is if a small or big percentage of the displaced workers can band together to build a startup that may one day be required to help the government. If this happens, it could be a huge blow to the Trump administration as the efforts to continually shrink the federal workforce remain ongoing. With Cuban already promising to help, it is only a matter of time before the potential company becomes a much-needed firm that the government may need in the future. Meanwhile, users on Bluesky have waded into Cuban’s offer, with most of them discussing the pros and cons of the offer. For instance, a user mentioned that he could fund a startup for them and name it 18FU, after the department that they were fired from. A user called the choice to “sell back services to the government” stupid, while another highlighted that anything they would do would be on their terms and not on Cuban’s terms.

If Trump really wants the entire crypto market to go back up then he should tell the SEC to immediately withdraw the $XRP case — XRPcryptowolf (@XRPcryptowolf) February 28, 2025 The crypto market has struggled recently , and the bearish trend pushed Bitcoin below $80,000 for the first time in 2025. on the other hand, the SEC has recently dismissed multiple lawsuits and investigations against cryptocurrency companies, signaling a shift in its approach to regulation. However, these have not helped the market recover. XRPcryptowolf suggests that dismissing the Ripple lawsuit, arguably the most high-profile case in the crypto space, could kickstart that recovery, and he is calling on Trump, the first-ever pro-crypto president to make the call. His comments reflect a broader sentiment within the cryptocurrency community that regulatory clarity and supportive policies are pivotal for market growth. The Shift in the SEC’s Enforcement Strategy The SEC has recently shifted its enforcement approach under the new administration. Notably, the agency concluded its investigation into Uniswap Labs without pursuing enforcement action, signaling a potential change in its stance toward decentralized finance platforms. Similarly, the SEC dropped its investigation into Gemini , further indicating a possible softening of its regulatory posture. These developments have ignited optimism among XRP supporters regarding the potential dismissal of the SEC’s case against Ripple. Former SEC official John Reed Stark highlighted the lawsuit dismissals as signs that the agency might withdraw its appeal in the Ripple lawsuit, suggesting a broader reevaluation of its crypto enforcement strategy. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Such a move could have profound implications for XRP and the wider cryptocurrency market, potentially paving the way for increased adoption and investment. Will Trump Influence the Lawsuit? Trump’s return to the presidency cemented the SEC’s shift toward a pro-crypto stance. Trump has already appointed pro-crypto officials to the SEC, and he could cement his legacy as the most influential president in the crypto space by calling for the dismissal of the Ripple lawsuit. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has met with Trump multiple times since his election victory in November, and his actions to bolster the crypto market suggest that he understands the advantages of digital assets and the major role cryptocurrencies like XRP can play in global finance. While Trump has not publicly called for the SEC to drop the Ripple lawsuit, his pro-crypto stance and ties with Ripple and its executives have given many community members hope that the president can save Ripple from the war on crypto.

This rise follows a period of market downturn, with renewed optimism surrounding Ripple’s ongoing legal battle and large investors accumulating substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency. Legal Developments Fueling Optimism The long-standing legal dispute between Ripple and regulators has been a key factor in XRP’s price movements. Since the case was filed, uncertainty surrounding XRP’s status as a security has led to fluctuations in its value. However, recent regulatory shifts have led to speculation that the case could either be dismissed or settled under favorable terms. With regulators easing enforcement actions against several high-profile firms in the industry, sentiment is shifting towards a potential resolution. This shift has played a significant role in driving XRP’s price higher, as traders anticipate a clearer regulatory framework that could benefit the token’s long-term adoption. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence Large investors, commonly referred to as “whales,” have been actively accumulating XRP during recent price dips. On-chain data suggests that wallets holding between 1 million and 100 million XRP have added hundreds of millions of tokens to their holdings in a short period. Whale accumulation is often seen as a bullish signal, as these investors typically have a long-term perspective and access to information that may not yet be widely reflected in the market. Their increased holdings suggest they expect a strong recovery and potentially further gains in XRP’s price. Technical Indicators Suggest Further Upside From a technical standpoint, XRP is showing signs of a recovery pattern. The price is approaching a critical resistance zone, where multiple moving averages are converging. If the token can break above this level, it could trigger further upward momentum, potentially retesting recent highs. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also rebounded from oversold conditions, indicating growing buying pressure. A continuation of this trend could lead to an extended rally, with price targets set higher if key resistance levels are surpassed. What’s Next for XRP? XRP’s recent surge highlights the impact of both regulatory developments and market sentiment on its price. If the legal uncertainty surrounding Ripple is resolved positively, the token could see sustained growth. However, traders should remain cautious, as broader market conditions and external factors could still influence price movements. While technical indicators support a potential continuation of the uptrend, volatility remains a key factor to watch in the coming weeks.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-02 09:21:00

Since the premier cryptocurrency lost its hold above $90,000, investors have wondered whether the ongoing correction is a “buy the dip” opportunity or the market top is in. While there is no surefire way to put these doubts away, on-chain data can provide relevant insights into what is to come. The latest on-chain data suggests the highlighted level below is the one to watch before investors return to the market. Level To Watch Before ‘Buying The Dip’ In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Maartunn shared that it might not be technically secure to reenter the Bitcoin market at the current price. This analysis is based on the movement of the Bitcoin price relative to the current value of the short-term holders’ (STH) average cost basis. Related Reading: Litecoin Price Shows Resilience In Uncertain Market Conditions — What’s Next For LTC? The STH average cost basis metric estimates the average price at which short-term holders (investors who have owned Bitcoin for less than 155 days) acquired their coins. It represents a psychological level for BTC investors and could act as a reference point for price analysis, especially during bull cycles. Bitcoin usually trades above the short-term holders’ average cost basis during bull markets, signaling substantial buying pressure and optimistic sentiment from short-term investors. On the flip side, when the price of BTC falls beneath this cost basis — as seen in the ongoing correction, it implies that short-term investors are at a loss, which could lead to a sell-off and precipitate significant bearish pressure. According to data from CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin price is currently 6% below the short-term holders’ average cost basis at $90,950. With the flagship cryptocurrency beneath the realized price of short-term holders, the odds are that BTC price could face further selling pressure as the investor cohort looks to minimize their loss. Using this logic, Maartunn noted that investors might want to wait till the price of Bitcoin climbs above the STH average cost price before reentering the market. Interestingly, the short-term investors appear to still be loading their bags. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed in a post on X that short-term holders have purchased more than 35,000 BTC in the past 4 days. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just below the $86,000 mark, reflecting an over 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

But which ones truly stand out? While Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is making waves with its presale and deflationary token burns, ANDY and Apu Apustaja have also captured attention with their latest developments. With Arctic Pablo now in its 12th presale phase at Penguinopolis, the excitement is at an all-time high. Meanwhile, ANDY and Apu Apustaja continue to make moves in the meme coin space. This article will cover the latest updates and opportunities surrounding these three coins. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Model: Token Burns & Rising Demand One of the most thrilling aspects of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is its deflationary model. By burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale, Arctic Pablo ensures that scarcity increases, driving value for early investors. Additionally, all remaining tokens after the presale will be burned, making this a rare opportunity to grab APC before supply tightens even further. Built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo’s transparent burn mechanism is fully recorded on the blockchain, providing security and confidence for investors. With a current presale price of just $0.000067 and an anticipated launch price of $0.008, the potential return on investment (ROI) exceeds a staggering 11,844.78%. Early adopters could see exponential gains once Arctic Pablo hits the market. Penguinopolis Presale: Arctic Pablo’s 12th Phase Brings Unmatched Potential Arctic Pablo’s meme coin presale journey has been nothing short of legendary. Having completed expeditions through nine locations in under a month, it has now reached Penguinopolis—the 12th presale phase. This means the current price of $0.000067 won’t last long. With over $1.64 million already raised, Arctic Pablo is rapidly approaching its next milestone. Unlike traditional presales with stages, Arctic Pablo takes a unique approach by dividing its sale into locations, mirroring the character’s adventurous travels. As new locations are unlocked, the price rises. That means investors who enter now at Penguinopolis are securing APC at its lowest possible price before the final presale phase ends. With the launch price set at $0.008, those who jump in today stand to gain significantly. As the project progresses and new locations unlock, the entry price will only get higher. Now is the time to claim your share of Arctic Pablo before the next price increase.

Recently, ANDY experienced a major listing on a top-tier exchange, increasing its accessibility and liquidity.

Apu Apustaja Rides the Meme Wave: Community Growth & More Apu Apustaja continues to build a strong presence in the meme coin space, drawing in a vibrant community. The coin recently launched new staking features, allowing holders to earn passive rewards while supporting the ecosystem. This move has led to increased engagement, with more investors jumping in to stake their holdings.

According to QuantEdgeB, Bitcoin’s Sentival indicator hit a value of -4 standard deviations (SD) on Feb. 25, indicating oversold conditions. Although Bitcoin’s price has continued to fall in recent days, Sentival has begun to rise. This divergence suggests that downward momentum may be weakening and a potential reversal may be underway. Bitcoin has rallied towards the $85,000 level and Sentival is currently approaching -1SD. Analysts at QuantEdgeB suggest that if Sentival reaches its fair value, a sharper upward move could ensue, potentially accelerating Bitcoin’s recovery. Related News: Vitalik Buterin Announces Support for Surprise Altcoin Proponent While recent data suggests that the worst of Bitcoin’s recent downtrend may be over, analysts warn that confirmation is still needed. Market participants should closely monitor the $85,000 level and Sentival’s movement for further confirmation of the bullish trend, the firm said.

41048720,https://thecoinrise.com/custodia-bank-ceo-u-s-has-done-nothing-to-solve-crypto-debanking-issues/,1740909051,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/60/41048720.jpeg,Custodia Bank CEO: U.S. Has Done “Nothing” to Solve Crypto Debanking Issues,https://thecoinrise.com/custodia-bank-ceo-u-s-has-done-nothing-to-solve-crypto-debanking-issues/,"Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, has criticized the U.S. government for its inaction on crypto debanking issues , stating that no meaningful progress has been made since Donald Trump returned to the White House. Speaking at ETHDenver on February 28, Long emphasized that while some perceive a regulatory shift, federal banking agencies have not rescinded their anti-crypto stance. Regulatory Stagnation in Crypto Banking “It is still presumed unsafe and unsound for a bank to touch a digital asset even in a de minimis amount,” Long remarked, asserting that the regulatory framework remains restrictive despite changing political leadership. She believes that this resistance will eventually fade but noted that the Trump administration has not yet introduced any concrete reforms to address these concerns. A key part of Long’s critique focused on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which she argued has resisted technological progress under the leadership of former Chair Martin Gruenberg. Gruenberg, who was replaced by Acting Chair Travis Hill on January 20, has been linked to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” a rumored initiative that sought to cut off banking access for crypto firms. Long stressed the need for a new, reform-oriented FDIC chair to ensure that U.S. banking regulations evolve with technological advancements. SEC’s Shift in Stance and Stablecoin Concerns While Long expressed frustration with the slow-moving banking regulations, she acknowledged that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has significantly shifted its stance on crypto policy. A day after President Trump’s inauguration on January 20, the SEC established a Crypto Task Force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, signaling a more open approach to digital assets. One of the most notable regulatory reversals was the SEC’s cancellation of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121)—a controversial rule that required financial firms to record crypto holdings as liabilities on their balance sheets. The rule had been widely criticized for discouraging institutional adoption of digital assets, and its removal marks a significant shift in policy. Beyond banking and regulatory concerns, Long also highlighted the need for stablecoin legislation that enforces stronger consumer protections. She pointed out that many U.S. banks hold as little as 8 cents in cash for every dollar of demand deposits, making them vulnerable to bank runs. The collapse of Silvergate Bank , a crypto-friendly financial institution, serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with poor liquidity management. To safeguard consumers, Long argues that stablecoin issuers must hold full cash reserves to back their liabilities, preventing systemic risks in the financial system.

41049201,https://invezz.com/?p=2595408,1740909600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token predicted to break the $1 barrier with impressive momentum,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/02/mutuum-finance-mutm-token-predicted-to-break-the-1-barrier-with-impressive-momentum/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making significant strides in its presale, fueled by growing investor enthusiasm for its dual ending model and demand-centric tokenomics. Currently at $0.015 during the second presale phase, the project has already amassed $1.8 million from over 3,400 holders. The price per token is set for a 33.3% increase to $0.02 in phase 3, meaning investors have a rapidly closing window to buy at the current price. With plans to list at $0.06 and long-term price forecasts reaching up to $8.50, early adopters are positioning themselves for potential returns exceeding 300%, both at launch and as the ecosystem scales. Mutuum presale momentum Investors are rapidly embracing the momentum behind Mutuum Finance as its structured presale format drives significant demand. Now in its second phase, the initiative is fostering a sense of urgency among participants aiming to secure tokens at a competitive, introductory price point. The first phase concluded with overwhelming support, attracting participants eager to leverage the project’s blend of decentralized lending solutions and tokenomics engineered to sustain buy-side pressure. Each presale stage introduces incremental price increases, intensifying the rush to participate before the next adjustment. At $0.015, this phase presents a fleeting opportunity for investors to optimize pre-launch returns, with the upcoming move to $0.02 signaling a sharp 33.3% value uptick for those acting quickly. The $100,000 giveaway from Mutuum Finance serves as a powerful catalyst that boosts momentum while encouraging initial contributions. A group of ten participants each stands to receive $10,000 which serves to further energize their involvement. Through its revenue redistribution model, which directs fees to purchase MUTM tokens, the platform maintains demand while simultaneously deterring sell-offs. Within decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, such mechanics remain rare because speculative tokens typically do not possess real-world applications. Each transaction strengthens the token’s scarcity which connects platform activity directly to its market value. Tokenomics frame a clear path to profitability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart from conventional presale ventures with a thoughtfully designed token distribution strategy. The allocation of the total supply gives precedence to liquidity mining, staking rewards, and fostering strategic partnerships. With a listing price of $0.06, phase two investors stand to gain a 4x return, though projections for the secondary market indicate significantly higher potential. Analysts forecast a rise to $8.50 by 2025, fueled by the platform’s growing user base and the adoption of mtTokens. Lending model catalyzes long-term demand Mutuum Finance’s expansion approach hinges on its P2P lending system which facilitates direct asset negotiations for items outside conventional pools including meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The adaptability of the system increases user interest and transaction variety. The buy-and-distribute mechanism directs platform fees into scheduled MUTM purchases which then reallocates tokens to mtToken stakers. Demand escalates through this cycle while stakeholder incentives synchronize with platform success factors. The ripple effect is undeniable. The frequency of buybacks increases alongside adoption rates, which generates price pressures that operate independently from market volatility factors. Initial presale discounts merge with staking rewards to give early investors double benefits while the token’s governance and fee utility increases its essential role within the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance tackles typical DeFi project risks through reputable firm security audits and its upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) transforms decentralized finance by integrating practical lending mechanisms with autonomous token economic systems. The presale price point currently stands at $0.15 presents a unique investment opportunity before its upward trajectory begins, phase two progresses quickly and postponements threaten access to the most lucrative profit phases. The opportunity to achieve 400% pre-launch profits diminishes as exchange listings approach and forecasts become definite. Investors seeking utility-based assets over speculative ones find MUTM to be an unparalleled opportunity. Immediate action is required; any delay might result in losing a strategic opportunity within DeFi’s upcoming foundational element.

These rumors started doing the rounds on social media almost immediately after the Bybit hack. Speculations suggested that large crypto firms, including Binance, caused the recent market sell-off by aggressively selling and reducing the size of their holdings. They are misunderstanding what Binance does as an exchange, which is we simply help users match trades – Binance Binance’s clarification could be one of the reasons we’ve seen the market recover over the weekend. There are still reasons to worry about potential liquidation, though, especially given the upcoming influx of Solana tokens from the FTX hack. Over 15M $SOL worth $2.5B are about to flood the market. Still, expert analysis suggests that the coming week could see more buying pressure, as $BTC takes support on the 200 EMA. Combined with the long-term perspective being bullish, it could be worth investing in promising new presales that are showing a lot of investor interest. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana Altcoin Capable of Boosting the Network’s Appeal Solana has undoubtedly been one of the most talked-about blockchains in the last year thanks to its memecoin-friendly infrastructure. It’s both fast and cheap, which has led to an increase in the number of meme coins on the network. Notable ones include $TRUMP, $BONK, and $MELANIA. However, Solana’s rise to fame has birthed operational difficulties. The network stands overwhelmed by the sheer amount of transaction requests. This flooding of new investors on Solana has led to congestion and scalability issues, and transactions are failing to go through. This is where Solaxy ($SOLX) comes in. Designed to be the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, Solaxy will process transactions away from the network’s mainnet, reducing the burden on Solana. Additionally, since $SOLX will carry out multiple transactions simultaneously, i.e., bulk processing, it will result in a reduction of the costs investors have to pay to go through with their transactions. All in all, $SOLX isn’t just all fun and games. It’s a token with real utility, which is why it’s being considered the next 100x crypto . You can join Solana’s Solaxy-fueled growth by investing in the $SOLX presale. It has already raised over $24.5M, and each token is currently available for just $0.00165. Here’s how to buy it . 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Support Bitcoin’s Growth and Become a Crypto Millionaire Yourself Similar to how Solaxy could benefit from Solana’s growth, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is also designed in a way that it will bask in the success of a top cryptocurrency – Bitcoin. That said, BTC Bull Token has enough tricks up its sleeves that differentiate it from just about every other meme coin on the market. For starters, it’s the only one that will distribute free $BTC among token holders. $BTC airdrops will take place every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone figure, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Even better, the airdrops will be automatic, meaning you won’t have to manually request them, as is the case with other projects. Just make sure you keep your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. Additionally, the project has reserved a staggering 40% of the total token supply for marketing the token after its launch.

While blue-chip cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum remain staples, the real opportunities lie in projects with high-growth potential, strong use cases, and expanding ecosystems. Enter Qubetics, Stellar, and Tezos—three blockchain projects that are making waves for different reasons. Qubetics ’ presale has already surpassed $14.3M million, solidifying its position as one of the Top Cryptos to Join for 2025. Meanwhile, Stellar is deepening its presence in financial markets, and Tezos continues its expansion in institutional blockchain adoption. Let’s dive into why these three cryptos should be on every investor’s radar. Qubetics: The Game-Changer in Blockchain Interoperability As the blockchain space expands, the need for interoperability between networks has never been more crucial. Many existing blockchains function as isolated ecosystems, making asset transfers and cross-chain interactions complex and inefficient. Qubetics is solving this issue head-on by building a next-gen Web3 aggregator that unites major blockchains and facilitates seamless cross-chain transactions. Qubetics’ multi-chain architecture allows users to transact between different blockchains without third-party intermediaries. Whether it’s Bitcoin, Ethereum, or newer chains, Qubetics ensures that assets can move freely, securely, and cost-efficiently. Businesses and financial institutions will benefit from instant cross-border payments, while developers can build interoperable dApps that work across multiple ecosystems. Imagine a freelancer in Asia receiving payments in USDC on Ethereum and instantly converting it to Solana or Binance Smart Chain without high fees or delays—that’s the kind of real-world efficiency Qubetics is bringing to blockchain payments. With traditional financial systems struggling with slow, expensive international remittances, Qubetics is positioning itself as a go-to solution for global transactions. Qubetics Wallet & Certik Audit: Unparalleled Security Security is one of the biggest concerns in crypto, and Qubetics isn’t leaving anything to chance. Its multi-chain wallet offers a safe, decentralized way to manage assets across multiple blockchains, eliminating the risks associated with centralized exchanges. To reinforce trust and credibility, Qubetics is undergoing a CertiK audit, the gold standard in blockchain security. CertiK has previously audited industry giants like Binance, Polygon, and Aave, helping safeguard billions in digital assets. This audit strengthens Qubetics’ security architecture, ensuring safe transactions, smart contract integrity, and robust asset protection. As the mainnet launch nears in Q2 2025, this CertiK-backed credibility is already driving more users to join the presale. With its multi-chain wallet security and institutional-grade audit, Qubetics is a top crypto to join for 2025—and it’s only getting started. Qubetics Presale: A High-ROI Opportunity for Early Investors The crypto presale is making serious waves, with $14.3 million raised and 492 million $TICS tokens sold in just 23 stages. More than 21,700 token holders have already secured their positions, and with the price currently at $0.0888, time is ticking before the next 10% price increase this Sunday at 12 AM. Since each presale stage lasts just 7 days, early adopters are capitalizing on this limited-time opportunity before Qubetics enters the open market. Experts predict a meteoric rise in value—$0.25 by the end of the presale (181.52% ROI), $1 after presale (1,026.09% ROI), and a staggering $15 post-mainnet (16,791.32% ROI). A $1,000 investment at today’s price could soar to $168,000 if $TICS reaches its full potential. The presale window is closing fast, making Qubetics one of the most promising investment opportunities of 2025! Stellar: Expanding Financial Inclusion and Cross-Border Payments Stellar has long been one of the leading blockchain projects for global payments and financial inclusion. With partnerships across banks, fintech firms, and governments, Stellar is bridging the gap between traditional finance and decentralized systems. One of Stellar’s biggest strengths is its partnership with MoneyGram, enabling instant cash-to-crypto transactions in over 200 countries. This move is revolutionizing remittances and cross-border transactions, especially for the unbanked population worldwide. With major updates coming to the Stellar ecosystem and expanding regulatory clarity, the project is expected to see higher adoption among financial institutions. As more businesses integrate Stellar for real-world payments, its utility and token demand will skyrocket in 2025. Tezos: Institutional Adoption and Smart Contract Expansion Tezos has positioned itself as one of the most developer-friendly blockchains, offering seamless smart contract upgrades, high security, and strong governance mechanisms. The project has seen growing adoption among enterprises, institutions, and even governments looking to tokenize real-world assets and implement blockchain solutions. In recent months, Tezos has expanded its partnerships into luxury brands, financial institutions, and even the art world through NFTs. With its energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus and built-in upgradability, Tezos is attracting developers and enterprises who need long-term, scalable blockchain solutions. With growing adoption and increased institutional interest, Tezos remains a strong contender for investors looking to diversify their crypto portfolio in 2025. Conclusion: The Top Cryptos to Join for 2025 Are Here—Will You Take Action? As crypto adoption accelerates in 2025, investors must look beyond just Bitcoin and Ethereum. Qubetics, Stellar, and Tezos are three projects that stand out for their real-world utility, strong adoption, and long-term growth potential. Qubetics is leading the charge in blockchain interoperability, ensuring seamless cross-chain transactions and payments. Stellar is revolutionizing financial services, making global payments more efficient and accessible. Tezos continues to expand in institutional finance, securing its place as a top-tier blockchain for smart contracts and tokenization. With Qubetics presale booming at $14.3M and prices set to rise every Sunday at midnight, the time to act is now. If the predictions of $10 per $TICS token post-mainnet launch hold true, early investors could secure life-changing gains, making it one of the Top Cryptos to Join for 2025 . Join the Qubetics presale before the next price increase and position yourself for massive returns in 2025.

Qubetics is solving one of the biggest issues in crypto—interoperability. It allows users to seamlessly transact across multiple blockchains without relying on centralized intermediaries. This makes it a game-changer for cross-border payments, dApp development, and institutional adoption. How does the Qubetics presale work? Qubetics follows a weekly price increase model, where token prices rise by 10% every Sunday at midnight. This means the earlier you invest, the lower the price you pay. With $13.3M already raised, demand is surging fast. Why is Tezos considered a strong investment for 2025? Tezos offers self-amending smart contracts, institutional adoption, and a growing developer ecosystem. With its focus on security, efficiency, and enterprise-grade blockchain solutions, it is well-positioned to thrive in 2025 and beyond.

In a new thread on the social media platform X, Yakovenko says Bitcoin is an expense and not an investment – something to protect against the possible collapse of a country touting economic and military might. “BTC has no value. In the best light, it’s insurance. Based on my lifetime priors, there is a 1% chance a superpower will collapse any given year. It’s worth it for me to spend 1% of my wealth on some asset that might not go to zero in that environment. It’s not an investment, it’s a cost, and there is no guarantee it will work. It’s as good at doing that at $100,000 as it is at $10,000. If it works, it has very little to do with technology outside of the initial innovation that happened 15 years ago.” Popular figures in the digital asset space advocate for BTC as a hedge against currency debasement. Yakovenko says he does not contest the thesis because it is aligned with his argument. However, he does not believe that investors should go all in on BTC. “Currency debasement ~= superpower collapse, same use case – insurance. If it works, it’s because safety and property rights have intrinsic value. They are on the Maslow hierarchy of needs. But it’s not direct. The worst amount of BTC to own is 100%.” While Yakovenko thinks that Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, he champions layer-1 blockchains like Solana as they are designed to generate revenue with every transaction. When asked about the value of coins that require gas to process transactions, Yakovenko says , “The share of all future capturable fees.” At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $86,236, up over 2% in the past day.

According to a report from Nansen, current implied volatility levels for ETH suggest low expected price movement. Still, analysts say this may be a misjudgment because of its recent price movements. Ethereum Faces Downside Tail Risk Nansen evaluated Ethereum derivatives metrics on the crypto options and futures exchange platform Deribit for the past week starting from February 25, month, and year to check if there is any hope for ether’s price. The firm found that while the ETH options market still has a bullish bias, the significant call-side positioning appears increasingly at risk. This signaled a potential for further volatility, especially if the support levels at $2,200-$2,300 come under pressure. As of the report on February 25, ETH was worth around $2,395; however, the asset’s value had plummeted to $2,200 at the time of writing. As of February 25, the put/call ratio was 0.46, indicating a call-side bias. Total open interest for Ethereum was over 1.860 contracts, with more than 1.278 calls and about 582,105 puts. There was a key strike concentration for calls between $2,700 and $3,100 and $2,200 – $2,500 for puts. Additionally, the 90-day implied volatility (IV) for calls was 78.57, while puts were 76.49, with a slightly call-favored skew of +2.08 points. “The 90-day implied volatility data show current IV levels (calls at 78.57, puts at 76.49) are much lower than in past years. The chart below shows that from 2020-2022, these levels were typically between 120-140 during “regular” market regimes and went above 160 during market stress. We observe a seemingly “break lower” in implied vol from 2023 on,” Nansen noted. $2,500 Now Resistance Level Nansen further mentioned that the Ethereum IV levels suggested traders were not expecting much price movement; however, this may have been a mistake because ether’s price at the time was close to key option strike levels, and market conditions were not bullish . The analytics firm said ether’s future structure showed bearish signs, indicating near-term pressure. The $2,500 level changed from potential support to immediate resistance, with “dealer hedging likely to trigger selling pressure near the level. Dealer hedging refers to traders entering positions that will profit them if their primary investments turn into losses.

Yet it’s not just the XRP price recovery that has investors talking. XRPTurbo (XRT) —an AI Agent launchpad on the XRP Ledger—has rapidly sold out almost 70% of its presale softcap in less than 72 hours, attracting attention from retail holders and Ripple whales alike. A New AI Revolution on XRP XRPTurbo is engineered to harness XRP’s low fees and swift transactions , applying AI-driven automation to everything from smart contracts to real-world asset (RWA) tokenization. According to the dev team, they’re also rolling out a GUI-based XRP token and NFT minter , which can tie in with AI agents for seamless, autonomous token or NFT launches. This robust lineup of features aims to supercharge XRP DeFi , appealing to both experienced and first-time crypto enthusiasts. Driving Innovation with Tokenization & AI Agents In a bid to cultivate a thriving XRP Ledger ecosystem, XRPTurbo has introduced a form for projects and businesses seeking to tokenize assets or deploy AI agents on-chain. Whether you’re an enterprise exploring digital asset solutions or a developer craving advanced automation, XRPTurbo’s launchpad is designed to fast-track innovation on XRP. Join Xrpturbo Presale Why $XRT Matters Central to the platform is the $XRT utility token , powering network operations and delivering tangible benefits: Priority Access: Early entrance to high-potential AI and RWA ventures launching on XRPTurbo. Staking & Rewards: Stake $XRT to earn passive income while backing the network’s long-term stability. Revenue Sharing: A share of the platform’s revenue goes to $XRT stakers, fostering deeper community alignment. With a capped supply of 100 million tokens , 60% is reserved for presale participants. The final token price will hinge on total XRP contributed, ensuring fair price discovery. Meanwhile, the XRPTurbo team is in talks with various centralized exchanges to broaden $XRT’s availability post-presale. Buy $XRT Tokens Join the XRT Presale While It Lasts With nearly 70% of the softcap already secured in under 72 hours, now may be the ideal time to lock in $XRT at presale prices. Here’s how you can participate: Buy XRP from reputable exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, or Bybit. Use a non-custodial wallet (Xaman, Trust Wallet, Ledger) to hold your XRP. Go to XRPTurbo’s presale portal , copy the deposit address, and send your XRP to claim $XRT. Receive your tokens via airdrop when the presale concludes. By weaving AI automation into the speed and scalability of the XRP Ledger, XRPTurbo is poised to become a catalyst for DeFi growth. As the project accelerates toward completing its softcap—and with Ripple whales already jumping on board—this could be the perfect opportunity to ride the next big wave of AI-infused innovation on XRP.

Market analysts have identified indications of ETH’s resistance through the detection of the Wyckoff Accumulation Pattern because it suggests future price recovery. The historical patterns indicate ETH could reach $8,000 when its support levels become established. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues its second presale phase in spectacular fashion by gaining $2 million through 3,800 investors acquiring tokens at $0.015. The strategic combinations of tokenomics strategies with real-world utility make Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stand out to investors looking for substantial Q2 market growth. Ethereum Navigates Choppy Waters The Ethereum market value experiences price fluctuations in the range from $2,000 to $2,400 while trading near its current level of $2,290. Recent overvaluation due to stochastic RSI metrics is comparable to previous market strengths when Ethereum demonstrated powerful price rebounds. Financial players observe the $2,500 price point as their target because successful breaks through this barrier might spark an upwards movement toward $3,000. According to the Wyckoff pattern analysis combined with accumulation phases there is strong reason to believe Ethereum price could escalate up to $8,000 potentially. Market sentiment remains divided. The current bearish market sentiment remains strong as the MACD line continues to track below the signal line indicating brief short-term market insecurity. Still, Ethereum’s developing ecosystem ensures its prominence as the leading blockchain infrastructure. ETH’s present market devaluation creates possibilities for risk-tolerant investors to use as an entry position prior to a probable future price recovery. Mutuum Finance Accelerates Presale Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes its position in decentralized finance by implementing lending protocols which serve to boost token values. The second phase of token sales at Mutuum Finance offers $0.015 tokens which present a 33.3% discount to the following phase starting at $0.02. People who invest in the presale launch will receive a 300% return even though the MUTM price is expected to begin trading at $0.06. Anticipated price projections after launch indicate MUTM will rise to $7.50 by the end of 2025 according to analysts therefore providing existing investors with a 49,900% return on investment. The mtTokens platform system draws attention from users. Users who deposit their ETH or DAI assets obtain the interest-bearing mtTokens that function on all DeFi platforms. The integration of interoperability between DeFi protocols increases liquidity levels while simultaneously promoting users to maintain their assets for extended periods. The Mutuum Finance (MUTM) platform uses a buy-and-distribute model through which it acquires open market tokens with revenue and distributes them to token stakers. The platform distributes obtained tokens to stakers who keep the system stable by discouraging sell-offs through continuous token purchase. Why Mutuum Finance Stands Apart Unlike speculative peers, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) addresses tangible financial needs. Borrowers within its lending system must set assets worth more than the loan amount to lessen the chance of defaults. Under the peer-to-peer system users can establish direct trades to buy unique assets such as meme coins which expands who will use the platform. The presale’s $100,000 money giveaway system gives ten investors $10,000 rewards that push users toward phase two which is nearing its capacity limit. The token economics of Mutuum Finance represents its deliberate method for growth development. Most supply originates from rewards funding at only 20 percent while the remaining 80 percent supports both ecosystem development and exchange liquidity. The numerous presale phase sellouts have created a limited entry period because the current $0.015 price level will shift upwards to reach a $0.06 listing price. The cryptocurrency market shows two contrasting paths as Ethereum (ETH) moves with its own route while Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes its own direction for Q2. ETH shows volatile price behavior over brief periods yet technical analysis signals possible price recovery in the long term. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out through its presale design because it unites DeFi innovation with uncommon profit opportunities found in early-stage projects. For those prioritizing growth, MUTM’s $0.015 price point—and its trajectory toward $7.50—presents a rare convergence of accessibility and upside.

According to pseudonymous researcher Malik672, the solution will democratize the centralized block-building process on Ethereum. In the proposal, Malik672 mentioned that the solution will implement a process called the “shared random algorithm” to achieve this process. He added that the proposal relies on leveraging Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) to remove Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) at the block level. In turn, it will allow a fully democratized block proposal which will accelerate propagation. He added that compared to the Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), the proposal prioritizes trustlessness over-optimization, providing a transformative shift for Ethereum. Malik672 highlighted that due to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake model and the PBS feature migrating MEV concentration to an extent, builders and relays have become more centralized. Ethereum researcher wants to remove centralization issues In a previous report, a researcher with the Ethereum Foundation, Toni Wahrstätter, highlighted that only two Ethereum block builders, Beaverbuild and Titan Builder were responsible for building 88% of all the Ethereum blocks in the first two weeks of October 2024. The issue raised concerns around centralization on the second-largest blockchain in the crypto sector. “This trend is primarily driven by the rise of private order flow (XOF), sold exclusively by certain apps. XOF reduces genuine competition among builders in the block auction, leading to a smaller pool of shared transactions,” Wahrstätter said at the time. He also added that the issue surrounding centralization would be less concerning if strong censorship resistance measures were in place, noting that Ethereum has been making progress on that front. While the Ethereum researcher confirmed that the figure has been reduced to around 80%, he concedes that it is still concerning and far more centralized than the Ethereum community believes it should be. “This system flips that: block-building spreads to thousands of clients globally, fully democratizing the process. No single entity dominates—unlike PBS’s builder pool or a centralized mixer—and BFT mitigates mempool variance, ensuring robustness,” Malik672 said. Malik672’s table comparing the old and new block proposal system. Source: Ethereum Research. MEV, which translates to the value extracted by block proposers by reordering or censoring transactions has usually been subjected to a different range of profit-driven manipulation like arbitrage and front-running, with most of these activities coming at the expense of ordinary users on the network. Malik672 mentioned that the move is not in line with the decentralized ethos of Ethereum, showing the need to provide more decentralization on the network. Malik672 proposes changes to block creation According to the Ethereum researcher, under his proposal, blocks will be constructed using a cryptographically random algorithm. He also added that all Ethereum clients should be involved in the block construction process, instead of a handful of builders that would be responsible for more than 80% of the process. Malik672 noted that the random block creation process will take away profit-driven manipulation tactics that will affect all users. The Ethereum researcher also added that the new proposal is in line with Ethereum’s vision of “trustless roots”, while noting that it will remain compatible with the Danksharding blob requirements, a solution designed to scale Ethereum layer-2’s. In addition, Malik672 believes that the solution will also boost slot times, reducing it from the usual 12 seconds to about 6-8 seconds. However, the Ethereum researcher highlighted that some of the drawbacks of the proposal, including the gas-tip being sacrificed, the reduction in L2 efficiency, and the difference in mempools due to latency issues, which may cause the initial blocks proposed by clients not to be aligned. Meanwhile, he feels the pros outweigh the cons, as solutions can be found to some of the drawbacks listed. The recent proposal is coming after Ethereum developers and researchers agreed to begin deploying Ethereum upgrades at a faster pace. According to the reports from the meeting, the researchers believe it would accelerate Ethereum’s tactical roadmap. The meeting, which had 25 participants including Ethereum Foundation researcher Tim Beiko, touched on several topics including the Pectra and Fuska upgrades.

With the growing meme coin mania and an expected crypto boom, investors are wondering if Dogecoin will ignite a massive rally or if it will make history in a different way. As we witness increasing adoption and excitement around cryptocurrencies, Dogecoin’s future remains uncertain. However, the project’s strong community and media presence could drive a resurgence. In the midst of these predictions, Lightchain AI has already raised over $16.4 million at a presale price of $0.006, presenting another exciting opportunity for investors. Dogecoin Price Prediction- What’s Next for Meme Coin? Dogecoin (DOGE), initially launched as a joke in 2013, has evolved into a significant cryptocurrency, largely due to endorsements from high-profile figures like Elon Musk. As of February 18, 2025, DOGE is trading at approximately $0.39, reflecting a substantial increase from its previous value. Analysts have mixed predictions for DOGE’s future. Some forecasts suggest a potential rise to $1.385, indicating a bullish outlook. However, others caution about the cryptocurrency’s speculative nature and the risks associated with its volatility. While Dogecoin has demonstrated significant growth and garnered attention, its future remains uncertain. Investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions. Will 2025’s Crypto Boom Spark a Dogecoin Rally? Dogecoin (DOGE) is trading at $0.2444 as of February 18, 2025, reflecting a 5.52% decrease from the previous close. Analysts have varied predictions for DOGE’s performance in 2025. Some forecasts suggest a potential increase to $1.36 by April 2025, indicating a 318.71% rise. Conversely, other analyses predict a decline of over 50% due to market saturation and competition from newer meme coins. The cryptocurrency market is influenced by factors such as regulatory developments, institutional adoption, and market sentiment. While some anticipate a significant rally for Dogecoin, others advise caution due to its speculative nature. While there is optimism about Dogecoin’s potential in 2025, investors should remain aware of the inherent risks and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.

Now, some market watchers see the possibility of history repeating itself—with even greater speed—thanks to a new DeFi project: Mutuum Finance. Already raising more than $1.8 million in the second phase of its presale, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has caught investor interest. Tokens currently sell for $0.015, but a 33.33% price increase to $0.02 is locked in for the next stage. Phase 2 investors could expect a 300% gain by its $0.06 launch price, while analysts predict a rapid climb to $1 in as little as two months. Under these projections, a $7,000 position in MUTM might surpass $460,000. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance ’s presale allows investors to purchase the token below market value before it appears on exchanges. In the current phase, tokens cost $0.015, but that figure will rise 33.33% once the project transitions to phase 3. By the time MUTM launches at $0.06, early phase participants may see up to a 300% return before trading begins. Momentum is already visible, with the presale raising $1.8 million from over 3,500 investors. Mutuum Finance’s lending system stands out for its dual approach that merges Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) models. Under P2C, users deposit stablecoins, such as USDT, into liquidity pools governed by smart contracts. This lets lenders earn passive income, while borrowers gain immediate liquidity for crypto-backed loans. The P2P model eliminates intermediaries entirely, allowing lenders and borrowers to connect directly. The project will also introduce a fully collateralized stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar on Ethereum. Departing from algorithmic designs, this stablecoin is strengthened by over-collateralized loans—a formula focused on stability and trust for users. In celebration of its growth, Mutuum Finance has unveiled a $100,000 giveaway, splitting $10,000 in MUTM tokens among 10 winners. A referral system further rewards investors who bring new participants into the project, helping expand its community while delivering added benefits. Building Enduring Value for Holders Mutuum Finance aims for longevity and consistent gains. Revenue from the presale is channeled into liquidity, security measures, and partnerships, thereby cultivating a reliable base for sustainable development. A moderated token release additionally keeps inflation under control, paving the way for a gradual price increase over time. As more users embrace the platform, Mutuum Finance is on track to become a key DeFi innovator. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as an especially promising DeFi asset this year, affording presale investors a rare chance to invest before the price rises. With novel lending solutions, a stablecoin initiative, and an expanding presale, the potential for massive growth is real. The token is still at $0.015, but its price won’t remain low indefinitely. If past market trends are any guide, early participants often reap the largest rewards. Now may be the opportune moment to buy into Mutuum Finance’s presale.

The proposal, dubbed the “Decentralized Random Block Proposal,” suggests implementing a shared random algorithm to eliminate Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) at the block level and distribute block construction more equitably across the network. Pseudonymous researcher Malik672 detailed the concept in a March 1 post , explaining that while Ethereum’s proof-of-stake (PoS) model and the proposer-builder separation (PBS) system have mitigated MEV concentration to some extent, block-building remains highly centralized. Ethereum’s Block Building Dominated by Few as Centralization Concerns Grow The dominance of builders and relays has resulted in a system where only a few entities control a large portion of Ethereum’s blocks. Ethereum Foundation researcher Toni Wahrstätter previously highlighted that two block builders, Beaverbuild and Titan Builder, were responsible for constructing 88.7% of Ethereum blocks in the first half of October 2024. Though this concentration has since dropped to around 80%, Malik672 argues that this level of centralization remains a significant concern. “This system flips that: block-building spreads to thousands of clients globally, fully democratizing the process,” Malik672 wrote. “No single entity dominates—unlike PBS’s builder pool or a centralized mixer—and Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) mitigates mempool variance, ensuring robustness.” An Ethereum researcher, malik672, suggests a ""Decentralized Random Block Proposal"" to tackle centralization and MEV. The idea? Random transaction selection from the mempool, reducing manipulation and making the network more DDoS-resistant. A smart move for better… pic.twitter.com/16YxFaAqv0 — TradeDucky (@tradeducky) March 2, 2025 MEV—where block proposers extract value by reordering or censoring transactions—has led to manipulation strategies like arbitrage and front-running, often at the expense of regular Ethereum users. Malik672 criticized this practice, saying it undermines Ethereum’s decentralization principles. Under the new proposal, block construction would no longer be controlled by a handful of builders. Instead, all Ethereum clients would participate using a cryptographically random selection process. This approach, Malik672 claims, would prevent manipulation and create a more trustless and decentralized Ethereum network. Additionally, the proposal aligns with Ethereum’s Danksharding roadmap, ensuring compatibility with layer-2 scaling solutions. Malik672 also suggested that the mechanism could reduce slot times from the current 12 seconds to 6–8 seconds, improving transaction finality. Ethereum Community Debates Faster Upgrade Rollout Amid Proposed Reforms The proposal comes amid broader discussions within the Ethereum community on expediting Ethereum upgrades. On Feb. 13, Ethereum developers agreed to accelerate the rollout of technical improvements, signaling a commitment to refining the blockchain’s infrastructure at a faster pace. The Pectra upgrade, a significant enhancement to the Ethereum network, was activated on the Holesky testnet on February 25. Activated at epoch 115,968, the upgrade aims to stress-test new features in a controlled environment. Holesky, one of Ethereum’s primary test networks, is designed to simulate real-world conditions, enabling developers to identify and resolve potential issues before full deployment. As reported, a significant on-chain metric supporting ETH’s long-term bullish case is its rapidly declining exchange supply . As of now, only 6.38% of Ethereum’s total supply remains on centralized exchanges, marking the lowest level since its inception. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s transaction fees have also plummeted to their lowest level since late August, averaging just $0.41 per transfer.

She remains confident that adjustments will eventually happen but noted that Trump has yet to propose any reforms. Call for Leadership Change at the FDIC Long highlighted the need for a new Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chair, arguing that under former chairman Martin Gruenberg, the FDIC had resisted technological change for over 15 years. “This is why the banking system is so backwards in this country,” Long said, blaming Gruenberg’s leadership for the lack of innovation in financial services. Gruenberg was replaced by Acting Chair Travis Hill on Jan. 20, but Long suggested that deeper structural changes are needed. Gruenberg had been accused of playing a key role in ‘Operation Chokepoint 2.0’, an alleged federal initiative aimed at denying banking services to crypto businesses. While banking regulators remain rigid, Long acknowledged the SEC’s recent shift in approach toward the crypto industry. The SEC’s creation of a Crypto Task Force, led by Commissioner Hester Peirce just one day after Trump’s inauguration, signaled a new stance on digital assets. Additionally, the SEC revoked the controversial Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121), which previously required financial institutions to classify crypto holdings as liabilities—an accounting rule that was widely criticized within the industry. Long also urged lawmakers to pass long-awaited stablecoin regulations while ensuring stronger consumer protections. She pointed out that many U.S. banks hold only 8 cents in cash for every $1 of demand deposits, making them vulnerable to bank runs. “In the crypto industry, we’ve learned that business model does not work,” she said, referencing the collapse of Silvergate Bank. To protect consumers, Long emphasized that stablecoin issuers should be required to hold cash reserves backing their liabilities, ensuring the industry’s long-term stability. A Shifting Regulatory Landscape It is worth noting that the political shift has already had an impact. Throughout February, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) dropped multiple enforcement actions against crypto firms, signaling a change in regulatory tone. As reported, cryptocurrency enforcement in the United States may ease under the upcoming administration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, with regulatory priorities expected to shift. Speaking at a legal conference in New York, current and former senior government lawyers indicated that while financial fraud cases will still be pursued, the Justice Department’s focus will likely move toward immigration enforcement, a key campaign promise of Trump.

Schlegel’s stance contradicts a proposal from Swiss Bitcoin nonprofit think tank 2B4CH, which aims to constitutionally mandate the SNB to hold Bitcoin on its balance sheet. The initiative, currently in its early stages, has gained traction among crypto advocates pushing for greater institutional adoption. SNB President Schlegel Cites Bitcoin Volatility as Barrier to Reserve Adoption In a March 1 interview with Swiss media outlet Tamedia, Schlegel argued that Bitcoin’s volatility makes it an unsuitable reserve asset for the country’s central bank. “Our reserves need to be highly liquid so they can be used quickly for monetary policy purposes if needed,” he said, emphasizing that Bitcoin’s price swings and market fluctuations are incompatible with the SNB’s financial strategy. Beyond volatility, Schlegel raised concerns over technical vulnerabilities associated with cryptocurrencies, stating that since Bitcoin is software-based, it remains susceptible to bugs and security flaws. “We all know that software can have bugs and other weak points,” he noted, reinforcing the argument that Bitcoin lacks the reliability needed for central bank reserves. Despite acknowledging the crypto market’s near $3 trillion valuation, Schlegel described Bitcoin as a “niche phenomenon” compared to the broader financial system. He also dismissed the idea that Bitcoin could challenge the Swiss franc, stating, “We’re not afraid of competition from cryptocurrencies.” The 2B4CH initiative, which was officially set in motion by the Swiss Federal Chancellery on Dec. 31, requires 100,000 signatures to qualify for a public referendum. The group has until June 30, 2026, to gather enough support—meaning about 1.11% of Switzerland’s 8.97 million residents must sign the petition. SNB chief speaks out against Bitcoin as a currency reserve ￼ The head of the Swiss National Bank, Martin Schlegel, has spoken out against the purchase of Bitcoin demanded by an initiative. For the National Bank, cryptocurrencies have several problems as an asset class. pic.twitter.com/eNjT8HW09w — Bitcoin Initiative (@initiativeBTC) March 1, 2025 Bitcoin Reserves in Other Countries While Switzerland remains cautious, other nations are actively exploring Bitcoin reserves. El Salvador has continued accumulating Bitcoin since September 2021, while the U.S., Czech Republic, and Hong Kong are considering similar policies. Conversely, Poland recently ruled out adding Bitcoin to its reserves. Despite Schlegel’s resistance, Switzerland remains a hub for Bitcoin adoption, particularly in Lugano, which hosts the annual “Plan ₿” conference. It is worth noting that several U.S. states , including Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Texas, have also introduced bills that could enable them to hold Bitcoin and other cryptos as reserve assets. More recently, lawmakers in Ohio introduced House Bill 116 , aiming to prevent the state from imposing additional taxes on digital assets when used for payments. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at around $86,000, largely flat over the past day. According to analysts at Time To Trade , should Bitcoin break above $86,500 with strong volume, traders might see a swift rally targeting $88,000, a psychologically notable round number and a level of interest to short-term speculators. On the other hand, if the market encounters increased selling pressure—especially with lower trading volume—Bitcoin may revisit the $84,000 mark.

The flagship cryptocurrency is up nearly 1% over the past 24 hours but is struggling to build momentum and retake key levels. Analysts believe BTC risks a deeper correction to $72,000 as market sentiment hits a three-year low. The decline saw BTC lose over 11% over the past well. The last time investor sentiment hit similar levels was a month after BTC dropped to $17,500 in 2022. Spot Bitcoin ETFs Snap Outflow Streak Spot Bitcoin ETFs finally broke their outflow streak, registering $94.3 million in total inflows on February 28, as crypto’s worst month in three years ended. The inflows registered on February 28 ended an eight-day streak of outflows, during which investors pulled over $3.2 billion as the Bitcoin price collapsed below $80,000. BlackRock’s IBIT, the largest spot Bitcoin ETF was an exception, registering $244 million in outflows on Friday. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC saw $174 million in inflows, while the ARK23Shares Bitcoin ETF registered inflows of around $193 million, according to data from Farside. The inflows came as the crypto market showed signs of recovery after BTC plunged to $78,457. The flagship cryptocurrency has recovered to reclaim $80,000 and is trading around $85,700 at the time of writing. However, BTC has still been down nearly 12% over the past week. Meanwhile, spot Ethereum ETFs have continued to see significant outflows, with over $419 pulled from the funds on February 28. Changpeng Zhao Shares Advice For Investors Former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has offered his perspective on recent market volatility and price action. In a post on X, Zhao addressed concerns about the recent market dip, stating that such fluctuations are a natural aspect of free markets. He also advised investors anxious about price swings to reassess their investment size. “Dips are a part of free markets … If you are stressed about it, you probably should reduce your investment size. (That is if you view crypto as an investment).” Zhao clarified he was not giving financial advice and reflected on his shift in perspective, adding, “For me, it’s a worldview shift. I exited the old world 11 years ago.” Zhao also emphasized the importance of a balanced approach and personal responsibility for long-term success in the crypto space. Zhao added, “If you got shaken out during the dip, reduce your size to a level you can handle. Mental stability beats all market volatility.” Bitcoin (BTC) Price Analysis Bitcoin (BTC) could see a correction to $72,000 if investor sentiment does not pick up, limiting the prospect of an immediate recovery. Investor sentiment has dropped to levels last seen in 2022. BTC fell to a three-month low of $78,457 on February 28, down nearly 28% from its all-time high of $109,000 on January 20. According to Iliya Kalchev, dispatch analyst at digital asset investment platform Nexo, BTC could experience a significantly deeper correction towards $70,000 as the market repositions. However, the analyst remains confident a significant drop below $75,000 remains less likely. “While there might be a temporary backtrack as the market fills in the gaps left during the rapid climb, Bitcoin is more likely to establish firm support in the $72,000 to $80,000 range. This support could provide a foundation for a more sustainable recovery, reducing the likelihood of a deeper retracement.” Other analysts have also predicted a bottom near $70,000 before the next stage of the rally sets in. The first warning of a correction to $70,000 came from Raoul Pal, founder and CEO of Global Macro Investor. Pal had predicted BTC would reach a local top above $110,000 in January before correcting. Investor sentiment has also dropped to levels not seen since 2022. The last time it fell to these levels was in 2022 after BTC declined to $17,500. Bitcoin (BTC) lost key levels this week as bears tightened their grip on the market. Market sentiment has registered a drop thanks to macroeconomic factors, concerns around inflation, the Bybit hack, and fears of a trade war. As a result, BTC started the week in the red after registering a marginal drop on Monday and settling at $96,084. Bearish sentiment intensified on Monday as BTC dropped nearly 5% to go below $95,000 and settle at $91,622. Sellers retained control on Tuesday as BTC fell below $90,000 on its way to a low of $85,985. The price recovered from this level but could not reclaim $90,000, ultimately settling at $88,654. Bearish sentiment intensified on Wednesday as the price fell to a low of $82,081 before settling at $84,129 after a decline of over 5%. Source: TradingView Despite the overwhelming bearish sentiment, BTC recovered on Thursday, reaching an intraday high of $87,045. However, it could not stay at this level and settled at $84,657, ultimately registering a marginal increase. The price collapsed on Friday as BTC plunged below the 200-day SMA and key support levels to an intraday low of $78,179. Buyers stepped in at this level, allowing the price to recover. As a result, BTC reclaimed $80,000 and ultimately settled at $84,362 after a marginal decline. The price registered a recovery on Saturday after the White House announced a crypto summit scheduled for March 7. BTC rose just over 2% following the news and settled at $86,182. The current session sees the price marginally down as buyers and sellers struggle to establish control. Despite BTC’s recovery on Saturday, buyers are struggling to build momentum, with sellers in control of the ongoing session. If sellers retain control, BTC could drop back to $80,000. A deeper correction could see the price drop to $72,000. On the other hand, buyers will look to establish control and push BTC towards $90,000. The RSI and MACD are bearish, indicating a further downtrend for BTC . Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Investor sentiment has dropped to levels not seen in three years, increasing the likelihood of a correction toward the $72,000 range. As market uncertainty grows, many are questioning whether Bitcoin’s current downturn is just a temporary pullback or the beginning of a more prolonged bearish trend. Bitcoin’s Decline from Recent Highs Bitcoin has seen a significant drop from its all-time high earlier this year. After reaching a peak of over $109,000 in January, the cryptocurrency has fallen to around $78,000, marking a substantial pullback. This decline has been driven by several factors, including increased market volatility, profit-taking by investors, and concerns about regulatory developments in the cryptocurrency space. Despite attempts to regain momentum, Bitcoin has struggled to maintain key support levels. Some analysts believe that the next major support zone lies around $72,000, where buying pressure could emerge. However, if this level fails to hold, the market could see even steeper declines in the short term. Weakening Investor Sentiment One of the key indicators influencing Bitcoin’s recent price movement is investor sentiment, which has dropped to its lowest level since 2022. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, a popular metric for measuring market emotions, has fallen to extreme fear levels, suggesting that traders are becoming increasingly cautious. Several factors have contributed to this negative sentiment. The broader macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, with concerns about inflation, interest rate hikes, and potential economic slowdowns affecting risk assets like Bitcoin. Additionally, fears of increased regulatory scrutiny in major markets have made institutional investors hesitant to commit large amounts of capital to the cryptocurrency sector. Impact of Market Events and Security Concerns Security breaches and major hacks have also played a role in dampening investor confidence. The cryptocurrency market has recently witnessed high-profile incidents involving stolen funds, further fueling concerns about exchange security and the vulnerability of digital assets. The impact of these security issues has extended beyond individual platforms, affecting the overall trust in the market. Many investors have responded by moving their funds to self-custodial wallets or reducing their exposure to riskier assets, contributing to the ongoing price decline. Potential Scenarios for Bitcoin’s Price Movement With Bitcoin facing a critical moment, analysts are divided on what comes next. If the $72,000 support level holds, Bitcoin could see a period of consolidation before attempting another rally. Historically, strong corrections have often been followed by significant rebounds, as long-term investors take advantage of lower prices to accumulate more Bitcoin. On the other hand, if Bitcoin fails to maintain support above $72,000, a deeper correction could occur. Some bearish projections suggest that Bitcoin could test lower levels before finding a new equilibrium. Long-Term Outlook Remains Positive Despite the current downturn, many market participants remain optimistic about Bitcoin’s long-term prospects. Historically, periods of extreme fear and price corrections have been followed by strong recoveries, particularly as adoption and institutional interest continue to grow. As the market navigates this period of uncertainty, traders and investors will be closely watching key technical levels and broader macroeconomic trends to determine Bitcoin’s next move. While short-term volatility may persist, the fundamental case for Bitcoin remains strong, with continued advancements in adoption, infrastructure, and regulatory clarity shaping its long-term trajectory.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|BUSINESS|MARKET|TRADING|EXCHANGE,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-02 11:21:00
41052123,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/understanding-the-power-of-strategy-rewards-and-community-in-web3-gaming,1740914876,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/41052123.jpeg,"Understanding the Power of Strategy, Rewards, and Community in Web3 Gaming",https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/understanding-the-power-of-strategy-rewards-and-community-in-web3-gaming,"Web2 games run on centralized servers, which hold all in-game data in one place. Closed ecosystems and limited player ownership are the other salient features of Web2 gaming. Nintendo, Ubisoft, Microsoft Xbox Game Studios, and other heavyweights in the industry dominate the market. The gaming firm managing the centralized server is responsible for all game content, user data, and server maintenance. Users don't control digital assets like accounts, characters, weapons, and skins; the company does. Web2 companies face criticism for heavily promoting in-app purchases, which can push players to spend more than they can afford. Web3 improves on legacy gaming, but we have yet to see a full transition Many players have made the transition to Web3, inspired by high processing power, better graphics, and other appealing enhancements. Web3 games improve the Web2 gaming experience via decentralized storage and hosting, which are safer, more stable, and more transparent than centralized servers with their single point of failure. Blockchain technology is used to guarantee the fairness of in-game features. However, Web3 gaming's most appealing aspect is the play-to-earn model, which replaces Web2's pay-to-play. This model allows players to earn crypto or in-game assets while having fun. Blockchain technology gives players true ownership of their in-game assets, which they can sell, trade, purchase, or otherwise use across platforms and games. Still, it has been a rocky road for Web3. In 2023, around a third of blockchain gaming projects were either canceled or discontinued. Projects struggle with user retention, sustainability, and economic balance. True engagement is achieved through strategic and exciting gameplay, appealing rewards, and a vibrant community where players share their achievements and other aspects of their performance. Bridging the gap between entertainment and profit Web3 gaming platforms like Funtico are bridging the gap between rewards and entertainment, emerging as a viable choice for Web2 game publishers and evolving into gamer-centric next-generation platforms. Backed by investors such as Avalanche and Alpha Crypto Capital, Funtico crafts and delivers high-quality, competition-based games that put the power in players' hands while regularly distributing rewards based on engagement with the platform. The gaming experience blends with technological prowess seamlessly. Funtico recently concluded "" The Start of a Revolution ,"" a $100,000 tournament with exciting performances, battles, and strategic maneuvering culminating in big rewards for the best players. It raised the bar for competitive gaming with its enticing prize pool, offering substantial rewards as well as prestige. There was significant engagement around the tournament on social media, with players sharing not only strategies but also highlights and experiences. Previous tournaments have included Solitaire Slam, It Only Takes 5, Who Wants to be King, and Crypto OGs' Space Race. One of the platform's most recent games is Bingo Rampage, with tournaments offering high weekly rewards in the native token $TICO. Stronger community engagement will determine the success of the next wave of play-to-earn games, according to Pavel Antohe, Funtico's Chief Product Officer, who took part in a panel on the best P2E strategies for decentralized platforms at AIBC 2025 in Dubai. He drew attention to the importance of building trust through meaningful interactions and incentives. Web3 gaming platforms must ensure players have full control over their assets to facilitate sustainability and merge familiar Web2 experiences with the benefits Web3 decentralization brings to attract and onboard more users. Funtico partnered with Ludo to leverage the latter's advanced reputation and trust technology and make sure only real users can play games. The goal is to eliminate bots and enhance player engagement by fostering a genuine, community-driven environment. Ludo's technology ensures that only users with established reputations take part in its ecosystem. It features advanced filtering to guarantee there are no bots among the 500 recipients of Ludo's $TICO airdrop. This collaboration sets the stage for a long-term partnership emphasizing sustainable, community-driven Web3 growth. It goes without saying the goal of a game should go beyond clicking on a cookie (Cookie Clicker) or something equally mindless. A goal like that loses meaning quickly, and the fact that Web3 is rife with bots is an equally powerful deterrent to engagement. Bots can exploit loopholes in Web3 games, using them to inflate prices or farm tokens artificially. Users exploited bots to get more tokens in the Hamster Kombat and Catizen airdrops. In decentralized contexts, conventional anti-cheat measures are insufficient or easy to bypass. Early Web3 games focused on speculative NFT trading instead of true engagement, resulting in the misconception that the games prioritized financial speculation over experience. While speculative trading will not disappear in 2025, experts expect a steady pivot toward projects with exclusive perks, rewards programs, or real services connected to asset ownership. Striking a balance: Rewards, community, and engagement Web3 games can balance player rewards and platform profit by selling NFTs and governance tokens and obtaining royalties from secondary markets. They can achieve recurring revenue through subscription models like battle passes. Staking mechanisms encourage player retention while providing an additional income stream. Games that launch a custom blockchain collect transaction fees, and part of the revenue can go toward rewarding the best players. Measures to balance community collaboration and competition include encouraging players to form guilds or DAOs and cooperate to earn rewards while competing against other groups. The platform can introduce quests where players need to collaborate and ranking systems for competitive incentives. It rewards competitive achievements (tournaments) as well as collaborative efforts (community engagement, staking) and creates roles for different types of players: some thrive in competition, while others focus on community efforts. Engagement is tricky. While assets shouldn't be plentiful, the platform shouldn't design a game where few players can earn rewards. Critics of P2E maintain that the ability to gain valuable items undermines the essence of gaming as an escape from reality. However, people value their time, and an ""escape"" means wasting it. Earning makes gaming productive as well as entertaining. Building on achievements and tailoring a more effective gaming strategy provides fulfillment. The most engaging games can help players strategize better and even apply successful approaches crafted through patience and persistence to real-life challenges.

Ripple ( XRP ) has moved into a strong bear market, dropping by over 30% from its highest level this year. This decline happened even as the Ripple network faced numerous bullish catalysts. The Ripple USD (RLUSD) stablecoin continues to gain market share, with the daily volume rising to over $100 million. Other players in the XRP Ledger network, like Coreum and Sologenic, have also seen more traction. There are rising odds that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will end its appeal against Ripple Labs this year. It has already dropped charges against companies like Uniswap , Coinbase, and Gemini. Further, the number of XRP transactions has continued to rise this year. Data by XRPScan shows that the number of XRP transactions rose to almost 1 million on March 1, a trend that may continue in the coming months. Additionally, there are signs that the SEC will approve a spot XRP ETF later this year, a move that would grow inflows from investors. JPMorgan analysts estimate that these inflows would be worth over $8 billion in the first year. You might also like: Solana meme coins rebound, but is it a dead cat bounce? Key risks explained Wyckoff Theory explains the XRP price crash XRP price chart | Source: crypto.news The XRP price has moved into a bear market. Why? Data shows that the crypto fear and greed index has moved to the extreme fear zone of 18. This is pushing more investors to stay on the sidelines. It also explains why other cryptocurrencies have crashed. The Wyckoff Theory or Method, which Richard Wyckoff discovered 90 years ago, also explains the recent Ripple sell-off. This theory describes how asset prices move over time and the phases they follow. He identified four key phases: accumulation, markup, distribution, and markdown. XRP remained in an accumulation phase for over three years as it remained in a narrow range. Its upward surge, or the markup phase, was triggered in November after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election. He promised to loosen regulations and appoint a crypto-friendly chair at the SEC. This phase is characterized by higher demand than supply. XRP then entered the distribution phase shortly after hitting its highest level this year. This phase is characterized by indecision and pull-and-push among bulls and bears. It has then formed a head and shoulders pattern whose neckline is at $2. Therefore, there is a risk that the coin will move into the markdown phase when it moves below the neckline. If that happens, there is a risk that the Ripple price will drop to the 78.6% retracement level at $1.1395.

Saylor has never been shy about his unwavering belief in Bitcoin. His latest remarks emphasized his love for the digital asset, as he suggested that people should go to extreme lengths to possess Bitcoin. In a post on X, Saylor wrote, “Sell a kidney if you must, but keep the Bitcoin.” While hyperbolic, his statement has excited many Bitcoin enthusiasts, who believe buying BTC is the best investment anyone can make. Saylor’s suggestion to prioritize Bitcoin holdings over personal well-being has been criticized in various quarters. Peter Schiff, a well-known gold proponent and Bitcoin skeptic, highlighted the irresponsibility of such advice, especially given the financial burdens it could impose on individuals. Others in the crypto community echoed this sentiment, cautioning against extreme measures and emphasizing the importance of health and financial prudence over aggressive investment strategies. More Community Reactions to Saylor’s Comment In contrast to the sensationalism surrounding Saylor’s remarks, Uphold, a prominent exchange and partner of Ripple , has demonstrated steadfast support for XRP. Uphold has championed XRP for a long time, and addressed the comments, playfully asking how much XRP selling a liver or kidney would get. We know Saylor was talking about Bitcoin, but has anyone done the math on how much $XRP a liver, or maybe even a kidney would get you? Asking for a friend. — Uphold (@UpholdInc) March 1, 2025 Some speculated on the hypothetical value of a human organ in XRP, with one user estimating , “About 20k XRP if you find the right buyer.” Others took the conversation even further, joking about the potential for a market dedicated to such transactions. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Another user responded with enthusiasm for XRP, stating , “1 XRP could change your entire life.” Meanwhile, another commenter jokingly announced plans to go through with the sale, saying , “Alright gonna sell my liver and I’ll let you know. Brb.” While these comments were made in jest, they highlight the growing enthusiasm for XRP especially when challenging Bitcoin’s dominance . XRP’s Recent Market Performance XRP has experienced notable volatility in recent times. The cryptocurrency declined, falling with the broader market to a 2025 low of approximately $1.95. This decline was part of a broader market movement, influenced by the theft of $1.46 billion from ByBit . However, the asset’s price has recovered slightly, and it is currently trading at $2.18 following a 2.09% rise from yesterday.

Currently, Bitcoin is at a three-month low, trading below $90,000, as investors focus on identifying a potential price bottom before any rebound. Finbold consulted xAI’s latest artificial intelligence (AI) model, Grok 3, to assess when Bitcoin might find a floor. According to the AI model, Bitcoin’s correction is nearing its final stages, with a potential bottom forming in the coming weeks. The downturn follows Bitcoin’s all-time high of $108,000 in late January. Grok 3 noted that historically, BTC experiences corrections of 20% to 40% after parabolic rallies, making the current pullback a typical occurrence. In this context, the model highlighted key psychological and historical support levels, identifying $80,000 as a critical floor. In a worst-case scenario, Bitcoin could dip to the $74,000 and $78,000 range. When will BTC bottom? Bitcoin’s post-halving cycle also influenced Grok 3’s forecast. Following the April 2024 halving, historical trends suggest that bull markets typically peak 12 to 18 months later, implying a potential top between April and October 2025. Given this pattern, Grok 3 suggested the current decline is a mid-cycle correction rather than the start of a prolonged bear market. Based on past cycles, the AI model estimates Bitcoin could bottom out between mid-March and early April, likely stabilizing in the $78,000 and $82,000 range before consolidating. Bitcoin bottom outlook. Source: Grok 3 However, external factors such as regulatory changes, institutional demand, and macroeconomic conditions could influence this timeline. A similar bottom range has been set by cryptocurrency analyst CrypNuevo , who noted that the asset is likely to rebound in March, as per a Finbold report . Bitcoin in a macro trend shift Indeed, technical indicators suggest Bitcoin is flashing signs of a significant macro trend shift based on the Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator. According to data by CryptoQuant, shared by on-chain cryptocurrency analyst Ali Martinez on March 2, Bitcoin has entered an extreme bearish phase, with the indicator dipping below zero, a sign of deeper corrections. Bitcoin Bull-Bear Market Cycle Indicator. Source: CryptoQuant The data indicates that Bitcoin’s price has been declining, with the indicator transitioning from early bull and bear phases to extreme bear. This implies that BTC is experiencing a notable downturn, potentially testing lower support levels. The indicator tracks Bitcoin’s 365-day and 30-day moving averages ( MA ) to determine broader market trends. When the value moves below zero, the market enters a prolonged bearish phase or the late stages of a correction before a recovery begins. Bitcoin on the verge of a rebound Another CryptoQuant data set suggests Bitcoin could be on the verge of a rebound. Its on-chain trader realized loss margin has hit -14%, surpassing the typical -12% threshold that has marked market bottoms before a recovery. Bitcoin On-Chain Trader Realized Price. Source: CryptoQuant Bitcoin’s realized price is $99,250, while its current price hovers around $85,000, leaving many short-term holders underwater. However, past data shows that such capitulation often precedes strong rebounds as sellers exhaust themselves and demand picks up. If history repeats, Bitcoin could soon stage a sharp reversal, potentially retesting previous highs. Traders will be watching closely for confirmation of a recovery. Meanwhile, on-chain data also hint at what to expect from Bitcoin. Specifically, Bitcoin’s active addresses have hit a three-month high, signaling a possible market capitulation and price rebound. According to Glassnode data , active addresses surged past 912,300 on February 28, a level last seen on December 16, 2024, when BTC traded near $105,000. Bitcoin active addresses chart. Source: Glassnode In this case, spikes in on-chain activity often mark market tops and bottoms, driven by panic sellers and opportunistic buyers. While not a definitive reversal signal, the surge suggests Bitcoin may be at a pivotal moment, with a rebound as the next possible move. Bitcoin price analysis As of press time, Bitcoin was trading at $85,867, gaining 1% in the past 24 hours. However, on the weekly timeframe, the digital currency has plunged over 10%.

Rexas Finance (RXS) Poised for DOGE-Like Surge: 23,044% Growth Projection & Final Presale Opportunity! Rexas Finance embarks on an investment strategy centred on Real World Assets (RWAs). This focus differentiates this cryptocurrency from numerous digital currencies while providing established market connections that may enhance its stability and long-term investment potential. The combination of strategic positioning, active community development, and a strategic presale prepares RXS for close observation in the crypto market. Analysts currently follow RXS closely as they anticipate the upcoming 2025 bull run market conditions. Because of its unprecedented price increase, which mirrored DOGE's 2021 success, analysts predict RXS has the potential to deliver significant returns to its holders while generating millionaires. Stage 12 of the Rexas Finance presale offers RXS tokens for $0.200 each. The market conditions indicate an unwavering upward trend because RXS has reached 89.90% of its total funding goal. The Rexas Finance token raise has achieved $45,905,194 from a $56,000,000 fundraising goal, while 449,523,684 tokens have been sold from the total 500,000,000 available. The high level of investor participation shows strong faith in RXS's project potential. The final stage of acquisition enables investors to buy RXS before its exchange listing becomes available. RXS plans to launch its exchange listing at $0.25 on June 19th, 2025. Participation in earlier RXS presale stages allows participants to profit from this listing price, which motivates early token adoption while sparking excitement about the upcoming launch. Real-world assets (RWAs) serve as the fundamental foundation of Rexas Finance operations. Blockchain technology integration with physical assets through RXS works to unite cryptocurrency spaces with conventional financial operations. Implementing RWAs creates both a stable base for the token and new investment possibilities that promote wealth generation. Rexas Finance prioritizes security for its investors by implementing proactive measures across its crypto platform landscape . CertiK audited RXS, a leading blockchain security firm. The audit from CertiK offers independent verification of token codes and smart contracts, which gives investors peace of mind regarding project longevity. RXS positions itself for future growth in the crypto sector. The RXS project shows strong potential through its established RWAs alongside a successful presale, reaching 89.90% completion while confirming its listing date and prioritizing security measures for investors pursuing high-growth opportunities. The innovative market strategy and strategic placement of RXS create the potential for substantial market growth through 2025 and beyond, according to projections showing a 23044% increase that appeals to established and new cryptocurrency investors. RXS: A Millionaire Maker in the Making? The comparisons to Dogecoin's meteoric rise are hard to ignore.

According to reports, the group has moved 62,000 ETH worth about $138 million as it continues to gradually launder the stolen funds. The Lazarus Group, which has been credited as the perpetrators of the $1.4 billion hack that took place on the exchange on February 21, now has only 156,500 ETH remaining to be moved, a pseudonymous analyst has noted. According to X user EmberCN who broke the news, the group has now moved a total of 343,000 ETH from the 499,000 that it stole from the platform, with the user expecting the rest to be laundered in the coming days. The 343,000 ETH being moved means that the criminals have moved about 68% of the total funds, up from the reported 54% on February 28. A translated post showing the recent laundering activities of the Bybit hackers. Source: EmberCN (X/Twitter). Bybit hackers move funds as FBI raises alarm According to previous reports, the group’s laundering activities had slowed a bit after the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) raised an alarm, calling on node operators, crypto exchanges, bridges, and other platforms to block transactions linked to the group. The FBI confirmed that the hack, which was carried out by the “Trade traitor”, was tied to North Korea. The FBI referenced a report from April 2022, which mentioned that the TradeTraitor is the codename for the Lazarus Group, APT38, BlueNoroff, and Stardust Chollima. “TraderTraitor actors are proceeding rapidly and have converted some of the stolen assets to Bitcoin and other virtual assets disperse across thousands of addresses on multiple blockchains,” the FBI said. The FBI shared a public service announcement (PSA) linking North Korea to the Bybit hack. Source: FBI . The FBI shared about 51 Ethereum addresses at the time, with the addresses being linked to or operated by the Bybit hackers. Blockchain analytics firm Elliptic also flagged over 11,000 crypto wallet addresses linked to the group. “Addresses associated with the Bybit exploit were identified and available to screen within just 30 minutes of the announcement, protecting customers without the need for them to conduct repetitive manual checks,” Elliptic said at the time. Hackers trying to cover tracks during laundering activities According to crypto forensics firm Chainalysis, the hackers have also been trying to cover their tracks when carrying out their laundering activities, converting some of the stolen Ethereum to Bitcoin. Other portions of the assets have also been converted to the DAI stablecoin and other assets, moving them through decentralized exchanges, cross-chain bridges, and using instant swap services without Know Your Customer (KYC) measures in place. One of the platforms fingered for helping the Lazarus Group launder their stolen funds was the cross-chain asset swap protocol THORChain . The developers of the protocol received heavy backlash from stakeholders and the crypto community for facilitating a significant portion of the transfers made by North Korean-affiliated hackers. The development led to a vote on the platform on whether they should revert all the transactions linked to the hackers or not. The vote led a developer on THORChain, Pluto, to announce his departure from the protocol, while another validator also threatened to leave. “Validators, developers, members of the community: effectively immediately, I will no longer be contributing to THORChain,” he said at the time. Pluto added that he would remain as long as he is needed to ensure that he passes his responsibilities on to another person should the protocol find someone to replace him. Meanwhile, THORChain founder John Paul Thorbjornsen has mentioned that he no longer involves himself with the cross-chain protocol. He also added that none of the wallets that have been blacklisted by the FBI or the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control have interacted with the protocol.

The rapper has been vocal about Spotify’s unfair payout system, revealing he earned less than $45,000 from a billion streams. Tune.fm aims to solve this issue with instant crypto payments, ensuring artists are compensated based on actual streaming time—a model that offers 100x higher revenue than legacy platforms. Snoop Dogg joins Tune.fm, fueling Hedera’s music adoption. JAM token skyrockets 222% after the announcement. Snoop ditches Spotify over low payouts, choosing Tune.fm’s crypto model. With Snoop’s backing, Tune.fm is gaining mainstream attention, reinforcing HBAR’s potential beyond finance and into entertainment and creator economies. This adoption strengthens Hedera’s long-term outlook, attracting more projects and institutional interest. HBAR Price Analysis: Bulls Test Key Resistance HBAR is currently testing resistance at $0.2629, aligning with a descending trendline and the Fibonacci 0.382 retracement level ($0.2636). A breakout above this level could propel HBAR toward $0.3161 and $0.3542. 50-day EMA at $0.2442 has turned into support, suggesting a shift in momentum. Rejection at $0.2629 could lead to a pullback toward $0.2211 (Fibonacci 0.5 level) or $0.1787 (0.618 level). A daily close above $0.2636 could reinforce bullish continuation. For now, HBAR remains in a breakout zone, with rising volume and increasing on-chain inflows. Investors are closely watching macro trends and market sentiment to gauge whether this momentum will hold.

With Dogecoin 6% lower, it’s a reflection of broader volatility in crypto markets, while Chainlink can find protection if Glassnode’s Cost Basis Distribution metric is right about the important support zones. However, the trajectory of neither asset comes close to that of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a decentralized lending platform now in the second phase of its presale. At a price point of $0.015, MUTM has already netted $1.8 million worth of investment and a holder count of over 3,400, testament to a groundswell in investor confidence. The presale is moving so fast, some experts are predicting as much as 5400% returns after launch, beating LINK and DOGE gains. Dogecoin faces cyclical pressures The recent drop in Dogecoin’s price mirrors declining network engagement and overarching economic anxiety. New unique addresses created see a sharp drop to 30,815 from 1.29 million in November, weakening buying pressure. From a technical perspective, indicators like the TD Sequential are showing a buying opportunity or suggesting a rally to $0.45. Still, past behavior indicates that the asset will remain volatile. Observers identify similarities with Dogecoin’s 2017-2018 cycle where rallies were always followed by deep corrections. However, even rationalizing a surge to $1.70, the most optimistic target, does not come close to Mutuum Finance’s effortlessly compelling growth strategy. Chainlink’s stability meets stagnation Chainlink’s $15.41 price masks underlying fragility. Glassnode identifies $14.8 as a pivotal support level, with 53 million LINK tokens held by investors refusing to sell. Resistance at $16 presents a near-term ceiling. While its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) bolsters DeFi utility, LINK’s 312% growth forecast lacks the immediacy of MUTM’s presale incentives. Chainlink’s role as a data oracle remains critical, but its incremental gains are overshadowed by Mutuum Finance’s aggressive tokenomics. Mutuum Finance presale momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is accelerating through its second presale stage, offering tokens at $0.015, a price set to rise 33% to $0.02 in the next phase. Early participants locking in now anticipate a 400% surge upon its $0.06 exchange debut. The project’s $1.8 million fundraising milestone underscores demand, with 3,400 holders securing positions ahead of anticipated scarcity. Unlike speculative memecoins, MUTM’s value stems from a live beta platform launching alongside its token, merging immediate utility with long-term viability. Lending and borrowing innovations Mutuum Finance disrupts DeFi with dual peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) markets. Lenders earn adjustable APY by depositing assets into audited smart contracts, while borrowers access liquidity using crypto collateral, a system eliminating intermediaries. For example, staking $10,000 in USDT could yield $800 annually at 8% APY. This flexibility, paired with a $100,000 community giveaway, fuels engagement, positioning MUTM as a hub for passive income seekers. The imminent launch of an overcollateralized stablecoin amplifies MUTM’s appeal. Backed by on-chain reserves, this asset ensures borrowing stability while a buy-and-distribute mechanism redirects platform fees into MUTM purchases, sustaining price momentum. Analysts forecast post-launch targets of $4.50 by 2025, translating to a 29,900% ROI from the current presale price. Such projections hinge on Mutuum Finance’s operational roadmap, which prioritizes scalability and user adoption. While Dogecoin and Chainlink navigate uncertain recoveries, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a tangible path to exponential returns. Its presale, already 34% funded, represents the final window to acquire tokens below $0.02. As Phase 2 nears capacity, delaying action risks missing the lowest entry point. Investors prioritizing measurable growth over speculative swings are pivoting to MUTM, a project where innovation meets execution. Act now, secure Mutuum Finance (MUTM) at $0.015 before Phase 3 begins.

Prominent crypto lawyer MetaLawMan suggests that the delay may be due to Ripple itself negotiating with the SEC for better settlement terms. In a recent statement, MetaLawMan suggested that Ripple may be pressuring the SEC to agree to overturn part or all of Judge Analisa Torres’ decision. While Torres’ decision was seen as a significant victory for XRP holders, it also included findings of securities law violations and a preliminary injunction containing “bad boy” provisions, factors that could pose challenges to Ripple’s future plans, including a potential initial public offering (IPO) or exempt securities offering. Related News: Analytics Company Predicts What Could Happen to Bitcoin Price with Its Custom Metric - Is the Decline Over? “Torres’ decision was unquestionably great for XRP holders, but (a) the finding of securities law violations and (b) the injunction (with its ‘bad boy’ provisions) are not so great for Ripple,” MetaLawMan wrote. The lawyer theorized that the SEC might have been willing to accept a simple settlement in which both parties dismissed their objections and Ripple paid the $125 million fine. But Ripple may have been pushing for a more favorable outcome by trying to erase some of the legal precedents set by Torres’ decision. “This is all pure speculation on my part. I could be wrong. This wouldn’t be the first time,” MetaLawMan said, adding that there’s no guarantee that a judge will get approval to overturn a previous ruling. While such agreements used to be more common in the past, federal judges have increasingly resisted the practice in recent years. *This is not investment advice.

Despite Ethereum’s ( ETH ) shift to Proof of Stake and adoption of Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS), approximately 80% of Ethereum blocks are currently proposed by just two entities. This concentration undermines the network’s decentralized foundation and allows these entities to hold most of the maximum extractable value (MEV). The proposed solution would fundamentally change Ethereum’s block creation process. Instead of specialized builders constructing blocks, all Ethereum clients (like Geth and Nethermind) would use an identical random algorithm to select transactions and roll-up blobs from their local mempools. You might also like: Crypto VC funding: Figure leads with $200m raise, Ethena Labs nabs $100m This randomization would ensure no entity could predict or control transaction ordering. As per the research, this could effectively eliminate block-level MEV such as arbitrage and front-running opportunities. This approach could potentially reduce Ethereum’s current 12-second slot time to 6-8 seconds while supporting Danksharding’s future roll-up requirements. Decentralization report comes amidst Ethereum leadership changes The timing of this research coincides with leadership changes at the Ethereum Foundation. Core developer Tim Beiko characterized these shifts as “one of the most consequential turning points in Ethereum’s history” in a recent X post. If we play our cards right, we'll remember today as one of the most consequential turning points in Ethereum's history. The last few months have been, to put it mildly, tumultuous. While it's clear that many things need to change for Ethereum to win, it's easy to overcorrect and… — timbeiko.eth (@TimBeiko) March 1, 2025 Beiko praised the appointment of Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stanczak as co-executive directors of the Ethereum Foundation. He described it as striking “the right balance” between optimization and preserving Ethereum’s core values. Wang brings seven years of experience as an Ethereum researcher with contributions to the beacon chain, while Stanczak offers his background as a developer and organizational leader at Nethermind. “While it’s clear that many things need to change for Ethereum to win, it’s easy to overcorrect and kill the magic in search of maximal optimization,” Beiko wrote. He suggested that these leadership changes would help Ethereum stay “anchored to OG values while staying relevant for newcomers.” Despite his optimism, Beiko acknowledged the challenges ahead: “There’s a lot of work ahead of us and we shouldn’t delude ourselves into taking for granted that Ethereum will succeed at the level of its ambitions.” Read more: U.K. man sentenced to 4 years for illegal crypto ATM operation",News|Ethereum,EN,0,0,ETH|RESEARCH|ENA,"{'name': 'crypto.news', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/73/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",crypto_news,2025-03-02 12:15:00

We’re talking about Floki Inu (FLOKI), the once-sleepy meme token inspired by Elon Musk’s dog that turned into a billion-dollar juggernaut. FLOKI went from near obscurity to a $3.5 billion market cap, minting overnight millionaires. Early investors who threw in a couple of hundred bucks saw their portfolios swell into six or even seven figures. Those who hesitated? Well, they’re still kicking themselves. But here’s the thing—crypto is all about second chances. And if you missed out on Floki Inu’s ride to glory, you’re in luck because BTFD Coin is serving up a golden opportunity with its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, presale success, and potential for massive gains. With over $6.21 million raised and Stage 14 pricing at just $0.00016, BTFD Coin is positioning itself as one of the top new meme coins to join this weekend . How Floki Inu Became a Meme Coin Titan Floki Inu wasn’t just another Shiba Inu wannabe—it was a movement. What started as a meme quickly turned into a hyper-engaged community with global reach. Floki’s marketing game was on another level, splashing its logo across London’s Tube, Burj Khalifa, and even Formula 1 sponsorships. The team pushed beyond the meme status, developing real-world utility with FlokiFi, a metaverse called Valhalla, and DeFi integrations. The numbers don’t lie—FLOKI’s price soared from fractions of a cent to an all-time high of $0.0003437 in November 2021. That’s a 700,000% increase from its launch price! The coin didn’t just moon—it went intergalactic. A $1,000 investment at launch would have turned into over $7 million. No wonder FLOKI fans call themselves the “Floki Vikings.” But if you’re thinking it’s too late to ride the Floki Inu wave, you’re right. The explosive growth is behind us. The next big meme coin opportunity? That’s where BTFD Coin comes in. BTFD Coin: The Next Meme Coin Revolution Is Here What makes BTFD Coin different? Three words: Play. To. Earn. Unlike Floki Inu’s slow utility rollout, BTFD Coin is launching with a fully integrated four-level Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, where players can earn real crypto rewards. Combine that with a 90% APY staking system , a Bulls Squad community-driven movement, and Ethereum-backed security, and you’ve got a project with meme coin hype + real utility. The Investment Play: How High Can BTFD Coin Go? Current presale price: $0.00016 Your investment: $7,000 = 43.75 million BTFD tokens If BTFD Coin hits $0.0006 at launch? That’s $26,250 If it follows Floki Inu’s trajectory and moons to $0.006? Your $7K turns into a jaw-dropping $262,500 That’s a 3650% ROI—insane, right? This is why early-stage meme coins are where the real money is made. Now’s the time to get in before Stage 15 raises the price again. Final Thoughts: Don’t Let This Be Another “What If” Missed Floki Inu? It happens. But missing BTFD Coin now would be a next-level blunder. With its P2E game, massive presale success , and community-driven growth, this is one of the top new meme coins to join this weekend. Don’t wait for the next pump—be in before it happens.

Why did Floki Inu explode in value? Floki Inu capitalized on Elon Musk’s influence, aggressive marketing, and meme coin hype, reaching a $3.5 billion market cap at its peak. Early investors saw massive gains as its ecosystem expanded into DeFi and gaming. 2. What makes BTFD Coin a great investment right now? BTFD Coin is still in its presale phase, meaning investors can get in early before the price skyrockets. With a P2E game, staking rewards, and strong community backing, it has both hype and real utility. 3. How do I buy BTFD Coin?

With market momentum building and whale excitement reaching its peak, Dogecoin and FloppyPepe could spark the biggest crypto surge since 2021. DOGE on the rise, whales accumulate The Dogecoin price has seen a 2.47% price rise in the past 24 hours, fueled by a surge in whale activity in the crypto market. Reports reveal that whales have scooped up an additional 590 million DOGE, driving a spike in market excitement. This wave of accumulation mirrors patterns seen in the 2021 bull run, during which the Dogecoin price soared for over three consecutive months, smashing through multiple all-time highs.

While listings on major platforms often cause short-term surges, the real test will be whether KAITO can sustain this momentum or if profit-taking will bring a correction.

The weighted funding rate turned positive, reflecting rising optimism among derivative traders. KAITO spiked 40% after Coinbase launched perpetual futures trading.

Will KAITO’s Momentum Hold? Analysts Weigh In Looking ahead, analysts have mixed views on KAITO’s trajectory. Some forecast a run to $5–$7 by 2025, while more optimistic predictions see it hitting $15–$20 by 2030. However, crypto remains highly volatile, and recent gains are largely fueled by exchange-driven speculation. KAITO’s rally is fueled by strong investor demand and exchange-driven liquidity. The key question—can it sustain this pace, or will profit-taking slow the momentum? KAITO/USDT Technical Analysis – Bulls Eye a Breakout KAITO remains in an uptrend, currently trading at $2.3088, after rebounding from trendline support near $2.1369. The 50 EMA at $1.9609 continues to hold as dynamic support, reinforcing bullish sentiment. Key Resistance: $2.4302 – A breakout above this level could send KAITO toward $2.6882 and $2.9229. Key Support: $2.1369 – A breakdown below could trigger a pullback toward $1.8749. Trend Outlook: Higher highs and higher lows suggest continued bullish momentum, but traders should watch price action near resistance for confirmation. Traders should watch for a decisive 4H close above $2.4302 with rising volume—confirmation could trigger a breakout to $2.6882. A failure to hold may lead to a retest of $2.1369.

The dog coin lost 80% of its value in relation to its peak 2021 value before falling another 10% last week thus putting significant support at $0.000012 at risk. A 30% price drop in February caused market analysts to forecast a reduction that could take SHIB to $0.0000094 based on relentless selling pressure. The declining connection between Bitcoin at 0.79 and rising market uncertainty shows that SHIB has lost stability. Meanwhile 74% of SHIB supply remains under control of major players while 58% of their holders face losses. Most investors have chosen incorrectly by investing in SHIB and major suppliers control 74% of the total tokens so volatility is set to continue. All this theatrical performance creates a sanctuary for users who seek utility growth opportunities through presale mechanisms at Mutuum Finance (MUTM). Shiba Inu’s Fragile Position Shiba Inu experiences a continuous bearish market condition which makes trading complicated. The Shiba Inu coin proved volatile by technically falling from $0.00001964 to $0.0000123 in February as it stayed within an insecure support band. The research conducted by Ali has identified critical price points at $0.000012 and $0.0000094 for market observation but SHIB displays weak market trends. Analysis conducted by IntoTheBlock reveals that negative position holders among SHIB owners comprise of 58% of the entire community thus putting market volatility at risk. Listener ownership amounting to 74% triggers vast market price movements because the whales dominate the control of the system. The decrease of members on Telegram’s platform (0.32%) suggests SHIB token may stagnate in market support because participation from its community is declining. RSI maintains an unchanged value at 45.68 while the MACD trading line remains below its signal counterpart resulting in short-term bearish market behavior. A price mirror maintain its place at $0.00001405 but any move below $0.000012 price level could trigger a 23 percent price reduction. Mutuum Finance Gains Momentum The cryptocurrency world focuses on Mutuum Finance (MUTM) due to its actual presale together with practical use cases while Shiba Inu struggles for attention. The current $2 million in sales during Phase 2 adds 3,800+ participants to increase MUTM value to $0.015 and establish a 33.3% bonus for the following presale stage. However, the presale must start immediately due to increasing market interest. Early investors will reach up to 300% returns during Mutuum Finance’s release day since its initial listing price stands at $0.06. Analysis indicates that presale surplus funds will increase up to $6. 00 by 2025 thus delivering a remarkable 39, 900% return to initial investors. Mutuum Finance stands out from other meme coins because its stable value results from decentralized lending activities. Debtors secure their ETH or DAI by depositing assets to obtain interest-bearing mtTokens (mtETH, mtDAI) that operate throughout DeFi platforms. The combination of overcollateralized lending with peer-to-peer lending protects the system through enhanced security while maintaining adaptable operation. Built-In Demand Mechanisms Another core policy for growth implementation involves purchase distribution mechanisms that function through revenue streams. The platform invests its revenue into acquiring MUTM from the open market to provide it as dividends to mtToken holders. The investment quantity increases persistently creating support for long-term investors who replace ousted sellers. A $100, 000 presale giveaway compels urgency. The $0.015 starting price of Phase 2 will become prominent before additional price rises spotlight incumbent investors who profit from the early stage of this new revolution. Since traditional exchange listings approach the company the token experiences total success during its voyage. The rise of superstardom in the Shiba Inu market creates a direct obstacle to the continuous success of Mutuum Finance. Rather than enduring speculative losses and volatile market sentiment SHIB faces a situation where MUTM utilizes DeFi technologies and early tokens sales to deliver genuine profitability. Future investors who purchase at $0.015 stake price get exclusive access to the 300% launch bonus while predictions show enormous profits during the long-term period. Buy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) today in Phase 2 at $0. 015 before the price hike. Participate in the presale and watch the $100, 000 giveaway on the site. Don’t wait—the next phase will not be far away.

Cardano ( ADA ) token was trading at $0.6610 on Sunday, up 15% above the lowest level last week. A key catalyst for Cardano was the much-hyped meeting between Hoskinson and a VIP . Speculation was that he would meet with either President Donald Trump or Elon Musk, the head of the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. Odds of Hoskinson meeting with Trump rose after he sent an X post claiming that he would miss the ETH Denver event for a trip to Florida. Trump traveled to Mar-a-Lago in Florida after his tense meeting with Vladimir Zelenskyy. Sorry I'll miss ETH Denver but I had to go to Florida for a thing — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) February 27, 2025 Hoskinson has not made an update about his meeting, what was discussed, and how it will benefit Cardano. He clarified that he was not about to be appointed in a crypto-related role in the government, adding : “I will not comment again on this topic until I have definitive and tangible news that is relevant to the legislative process to get new laws on the books that enable the industry to survive and thrive in the United States.” Cardano fans expected the VIP meeting to yield substantial outcomes. For example, many have been pushing Musk to embrace the network as he tries to move key government functions to the blockchain. They cite Cardano as a Made-in-USA network with a 100% uptime, and fast transaction speeds.

On the positive side, Cardano price has formed a falling wedge pattern, a popular bullish sign. It has also moved to the 61.8% retracement point, where most assets rebound. Therefore, Cardano’s outlook is neutral, with a bullish breakout being confirmed if it rises above $0.789, the 50-day moving average, and the 50% retracement point.

This Pattern Suggests Imminent Drop To $1.1,https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-price-this-pattern-suggests-imminent-drop-to-1-1/,"The XRP price has remained afloat in 2025 despite the uncertain market condition where several large-cap assets have floundered. However, the altcoin did little to absorb the bearish pressure that hit the market over the past week. According to data from CoinGecko, the price of XRP has declined by nearly 16% in the last seven days. A popular crypto analyst on social media platform X revealed that the altcoin’s woes might just be about to begin. Here’s How XRP Is At Risk Of 50% Plunge In a March 1 post on X, crypto pundit Ali Martinez put forward an interesting projection for the XRP price, saying the fourth-largest cryptocurrency is at risk of significant downward pressure in the near future. Martinez suggested that the value of XRP could be almost halved over the next few weeks. Related Reading: Bitcoin Fills CME Gap Between $78,000 and $80,000 – Is A Reversal Around The Corner? This bearish forecast revolves around the formation of the head-and-shoulders pattern on the XRP chart on the 12-hour timeframe. The head-and-shoulders formation is a technical analysis pattern marked by three distinct swing highs, including a higher “head” between two lower “shoulders.” This chart pattern signals a possible trend reversal; usually a shift from an uptrend to a downward price trend. This trend reversal can be confirmed when the asset price breaks down beneath the neckline, which is a trendline connecting the troughs (swing lows) between the head. As shown in the above chart, the XRP price recently found support at the neckline around the $2 area before bouncing back toward $2.2. The price of XRP appears to be making a U-turn for a return to the neckline. If the altcoin does return, successfully breaches, and closes beneath the neckline, investors could see a shift to a downward trend. In the head-and-shoulders formation, the price target is calculated by subtracting the height of the pattern (vertical distance between the head and the neckline) from the breakout point. Based on this strategy, the price of XRP could target the $1.1 mark (roughly 50% decline from the current price point) if it breaks below $2. It is worth noting, though, that a strong 12-hour candlestick close above the $2.8 level would invalidate the current bearish outlook for the XRP price. Ultimately, if the XRP token reclaims $0.8, it could resume its bullish run and make a run for new highs in this cycle. XRP Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of XRP stands around $2.17, reflecting a 1% increase in the past 24 hours.

With its fully operational crypto casino generating real revenue across 8,000+ games, BitLemons is transforming the $450B traditional casino market while top cryptocurrencies struggle to maintain support levels. Why is BitLemons ($BLEM) Attracting Institutional Interest? BitLemons delivers immediate revenue through its GambleFi protocol, with $1M in seed funding and 30% of gaming revenue allocated to token value enhancement via buybacks, burns, and staking rewards. Dual audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof ensure investor confidence as the platform generates profits 24/7. The $BLEM presale demonstrates unprecedented demand, with Stage 2 now available at $0.02 and industry insiders hinting at a potential $0.17-$0.18 listing price – up to 9x returns from current levels. The first presale stage sold out in just 16 days, indicating strong market confidence in this innovative platform. Can Bitcoin Recover from $85K Support Test? Bitcoin has declined to $85,324.25, shedding 11.46% over the past week amidst market uncertainty and profit-taking. However, the 24-hour volume has surged 35.32% to $77.31B as buyers accumulate at current levels, with the market cap recovering to $1.69T (up 6.00% in the last 24 hours). Technical analysis shows critical support forming around $80,000, with resistance at $87,500 and $90,000. With 19.83M BTC in circulation out of the maximum 21M, scarcity continues to underpin long-term bullish sentiment despite short-term volatility. Will Ethereum Stabilize Around $2,200? Ethereum has declined 15.38% over the past week to $2,267.90, facing resistance at $2,400 while attempting to establish support. Daily volume is up 14.13% to $30.92B as traders navigate the volatile market conditions. The market cap has stabilized at $273.47B (up 5.42% in the last 24 hours), suggesting potential consolidation. With a current circulating supply of 120.58M ETH and a Vol/Mkt Cap ratio of 11.72%, Ethereum shows signs of accumulation despite recent price weakness. Support levels are forming at $2,100 and $2,000, with resistance at $2,300, $2,500, and $2,700. Why Are Institutional Investors Quietly Accumulating $BLEM? As Bitcoin and Ethereum fluctuate, smart money targets BitLemons at $0.02. Audited security, real-world utility, smart tokenomics, and explosive growth potential in the $450B casino market make $BLEM a rare gem. Unlike purely speculative cryptocurrencies, BitLemons offers sustainable value through its operational platform generating actual revenue. The project’s combination of revenue sharing (30% of all Gross Gaming Revenue), token buybacks, and certified security creates a compelling case for potentially explosive returns that could outshine traditional cryptocurrencies during these uncertain market conditions. Will you watch early adopters potentially 10X their investment? The question isn’t whether to invest in BitLemons but how much before the next price jump.

This low-cost rival is gaining traction among traders",https://crypto.news/can-bonk-turn-250-into-25000-this-low-cost-rival-is-gaining-traction-among-traders/,"Disclosure: This article does not represent investment advice. The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As traders speculate whether Bonk can turn $250 into $25,000, Lightchain AI is rising as a low-cost rival with potential. Table of Contents Is Bonk still a viable high-return investment? Why Lightchain AI is gaining traction among traders Conclusion Bonk (BONK) has captured attention as one of the most talked-about low-cost meme coins, attracting high-risk, high-reward investors. With a history of massive price movements, many traders are now speculating whether Bonk can turn a $250 investment into $25,000 in 2025. However, while Bonk continues to ride the meme coin wave, another low-cost rival is quickly gaining traction among traders — Lightchain AI (LCAI). With over $16.8 million raised in its presale at $0.006 per token, Lightchain AI is becoming an alternative for investors seeking solid fundamentals and long-term growth potential. Is Bonk still a viable high-return investment? Bonk , a meme-based cryptocurrency on the Solana blockchain, is currently trading at $0.00001349, up 1.60% from its previous close. Despite its initial surge, BONK has been highly volatile, with its price down about 78% from its all-time high of $0.00005916 in November 2024. Market forecasts for BONK vary significantly. Some predict a potential high of $0.00002213 by August 2025, while others offer a more optimistic outlook, projecting a maximum of $0.00053 in 2026. However, there are concerns over BONK’s long-term viability, especially given the lack of transparency surrounding its founders and the project’s limited roadmap. As such, BONK remains a speculative investment, and potential investors should proceed with caution and conduct thorough research before considering it.

Unlike meme coins, which rely heavily on market sentiment, Lightchain AI is designed for sustainability. Its tokenomics promote long-term growth and minimize the risk of whale manipulation. Additionally, Lightchain AI’s decentralized governance model ensures fair and transparent decision-making. What truly sets Lightchain AI apart is its focus on scalable financial applications. It is a practical choice for both decentralized finance (DeFi) and institutional use cases, combining utility with transparency. For traders and investors seeking stability and long-term growth potential, Lightchain AI is quickly emerging as a top pick. Conclusion Bonk is better suited for short-term speculative trading, driven by the popularity of meme coin trends. However, it carries significant risks, including high volatility and the potential for whale sell-offs. For traders, Bonk is a high-risk, high-reward opportunity that requires precise timing and risk management. Lightchain AI is designed for long-term growth and broad ecosystem adoption. With growing market demand and institutional interest, LCAI presents a unique alternative. Its forecasted price for this year is $3, highlighting its potential for steady, sustainable growth.

This innovation, made possible through a strategic partnership with Crypto.com, represents a significant milestone in bridging decentralized finance (DeFi) with traditional financial systems. Revolutionizing Crypto Off-Ramping Historically, converting cryptocurrency into spendable fiat currency has been a cumbersome process. Users often need to transfer their digital assets to a centralized exchange, convert them to fiat, and wait for bank transfers to process. This new feature from Cronos eliminates these hurdles by allowing users to off-ramp their crypto holdings almost instantly through a direct connection between their web3 wallet and a Crypto.com prepaid card. By linking their non-custodial wallet on Cronos EVM or Cronos zkEVM to the Crypto.com prepaid card, users can quickly transfer funds from their Cronos wallet to the Crypto.com Crypto Wallet, and subsequently to the prepaid card with a single click. If the selected token is not directly supported, the platform automatically swaps it into USDC or ETH, ensuring seamless and near-instant access to converted funds for everyday transactions. Bringing DeFi Closer to Everyday Life Ken Timsit, Head of Cronos Labs, emphasized the significance of this development, stating, “With this new feature, Cronos users can off-ramp their crypto assets almost instantly and spend them wherever prepaid cards are accepted. In eliminating the wait times and multiple steps usually required when cashing out, Cronos is bringing DeFi closer to everyday life. As a result, users can hold their digital assets for longer in the knowledge that they can easily withdraw funds at any time.” This new capability aligns with the broader mission of making crypto more accessible and practical for everyday use. By reducing friction in off-ramping, Cronos empowers users to leverage their digital assets without the traditional limitations that often deter mainstream adoption. A Step Toward Mass Crypto Adoption The partnership between Cronos and Crypto.com is a testament to both companies’ commitment to accelerating the adoption of blockchain technology. Eric Anziani, President and COO of Crypto.com, highlighted the impact of this collaboration: “This collaboration highlights Crypto.com’s commitment to driving the mass adoption of blockchain services by integrating innovative solutions that simplify the user experiences. We have been a longstanding supporter of Cronos, and to launch this feature together is a testament to our shared vision of bridging further mainstreaming crypto and enhancing its daily utility.” As the industry continues to evolve, such initiatives play a crucial role in making crypto more practical for everyday financial transactions. By providing a direct bridge between DeFi and real-world spending, Cronos and Crypto.com are paving the way for wider adoption and usability of blockchain-based assets. Seamless Integration Across Cronos Networks This feature is available across both Cronos EVM and Cronos zkEVM, a high-performance Layer 2 network powered by zkSync technology. Ethereum users, in particular, stand to benefit from this integration, as Cronos zkEVM offers a direct bridge to Ethereum. This enables users to off-ramp their Ethereum-based assets directly onto the Crypto.com prepaid card, further simplifying the process of converting digital holdings into spendable currency. Future Enhancements: Automated DeFi Yield Transfers Looking ahead, Cronos is planning additional enhancements to further integrate DeFi into daily financial activities. Following the feature’s launch in February 2025, the company intends to introduce an automatic transfer system for DeFi yields. This update will allow users to directly route their staking rewards and other DeFi earnings into their Crypto.com prepaid card, making it even easier to utilize crypto-based passive income for real-world expenditures. This future development underscores Cronos’ ongoing efforts to bridge the gap between decentralized finance and traditional banking, making it easier for users to harness the benefits of crypto without navigating complex withdrawal processes.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,CRO|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-02 12:51:07

BTC Price Fills Key CME Futures Gap One of the major focus points for analysts is the “gap” in the CME Group’s Bitcoin futures market. This gap was formed during Bitcoin’s ascent past $100,000 and has now become a crucial level to monitor. The key range in question lies at $78,000, and as of February 28, BTC/USD has nearly completed filling this void. “Bitcoin is getting closer and closer to filling its CME Gap formed back in November 2024. The CME Gap is between $78,000 and ~$80,700,” trader and analyst Rekt Capital confirmed in a post on X. While this downside gap is being filled, Rekt Capital also pointed out an upside CME gap at around $92,000, which could become a potential target if Bitcoin experiences a relief bounce. CME gaps often act as short-term price magnets for Bitcoin, with historical data showing that these gaps tend to be revisited either shortly after their formation or later when macro trends shift. Long-Term Target of $76,000 Remains in Play Despite Bitcoin’s rise to record highs near $110,000, some seasoned market participants have maintained a cautious stance on its near-term trajectory. One such figure is BitQuant, a pseudonymous crypto analyst known for accurately predicting key BTC price movements. Throughout Bitcoin’s climb, BitQuant has consistently warned of a potential major correction. In December, he dismissed the idea that $90,000 would serve as a reliable support level, stating, “Sorry, but no, $90K was not the dip.” Now, BitQuant remains firm in his prediction that Bitcoin will dip into the mid-$70,000 range before resuming an “up only” trend. “Are you panicking again? Panic buying or panic selling?” he asked his followers on X, emphasizing the emotional volatility surrounding Bitcoin’s price movements. Exchange Liquidity Suggests Strong Interest Between $70,000-$80,000 When it comes to identifying market bottoms, traders often look at exchange order books to gauge buyer interest. However, this approach comes with risks, as large players can manipulate liquidity by adding or removing buy orders at strategic levels. At present, significant liquidity is forming between the $70,000-$80,000 range, suggesting that buyers are prepared to step in at those levels. “$BTC ~$1.8 Billion in Bids has appeared on the Binance futures pair. These bids are sitting between $70K-$79K,” trader Daan Crypto Trades noted. “What happens when bids like these appear is varied. Sometimes price never moves into them, when it does start hitting them, it often fills a lot of them before (shortly) reversing. Keep in mind, these are bids that can just as easily be pulled away. Highlighting this as it’s an insane amount and this is something you rarely ever see.” While this level of liquidity might indicate strong support, it is also important to consider the risk of price manipulation. Large market participants can add significant buy orders only to remove them before execution, causing traders to misinterpret market trends. Market Liquidations and the Danger of Catching a Falling Knife Bitcoin’s price decline has led to a surge in liquidations, particularly among long positions. According to monitoring resource CoinGlass, over $3 billion in long positions have been liquidated in just five days. Keith Alan, co-founder of trading suite Material Indicators, highlighted the risks of trying to predict the bottom too early, a practice often referred to as “catching a falling knife.” “This is the Bitcoin correction we’ve been waiting for,” he stated on X, sharing a daily BTC/USD chart. “I’m looking for a wick to the trend line. More importantly, I’m looking for buyers to come in…as long as they don’t front run me.” As Bitcoin traders and investors navigate the ongoing correction, the market remains highly volatile. Whether Bitcoin will find support in the $70,000-$80,000 zone or see further declines remains a critical question in the days ahead. One thing is certain: Bitcoin’s price action continues to be shaped by both technical factors and large-scale market movements, making it an unpredictable yet compelling asset to watch.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|EXCHANGE|BNB,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-02 12:55:11

The Binance coin price prediction for 2028 projects a maximum price of $2,838.30 and a minimum price of $2,483.51. By 2031, BNB’s price could surge to $4,612.24 with broader acceptance in mainstream finance. After notable changes in its executive team, Binance has shown resilience and prospects for recovery. The departure of Changpeng Zhao, Binance’s CEO, who was also embroiled in legal challenges, initially caused a decline in the value of Binance coin (BNB). Despite this initial setback, the cryptocurrency has shown a positive trend. What’s next for BNB in the remainder of 2025 and beyond? What can be the future price movements? Let’s get into the BNB price prediction and technical analysis. Overview Cryptocurrency Binance coin Token BNB Price $607.5 Market Cap $86.48B Trading Volume $1.57B Circulating Supply 142.47M BNB All-time High $788.84 Dec 04, 2024 All-time Low $0.09611 Oct 19, 2017 24-hour High $610.89 24-hour Low $590.99 Binance coin price prediction: Technical analysis Metric Value Volatility 5.60% 50-Day SMA $652.82 14-Day RSI 42.52 Sentiment Bearish Fear & Greed Index 26 (Fear) Green Days 14/30 (47%) 200-Day SMA $620.22 Binance coin price analysis: BNB drops to $607.5 amidst loss TL;DR Breakdown: Binance Coin price analysis confirms a downtrend at $607.5. It lost 0.31% of its value. BNB coin has support around $589.3. On March 2, 2024, Binance Coin price analysis revealed a downward trend for the cryptocurrency. Its value dropped to a $607.5 low in the past 24 hours. Side by side, the cryptocurrency lost up to 0.31% of its value. Despite the upturn in price yesterday, today, the bears remained on the leading end. BNB/USDT price analysis on the daily timeframe The one-day price chart of Binance Coin confirmed a bearish trend for the currency. BNB/USD value depreciated to $607.5 in the last 24 hours. The rising volatility means a high chance of reversal in the coming hours. The distance between the Bollinger Bands defines the volatility. This distance is widening as volatility rises. Moreover, the upper limit of the Bollinger Bands indicator, acting as the resistance, has shifted to $699.5. Whereby its lower limit, serving as the support, has moved to $586.6. BNB/USDT descends to $607.5 The Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator is in the neutral region. Currently at 42.32 and dropping, this marks a bearish trend. The falling curve on the RSI graph signifies rising selling pressure. If the selling activities intensify, the RSI value will fall below 40. BNB price analysis on a 4-hour chart The four-hour price chart of Binance Coin confirms a bearish trend. BNB/USD value deteriorated to $607.5 amidst the growing selling pressure. The price movements fluctuated throughout the day, leading to a bearish outcome. The Bollinger Bands are converging as volatility decreases. This drop in volatility suggests market predictability. Moving ahead, the upper Bollinger has shifted to $625.5, indicating the resistance point. Conversely, the lower Bollinger band has moved to $569.2, securing support. Binance Coin descends to $607.5 The RSI indicator is hovering within the neutral area for now. The RSI value has dropped down to 51.34 in the past four hours. This trend is shown by a steep bearish slope. The current downside signals a relatively unbalanced trading setup.

The cryptocurrency value dropped to $607.5 in the past 24-hours. Overall, the currency lost 0.31 percent through the day. Technical indicators and the price charts signal a rising selling activity. Is BNB a good investment? Considering the recent price moves, purchasing Binance coins to hold them for an extended period could yield significant returns. From a five-year plan standpoint, it is projected to see a large increase, possibly rising above $4,612.24 in 2031. However, financial choices shouldn’t be made exclusively based on our data. Why is BNB down? BNB’s price decreased over the last 24 hours, towards the support at $589.3. Sellers stepped in to sell the assets; moreover, the support floor at that level seems stable because bulls successfully secured this level in the past week, whereas the coin is still trading on the balanced end of its daily price range. Will BNB reach $800? Most crypto analysts, including WalletInvestor and Coincodex, are bullish on BNB. According to Binance coin price prediction, its price is expected to cross the $800 mark in 2025, which would be higher than the current Binance coin price. Will BNB reach $2000? Currently, BNB is feeling pressure from legal challenges around its ecosystem. However, as these issues are settled by next year, the coin’s price is expected to start a bull run. As per the Binance coin price prediction, BNB will reach $2000 at the end of 2027. Will BNB reach $3000? Binance allows users to save up to 25% on spot margin trading fees by using BNB. Another factor is that users can save up to 10% on future trading expenditures with the token, which makes it a primary choice. Binance also uses a significant portion of its earnings to buy back BNB.

He said if the crypto dip is stressful for you, then you should reduce your positions for peace of mind.

Binance Coin historic price sentiment Binance Coin (BNB) was launched in July 2017 through an Initial Coin Offering (ICO), with an initial price of around $0.10, according to historical crypto market data. As a utility token for the Binance cryptocurrency exchange, it offered users reduced trading fees. In late 2017, BNB’s price significantly increased and reached its first major peak in January 2018, hitting approximately $24. However, it experienced a decline following the broader market correction. BNB price history | Coinmarketcap Throughout 2018 and 2019, BNB’s price experienced gradual growth as the BNB market soared. In 2018, BNB traded near $13 for most of the year but dropped to $5 by December. However, BNB reached above $30 in June 2019. Despite the global economic uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, BNB maintained relative stability and saw an upward trend in 2020. Due to the growing popularity of Binance as an exchange and the expansion of its ecosystem, the coin touched the $34 range in November 2020. BNB experienced a significant bull run in early 2021, reaching a high above $600 in May 2021. Positive market sentiment helped improve its market cap, which remained at an all-time high until recently. Binance Coin’s price dynamics in 2022 were characterized by volatility and were influenced by a combination of macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments around the Binance exchange, which led to a bearish scenario. This took BNB to less than $220 in June and an average price of $250 in December. BNB remained a significant player in the cryptocurrency market in 2023, recovering to about $350 in April. However, it soon lost momentum, reaching about $205 in October. In late December, BNB climbed back to about $325. At the beginning of 2024, Binance Coin (BNB) traded near $300, surged to an all-time high of $717.48 in June, fluctuated between $488 and $661 through the year, and closed December at $700.3. In January 2025, BNB maintained an average price of $697, but it decreased to $589 by the end of February. In March 2025, BNB is trading near the psychological mark of $600.",Crypto Price Predictions|Binance|BNB,EN,0,0,TRADING|EXCHANGE|REGULATION|BNB|MARKET|TOKEN SALE,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-02 13:00:00

Ethereum ( ETH ) was trading above $2,200 at last check Sunday, down by over 45% from its highest point in November last year. Several crucial charts explain why the ETH price has crashed, and provide hints of what to expect this year. Ethereum price formed a triple-top pattern The weekly chart shows that the ETH price found strong resistance at around $4,000 in 2024. This pattern is characterized by three peaks and a neckline, and is one of the most bearish patterns in the market. ETH has now dropped to the neckline at $2,150. Therefore, a clear break below that level risks more downside, potentially to $1,176, down by 45% from the current level.

And while these funds have attracted cumulative inflows of $2.82 billion, it’s a much smaller figure compared to Bitcoin’s $38 billion.

Data by StakingRewards shows that the staking market cap has dropped by 20% in the last seven days to $74.5 billion. It has had outflows in the last four straight days.

These balances rose to 15.40 million, the highest level since Feb. 1. ETH balances on exchanges | Source: CoinGlass Ethereum fees have dropped Further, Ethereum’s price has dropped because it is no longer the most profitable player in the crypto industry.

Bitcoin Prices Crash In Trump Dump Even Bitcoin whales are offloading supplies as selling pressure mounted in the final week of February while the network activity and hash rate plunged . But crypto asset isn’t alone amid a global macro Trump dump in prices across the board. The economy is pulling back to reset as an aggressively pro-reform White House administration takes the reigns in Washington. Stocks plunged over the week with a 3.5% fall in the NASDAQ Composite. Gold futures fell 2.92%. Meanwhile, the US saw its first drop in consumer spending in two years. So crypto’s woes appear to be due to shifting macro tides.

Our debt including social programs, such as Medicare and Social Security, including our $36 trillion debt is… — Robert Kiyosaki (@theRealKiyosaki) February 27, 2025 Robert Kiyosaki isn’t alone in his positive outlook for BTC. Several blockchain market analysts say there is a recovery in view for crypto markets. BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes on Thursday predicted another “violent wave” down to $80,000 before this market clears out all the sellers. That wave materialized on Thursday, and Bitcoin markets bounced off support at $78,200 and back to above $86,000 by Sunday. Meanwhile, trade volume increased as the asset made its rapid recovery, and searches and mentions of “buy the dip” spiked on social media. That may be a signal that bears went too far and attracted Bitcoin bulls to the market with the smell of fresh blood on exchanges. On Wednesday, Kiyosaki exclaimed in a post on X that “Bitcoin is on SALE.” “The problem is not Bitcoin,” the author of “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” said. “The problem is our Monetary System and our criminal bankers,” he added. Calling US Treasury bonds “a joke,” Kiyosaki referenced the $36 trillion US national debt and $230 trillion in unfunded obligations for more bloated spending in pay-as-you-go social welfare programs. “Bitcoin is money with integrity,” the bestselling financial author wrote.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. Catzilla is emerging as the next big contender on Solana, looking to match the success of Bonk and Popcat. Table of Contents Catzilla’s presale: A well-structured launch or just hype? Tokenomics: A long-term strategy or a short-term play? Community hype: The lifeblood of any meme coin What comes next? The roadmap and potential for growth Is Catzilla the next Solana meme coin to watch? Meme coins have long been dominated by Ethereum-based tokens like Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE), but Solana has emerged as a new hub for high-performing meme assets. Coins like Bonk (BONK) and Popcat (POPCAT) have delivered massive returns, benefiting from low transaction fees, fast speeds, and strong community backing. With the rise of Solana-based meme coins, Catzilla (CATZILLA) is positioning itself as the next potential breakout in this category. But does it have the fundamentals to sustain its growth, or is it another short-lived meme project? Here is how it stacks up against previous Solana meme coin launches: Meme coin Initial price Current price Growth since launch Bonk $0.000000208 $0.0000135 +6,389% Popcat $0.005 $0.2429 +4,758% Catzilla (Presale) $0.0002 $0.0009 +350% (Pre-launch) The real test will come post-listing. Historically, meme coins on Solana have performed well post-launch if they maintain strong community engagement and secure exchange listings. Catzilla seems to be building toward that, but it remains to be seen whether it can replicate the viral success of Bonk or Popcat once trading goes live. Catzilla’s presale: A well-structured launch or just hype? Catzilla is currently in Stage 7 of 14 in its presale, with prices set to rise at each stage before its listing. Here’s a look at its pricing model: Stage 1 price: $0.0002 Current price (Stage 7): $0.0009 Final presale price (Stage 14): $0.0016 Total raised so far: $2.3 million This structure incentivizes early buyers by offering lower prices in the early stages. Many successful meme coins have used similar tiered pricing structures to drive demand. Early investors who secured tokens at lower prices often benefited from significant post-listing price surges. Crypto influencer CryptoDexWorld has recognized the high potential of CATZILLA, calling it the next big meme coin. With a final presale price of $0.0016, those who bought in at Stage 1 ($0.0002) will see a 350% gain. If post-listing performance mirrors past Solana meme coin trends, early backers could see even greater returns. Tokenomics: A long-term strategy or a short-term play? A well-structured tokenomics model is essential for meme coins to survive beyond their initial hype phase. Catzilla has a total supply of 10 billion tokens, with 35% allocated to the presale, 15% to liquidity and listings, and 25% to staking rewards. The staking mechanism could play a crucial role in reducing selling pressure, as investors who stake their tokens will be less likely to sell immediately after launch. However, a key challenge will be managing the supply once the token hits exchanges. Catzilla’s long-term sustainability will depend on how well it can balance supply and demand post-listing. A strong staking ecosystem and continued marketing efforts will be critical to maintaining price stability. You might also like: This new cat-themed coin is pumping while the market turns red: POPCAT 2.0? Community hype: The lifeblood of any meme coin Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, meme coins rely heavily on community engagement to drive their value. Catzilla has already gained strong support on platforms like CoinMarketCap, where over 90% of followers are bullish on its potential. It has also raised over $2.3 million in its presale, signaling early investor confidence. But community hype isn’t just about numbers — it’s about maintaining momentum, visibility, and excitement. Bonk and Popcat succeeded because their viral appeal extended beyond crypto circles. Catzilla will need to actively cultivate a passionate following to reach the same level of success. What comes next? The roadmap and potential for growth Catzilla is positioning itself as an ecosystem that extends beyond speculation. Its roadmap includes staking rewards, referral programs, community incentives, NFT drops, and even an interactive game called CatzillaTap. This multi-layered approach could help differentiate it from other meme tokens that rely solely on social media hype. If the team delivers on these promises, Catzilla could establish itself as more than just a short-term play. However, execution is everything. Many meme coins promise NFTs, games, and community-driven utilities but fail to deliver real products. Investors should watch closely for actual developments rather than just announcements. Is Catzilla the next Solana meme coin to watch? Catzilla is entering a competitive but promising space, leveraging Solana’s thriving meme coin ecosystem to attract investors. Its presale has shown strong demand, and its tiered pricing model encourages early adoption. The staking system and community incentives add potential long-term value, but the real test will come after the token launches on exchanges. If Catzilla can sustain its hype, secure strong exchange listings, and deliver on its roadmap, it has the potential to be one of Solana’s next big meme coins. However, as with any meme coin, volatility and risk remain high. For investors looking to get in early, the presale still offers a lower entry point before the final listing price kicks in. But for those waiting to see how it performs in the open market, watching post-listing trends will be key. For more information about Catzilla, visit the website , Twitter , or Telegram News .

The latest transfer brings the total amount laundered to approximately 343,000 ETH, which is close to 68.7% of the 499,000 ETH stolen during the Feb. 21 attack. Based on the current pace, EmberCN projects the hackers will clear the remaining funds within the next three days. 从昨天下午 3 点黑客恢复洗钱以来，黑客洗走了 6.22 万枚 ETH ($1.38 亿)。 现在黑客从 Bybit 盗取的 49.9 万枚 ETH，已经洗的只剩 15.6 万枚 ($3.46 亿)了。再有个三天时间应该就会被全部清空了。 本文由 #Bitget ｜ @Bitget_zh 赞助 https://t.co/KCEhMwIsnG pic.twitter.com/alJMqyBVVU — 余烬 (@EmberCN) March 2, 2025 This accelerated laundering comes despite recent intervention by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI formally attributed the $1.5 billion hack to North Korea in a public service announcement on Feb. 26. FBI confirms North Korean responsibility According to the FBI announcement, North Korea was responsible for stealing approximately $1.5 billion in virtual assets from the cryptocurrency exchange Bybit on or about Feb. 21, 2025. The FBI has designated this specific North Korean cyber operation as “TraderTraitor.” Source The announcement details that TraderTraitor actors are moving quickly, having already converted portions of the stolen assets to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies dispersed across thousands of addresses on multiple blockchains. FBI officials expect these assets will be further laundered and eventually converted to fiat currency. The FBI is actively calling for assistance from the private sector. They’ve also asked RPC node operators, exchanges, bridges, blockchain analytics firms, DeFi services, and other virtual asset service providers to block transactions connected to addresses the TraderTraitor actors are using to launder the stolen assets. The FBI has shared addresses linked to the hackers, while blockchain analytics firm Elliptic has expanded monitoring efforts by flagging over 11,000 wallet addresses potentially tied to the operation. According to Chainalysis, the hackers have used various mixing techniques to hide the trail of stolen funds. They have also converted portions of the ETH into Bitcoin ( BTC ), DAI stablecoin, and other assets. The group has primarily used decentralized exchanges, cross-chain bridges, and instant swap services without Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements.

The company’s HPC expansion, including a $1 billion Core42 agreement, suggests significant future revenue growth and transformation beyond Bitcoin mining. TeraWulf's fully financed expansion and projected profitability make it an attractive investment, despite dilution and high short interest risks. With supportive valuation metrics and positive momentum indicators, I upgrade TeraWulf from Buy to Strong Buy, expecting a sustained rally. Bitcoin miner TeraWulf ( WULF ) reported fourth quarter and full-year earnings on Friday, and the stock exploded higher on huge volume. That’s terrific, but if we zoom out, the stock was in a sustained downtrend, that saw it lose well over 60% of its value going into the report. The last time I covered TeraWulf, I said it was a Buy-rated stock at $7.35. The stock waffled a bit, then entered its downtrend after that, which is why we use stops to limit risk. Being wrong is okay; bag-holding is not. Now that we’ve got a fresh earnings report and a much lower share price, I feel compelled to upgrade TeraWulf from Buy to Strong Buy. Let’s dig in. Support held The key thing from the reaction to the earnings report is that support was held when it needed to be. That level was a zone around $3.50 to $3.75, and the stock bounced right off of that level on Friday. StockCharts The candle is beautiful as the stock opened at the low and rallied all day. Volume was huge , being the biggest day in the company’s history in terms of volume. I can’t think of a bigger statement from the bulls than that, and it should be ignored at one’s own peril. The momentum indicators aren’t supportive of a sustained move yet, as they’re bouncing off oversold levels. But price support around $3.50 or so is the critical thing to hold here, and I like the stock above that. On the weekly chart, I do think we have support for a larger up move if the channel holds. StockCharts That channel has been in place for about two years, and it’s held a bunch of times in the past. That doesn’t guarantee that it holds, but it sure looks like we have a good chance. I will also say that unlike the daily chart, the weekly momentum indicators are indeed supportive of a larger move higher. The PPO is testing the centerline, and the RSI is testing 40. Should those levels hold, we could be in for a very large move in TeraWulf to the upside. High-performance computing drives the future TeraWulf’s earnings showed a small loss for the year, as expected. But for the forward look, it’s hard not to be bullish here. Seeking Alpha As we can see, while doubling revenue is obviously unsustainable, we are looking at stratospheric growth rates in the coming years, building upon 2024's success. Sales are set to nearly double again in 2025, and again in 2026 before leveling off. Importantly, the analyst community is now looking for a small profit this year of 18 cents. If TeraWulf gets anywhere near that level, buying at today’s price is likely to have proven a bargain. For the quarter, operating costs were up sharply, but with revenue doubling, that’s expected. The company is heavily investing in its HPC unit expansion, but also for its mining operations. Stock-based compensation is driving higher SG&A costs as well. Investor presentation The company’s hash rate ended the year at just under 10 EH/s, which was roughly double the year-ago period. However, it’s still one of the smaller miners, so scale is not at play here. The good news is that the company’s mining cost was ~$46k per coin, meaning it’s mining profitably with prices nearly double that level. Capacity is expected to be something like 13 EH/s in the near future with rig upgrades, but we’re still talking lower scale when the big boys are cresting 50 EH/s. On the HPC side, the company executed a 10-year, 72.5 MW data center lease agreement with Core42, which is worth more than $1 billion in total revenue. That’s huge for a company the size of TeraWulf, and it’s indicative of the potential here. Investor presentation The company’s Lake Mariner site is secured for capacity of up to 750MW, and the new Cayuga site should add something like 150MW by next year. Management thinks it can deploy something like 100MW to 150MW of capacity annually over the next three years. Indeed, the goal is to exit 2026 with 200MW to 250MW of revenue-generating HPC capacity. This highlights the early stages of this transformation for TeraWulf, so if you’re bullish on the stock, it means you’re bullish on the HPC transformation and not necessarily Bitcoin mining. Revenue from the Core42 agreement should add $100 million in annual revenue for the next decade, and additional contracts are expected to add $140 million to $210 million in annual revenue. After Q4 earnings and an update on the HPC strategy, I think the market’s reaction to buy the low and just keep adding was exactly correct, and I fully expect this rally to be sustained until further notice. Other considerations Any small company that’s undergoing rapid expansion requires a lot of capital to do so. One of the things I like about TeraWulf is that its expansion is already fully financed. Investor presentation TeraWulf ended the year with almost $300 million in cash on hand, and as we can see from the above, it expects to end the year with about the same amount. Now, part of the cost of this is a much higher share count over time. TeraWulf ended the year with 391 million shares outstanding, which is up from 100 million three years ago. Dilution is not something I’m a fan of, particularly on this kind of scale. But it’s priced in at this point, and to be fair, as HPC capacity comes online and generates meaningful revenue, we should see the need to issue more equity decline over time. We’ll see, but point being, this is something investors should keep a keen eye on. From a valuation perspective, we do have projected earnings for this year, but not much in terms of history to compare it to. However, we can compare enterprise value to revenue, which is below. TIKR The number today is 5.1X, which is about the average for the past couple of years, but is well off the high of 17X. I’d argue that with the company’s margins providing sustainable profits starting this year, the EV/S revenue should be higher than it’s been in prior years on the grounds that each dollar of revenue is worth more. If that were to occur, we could see the multiple move much higher over time. From a valuation perspective, I really think TeraWulf looks terrific and supportive of the bulls at $4 per share. One more consideration is that short interest is 20% of the float, which is huge. It means sentiment on the stock is massively negative, and if there’s a big rally, the shorts may decide to take profits and move on. From a risk perspective, that short interest will almost certainly drive high levels of volatility. If that’s not for you, this stock isn’t for you. The other risk is that the HPC build-out doesn’t go as planned. That’s a big risk, of course, which is why the stock is $4. The evidence suggests the odds are pretty good that the build-out goes okay on the evidence of the Core42 signing and capacity build-out, but it's certainly the principal risk here. I think the odds are in favor of the bulls, so I’m going with a Strong Buy off of earnings.",WULF,EN,0,0,BUSINESS|TRADING|MINING|BTC|MARKET,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-02 13:30:00

Analysts accordingly decode some patterns that suggest the likelihood of a big rally. The technical evaluation of what is going on here tells us about the various bullish formations. These carry a head-and-shoulders pattern as well as symmetrical triangles which are signs of a break. Henceforth, as a forecaster, a prominent analyst, Crypto Rover says the price of the ether can surpass the figure of $15,000. CryptoGoos and others are of the opinion that the price will be $6,000 in a few days. A precedent, Ethereum’s cycle registering a four-year development with peaks in 2017 and 2021, is also indicative of a leap to a value of $2,700 in 2025. Mutuum Finance(MUTM) being as a waterfall of optimism is a token attached to ETH that is gaining vast interest. Ethereum’s technical foundations and market sentiment Falling prices of Ethereum to 16%, a month previously, did not push people away from bullish interest. Analysts who are significantly impressed by a four-year run of bear markets followed by explosive crosses cannot be wrong. In 2017, ETH mooned to $1,400 before plummeting to $80. Similarly, 2021’s $4,800 peak crumbled to $900 just like that. For now, symmetrical triangles and controlled levels of resistance can be seen on the charts. The primary one is $3,200, which, if it is passed, can have ETH go through to $5,600. Additionally, Mikybull Crypto refers to a bullish cross figure at the time that the charts were showing a very similar pattern back in February 2024, which had led to substantial profits. Should the present patterns remain, 2025 not only is going to be a record-setting year but also it will be capped at $15,000 if the numbers are correct. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale momentum As Ethereum grows in potential, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) emerges as a parallel opportunity. The second presale phase of the project is moving quickly. Stage 2 allows you to purchase at $0.015 — a 33.3% discount to Stage 3’s $0.02 price. Early participants will likely benefit from a 400% return at launch. MUTM would then list at $0.06 at this time. While a fixed supply and buy-back mechanisms secure scarcity, tokenomics drive this estimate. Plus, average post-launch targets are between $1 and $10, which represents a potential ROI of 6,500%-plus if you time your entry ahead of the presale. As investors clamour for a foothold at low-entry prices, urgency is growing, with $1.8 million raised in hard and soft commitments thus far and Phase 1 tokens going, going, gone. Mutuum Finance’s Design Advantage Unlike speculative tokens, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is born with real utility. This is via its DeFi lending framework. The platform allows overcollateralized loans. However, borrowers secure collateral worth more than what they borrow; an approach to reduce insolvency risks. On top of that, mtTokens is the interest-bearing representation of deposits. Over time, these gain value and can circulate between DeFi ecosystems. A peer-to-peer lending feature expands utility even more, allowing for less mainstream assets like meme coins. Buybacks funded by revenue create persistent demand for MUTM. Thus, reallocating tokens to stakers and reducing sell pressure. This balance of utility to incentives makes MUTM a highly differentiated stablecoin alternative, especially in an increasingly volatile crypto market. As such, the tokenomics as calculated and the applications implemented in practice provide a measurable path for growth. Ethereum Dominance in 2025: A Hint From Historical Cycles Yet the momentum of MUTM’s presale, amplified by FOMO and structural demand, is a different story of immediacy. For the next breakout asset, the timing of ETH’s technical momentum alongside MUTM’s presale window is a key moment for both.

On January 23, 2025, President Donald Trump began delivering on his promise to transform the digital asset industry by supporting policies, rules, and regulations for the responsible growth and use of digital assets, blockchain technology, and related technologies across all sectors of the economy in order to secure America’s position as the world’s leader, by undertaking “Tokenization Friendly Initiatives.” These included: President Donald Trump issued an executive order, Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology, which established a Working Group on Digital Asset Markets chaired by White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks (who shared his opinions here ); The US Securities Exchange Commission revoked accounting rule SAB 121 that hindered financial institutions from custodying customer digital assets. You might also like: The focus is on strengthening US leadership in crypto tech | Opinion About SAB 121 Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 was issued by the SEC Staff on March 31, 2022, ahead of several bank failures involving exposure to the digital asset industry. It was issued in response to an increase in the number of entities providing digital asset custody services, which have unique technological, legal, and regulatory risks associated with them. The rule required an entity to recognize a liability and corresponding asset at fair market value, or FMV, for its obligation to safeguard digital assets for customers. This balance sheet disclosure requirement, which did not apply to traditional assets—such as securities—held in custody, posed challenges for banks subject to regulatory reserve requirements. The rule significantly increased the financial burden on these financial institutions wanting to offer digital asset custody services, potentially deterring them from entering the market. The rule also required entities to provide a significant number of detailed disclosures, both in the footnotes to the financial statements and outside the financial statements, about the nature and amount of digital assets being safeguarded and any risks related to concentrations in digital asset safeguarding. Such disclosures included information about who held the cryptographic keys, who maintained internal recordkeeping, and who was obligated to secure the digital assets and protect them from loss or theft. Furthermore, the rule was not easy to use because it did not define safeguarding. Entities were often required to use significant judgment to determine whether a transaction fell within the rule’s scope. For these reasons, traditional financial institutions did not favor SAB 121. It essentially created a significant barrier to offering digital asset custodial services, hindering tokenization innovation. William Quigley, who began his career as a bank auditor ahead of becoming a cryptocurrency and blockchain investor and co-founder of WAX.io blockchain and stablecoin Tether ( USDT ), explained to me: “ SAB 121 placed a significant restraint on the ability of banks to maintain custody of cryptocurrency assets on behalf of customers by requiring a bank to reflect at FMV both an asset and a liability, for which it must reserve capital on its balance sheet even though it is not the owner of the digital asset. The rescission of SAB 121 will allow banks to tokenize .” You might also like: Crypto and banking: tokenization of the global financial system is yet to come | Opinion About SAB 122 Staff Accounting Bulletin 122 provides greater flexibility to banks and traditional financial institutions that provide or are interested in providing digital asset-custody services by returning to the pre-SAB 121 accounting principles and standards in reporting contingent liabilities under [ASC 450-20 2 ] or [IAS 37 3 ] in accordance with GAAP and IFRS Accounting Standards without requiring the one-to-one asset to liability ratio that SAB 121 imposed. Preliminary guidance provided by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency around 2020 seemed thoughtful. The SEC staff stresses that entities should continue providing clear and thorough disclosures about risks, obligations, and uncertainties related to safeguarding digital assets, which agencies in a joint statement in 2023 detailed for banks. “ The FDIC looks forward to engaging with the President’s Working Group on Digital Asset Markets, ” said acting chairman Travis Hill, who released 175 documents related to its supervision of banks that engaged in, or sought to engage in, digital asset-related activities. Accordingly, SAB 122, which applies to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with elective rescission in any earlier interim or annual financial statement period, does not completely absolve a reporting company from recognizing a liability relating to digital asset custodial activities of entities. Conclusion The Working Group on Digital Asset Markets includes SEC Acting Chairman Mark T. Uyeda, who launched a task force led by Republican Commissioner Hester Peirce charged with developing a “comprehensive and clear regulatory framework for digital assets.” The goal of this task force is to regulate “less through enforcement” and more through established regulatory guidelines, paths to registration, and disclosure requirements that will continue to drive institutional participation in tokenization and broader market growth. These Tokenization Friendly Initiatives—including by the SEC task force—are welcomed by the world’s largest custodian Bank of New York (BNY), which indicated its intention to extend its custody services into digital assets, the American Bankers Association as well as “Etherealize.io, which connects financial institutions to the largest, secure, and open blockchain eco-friendly Ethereum ecosystem around the world” said Vivek Raman, the CEO of Etherealize.io.

Schlegel’s remarks come amid ongoing efforts by Swiss Bitcoin nonprofit think tank 2B4CH to introduce a constitutional amendment requiring the SNB to hold BTC on its balance sheet. Bitcoin Deemed Too Risky for Swiss Reserves Speaking to local media outlet Tamedia on March 1, Schlegel explained that Bitcoin’s unpredictable price swings make it incompatible with the SNB’s objective of maintaining financial stability. He also emphasized the importance of liquidity, stating, “Our reserves need to be highly liquid so that they can be used quickly for monetary policy purposes if needed.” Beyond volatility and liquidity concerns, Schlegel highlighted another issue: the reliance on software-driven technology. He cautioned that all software carries potential vulnerabilities, which could expose Bitcoin to unforeseen risks. Despite the crypto market now securing nearly $3 trillion in value, he described it as a “niche phenomenon” compared to the broader financial system. Public Referendum Despite Schlegel’s skepticism, Bitcoin advocates in Switzerland continue to push for change. The 2B4CH proposal was officially launched by the Swiss Federal Chancellery on December 31, 2023, initiating a process that requires 100,000 signatures to qualify for a public referendum. With a deadline set for June 30, 2026, BTC supporters have 16 months to gather the necessary backing. Switzerland, home to 8.97 million people, would need at least 1.11% of its population to sign the petition for it to move forward. If successful, the country could see Bitcoin debated as a legitimate reserve asset at the highest levels of government, despite opposition from SNB leadership. While Switzerland remains a leader in Bitcoin adoption, particularly in the city of Lugano, which hosts the annual Plan B conference, the country’s central bank remains resistant to integrating BTC into its financial framework. Global Interest in Bitcoin Reserves Although Switzerland’s central bank is steering clear of Bitcoin, other nations are actively considering it. Countries like the U.S., Czech Republic, and Hong Kong have expressed interest in holding BTC as part of their reserves, while El Salvador continues its strategy of accumulating one Bitcoin per day since launching its Bitcoin treasury in September 2021. On the other hand, Poland recently ruled out BTC as a reserve asset, aligning more closely with Switzerland’s cautious stance.

The core developer took to blogging platform X to share his optimism, noting that if Ethereum Foundation (EF) plays its cards right, it could be the much-needed turning point. Ethereum has experienced a very subpar performance over the last few months, with many questions surrounding the future of the organization. Last month, its token saw its ETH/BTC pair hit another multi-year low of 0.0023 BTC. Beiko shared his optimism, noting that the platform has finally struck the right balance between two extremes. If we play our cards right, we'll remember today as one of the most consequential turning points in Ethereum's history. The last few months have been, to put it mildly, tumultuous.

While it’s clear that many things need to change for Ethereum to win, it’s easy to overcorrect and kill the magic in search of maximal optimization. This week’s announcements make me confident we’ve struck the right balance between these two extremes,” Beiko said . Tim Beiko welcomes the new EF appointments Tim Beiko’s comments are coming after the appointment of Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stanczak as co-executive directors of the Ethereum Foundation. Before the appointment, Wang had served as a researcher at the Ethereum Foundation, while Stanczak was one of the first members of Flashbots and the founder of Nethermind. “The Ethereum Foundation is thrilled to welcome Hsiao-Wei Wang and Tomasz Stanczak as co-Executive Directors. This new leadership structure marks an exciting new chapter in the Foundation’s evolution as we continue to support a growing Ethereum ecosystem,” the Ethereum Foundation posted on X. According to the announcement, both executives will resume their new posts on March 17, with Wang expected to come into the fray with her seven years of research background at the firm, while Stanczak will come in with his wealth of experience to help the foundation. Aside from the new executives, the EF also announced that Daniel Ryan was joining Etherealize as a co-founder, mentioning that he would help onboard Ethereum to the world. Beiko reacted to the new appointees, showering encomiums on them, noting that he was looking forward to working with them. Talking about Stanczak, he highlighted his work ethic and the experience he’ll bring. “He’s built a client from scratch, scaled Nethermind as one of the most successful independent Ethereum organizations in the space, and travels the world non-stop to meet Ethereum builders, researchers, and users. I’m stoked he’ll be working with us!” he said. He also hailed Wang’s appointment, noting that she had been a hard worker from her days before the transition. “@hwwonx is one of the very few people who has been involved hands-on in Ethereum’s transition to “Eth2” from the very beginning. She made the first diagram that showcased how sharding was supposed to work,” he added. Buterin calls for young blood as the community reacts to the appointments Tim Beiko sees the appointments as a nice turning point for Ethereum, predicting that it will steer the future of the platform and the foundation in a better direction. The same enthusiasm also came from the wider crypto market, with a partner at Cinneamhain Venture, Adam Cochran, praising the picks. “I’m always a bit skeptical of co-director structures, but these all seem like good choices, and a good new direction for the EF and the broader Ethereum ecosystem,” he said . However, he added that Ethereum still needs to put in a lot of work to improve, including its communication with the world, noting that it has been tough with most members of the community feeling disconnected. The executive appointments are coming days after the Ethereum co-founder mentioned that Ethereum needs young blood that shares the cypherpunk’s vision, noting that all the OG are “jaded.” The statement did not go down well with the community members, as Uniswap CEO Hayden Adams noted that the OGs are the ones who have been building Buterin’s visions for decades. Former director at Web3 Foundation (W3F) Ryan Zurrer also replied saying, “Not all OGs are jaded. There are many who live crypto-native values, believe in Ethereum, and love what they buidl.” Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

Analyst Answers, Gives Important Levels",https://en.bitcoinsistemi.com/could-a-bear-market-in-bitcoin-price-have-really-begun-analyst-answers-gives-important-levels/,"Bitcoin’s recent price action has sparked debate among analysts, with analyst Joao Wedson expressing concerns over what he described as “the most complex distribution process” he has ever seen. With BTC currently hovering around key support levels, Wedson assessed whether BTC has entered a bear market. According to Wedson, Bitcoin has gone through a complex cycle that includes distribution, accumulation, and a false breakout engineered by exchanges. The recent price action could signal a second Major Signal of Weakness (MSOW), which could pull Bitcoin below $64,000. A second MSOW typically occurs when Bitcoin fails to reclaim key resistance levels after an initial sign of weakness. If this scenario occurs with increased volume, it could signal further redistribution and a continuation of the downtrend. Conversely, decreasing volume could signal sellers are exhausted, reducing the likelihood of a deeper decline. Related News: Analytics Company Predicts What Could Happen to Bitcoin Price with Its Custom Metric - Is the Decline Over? Wedson highlights two critical market metrics that could determine Bitcoin’s next move: Real Market Average Price: Currently at $63,800, this metric reflects the average BTC price excluding mining-related transactions. Historically, this level has served as strong support, as seen during the 2021 China Ban. Losing this level could trigger further declines. Alpha Price Levels: Wedson identified three key price targets based on network behavior: $75,500 (upper resistance) $66,000 (mid-range) $52,800 (potential lower support) Despite concerns about a potential downtrend, Wedson is cautious about labeling the current price action as a confirmed bear market. *This is not investment advice.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Dogecoin, Cardano, and Sui struggle to recover, Rollblock (RBLK) is defying the downturn with surging investor interest. Table of Contents Rollblock out to change the gaming industry Dogecoin struggles to find direction Cardano: Can it recover after breaking support? Sui facing pressure after crashing by 17% Conclusion Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Sui (SUI) are struggling to bounce back after the latest crypto market crash, leaving investors searching for better opportunities. One project, however, is defying the market slump; Rollblock (RBLK). Analysts say RBLK could rally up to 50x thanks to its Web3 gaming model and deflationary mechanics. Rollblock out to change the gaming industry Rollblock is setting a new standard in online gaming with its fully verifiable bids and payouts, bringing unprecedented transparency to the $500 billion industry. Each transaction is secured on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring fairness and eliminating the trust issues that have long put gamers off using centralized platforms. This has led to a massive surge in user adoption, with new signups, deposits, and bids climbing month after month. Investor confidence is also surging, with Rollblock’s presale raising over $10.7 million since its launch. The project’s momentum is incredible, and with major exchange listings on the horizon, many believe the current price of $0.06 won’t last much longer. On the tokenomics front, RBLK’s deflationary model is a game-changer. The platform takes 30% of its revenue to buy back RBLK tokens each week. Of these, 60% are burned, permanently reducing the token supply, while 40% is distributed as staking rewards, offering up to 30% APY in passive income. This creates constant buying pressure while rewarding holders who are among the least likely to sell. Right now, Stage 10 tokens are selling at $0.06, and with a 50% bonus on all purchases this week, investors are piling in before the next price jump. You might also like: Shiba Inu could outperform Dogecoin, analysts see massive upside for a viral GameFi token Dogecoin struggles to find direction Dogecoin has been unable to recover from the latest downturn, currently trading at $0.2052 after dropping 16.08% this week. Dogecoin has struggled to break key resistance levels as bearish sentiment has come to dominate the market. Elon Musk’s continued support for Dogecoin has kept some hope alive, with speculation that it could play a role in Tesla or X payments in the future. However, DOGE remains vulnerable to further declines. Notably, Carl The Moon recently posted that Dogecoin could break out of this falling wedge any day now, with a target of $0.43. Cardano: Can it recover after breaking support? Cardano is trading at $0.6560 after shedding 15.50% of its value this week, briefly breaking through teh crucial support level at $0.65. The Cardano blockchain has faced mounting criticism for its slow development progress, causing some Cardano investors to lose faith over recent months. The market downturn has only worsened Cardano’s position, as many traders are now hesitant to buy in. Crypto Rand suggests that Cardano is ‘respecting the key horizontal support and pushing a tiny bounce’ but adds that this is a critical situation. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson remains optimistic, pointing to ongoing network upgrades such as Midnight that could attract more developers this year. Sui facing pressure after crashing by 17% Sui , the high-performance Layer 1 blockchain, has been hit hard by the recent market downturn, now trading at $2.84 after dropping by 15.20% in the past week. Sui has struggled to maintain its bullish momentum, with investors stepping in to take profits after its recent rally. Crypto IG posted that ‘SUI is currently moving within a bullish pennant pattern on the 1-hour time frame, indicating a strong trend.’ He predicts an 85% probability that the next move will be bullish, although this will depend on Sui holding support. A break below could see further downside for Sui toward $1.80. Conclusion While Dogecoin, Cardano, and Sui face heavy turbulence, Rollblock is proving to be a bullish safe haven in 2025. With RBLK still priced at $0.06 and a 50% bonus available this week, investors are jumping in before its price truly takes off. For more information on Rollblock, visit the website or socials .

41057252,https://invezz.com/?p=2595461,1740923400,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Investing in these 3 tokens could bring new investors millions in 2025,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/02/investing-in-these-3-tokens-could-bring-new-investors-millions-in-2025/,"Analysts are seeing the potential for explosive growth in three tokens heading into 2025: Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and Mutuum Finance (MUTM), among which a wave of interest is hitting the cryptocurrency market. One presale that’s capturing immediate momentum is that of Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is currently in its second presale phase, attracting $1.7 million from 3,200 holders. At $0.015, the token will see a 33% jump to its next stage, where it is priced at $0.02, with a target launch price fixed at $0.06, an offer of 400% returns to its early investors.. Dogecoin (DOGE) faces critical test Dogecoin’s price dipped 0.20 after a 6% drop that can be attributed to Bitcoin sliding down to below $84000. The decline in new network activity, such as new addresses decreasing from 1.29 million to 30,815 since November, suggests that investor engagement is weakening. The falling wedge technical pattern suggests a potential drop down to $0.201, but some analysts believe there is hope. The TD Sequential indicator shows a buy signal which suggests that there is likely to be a dip. Many suggest that the historical parallels revolving around Dogecoin’s 2017 cycle will give way for another climb up to 0.45. However, the trade wars combined with the decreasing interest from retail investors make it difficult to achieve. For Dogecoin, breaking $0.30 is extremely important for switching from their falling hype. Cardano (ADA) eyes $1 amid strategic moves Cardano has stabilized at $0.70 after creating a double-bottom formation, a bullish signal ahead of founder Charles Hoskinson’s undisclosed VIP meeting on March 1. Speculation places the focus of the event on Elon Musk, thus rumors of partnerships that may take ADA closer to $1 are sizzling. The token’s recovery rests on breaking resistance at $0.80, a level that has not been breached since January. While network upgrades and staking rewards help bolster the case, the ADA’s dependency on exogenous factors makes it susceptible to changes in market sentiments. Success here could help reignite its top-ten position, while loss would risk further consolidation. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale ignites frenzy Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is swiftly making a name for itself as a DeFi platform integrating lending protocols, overcollateralized stablecoins, and an elaborate buyback protocol to ensure price stability. Now in its second presale phase, the token’s entry price of $0.015 has attracted more than 3,200 new holders, which has resulted in total funds raised surpassing $1.7 million. New investors are looking at realizing a 33% profit from the current price before the next spike to $0.02. The target of the investors at this stage should aim for the screamer at $0.06, which results in a staggering 400% profit. However, the expectations post-launch are even more astounding, analysts will be looking at $8.50 for the token, meaning 56,000% ROI for presale participants. The beta version of the platform, and its listing on the exchange, will coincide with the activation of the lending pools and the stablecoin system that should bring unprecedented utility right off the bat. In addition to that, the $100,000 giveaway will help these funneled ideas into the newly formed community. On the other hand, the fully audited smart contracts provide a high level of trust. While Dogecoin suffers from sheer meme-based volatility and Cardano is stuck waiting for new partnerships to buy the hype, Mutuum (MUTM) benefits from real demand in DeFi with every phase of presale, the 72-hour windows selling out quicker. Early investors claim it’s the tokenomics that do the trick: 45% of presale, 30% liquidity, and 15% marketing set the stage for spikes in demand. The potential of the crypto market in 2025 hinges on projects offering real-world utility. This is a space that Mutuum Finance fills quite well. While Dogecoin continues to suffer from network stagnation and Cardano is waiting for endorsement, the presale growth and marketing strategy of MUTM makes them invaluable. Those investors who do not participate in this phase run the risk of missing out on the unprecedented profits that may be possible from a surge in the market.

The price has faced intense selling pressure, fueling concerns among investors that ETH may not see a strong bull market ahead. Market sentiment remains uncertain as Ethereum struggles to reclaim lost ground, with analysts divided on whether the correction will continue or if a recovery is on the horizon. Related Reading: Whales Add 190,000 Ethereum In The Last 24 Hours – The Accumulation Continues A technical perspective suggests that ETH may still have a chance to bounce back. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez shared an analysis on X, noting that if Ethereum holds above the $2,200 level, it could set up for a rebound toward $2,500. Martinez highlights that Ethereum is trading near a crucial support level, which historically has triggered strong upward moves. Bulls must defend the $2,200 mark to prevent further declines, while reclaiming $2,500 would signal strength and a potential trend reversal. However, continued weakness could lead to another wave of selling pressure, pushing ETH even lower. Investors remain cautious as they await confirmation of Ethereum’s next move in this volatile market. Ethereum Faces A Critical Test Ethereum has been struggling under heavy selling pressure and negative sentiment, leading to extreme speculative activity favoring bearish futures positions. The uncertainty surrounding ETH’s price action has fueled doubts about its ability to recover in the short term. Related Reading: Dogecoin Holds Critical Support Level – Can Bulls Reclaim $0.25? Since late December, Ethereum has lost 49% of its value, and investor sentiment remains in despair as the price fails to reclaim key resistance levels. Many traders have started to position themselves for further downside, reinforcing the bearish outlook in the market. However, some analysts still believe that Ethereum could soon stage a rapid recovery. Ethereum is approaching a critical inflection point where a decisive move could determine the asset’s next trend. This perspective aligns with the few optimistic analysts who argue that Ethereum’s rally, when it starts, will be aggressive. Historically, ETH has exhibited sharp rebounds following prolonged periods of downside pressure, and if the broader market conditions improve, the same could happen again. For now, investors remain cautious, closely watching Ethereum’s ability to defend the $2,200 support level and looking for signs of renewed strength. Price Struggles Below $2,500 Ethereum is trading at $2,222 after struggling for days to reclaim higher prices. The price has been under intense selling pressure, and investor sentiment remains bearish as ETH fails to establish a strong support zone. ETH bulls lost control last Monday when the price started to decline rapidly, leading to a sharp 26% correction in less than five days. This sell-off wiped out key support levels, leaving Ethereum in a vulnerable position. For Ethereum to regain momentum, bulls must push the price above the $2,500 level. Reclaiming this mark would signal strength and potentially trigger a recovery rally. However, without a strong push from buyers, ETH could remain stuck in a slow consolidation phase below $2,500. This would likely lead to prolonged indecision in the market, making it difficult for traders to establish clear positions. Related Reading: Is Solana In A Macro Trend Move? Charts Show Potential Shift If ETH fails to reclaim $2,500 soon, the market could see continued weakness, with sellers dominating price action. On the other hand, if Ethereum manages to hold above the $2,200 mark and build support, the possibility of a strong rebound remains on the table. The next few days will be crucial as investors watch for signs of a potential trend reversal or further downside movement.

Coins like PEPE and Shiba Inu, which were super popular a while ago, have crashed hard lately, making a lot of investors rethink their bets. Especially with SHIB price going 22% down in the last month. Meanwhile a new trading platform, DTX Exchange , is getting hype because it offers clearer long-term potential, like a safer bet compared to meme coins’ rollercoaster prices. With its listing price set to $0.36, investors are set to 2x their investment. DTX Exchange: $0.18 Gem Outshines Meme Coin Decline And Will 2x DTX Exchange's current presale price of $0.18 represents exceptional value for early investors, especially considering its anticipated listing price of $0.36. The platform has already attracted over 720,000 unique investors who collectively contributed more than $15.2 million to the project. This remarkable traction demonstrates strong market confidence in the exchange's hybrid trading model, which combines traditional financial instruments with cryptocurrency markets. DTX Exchange lets you trade stocks, crypto, currencies, and ETFs—over 120,000 options total. Its fast, secure system (built on blockchain tech) handles 200k trades per second, making it a steadier choice than meme coins that can crash suddenly. Unlike many projects that restrict early access to select investors, DTX Exchange has democratized participation through its accessible presale structure. The current bonus stage follows eight successful funding rounds, with each stage seeing increased pricing – providing early investors with a 2x on investment potential from the current price to listing. PEPE Is Going Down Even Further to $0.0000084 PEPE's price currently stands at $0.0000085, showing a modest daily gain of 2% but revealing concerning longer-term trends with a 10.31% weekly decline and a 34% monthly plunge. Technical indicators suggest further downside potential, with key support levels consistently failing to hold in recent trading sessions. Source: PEPE Price, Weekly Chart, CoinMarketCap Trading volumes for PEPE have significantly decreased from their previous highs, indicating diminishing interest among retail traders. Chart patterns reveal a classic distribution phase where early investors and whales gradually exit their positions as retail enthusiasm wanes. This technical deterioration suggests that PEPE could continue its downward trajectory toward the $0.0000084 level, representing another painful decline for holders. Popular crypto analyst CryptoMasterJ recently tweeted: ""Meme coin season cooling off fast. PEPE and SHIB breaking down while solid utility projects are gaining steam. This rotation happens every cycle."" This sentiment reflects growing market maturity as investors increasingly prioritize fundamentals over hype-driven narratives. Many former PEPE holders are reportedly exploring projects with stronger value propositions, with DTX Exchange emerging as a good crypto to buy for those seeking both stability and growth potential. SHIB Price Drops 34% In One Month The Shiba Inu (SHIB) is worth less than a penny right now. The SHIB price went up 2.5% today but crashed over 30% this month – even though it’s still one of the bigger crypto names, its total value ($8.65B) is way below what it used to be, like a viral trend that’s fading but still hanging on. Trading patterns show a series of lower highs and lower lows, typically considered a bearish indicator in technical analysis. Which can be seen on the monthly chart of the SHIB price below. Source: SHIB Price, Monthly Chart, CoinMarketCap The declining SHIB price trajectory comes despite continuous development efforts and ecosystem expansions by its team. The prolonged bearish trend has tested the patience of even the most dedicated ""Shiba Inu (SHIB) Army"" members, many of whom entered during previous bullish phases. Community sentiment surveys indicate growing frustration, with an increasing number of holders looking toward more sustainable projects as they search for the best new crypto to invest in. Conclusion As the PEPE and SHIB price continue their downward spiral, DTX Exchange's comprehensive trading ecosystem offers a compelling alternative for serious investors. With its presale success and upcoming exchange launch, DTX has positioned itself as a new DeFi project worth watching while PEPE and Shiba Inu (SHIB) struggle.

One of these has been Ripple’s erratic price movements. Having soared in mid January, Ripple has now plummeted by 31% in the last month and is now teasing the $2 mark. Many investors have decided to sell up and divert their funds in hopes of better returns. Among their top picks is Panshibi (SHIBI) , a next-gen meme coin that skilfully combines real utility for investors, a philanthropic mission in the wider world and all the best components of meme coin culture, to offer something completely unique. So why is Panshibigaining so much traction and what is the Ripple price prediction for 2025? Ripple Price Prediction: XRP Faces Major Downturn Ripple (XRP) is in a seriously tight spot after sliding down by 17% of its value in the last week, now trading at a bleak $2.15. So what’s catalyzed these losses? Recent network issues certainly haven’t inspired confidence. Approximately three weeks ago, the XRP Ledger experienced a rare hour-long outage, disrupting transaction validations and raising questions about the network's reliability. Ripple's Chief Technology Officer, David Schwartz, acknowledged the incident, noting that while the exact cause remains unclear, the network managed to recover without significant intervention. ​ Technical analysis suggests that XRP is facing substantial resistance at the $2.25 and $2.325 levels. Failure to surpass these thresholds could result in a retreat toward $2.00 or lower, suggesting a bearish outlook. ​ Given these developments, the Ripple price prediction leans toward a potential decline, with network instability and technical resistance levels contributing to a cautious market sentiment. Panshibi Disrupts the Meme Coin Space The meme coin market is packed with projects chasing the next viral moment, but very few manage to combine hype with real investment value. Panshibi (SHIBI) isn’t just another fleeting trend - it’s a structured, high-potential project built for long-term success. With a fully audited smart contract, a locked liquidity pool for 10 years and a capped 60-day presale, this isn’t a random gamble; it’s a serious contender in 2025’s meme coin race. Panshibi comes packed full of utility for investors and incentivizes holding through its lucrative staking model. With returns reaching 1,200% APY, holders aren’t just waiting for price appreciation - they’re actively earning while being part of the ecosystem. This approach not only builds a stronger, more engaged community but also prevents the kind of pump-and-dump cycles that have plagued other meme coins. Adding another layer of exclusivity, presale investors gain access to the Bamboo Private VIP Members Club, giving them perks within the growing ecosystem. Combined with the 15-stage presale structure, where the price rises with each phase, early buyers are already seeing their investments grow before the token even launches. Unlike many meme coins that disappear as quickly as they appear, Panshibi is backed by a locked liquidity pool, a verified smart contract audit by Coinsult and team tokens secured for two years. This foundation has given the project the credibility that serious investors are looking for. FOMO Kicks In: Investors Rush to Claim SHIBI Tokens With over $1.19 million raised and presale demand soaring, investors are moving quickly to secure their SHIBI tokens at the current stage 4 price of $0.005. Analysts expect a 1,200% price jump before the presale even ends, making this one of the most talked-about opportunities in the meme coin sector. For those aiming to get ahead in the 2025 meme coin wave, Panshibi is proving to be a frontrunner. With limited time left in the presale and the market responding rapidly, this could be one of the last chances to buy in before SHIBI takes off.

Cheong, the founder of the crypto investment firm DeFiance Capital, says in a post on the social media platform X that he participated in an over-the-counter (OTC) SOL deal through Galaxy Digital and has collected his unlocked tokens. Even though he’s already up significantly after purchasing at $64, Cheong says he will wait to sell his SOL stack. “ Not selling a single one of them. I think it will be substantially higher in three months.” The investor is also bullish on the Solana ecosystem, specifically Jupiter ( JUP ), a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator that currently has the second-highest total value locked (TVL) on Solana after the re-staking protocol Jito ( JTO ), according to DefiLlama . Now that the CME Group has announced that it will be rolling out two Solana-based futures contract options on March 17th, Cheong says that a short squeeze may ensue for SOL. A short squeeze occurs when a sharp rise in the price of an asset forces traders who had previously sold short to close their positions, fueling more rallies. According to Cheong, the crypto market cycle is still not over, but may need to go through a repricing following the “Trump honeymoon.” “It feels like there is a severe lack and outflow of liquidity in the market lately as many crypto aside from BTC have corrected >40% in less than two months. However, the stablecoin supply has expanded dramatically since 2024, growing by nearly $100 billion to reach a total supply of $221 billion, now representing over 1% of the US Dollar M2 Money Supply… That said when the animal spirits come back as they always do, I think we have the liquidity and capital in place to push the market substantially higher.” Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inbox Check Price Action Follow us on X , Facebook and Telegram Surf The Daily Hodl Mix Disclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

According to market expert Random Crypto Pal, XRP may hit an incredible $385 price mark. Although his audacious prediction has generated debate, many are wondering if this goal is realistic or only wishful thinking. Related Reading: Solana Jumps 9% As Whales Quietly Accumulate Millions—Details A Look At The Analyst’s Bold Claim Random Crypto Pal’s argument hinges on historical patterns. He believes XRP is currently following a similar trajectory to its 2017 price surge. Back then, XRP experienced an unprecedented jump, climbing from $0.003 to $3.31 within a year — a gain of over 110,000%. The analyst suggests that this same pattern is unfolding in 2025, despite the token seeing a 33% drop in February. According to him, XRP’s journey to $385 starts with smaller recoveries. He predicts the token will first climb to $27, a target also proposed by another analyst named Egrag Crypto. From there, Random Crypto Pal sees XRP pulling back before making its ultimate leap to a three-digit price. “What is now stopping $XRP going from $0.385 to $385? Nothing in my opinion! The chart is clear!” Random Crypto Pal said in an X post. Why $385 Is A Little Far-Fetched The numbers might sound thrilling, but hitting $385 comes with some pretty big hurdles. For XRP to get there, its market cap would have to jump past $22 trillion. To give you an idea of how massive that is, the entire crypto market right now isn’t even close to that. #XRP went from $0.003 to $3.31 in 2017. Same pattern is repeating for 2025. People are DUMB if they think this is not the same!! What is now stopping $XRP going from $0.385 to $385?? NOTHING in my opinion! The chart is clear! Do you agree? pic.twitter.com/yzxgk68A3E — Random Crypto Pal (@RandomCryptoPal) February 26, 2025 If it somehow managed to hit this target, XRP wouldn’t just be another crypto success—it would become the largest financial asset on the planet, even bigger than gold. That’s a hard picture for anybody to wrap their head around. Skeptics argue that these figures are highly unlikely. Some point out that market conditions in 2025 are vastly different from those in 2017. Additionally, other analysts have proposed far less ambitious targets for XRP, with one suggesting it might cross $13 under the right conditions. What Happened In 2017? Back in 2017, XRP saw some incredible gains, which is why the analyst is drawing comparisons to that time. The token started at just $0.003 in January 2017 and shot up to $3.31 by January 2018. It wasn’t all smooth sailing, though. Along the way, XRP hit some rough patches, like a steep 62% drop in April 2017. Still, it managed to bounce back again and again, eventually reaching its all-time high. Related Reading: Avalanche (AVAX) Overextended—Is A Market Shakeup Imminent? Random Crypto Pal now sees history poised to repeat itself. He uses the recent price declines as evidence XRP is preparing for yet another major rise. Not everyone is persuaded, though, and several authorities have doubts about his interpretation. Some experts in order books said XRP is not behaving as it should based on 2017 trends. For those following XRP, the more realistic targets may be worth keeping in mind. Whether the token climbs to $13, $27, or somewhere in between, it’s clear that XRP’s future is still a hot topic in the crypto community. For now, though, $385 remains a figure that’s hard to imagine.

Experts Compare Top AI Contenders,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/can-this-viral-crypto-outpace-solanas-21-fall-experts-compare-top-ai-contenders,"While Bittensor (TAO) and the unstable Solana price chart have alerted investors, with broader bearish sentiment developing in the market, IntelMarkets (INTL) has proven to be a safe haven to help recover losses. This next-generation platform is touching high-stake opportunities for traders in its presale as the platform adds over 110,000 new holders to the community. Solana Price Trend Hints at a Potential Rebound Soon Being one of the hardest-hit cryptos this week, Solana (SOL) witnessed a recent breakdown to around $130. Over the last 30 days, the Solana price has suffered a dramatic 41% drop in its trading value. Currently, the Solana price is hovering around $140 with lesser signs of further dips. Analysts believe the recent plunge took place due to the SOL’s reduced on-chain activity. Based on the report received by Cointelegraph, decentralized exchange volumes on the SOL network have dropped by 30% over a week and touched their lowest level since October 2023. Another factor behind the Solana price plunge is the collapsed crypto exchange FTX’s plan to unlock 11.1 million SOL tokens worth $2.06 billion on March 1. According to Manish Chhetri’s analysis, the SOL token unlock could negatively impact the Solana price. Meanwhile, the recent Bybit hack is also partly to blame for the Solana price correction and crypto market downturns. This major security breach cast a shadow over the broader crypto market, indirectly affecting Solana's trading value. Bittensor (TAO) Monthly Chart In Red: Reports 35% Price Correction Bittensor’s TAO token is trading at $310.34, reflecting a 14.07% decline from the previous close. With the rising bearish sentiment in the network, TAO’s market cap has plunged by 14.01% ($364 million) in the last 24 hours. The token is currently testing the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) support at $420, with potential for further gains if support holds. On the bright side, Zuvu AI and Vana announced a major partnership on February 26 to enhance DEX artificial intelligence within the Bittensor network. This collaboration is poised to create a financially sustainable AI ecosystem by leveraging blockchain technology to decentralize AI ownership and governance for TAO users. IntelMarkets’ Viral Crypto Among Top Contenders to Beat Solana The overall crypto market condition is moving toward recovery as investors look for advanced AI projects as alternatives to the current bearish networks. Among the many, IntelMarkets (INTL) is gaining traction as the AI-powered platform that offers the best way to buy, sell, and trade through its advanced AI agents that deliver lightning-fast execution speeds. Whereas the Solana price could recover in the near term, the growing popularity around the IntelMarkets is drawing SOL whales into the network through next-generation analytics bundled with AI blockchain technology. This DeFi solution is positioned to outperform some of the most high-performing AI projects, including Bittensor’s TAO token, amid its bearish struggles. IntelMarkets (INTL) Pulls Investors With Route X21 Execution Speaking of the recent ByBit hacking scenario, lurking security threats in the market are also among the major reasons why investors are losing confidence in the market. This is where IntelMarkets ’ Route X21 comes into play. This cutting-edge security protocol addresses the growing ability of quantum computing and its potential threats to blockchain ecosystems. Through its next-generation technology, Route X21 focuses on implementing end-to-end cryptographic techniques across products to prevent security challenges. This way, IntelMarkets addresses rising concerns regarding the hacker attacks in the crypto market. That said, IntelMarkets is well-positioned to lead Solana and Bittensor (TAO) in the upcoming cycle.

The recent uptrend suggests that these cryptocurrencies might be poised for significant growth. This article delves into the potential buying opportunities for LTC and LINK, uncovering why these coins could be ready to soar. Litecoin: Shifting Trends Amid Bullish Long-Term Gains and Short-Term Weakness Last month, Litecoin saw a decrease of 5.72%, but over the past six months, it has surged by 87.75%. This price behavior illustrates volatility, with recent challenges overshadowed by strong gains in the longer term. The decline in monthly performance contrasts with notable growth in the half-year frame, signaling changing investor sentiment and ongoing re-accumulation strategies in the market. Currently, Litecoin is trading between $92.79 and $151.90, with crucial resistance at $175.60 and support found at $57.39. Momentum indicators show mixed signals; the RSI is close to neutral at 50.56, while the oscillator reads at 4.408. The balance between bulls and bears suggests a sideways trend. Traders might consider entering positions near support levels or waiting for a breakout above resistance to capitalize on potential upward movements. Chainlink Price Overview: Recent Dip Meets a 6-Month Recovery Chainlink saw a steep price drop of nearly 39.65% in the past month while showing a marked recovery of about 37.38% over the last six months. The asset experienced significant short-term pressure, yet the longer timeframe suggests underlying strength and resilience, reflecting a volatile yet recovering trend in its market behavior. Chainlink is currently trading within a range of approximately $10.19 to $22.70 with a key support level at $5.57 and near-term resistance at around $30.59. Technical indicators such as an RSI close to 28.39 and negative momentum readings point to a bearish short-term environment without a defined upward trend. Traders might consider watching for a bounce off support or a pullback at resistance as the market seeks direction within these levels. Conclusion Both Litecoin (LTC) and Chainlink (LINK) have shown strong support and accelerating uptrends. This could signal a promising opportunity for potential buyers. Analyzing the current market conditions and trends, these coins appear to offer favorable entry points. Their solid performance might suggest that they are positioned well for further growth. Investing during such trends often proves beneficial for market participants looking to enhance their portfolios with potentially high-performing assets.

MSTR's past favorable bond issuances are unlikely to be replicated at the scale needed to justify its market cap premium. Avoid MSTR and buy Bitcoin directly if bullish; MSTR's structure is reminiscent of risky, leveraged financial products from the 2008 crisis. I made a bearish call against Strategy (MicroStrategy) ( MSTR ) on December 15, 2024, as shown below, since then, the stock has plummeted 40%. Some investors are always tempted to buy a market darling after a pullback, hoping momentum carries it forward again, I continue to reiterate my ""Strong Sell"" rating for this stock and discuss my reasons in this article. My rating history on MSTR ( Seeking Alpha) 1. Quick recap and update of previous article's bearish reason In my previous piece, I argued that MSTR was an inefficient way to invest in Bitcoin. MSTR claims it is providing levered exposure to Bitcoin but if one wanted leveraged exposure (not that I am suggesting any investor do so), Bitcoin futures would be far more efficient than MSTR. When my previous piece came out, Bitcoin was about $104k/coin and has since declined to $84k/coin, about 20% decline, while MSTR has declined by almost 40%. In fact, if we compare against MSTR's peak of $543/share on November 20, 2024, MSTR has declined by 55% in a little over one month despite Bitcoin prices falling about 10%+ (Bitcoin was $95k on November 20, 2024). Bitcoin prices (stockchart.com) Declining 40-55% in two to three months despite much smaller fluctuations in the underlying asset is mind-boggling and further supports my view that even if an investor were very bullish on Bitcoin, MSTR is a very inefficient and risky way to gain exposure. 2. MSTR is still way overvalued If we take a closer look, MSTR currently holds around 500k Bitcoins , which is worth roughly $42.2 billion at latest market prices of $84.5k/coin. MSTR has roughly $7 billion debt on Dec-24 balance sheet. Let's say Bitcoin is relatively flat for next 5 years, then this debt will have to be paid, leaving MSTR shareholders with $35 billion of net assets. The market cap is currently $66 billion which is of almost double net assets - a premium of around $31 billion (90%). So anyone buying into MSTR needs Bitcoin to double just to breakeven over the long run at the current $255/share (those investors that bought in the $300s/$400s/$500/share would need Bitcoin to go up even more to breakeven). The above assumes MSTR's underlying software business has 0 value (which is quite generous given that it has been oscillating between loss-making and slightly profitable for the past decade. 3. MSTR's past financing accomplishments may not be reflective of future market conditions Historically, MSTR has been able to issue bonds at very low-interest rates and this has been one of MSTR's selling propositions. Indeed, this is why many investors are bullish on the stock. But there's a glitch. A: MSTR is not getting money for free despite low stated interest rates. Below is a summary of MSTR's bond issuances from its Dec-24 SEC filing. While the stated interest rates are low, the initial conversion price (or strike price) by now is below market price. Were these convertible noteholders to convert to equity now (which they cannot yet as they have not reached the earliest conversion date), then it would dilute existing shareholders. To take the example of the 2028 Convertible Notes of $1.01 billion issued in September, were these converted to equity at $183.19/share, this would increase shares outstanding by 5 million (roughly 2% of outstanding shares). So looking at the stated interest rate is only one side of the coin - convertible note holders are not providing this money for free, they are getting something in return. MSTR bond list (MSTR 10-k) B. Now, even if we take a leap of faith and believe that MSTR is somehow profiting from convertible note holders' eagerness to get exposure to Bitcoin. Some commentators have suggested that MSTR is actually in the business of selling volatility . To justify the premium between its market cap and net assets, MSTR would need to issue bonds on a gargantuan scale to capture $31 billion for its existing shareholders. And that would only just make current shareholders whole. Let's do a rough estimate - given 10 year treasury yields are at 4.2%, let's assume a company like MicroStrategy would raise money on the open market for 8% interest a year. A 5 year period is 40% cumulative interest (without compounding). Let's assume MicroStrategy is able to issue these bonds at 0% interest with potential conversion rights at strike prices above market price (i.e. out of the money) and the stock price does not reach the strike price, then basically MicroStrategy got to use the proceeds for free. In order to gain $30 billion of value, MicroStrategy would need to issue $75 billion of bonds at these favorable conditions with these favorable results. So far, MSTR has only issued a billion or two of convertible notes here and there. Maybe there's the odd buyer who finds these interesting additions to their portfolio, and maybe it's really a good deal for MSTR. But can it be replicated up to the scale of $75 billion at these terms? I'm skeptical. When markets are giddy, it always sounds easy, but when the market hits a snag, like recently with market favorites such as Tesla ( TSLA ) seeing their stock prices fall from $490/share to $292/share in 2 months, the bullish animal spirits vanish and there is less demand for 0% convertible notes to invest in a company that goes all-in Bitcoin. Three months ago, that may have sounded exciting to certain investors, but once risk appetite vanishes, it sounds well, a lot less tantalizing. C. MSTR's recent issuance has performed poorly. MSTR's recent issuance in November of $2.6 billion convertible notes with a $ 660+ strike and having its stock price halve to $255, I would surmise that the next lender would not be so generous on its terms with MSTR, and if the next lender charges MSTR ""market rates"" of either 8% interest or a substantially lower strike price for conversion, then MSTR is unable to transfer value from bondholders to shareholders by selling volatility, then I don't see how MSTR will be able to justify its premium to net assets, much less grow its market cap sustainably. In short, hoping that bondholders will be able to provide unlimited amounts of free money just to give investors in their portfolio ""optionality"" of bitcoin exposure is not a business model. Even if MSTR cinches a deal or two at $1 billion or $2 billion (and recent deals have been poorly performing), I highly doubt this can be replicated on a $75 billion+ level (which is what the current stock price is implying). 4. Bitcoin sentiment indicates Bitcoin prices may be in for a rough patch My recent piece on an indicator of Bitcoin sentiment suggests that Bitcoin might be in for a rough patch. As discussed in the above paragraph, MSTR requires almost perfect conditions (in terms of financing and Bitcoin price appreciation) to even start justifying its market cap premium to net assets. Were market enthusiasm for Bitcoin to dampen or Bitcoin prices to range sidewards for a couple of months, MSTR's stock price could drop dramatically as it may become priced closer to net asset value rather than expectations of raising huge amounts at near nil interest rates and ploughing it into soaring Bitcoin prices. Since my previous piece, Bitcoin prices have slumped as they have often done when sentiment is jiggy. 5. Sum of the above MSTR is trading at a substantial premium to net asset value and would need either (i) massive Bitcoin price gains or (ii) massive value transfer from issuing bonds at favorable terms to justify. If either does not materialize, then even if Bitcoin prices remain at current levels (and that itself is a big if, given Bitcoin's volatile historical record), MSTR has substantial downside risk. Risks to bearish thesis Now it could be possible (though I would argue very improbable) that MSTR issues massive amounts of bonds at favorable conditions. Who knows, there could be the off-chance that the Fed massively lowers interest rates and MSTR is able to raise hundreds of billions of dollars at minimal interest to plough into Bitcoin and keep the gravy train going for its shareholders. Conclusion: Avoid MSTR and buy Bitcoin directly if an investor is bullishly inclined. Ironically Michael Saylor compared Bitcoin to Manhattan real estate , and even if this is true, MSTR rather reminds me of the CDO squared subprime debt in the 2008 financial crisis. While the underlying asset (house prices in America) eventually came back and hit record highs, the CDO squared holders were wiped out in the liquidity crunch. CDOs are the cautionary tale of leverage and opacity: Too much leverage packed into an opaque structure assuming too many things need to operate perfectly may not survive a downturn even if the underlying asset eventually recovers and does well.",MSTR,EN,0,0,BTC|MARKET|TRADING|BUSINESS|REGULATION,"{'name': 'Seeking Alpha', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/seekingalpha.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",seekingalpha,2025-03-02 15:42:03

As memecoins lose strength, traders are searching for a safer investment. DTX Exchange stands out; its listing price is set at $0.36, giving investors a clear 2X gain before trading starts. Buyers still have a final chance to enter at $0.18, securing a strong position before demand increases. With the LIST2X bonus, investors can receive extra tokens, making this the best time to prepare for the upcoming launch. DTX is proving to be a safe haven, offering stability in a market full of doubt. DTX Exchange: A Safe Haven in a Shaken Market DTX Exchange has become a top choice for investors looking for stability. While many tokens struggle with sudden drops, DTX has strong liquidity reserves that keep the market balanced. This prevents extreme price movements and makes trading smoother, even during market downturns. As a result, traders see DTX as a safer place to hold their assets while other projects remain unpredictable. The LIST2X bonus gives early investors a major advantage. Instead of waiting for price increases, buyers get double the tokens immediately, securing twice the potential returns before the official listing. Since the listing price is already set at $0.36, this gives a clear path to 4X gains for those who get at $0.18 and apply the “LIST2X” code. As supply becomes more limited, the value of holding DTX will only grow. DTX Exchange is built for long-term security. The platform has been fully audited by SolidProof, giving investors confidence in its safety. It also uses on-chain verification, allowing traders to track their transactions in real-time. While some projects rely on speculation, DTX focuses on transparency, ensuring users know exactly what’s happening at all times. Investors in DTX get more than just price gains. Holding DTX comes with profit-sharing opportunities, where large holders can earn rewards from trading fees. The platform also offers governance rights, allowing investors to help shape future upgrades. With the listing approaching fast, this is the final opportunity to secure a position before DTX reaches the broader market. SHIB Holders Are Selling Fast; Where Will the Price Go? In the past few months, the SHIB price has been dropping as big investors continue selling. One whale sold 250 billion SHIB for $6.05 million, taking profit after holding for years. This investor had bought 15.28 trillion SHIB for just $3,800 back in 2020, and at its peak, it was worth $1.22 billion. Even after selling, the whale still holds 2.15 trillion SHIB, worth $52.18 million. Many traders are now watching to see what happens next. If more whales start selling, SHIB prices could fall even more. But if buying demand increases, SHIB might find support and recover. The next few days will be important in deciding where SHIB goes from here. Dogecoin Price Drops, Will It Recover? The Dogecoin price has dropped 8% in the last 24 hours, now trading below $0.40 as selling increases. A big part of this drop comes from a market-wide sell-off, with $201 million liquidated across crypto markets, making it harder for Dogecoin price to hold its ground. Right now, Dogecoin is currently trading at $0.2064 and traders are watching if the Dogecoin price can stay above $0.335, which is a key support level. Source: CoinMarketCap Even though the Dogecoin price is falling, trading volume is increasing, meaning some traders believe a rebound could happen. But with fewer people buying on Coinbase, some experts think the Dogecoin price could fall to $0.30 before it recovers. If demand picks up, analysts say DOGE might aim for $0.50 in the coming months. Conclusion The Dogecoin price is falling, and SHIB is also struggling as big holders continue selling. DTX Exchange offers something different, giving investors a way to earn from platform activity through its rebate system. With the listing price set at $0.36, this is the last chance to buy at $0.18 before trading starts. LIST2X gives buyers a 100% bonus, making it a great time to secure more before DTX launches on major exchanges.

An ETF could attract institutional inflows and fuel higher demand, but regulatory issues still loom, making more extreme projections seem uncertain. Meanwhile, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gained significant traction by offering a real-utility, decentralized lending protocol—free from the speculation overshadowing XRP’s legal challenges. Priced at $0.015 during Phase 2 of its presale, the project has already raised over $1.7 million and drawn 3,500 investors. Projections hint that MUTM could climb as high as $14 in the next bull run, delivering gains of over 19,000%. Investors entering Phase 2 are set to see a 33% gain when the price moves to $0.02 in Phase 3 and a 300% profit at launch. XRP’s next major move: can Ripple reach new records? At $2.71, XRP stands at a crossroads, influenced by both unresolved SEC concerns and optimism surrounding a potential ETF. Its cross-border payment tools remain a boon for banks and remittance services, but investor sentiment depends heavily on legal outcomes. An approved XRP ETF would open the door for considerable new capital, possibly raising the token’s price far beyond its current range. However, without a decisive legal resolution, many are now turning to DeFi upstarts like Mutuum Finance, which is already securing backing in its early stages. Mutuum Finance Mutuum Finance is innovating within DeFi, delivering a user-friendly and secure platform where investors can earn passive returns, and borrowers can acquire liquidity without liquidating their assets. Its dual lending model accommodates both traditional lending (peer-to-contract) and direct negotiations (peer-to-peer), making borrowing and lending easier to manage. The ongoing presale offers tokens at $0.015 (Phase 2), with early participants poised to reap 300% gains once the token lists at $0.06. Experts see even larger potential, projecting the token could eclipse $14 by 2025. With over $1.7 million raised and 3,500 investors involved, the presale’s momentum is robust. Approximately 45.5% of the token’s 4 billion supply is allocated to the community, indicating a structured approach for stable growth and sustained demand. Key growth catalysts and ecosystem expansion • Beta platform release: Mutuum Finance plans to release its beta lending platform alongside the token’s listing, giving immediate use and spurring broad adoption. • USD-pegged stablecoin: Soon, a fully collateralized stablecoin will launch on Ethereum, providing a reliable, on-chain asset within the ecosystem and steering clear of the volatility common in algorithmic stablecoins. • Exchange listings and market recognition: Upcoming listings on centralized and decentralized exchanges will likely drive up liquidity and visibility, enhancing MUTM’s growth potential. In addition, Mutuum Finance is running a $100,000 giveaway to reward early adopters, issuing $10,000 in MUTM to each of 10 winners. This initiative expands community engagement and adds momentum to an already dynamic presale. While XRP’s future success hinges on ETF approval and legal clarity, Mutuum Finance stands out by offering tangible DeFi utility and real demand. With Phase 2 priced at $0.015 and a next-phase price of $0.02 looming, many see this as an ideal chance to lock in lower prices before the token matures. For long-term investors aiming to capitalize on DeFi’s next wave, Mutuum Finance appears to be an opportunity with significant upside in 2025.

Although many digital assets headed north after his latest interaction in his own social media, the trio that he named literally exploded. His post relates to the crypto reserve promises that he made during his presidential campaign, which was initially believed to consist only of bitcoin. However, after lobbying from numerous US-based crypto companies, such as Ripple and its CEO, Brad Garlinghouse, rumors emerged that he might include such assets as well. His executive order on the matter didn’t shed much light when it was first signed , but his post from less than an hour ago did. It namedrops SOL, ADA, and XRP, all of which are from companies that are based in the States. Somewhat expected, the prices of all three skyrocketed immediately. XRP went up by over 20% at one point, from under $2.3 to over $2.6. Solana gained 15%, shooting past $160 for the first time since last week’s crash. Cardano’s native token took the main stage with a 32% surge that pushed it to a multi-day peak of its own of over $0.8. Other crypto assets, including BTC, also reacted well to Trump’s statement.

ETH Price Charts Give The Real Answer,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/is-binance-secretly-nuking-the-crypto-market-eth-price-charts-give-the-real-answer,"The Binance (BNB) coin price has been on a downward trend since last Friday. The ETH price is also down by 10%, and it is struggling to cross the $2,500 level. The bear market has affected all top altcoins. Experts say ETH and BNB are under pressure because of the fallout from Bybit’s $1.4 billion exploit last week. Ethereum news has confirmed that the hack resulted in the theft of approximately 401,347 Ether (ETH), along with other staked Ether tokens The Binance (BNB) price dropped as customers shifted funds off centralized exchanges because of the ByBit security breach. Once DTX Exchange launches its trading platform, it will offer unmatched security and reliability, as decentralization is central to its purpose. It will offer the speed and efficiency of centralized exchanges, but as a DeFi project, there will be no possibility of a hack like the one that Bybit has faced. Additionally, the prospect of 200% gains with the upcoming listing of DTX Exchange is also driving massive hype for the DeFi project. Binance (BNB) Coin To Rebound and Hit $680 The Bybit hack has rocked the entire crypto market as it is the biggest crypto heist in history. Naturally, top altcoins like Binance (BNB) are reeling from the aftereffects, especially as trust in centralized exchanges has been shaken. Ethereum news said Binance even transferred ETH in emergency support to Bybit within hours of the attack, and the BNB price reacted positively, but as customers started shifting funds off Binance, the BNB price came crashing down. There are concerns about the hack's effect on Binace’s reserves, and daily transactions have been reduced on the platform, impacting BNB’s value accrual through staking and trading fee incentives. Key stakeholders of the BNB Chain ecosystem have advised the community to hold their positions, hopefully easing selling pressure. Key experts say the Binance (BNB) price will attempt a rebound toward $680, and technicals show that bullish traders are holding rather than capitulating. Once investor interest returns, the rebound is imminent unless negative catalysts emerge. The Binance (BNB) coin will meet resistance at $640, and potential recovery above this will invalidate further downside risks. Bearish Market Sentiment for Ethereum Because of Stolen 400,000 ETH As per Ethereum news, the ETH price dropped after the Bybit hack was announced. More than $1.44 billion worth of Ethereum-based assets were stolen, and demand for it was expected to help the ETH price. Bybit decided against buying Ethereum to settle market withdrawals and chose to leverage bridge loans. The ETH price dropped 6% when Ethereum news announced the hack and fell below $2,400 yesterday. The ETH price was on its way to recovering to $2,900, but if Bybit had bought it to refund customers, the ETH price would have been boosted. Post the hack, Ethereum news has confirmed that the ETH price has fallen below its support at $2,560 and could see a daily candlestick close at $2,200. The ETH price is currently moving downwards towards support at $2,320. Ethereum news confirmed that the ETH price is subdued by bearish sentiment because of the hack, as a massive supply of it is in the hands of the Lazarus group. As per Ethereum news, the Lazarus group is a notorious North Korean hacking collective. DTX Exchange: Decentralized, Dynamic and Disruptive In light of the recent Bybit hack, it is evident that the future lies with decentralized exchanges. Since conventional financial instruments have a substantially more significant market size than crypto assets, traditional assets must find their space on decentralized exchanges. You cannot match the security, immutability, and reliability of DeFI, which is why DTX Exchange’s use case has massive growth potential. DTX Exchange will ensure that the fragmented financial world can work together by merging centralized and decentralized trade. Of course, a world-class use case with solid fundamentals means that DTX is also a top investment choice. Its token will be listed at double its current price, and there is no other crypto asset that is guaranteeing these sort of returns. With legacy altcoins like Binance (BNB) and Ethereum struggling in this bear market, DTX Exchange is gaining traction as the best altcoin out there. Additionally, what makes the proposition even better for investors is that DTX is offering a minimum 200% gains for participants in the current final round. This means that tokens bought at $0.18 will list at $0.36 and if projections follow, it would not be surprising to see prices hit $10.

This initiative signifies a strategic effort to strengthen the nation’s digital asset sector and counteract previous regulatory challenges. Establishing the U.S. Crypto Reserve On January 23, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to establish a Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets. This group’s primary objectives include evaluating the potential for a national digital asset stockpile and formulating clear regulations for the cryptocurrency industry. The executive order explicitly bans federal agencies from promoting or establishing central bank digital currencies and reverses previous administration policies on digital assets. Selection of XRP, Solana, and Cardano In his recent announcement, President Trump specified that the U.S. Crypto Reserve would include XRP, SOL, and ADA. These cryptocurrencies were selected to diversify and strengthen the nation’s digital asset holdings. Strategic Implications of the Inclusion The inclusion of these specific cryptocurrencies reflects a strategic approach to embracing blockchain technologies that offer diverse functionalities: XRP : Known for its efficient cross-border payment solutions, XRP can enhance the speed and reduce the cost of international transactions. Solana (SOL) : Recognized for its high-performance blockchain supporting decentralized applications (dApps) and crypto-assets at scale, Solana offers fast transaction speeds and low fees. Cardano (ADA) : A blockchain platform for changemakers, innovators, and visionaries, Cardano aims to redistribute power from unaccountable structures to individuals. By incorporating these assets, the U.S. aims to position itself at the forefront of digital innovation, leveraging the unique strengths of each platform. Responding to Previous Regulatory Challenges This initiative also serves as a response to what President Trump characterized as previous regulatory pressures on the crypto industry. By establishing a national crypto reserve, the administration aims to provide a more supportive environment for digital assets, fostering innovation and economic growth within the sector. Future Outlook The establishment of the U.S. Crypto Reserve marks a pivotal moment in the nation’s approach to digital assets. As the working group develops regulatory frameworks and explores the potential of a national digital asset stockpile, the inclusion of XRP, Solana, and Cardano signals a commitment to embracing diverse blockchain technologies. This move is expected to encourage further adoption and integration of cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system, solidifying the United States’ leadership in the digital economy. In summary, President Trump’s proposal to include XRP, Solana, and Cardano in the U.S. Crypto Reserve represents a strategic effort to strengthen the nation’s digital asset sector, counteract previous regulatory challenges, and position the United States as a leader in the rapidly evolving digital economy.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,ADA|SOL|FIAT|XRP|BTC,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-02 15:59:37

During its ongoing presale Phase 2 users can purchase MUTM tokens at $0.015 apiece after the project succeeded in collecting $2 million from more than 3,800 token holders. Research analysts confirm that MUTM’s growth follows from a special buy-and-distribute approach that transforms platform earnings into ongoing token purchases that drive ongoing demand. The volatile cryptocurrency market positions MUTM as a leading asset because experts anticipate it reaching $5 in 2025 and $20 in 2028 and $50 in 2030. Presale Momentum Accelerates The market attractive Phase 2 launch of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) attracts numerous investors who acquire tokens at 33% below the future Price 3 estimate of $0.02. Participants who join at the current $0.015 presale entry point can obtain future gains after stage activation because the entry price remains open for a restricted time period. Fundraising through the presale process stepped up rapidly because investors demonstrate rising faith in the project’s lending capabilities that enable both margin loans against sufficient deposits and yield opportunities across liquidity pools. Mutuum Finance introduces mtTokens that function as earning assets from deposits including ETH or DAI while maintaining an interest-bearing status. Holders earn passive earnings from token accumulation that simultaneously boosts the platform liquidity levels. The complete sellout of Phase 1 during the presale demonstrate how such features drive accelerated sales. Market analysts warn that late entry will potentially lead investors to miss anticipated 300% token value increases which remain true to established rules of tokenomics instead of hyped speculation. Tokenomics Drive Unmatched ROI Potential The sustainable economic cycle of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) spends 20% of its platform fee revenue to buy tokens automatically. Through procurement of MUTM tokens individuals can provide distribution to mtToken holders so they maintain investment longevity while averting market sell-offs. The system obtains stable prices through this mechanism which also enhances market growth opportunities. The first investors who acquired MUTM for $0.015 would earn up to 300% more when the platform started while analysts predict a potential price rise to $8 during future market adoption. Mainstream decentralized finance tokens demonstrate that Mutuum Finance (MUTM) includes important architectural benefits. The combination of received payouts and money-based lending allows users to unilaterally request system features. Project participants receive ongoing $100,000 prize distributions during the presale phase to boost awareness and build trust. Long-Term Trajectory Anchored in Utility Mutuum Finance (MUTM) price predictions depend on its successful disruption of conventional lending systems in financial markets. Representing $5 by 2025 will become possible for the token when it starts integrating with decentralized loans and cross-platform mtToken services. Institutional DeFi interest during the coming years will drive MUTM prices towards $20 by 2028. If pervasive market adoption of its overcollateralized stablecoin alongside peer-to-peer lending features occurs by 2030 it could push MUTM prices to reach $50 elevating them by 3,233% from the current presale point. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) establishes the foundation of ecosystem stability by rejecting speculative assets which might disrupt its overall stability. Mutual Finance allows its interest rates to fluctuate automatically based on market dynamics between loan providers and loans takers. Mutuum Finance uses external security audits which increases its credibility by resolving investor issues frequently seen in new development projects. Through MUTM users can discover a new approach to retaining DeFi value that unites useful functionality with financial rewards. The opportunity to purchase tokens for $0.015 exists only through time remaining in Phase 2 before expiration. The opportunity to gain access to one of the most thoughtfully constructed growth models of the sector becomes unavailable to those who delay their participation. Investors need to act right away since the upcoming price increase will modify all entry barriers into the system.

A sharp decline in user activity and capital outflows has left SOL grappling with growing skepticism. Data from Glassnode reveals a 40% drop in weekly active addresses since November 2024, coupled with a 29% Solana price plunge over the past month. The collapse of high-profile meme coins like Libra, which erased $4 billion in investor funds after insiders drained $107 million in liquidity, has accelerated the erosion of trust. Meanwhile, DTX Exchange (DTX) is capitalizing on this shift, drawing investors to its presale with a 200% profit guarantee at listing and predictions of a colossal surge in 2025. Launched a few months ago, the presale has entered its bonus round with a raise of $15.1 million and high demand. The SOL alternative is the talk of the town as it provides Solana-like gains with a very low investment cost. Though the market is tumbling, the DTX Exchange remains invincible with its high ROI and unique features, thereby providing investors with a haven. DTX Exchange Becomes SOL Alternate: The Gem Surges 800%! As the Solana price falters, DTX Exchange (DTX) emerges as a magnet for disillusioned investors. The hybrid project has raised $15.1 million in its ongoing bonus presale phase, attracting investors at the current price of $0.18. The SOL alternative provides its holders with massive benefits at a very low investment cost without the fear of market volatility. DTX Exchange has emerged as a rapidly growing project within the crypto market which attracts institutional investments. Since its initial presale phase, the DTX native token has experienced an 800% value increase reaching $0.18 per token during current trading markets. The substantial growth of the DTX Exchange has gained considerable interest from retail and institutional investors who see it as a future top exchange token. The platform goes beyond basic cryptocurrency capabilities to represent the upcoming standard of trading operations. DTX uses its proprietary hybrid Layer-1 blockchain platform to provide users with fast trades, improved security measures along fluid integration capabilities between classical financial and digital asset markets. The trading technology enables investors to use one platform for trading through 120,000 available assets that incorporate stocks, ETFs, commodities, forex, and digital currencies. Early DTX token holders have received considerable profits from their investment, which analysts expect will lead to more significant gains after they list for $0.36 each. This means that participants in this round will make over 200% gains in Q2 this year when the altcoin is listed. SOL’s Struggles Intensify: Solana Price Declines Further! SOL’s reputation as a blockchain innovator is under strain amid Solana’s price struggles. Once hailed for its speed and scalability, the network is now facing a 5.9% monthly capital outflow, driven largely by namecoin-related scandals. The daily Solana price charts reveal the domination of bears over the SOL network. User activity for the SOL network has plummeted to 9.5 million weekly active addresses in February, down from 15.6 million in late 2024. CryptoVizArt, a Glassnode analyst, attributes this to fading confidence in memecoin projects and rising concerns over security. The Solana price dips are raising concerns among investors. The Libra token collapse exemplifies this crisis. Endorsed by Argentine President Javier Milei, the project’s dramatic rug pull triggered a 94% price crash within hours. This incident, alongside $7.7 million in capital migrating to Arbitrum and $6.9 million to Ethereum, signals a broader exodus. While some analysts argue this purge of bad actors could strengthen SOL long-term, short-term challenges are undeniable. Key Takeaways The Solana price tumbles to the $140 level using the $120 mark as support for the SOL token. Though the price decline has raised concerns among SOL holders, they are shifting to DTX Exchange as the best hedging option.

He points to rising hash rates and frenetic miner activity as reasons for a potential rally in Bitcoin price. Hashrates Continue To Rise Amid Falling Bitcoin Price As February came to a close, Bitcoin (BTC) fell to $85,000 from its previous highs, shedding 10% of its value. While investors groan under the dip, Cryptoquant founder Ki Young Ju has expressed bullishness, pointing to on-chain data. Young Ju says Bitcoin price still shows promise for a rally in the coming weeks, capable of surpassing its previous highs. He hinges his argument on rising investment in network security and the soaring number of Bitcoin miners. “When investment in its (Bitcoin) network security stops, it’s likely absorbed enough capital,” said Ju. “That’s the time to sell.” At the moment, hash rates have been rising steadily to reach an all-time high of 936.64 EH/s. Onchain data indicates a correlation between Bitcoin price, hashrates, and the number of miners securing the network. Ju argues that despite the correction, mining rigs are still climbing toward the 5 million mark. However, investors have their eyes on the charts for indications of a plateau to begin a mass selloff. “FYI, investment in the Bitcoin network has never stopped over the past 16 years,” said Ju. Dipping Prices Paint A Sorry Picture For Bitcoin While hashrates indicate positive sentiments for the top cryptocurrency, recent events present a grim outlook for investors. Reports of 59,000 Bitcoin options expiring with a value of $4.68 billion have put a dent in near-term asset price reversal. Furthermore, Bitcoin ETF outflows reached $3.5 billion in February but analysts are unsure if March will lead to a trend reversal. Hardliners are making plays to buy the dip, eyeing a raft of positive announcements from the White House to trigger a rally.

RCO Finance is rapidly emerging as the best altcoin to buy in February 2025, capturing the attention of retail and institutional investors alike. With a unique and improved ecosystem integrating AI, high-yield investment opportunities, and a broad range of tradable assets, RCOF is redefining how traders engage with digital finance. How RCO Finance (RCOF) is Reshaping the DeFi Space Unlike many altcoins that rely on hype without real-world functionality, RCOF is built on a foundation of tangible value, ensuring its longevity in the crypto market. The project integrates cutting-edge AI-driven tools that significantly enhance trading strategies and portfolio management for investors of all experience levels. At the heart of RCO Finance is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, an intelligent system that crafts highly customized investment strategies based on a user’s financial goals, risk tolerance, and real-time market conditions. Utilizing ML algorithms, the Robo Advisor processes vast amounts of market data, including live feeds from major financial sources like Reuters, to generate precise and actionable trading insights. Such AI-driven customization was once exclusive to hedge funds and institutional traders. RCOF is leveling the playing field, providing everyday investors with institutional-grade tools that optimize profitability while mitigating risk exposure. This democratization of advanced trading technology is one of the key reasons RCO Finance is being recognized as the best altcoin to buy in February 2025. With such technology, investors can identify lucrative opportunities, like the recent surge in the Pi (PI) token, which has seen a surge of over 200%. Beyond AI-powered analytics, RCOF offers an unparalleled selection of over 120,000 tradable assets across 12,500 asset classes. These include tokenized real-world assets such as real estate, commodities, and traditional financial instruments like stocks and bonds. By enabling seamless access to these diverse investment options, RCO Finance allows investors to build robust, well-balanced portfolios that can withstand market volatility. Security, scalability, and financial freedom are central to RCO Finance’s vision. The platform has adopted a no-KYC policy, allowing users to trade and invest without undergoing invasive identity verification processes. Moreover, RCO Finance has undergone extensive security audits conducted by SolidProof , a leading blockchain security firm specializing in smart contract verification. This ensures that the platform remains resistant to vulnerabilities, providing a safe environment for traders and investors. RCOF implements a deflationary token mechanism to improve its economic model further, actively burning unsold tokens during its presale phases. This reduction in supply creates scarcity, which can drive up the token’s value over time, making it even more appealing as the best altcoin to buy in February 2025. RCO Finance is designed to cater to a wide range of traders by offering low transaction fees and high-leverage options up to 1000x. Whether for beginner investors seeking long-term gains or experienced traders engaging in margin trading, the platform provides many lucrative opportunities. The Beta Launch and Growing Presale Momentum The recent beta launch of RCO Finance solidified its position as the best altcoin to buy in February 2025. Within days of its release, the platform saw over 10,000 new users, a testament to the strong interest in its AI-driven trading features. As the project moves toward its alpha release, anticipation is building around upcoming advancements, including the full-scale rollout of the Robo Advisor’s real-time monitoring tool, which is currently in the final stages of testing. Currently in Stage 5 of its presale, the RCOF token is priced at $0.10, with over $13.9 million already raised, clearly indicating strong investor confidence in the project. As the presale progresses, the next pricing phase will see the token rise to $0.13, offering early buyers a strategic advantage before listing. Market analysts predict that RCO Finance could list between $0.40 and $0.60, translating to an 800% return on investment (ROI) for early adopters. However, even more optimistic projections suggest a 13,000% price increase, potentially making RCOF one of the highest-gaining altcoins of the year. This impressive growth potential draws comparisons to past DeFi success stories, reinforcing why RCO Finance is considered the best altcoin to buy in February 2025. Don’t miss out on the next major crypto success story; RCOF is shaping up to be the best investment of the year.

This is catching the eye of savvy mid-term investors who are quietly boosting their holdings. Dive into the reasons behind this trend and discover what makes these coins potential candidates for future growth. XRP Price Journey: From Six-Month Surge to Recent Volatility Last month's price activity showed a drop near 28%, while over the past six months, XRP surged almost 300%. This reflects a significant shift in market sentiment alongside a dramatic recovery. Price movements have been dynamic, with notable pullbacks that created opportunities for renewed interest. The month-long decline sharply contrasts with a robust long-term performance, underscoring a volatility that traders have learned to navigate through clear momentum shifts. The coin currently trades between $1.60 and $2.88, with key support at $1.06 and resistance at $3.61. Bears have a short-term advantage as momentum and oscillator readings remain negative, yet the long-term bullish trend suggests cautious buying near support could be beneficial. Trading within these levels may offer opportunities if a reversal occurs. Cardano (ADA): Surging Six-Month Gains Meet Short-Term Bearish Pressure Cardano dropped by 31.11% over the past month while recording a 96.44% surge across six months. Price movements show a volatile journey as the coin bounced between significant swings that highlight strong momentum followed by abrupt corrections. Each phase of the rally and decline underscores a market that is adjusting to rapid changes without settling into a steady path. Current trading ranges span from $0.4443 to $0.8893 with immediate resistance at $1.14 and a second barrier at $1.59. Support is identified around $0.25, and the market is currently under bearish pressure as indicated by the RSI at 36.47 and a one-week price drop of 14.47%. Traders could look for buying opportunities near support while remaining alert to potential sell signals as prices approach resistance levels. Conclusion Mid-term investors are showing increased interest in XRP and ADA. They are optimistic about the potential gains from these coins. Both assets are currently at strategic price levels. This accumulation suggests confidence in their growth and future performance. The focus is on the strength of their networks and the potential for significant returns.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Solana and Dogecoin struggle, experts suggest Remittix could outpace them both, drawing comparisons to XRP. Table of Contents Remittix eliminates chargeback fraud Experts remain bullish on Solana despite the recent decline Can Dogecoin overcome selling pressure? Remittix: The future of global crypto transactions Conclusion Remittix eliminates chargeback fraud Remittix emerges as a cryptocurrency option for those in search of a secure and private platform for transactions. Merchants enjoy the security of being protected from conventional chargeback fraud since transactions cannot be reversed. The users also have robust protections against fraud and criminal activity with complete control over their funds, hence minimal third-party interference. Many traditional remittance service providers impose between five and ten percent transaction charges. Remittix, however, imposes relatively lower charges, at one percent or lower, depending on the platform utilized. By not charging through intermediary banks or clearinghouses, Remittix minimizes the time taken to complete transactions, allowing payments to be made within minutes regardless of the destination. Solana and Dogecoin are among the altcoins that have witnessed a massive decline in the past week, falling below a crucial support zone. While Solana’s price has dropped by over 50% from the January high, Dogecoin’s has dipped by over 60% from the December high. Dubbed the next XRP, the Remittix presale has continued to witness massive adoption due to its cross-border payment platform, which offers a safer, quicker, easier, and more efficient way of sending funds. As the Remittix coin continues to gain momentum, experts believe the RTX token could set records on launching, ranking it among the best DeFi coins in 2025. Experts remain bullish on Solana despite the recent decline Solana has been among the worst-performing altcoins in the past two weeks, triggered by the Libra token saga which led to a massive selloff. Solana’s price has plummeted by 42% in the past month, with the market cap also declining significantly as the altcoin struggles to stay above crucial support zones. In a recent tweet, popular crypto account Coinvo claims that Solana’s price is forming a bullish harmonic pattern that might trigger a reversal. Confirming that, TraderSZ claims that a reversal will start soon. According to Lookonchain data, whales are using the current dip to accumulate the altcoin. Meanwhile, the Solana Fear and Greed index is 16 (Extreme Fear), suggesting that sellers are in control. Solana is trading below the 50-day and 200-day SMA, with over 22 indicators also negative. However, the RSI in the 1D timeframe is 24, suggesting that the Solana token is in the overbought zone. With the rising accumulation and increasing market volume, SOL might rebound towards $200 in March. You might also like: XRP could sink back below $1, investors are hedging with this XRP rival Can Dogecoin overcome selling pressure? Dogecoin , one of the popular meme coins in the market, has lost about 42% of its value in the past month, triggered by the general crypto market’s bearish sentiment. This dip has seen some Dogecoin holders selling their DOGE tokens. According to crypto analyst The Moon Carl, Dogecoin might break out of the falling wedge anytime soon. When that happens, the analyst projects a rise to $0.43. Ali Martinez, in a separate tweet, observed that the TD sequential indicator in the daily chart is flashing a buy signal. The Dogecoin price is below the 50-day SMA, and the Fear and Greed index shows extreme fear. The RSI, however, shows 21, suggesting the meme coin is in the overbought zone. With persistent efforts from the bulls, Dogecoin might retest the $0.40 mark in the coming weeks. Remittix: The future of global crypto transactions Remittix has been exceeding expectations in presale, with early investors’ ROI already above 1,000%. So far, more than 16,000 people have joined the project, with over 508m RTX tokens sold. This has seen the team raise more than $13m, ranking among the top-performing presale tokens. Driven by a transformative cross-border payment platform, Remittix is staking a claim to the $183t banking industry.

This is the first time since November that the BTC price has seen such a slump. Heightened crypto market volatility has also affected the altcoin space, and Cardano touched extreme lows yesterday, too. The grim outlook of the current crypto market has made investors look towards emerging altcoins that are not speculative and will be able to withstand the market's inherent volatility. With most altcoins following the BTC trajectory, investors want to welcome new blood into the crypto space. DTX Exchange is making noise as a hybrid trading platform whose token promises massive growth and an unmatched guarantee of profit-taking as soon as the platform goes mainstream. Is the Bitcoin Price in Free Fall? Senior crypto experts have predicted that the Bitcoin price could fall to $70K. This could be attributed to major US hedge funds exiting US BTC ETFs. The Bitcoin price has lost key support at $91K, and rebound attempts have been unsuccessful. The ByBit hack and other macroeconomic factors could have aided in pushing the Bitcoin price to this level. US tech stocks dropped ahead of Nvidia’s earnings report, and investors became cautious towards risk assets like BTC. The Bitcoin price dropped almost 8% in a day, and over $1 billion in long positions were liquidated across exchanges. Experts suggest that BTC needs to capture the $90K level soon to pick up momentum. The market was waiting for the new US administration to take some pro-crypto action, but that didn’t happen. There has been a lack of crypto adoption from the US government, and not much has been done to improve the public's perception of cryptocurrencies like BTC. Wil market sentiment around BTC is edging towards economic fear; BTC holders are advised to hold on to their Bitcoin. Buying the dip would be the wise thing to do, and once the Bitcoin price enters the consolidation phase, it will gain momentum to reach $100K again. Will the Cardano Price Drop Below $0.50 Amid Bearish Pressure? The Cardano price is under pressure, and sellers dominate the market. There is news that Cardano (ADA) will drop below $0.6 as the Bitcoin slump has applied additional pressure on a bearish crypto market. The Cardano price fell 5.4% in a day and continues to decline. Cardano will find support at the $0.6 psychological level, and it must quickly reclaim $0.67 to avoid further decline. Levels of liquidations are rising, and the subsequent volatility signals that the crypto market could be in for a long-term bear run. An ADA ETF could drive adoption among institutional investors and hopefully help the Cardano price. DTX Exchange Offers Stability in Volatile Market These are dark times for the crypto market, and no one is making any money. The fall of the Bitcoin price is leading the market’s trajectory. If you dumped your holdings before the slump, you might have saved yourself from some losses and grief; otherwise, you’re still losing money as we speak. Savvy investors who invested in the DTX Exchange have already made an 800% return, and further profits are expected as soon as the DTX token is listed on Binance or Coinbase. The DTX token is priced at $0.18, and the listing price is set to double at $0.36, offering 200% minimum gains to current participants. Even if you buy the token at this later stage of the presale, you have a confirmed chance to double your investment.

Trump said that his Executive Order on Digital Assets has directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward with the creation of the reserve.

In an announcement on Facebook, the Vietnam Police observed that the recent increase in the usage of Pi tokens for everyday transactions in the country could attract sanctions and criminal prosecution. According to the authorities, virtual currencies cannot be used as a means of payment in the country as it breaches existing laws. It stated that any organization that accepts Pi for payments could face sanctions under Clause 6 Article 26 of Decree 88/2019/ND CEP as amended. The police added that the sanction could be a fine varying between 50 million and 100 million Vietnamese dollars, or such entities could be prosecuted for violating regulations on banking activities under Article 206 of the criminal code. Meanwhile, the statement is a reaction to the widespread use of the token for payments by several individuals and businesses within the country. Vietnam has one of the highest levels of crypto adoption globally, and the Pi crypto has gained prominence there, especially after several exchanges listed the token. This is not the first time that authorities in the country have warned about using digital assets for transactions. Earlier, the State Bank of Vietnam had warned against using crypto for payments. Vietnamese authorities say Pi is not an asset Meanwhile, government authorities in the country further noted that Pi does not have any real value, as its current price is based solely on speculation. As they stated, Pi and cryptocurrencies, in general, are not considered assets under Vietnamese laws. Therefore, users should be aware of the risks of investing in Pi. It highlighted some of the potential risks associated with the token, including scammers using it for illegal activities by creating mimic tokens for unassuming investors or even fake applications to collect user data and give fraudsters access to victims’ accounts. Authorities have also warned that posting information about Pi and other digital assets could violate the law. It said: “It is not allowed to give, transmit, post false and unverified information on cyberspace related to virtual currencies, cryptocurrencies in general and Pi coins in particular, causing public confusion or causing cases of violating the law.” The Department of Cybersecurity and Crime Prevention also called on those investing in Pi to carefully research all information before investing so as “to avoid the risk of property damage and encountering unfortunate events.” Pi falls 17% in 24 hours Pi token has seen a massive plunge in its value today, falling 17.6% to $1.73 in the last 24 hours. According to CoinGecko data, the token still has a 21% gain in the past seven days, mostly due to listing on exchanges such as OKX, Bitget, and MEXC. However, it has also attracted criticism, with some stakeholders in the crypto community regarding it as a fraudulent project. They note its lack of listing by major exchanges and zero transparency as major reasons for this view. Some users have also complained that they cannot claim the Pi tokens because the Pi Network team has not verified their Know Your Customer (KYC) process. The KYC process is compulsory for users to access their Pi, and many of the long-term users say they have not passed the stage yet. In its response, the Pi Network team has extended the deadline for its mainnet migration to March 14, 2025, noting that this will give people more time to verify their balances and migrate to the mainnet.

This initiative underscores the administration’s commitment to positioning the United States as a leader in the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape. Bitcoin to Hit $120,000 on Monday Bitcoin has already experienced a strong rally following Trump’s announcement, but the BTC price is set to skyrocket further on Monday when the Bitcoin ETFs open, as strong institutional demand expected. Furthermore, institutional investors who sold their Bitcoin positions last week as their de-risked their positions amid tariff fears are likely to FOMO back into the market on Monday. This, coupled with a short squeeze and Trump potentially delaying tariffs on Canada and Mexico again, means that Bitcoin is very likely to record a new all-time high on Monday. Evolution of the Crypto Strategic Reserve During his keynote address at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville, Tennessee, then-candidate Trump pledged to create a “strategic national Bitcoin stockpile,” emphasizing the importance of Bitcoin in the nation’s financial future. He stated, “If I am elected, it will be the policy of my Administration—the United States of America—to keep 100% of all the Bitcoin the government currently holds or acquires into the future.” This commitment was intended to serve as the foundation of the strategic reserve. However, following his election, President Trump’s approach evolved. On January 23, he signed an executive order directing the President’s Working Group on Digital Assets to explore the feasibility of a national crypto reserve and to develop a regulatory framework for stablecoins. This order also prohibited the research and development of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) in the United States. Inclusion of Additional Cryptocurrencies Expanding beyond Bitcoin, President Trump recently announced that the strategic reserve would encompass other significant cryptocurrencies. He directed the inclusion of XRP, Solana (SOL), and Cardano’s ADA, highlighting a broader acceptance of diverse digital assets. Subsequently, he appended that Bitcoin and Ethereum (ETH) would be at the “heart of the reserve,” reinforcing their foundational role in the crypto ecosystem. This inclusive approach reflects a strategic effort to diversify the nation’s digital asset holdings, recognizing the unique functionalities and potentials of various blockchain platforms. Market Reactions and Industry Response The announcement had an immediate impact on cryptocurrency markets. Prices of the included assets experienced notable surges: Solana (SOL): The token saw a 19% increase, reaching $169.71. Cardano’s ADA: The asset jumped 50%, surpassing $1 per token. XRP: The cryptocurrency affiliated with Ripple experienced a 27.7% rise, climbing to $2.70. Bitcoin (BTC): Appreciated by 5.5% to over $91,400 per coin. Industry leaders have lauded the administration’s proactive stance. The establishment of the Crypto Strategic Reserve is viewed as a pivotal step toward integrating digital assets into the mainstream financial system, potentially fostering innovation and economic growth. Upcoming White House Crypto Summit In line with these developments, President Trump is set to host the inaugural White House Crypto Summit on March 7. The event aims to convene industry executives and members of the Digital Asset Working Group to deliberate on the future of cryptocurrency regulation and policy in the United States. This summit underscores the administration’s commitment to engaging with stakeholders and shaping a conducive environment for the crypto industry. Future Implications The creation of the U.S. Crypto Strategic Reserve marks a transformative moment in the nation’s approach to digital assets. By embracing a diverse array of cryptocurrencies, the administration signals its recognition of the multifaceted applications and benefits of blockchain technology. This initiative not only positions the United States as a forward-thinking leader in the crypto space but also sets the stage for further integration of digital assets into the broader economy. As the global financial landscape continues to evolve, the United States’ strategic move to incorporate cryptocurrencies into its national reserves may inspire other nations to reevaluate their stances on digital assets, potentially leading to more widespread adoption and regulatory clarity worldwide.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|FIAT|ADA|REGULATION|SOL,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-02 17:20:45

As AI-driven forecasts suggest modest gains for Dogecoin, Rexas Finance continues to gain traction in the crypto market. Table of Contents Dogecoin price in the next 14 days according to AI Rexas Finance: A coin to watch Conclusion Investors are closely monitoring the potential trajectory of Dogecoin’s (DOGE) price in the coming days as it battles volatility. Down 33% over the past month, DOGE’s price action has many wondering if a breakout is imminent, especially given the SEC’s recent acknowledgment of ETF submissions. The long-term outlook looks good, but where will the Dogecoin price be in fourteen days? Is the coin finally setting a new all-time high at $0.75? Here is what AI has to say. Dogecoin price in the next 14 days according to AI Dogecoin currently trades at $0.23 after nosediving 33% in the past month. According to the AI, Dogecoin may struggle to retain the considerable upward momentum necessary to hit $0.75 in the short term unless a major catalyst emerges, such as the SEC’s unexpected approval of the Dogecoin ETF, renewed support from Elon Musk, or Bitcoin’s rally above $110,000. However, the AI forecasts that DOGE will grow somewhat, with a goal range of $0.30 to $0.35 within the next two weeks. If market circumstances worsen, Dogecoin may see a decline to as low as $0.17. While a jump to $0.75 is absolutely possible in the long run, present trends and market sentiment suggest that it is less likely to occur within the next 14 days.

This latest development highlights the ongoing challenges in tracking and stopping illicit cryptocurrency transactions. Continued Movement of Stolen Funds The latest reports indicate that the hackers transferred over 62,000 ETH, valued at approximately $138 million, in a single transaction. This brings the total laundered amount to over 340,000 ETH, which represents a substantial portion of the funds stolen during the initial breach. With over 150,000 ETH still in their control, it is expected that further laundering attempts will continue in the coming days. Techniques Used to Obfuscate Transactions The hackers have been employing advanced methods to conceal the origin of their stolen funds. By leveraging decentralized exchanges, cross-chain bridges, and instant swap services that do not require identity verification, they have successfully converted portions of the stolen ETH into other cryptocurrencies, making it increasingly difficult to trace. These techniques allow the stolen funds to move across different blockchain networks, limiting the ability of authorities and forensic firms to track them efficiently. The increased use of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms for money laundering presents an ongoing challenge for security experts. THORChain’s Role in Fund Movement One of the platforms reportedly used in these laundering efforts is THORChain, a decentralized protocol that facilitates cross-chain swaps. Internal disputes within the platform’s governance recently surfaced when a decision to block transactions linked to the hackers was reversed, causing a key developer to resign in protest. This situation has fueled further debate on whether decentralized platforms should take active measures to prevent the movement of stolen funds or remain neutral in blockchain transactions. Law Enforcement and Security Measures Authorities have been monitoring the hacker’s wallets and issuing warnings to cryptocurrency exchanges and blockchain networks to blacklist certain addresses. Efforts are being made to track and freeze the stolen assets, but the decentralized nature of these transactions makes recovery difficult. This incident serves as another reminder of the risks associated with cryptocurrency exchanges and the growing need for stronger security measures. With blockchain technology continuing to evolve, the industry must find a balance between decentralization and regulatory oversight to mitigate future threats.",Crypto News Today|DeFi|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,EXCHANGE|BLOCKCHAIN|ETH|REGULATION|TECHNOLOGY,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-02 17:22:00

Financial media outlets often refer to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index (CPI). But, the Federal Reserve favors the PCE for the economic analysis involved in its decision-making process. Inflation in US prices across the core consumer basket rose a modest 0.3% from December to January, just as forecasters expected. Meanwhile, the inflation report even fell from a year-over-year point of view. That could be more bad news for Bitcoin prices that are already in jeopardy. Powell: Fed in No Rush to Print As a result of the tepid growth in US consumer prices that has accompanied an abrupt pullback in consumer spending, the Fed has room to consider moving interest rates further down the scale. The effective federal funds rate currently stands at 4.33%, one percent lower than the 2024 and 2023 levels. The correlation between lower interest rates and support for massive multi-month Bitcoin price rallies is historically very strong. But, Federal Reserve leaders like Chair Jerome Powell have indicated that the central bank is taking a wait-and-see approach. The Fed is in no hurry to lower rates. Powell told Congress in testimony earlier in February, “We’re in a pretty good place with this economy.” “We want to make more progress on inflation,” he said. “We think our policy rate is in a good place and we don’t see any reason to be in a hurry to reduce it further.” Did Bitcoin Tame The Dollar? The new White House and SEC are ardently accommodating to the crypto sector, but even the non-partisan, non-government Federal Reserve has taken a softer tone on crypto assets like Bitcoin in recent times. While speaking to Congress, Powell said, “Banks are serving crypto customers. We don’t want to get in the way of banks serving perfectly legal customers.” Fed Chair says banks can serve ‘perfectly legal’ cryptocurrency READ: https://t.co/Sxq9D1uQNq pic.twitter.com/psCidk3OHM — Washington Examiner (@dcexaminer) February 12, 2025 The Federal Reserve steers the monetary system between the extremes of deflationary debt revaluation and crushing price inflation. Bitcoin issues more currency in addition to the dollar, giving the Fed some cushion against the former. At the same time, it rewards long-term holders for saving their money instead of consuming it, giving the central bank some more room with interest rates when it comes to consumer price inflation. These are critical factors in Bitcoin’s price, but the world’s first and most secure cryptocurrency now exists on such a scale that the US government is carefully studying its macro impacts.

Meanwhile, BTC was up 6% in the last 24 hours, finally trading above $91,000 after prices stuck near the 80,000 to the $84,000 range. ETH was above $2,400, rising nearly 10% in the same time period.

In addition, the potential of an XRP Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) approval from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) could equally catalyze the much-anticipated price rally. Green January and Red February For XRP February was one of the darkest months for the Ripple-associated digital currency. During this time, XRP recorded as much as a 30% price dip. Notably, this coincided with a sell-off in the broader crypto market that further triggered a shift away from riskier assets. This same asset started the year with stellar performance, recording a seven-year high of $3.39, spurred by the optimism of a spot crypto ETF. However, this was the case with other major cryptocurrencies due to the policy pivot and favorable regulatory outlook for digital assets in the US. By the end of January, XRP gallantly walked away with up to a 45.35% price gain. XRP Price Outlook XRP dipped to trade at a low of $1.95 on February 28 before it bagged some recovery. The coin was trading at $2.23 after a 4.02% 24-hour price rally. Its trading volume is currently 17.84% lower than 24 hours, suggesting a decline in traders’ interest. Still, its price action reflects some price recovery, but it is unclear if the coin will sustain the rally in March. All eyes are on the XRP ecosystem, and we are expecting the next trend to follow history. Since 2021, March has always been the month that XRP remains in the green, although it often builds on the momentum of February. XRP ETFs in the United States Brazil securities regulator Comissão de Valores Mobiliários (CVM) has already greenlighted Hashdex Nasdaq XRP Index Fund as the country’s first-ever spot XRP. Yet, the United States cannot decide favorably on the XRP ETF applications filed with the SEC. Nasdaq and CBOE have submitted filings for CoinShares, Canary Capital, and WisdomTree, but the SEC is still busy with the review . However, due to the change in the US crypto regulatory landscape, the next few months may bring the approval. With Gary Gensler out of the way, Mark Uyeda and his team may consider XRP ETFs and other crypto ETFs worthy of approval.

41064682,https://invezz.com/?p=2595519,1740936600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Why major investors turn to Mutuum Finance (MUTM) as Bitcoin (BTC) sheds 20%,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/02/why-major-investors-turn-to-mutuum-finance-mutm-as-bitcoin-btc-sheds-20/,"Bitcoin’s latest 20% drop below key support levels has rattled the market. With institutional demand seeming to wane and traders bracing for further losses, uncertainty is rising. As Bitcoin struggles to regain traction, more investors are exploring alternative assets that offer stability and the promise of long-term gains. One project drawing attention is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a fast-growing DeFi lending platform. Despite the volatility affecting the broader market, MUTM’s presale is gaining momentum among those looking to buy in early, while Bitcoin navigates a technical bear market. Bitcoin (BTC) loses 20% from its peak sustained selling pressure, Bitcoin has slid 20% from its recent high and is now trading under $87,000. Heavy liquidations drove prices downward, wiping out around $1.6 billion from crypto markets in a single day. Market sentiment has swung into “extreme fear,” making it difficult for BTC to find reliable support. Analysts warn that failure to maintain certain price levels could trigger a deeper retracement. Some foresee a possible dip to around $73,800, while others consider the pullback a buying opportunity. Meanwhile, a slowdown in institutional interest further complicates the outlook for Bitcoin’s near-term direction. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) Mutuum Finance (MUTM) stands out in the DeFi sphere by allowing users to lend digital assets or earn passive income without selling their holdings. Overcollateralized loans reduce default risk for lenders, providing stability. The platform’s supply rates hinge on how much of each liquidity pool is utilized, and each asset is assigned a prudent Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratio. For instance, a user with $10,000 in Ethereum (ETH) might borrow up to $7,500 in stablecoins without liquidating their ETH. This approach gives borrowers fast access to capital while preserving system integrity and appealing to both day traders and long-term investors. In addition, Mutuum Finance uses mtTokens, which represent user deposits that grow in value automatically. If you deposit 10 ETH, the platform issues 10 mtETH. As borrowers repay loans plus interest, mtETH accumulates value, so lenders withdraw more ETH than they originally deposited—generating passive income without active trading. Mutuum Finance’s buy-and-distribute mechanism also underpins its long-term outlook. A slice of protocol fees goes toward buying MUTM from the open market, perpetuating steady buy pressure. Those tokens are then handed out to suppliers and stakers, supporting ongoing demand for MUTM and curbing sell-offs. As the platform’s adoption widens, buy pressure intensifies, helping the token’s value climb. The ongoing presale has drawn significant attention, with MUTM priced at $0.015. More than $1.5 million has been raised so far, with almost 3,000 holders securing tokens. Experts predict at least a 1,400% jump after launch, and some see even greater potential as usage spreads. Investing at this stage may be highly beneficial for those aiming for substantial gains. A $1,000 stake at the presale price stands to become worth $15,000 or more after Mutuum Finance (MUTM) launches and hits projected price milestones. With a robust lending model, opportunities for passive income, and solid tokenomics, Mutuum Finance is well-positioned to stand out in DeFi—offering a prime chance to buy MUTM before its value rises.

That’s the dream, right? The trick is getting in early, grabbing the best opportunities before the market catches on. And right now, BTFD Coin (BTFD) is delivering one of the biggest golden tickets the crypto world has seen in a while. With its Bulls Squad leading the charge and an insane 100% bonus on Stage 14 of its presale, this might be the best new meme coin to invest in for short-term gains. Meanwhile, Moo Deng and Turbo continue to hold their spots as established players in the meme coin frenzy. But let’s be real, the real money is being made in presales, where early investors get to buy in before the public even realizes what’s happening. BTFD Coin has been on a rampage, already raising over $6.21 million in its presale. With its Bulls Squad, a Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, and a staking setup that offers a jaw-dropping 90% APY, the hype is real. The limited-time 100% bonus offer using the LAUNCH100 code is what’s really setting the crypto space on fire right now. And with Stage 14 flying by, this window won’t be open forever. Let’s dive into why BTFD Coin is turning heads among the best new meme coins to invest in for short term and why this might be your best shot at life-changing gains. BTFD Coin: The Bulls Squad and 100% Bonus Are Reshaping Crypto Presales BTFD Coin is built for those who understand the power of buying the dip , it rewards early believers with massive incentives. And right now, it’s making a bold move by skipping straight to Stage 14, burning all unsold tokens from Stage 13. This means fewer tokens in circulation, higher demand, and tighter supply—all the right ingredients for explosive price action post-listing. But here’s where things get crazy. For a limited time, investors can use the LAUNCH100 bonus code to double their tokens. That’s right—every dollar you put in gets you 2x the coins. Think about it: at the current price of $0.00016, an investment of $2,000 will typically get you 12.5 million BTFD tokens. But with the LAUNCH100 bonus? That instantly doubles to 25 million BTFD tokens. And with BTFD projected to hit $0.0006 post-presale, that same investment could be worth over $15,000 in no time. The Bulls Squad is another reason why BTFD Coin is dominating the scene. This community-driven team consists of key figures like Baby Bull, Raging Bull, Nerdy Bull, and Peoples Bull, each playing a vital role in building, marketing, and maintaining the project’s massive momentum. Their mission? To turn every dip into a massive opportunity for investors who get in early. Beyond the presale, BTFD’s P2E game is already live, letting users earn while playing. The staking feature, launched on December 2, 2024, offers an eye-watering 90% APY, giving holders even more reasons to stay locked in. And with over 70 billion BTFD coins sold and 11,100+ holders, this project is set to dominate. Moo Deng (MOODENG): The OG Holding Strong Moo Deng has been one of the more consistent meme coins in the space. Built on strong fundamentals, it has carved out its niche, appealing to investors looking for a mix of meme culture and utility. While its current trajectory is steady, it remains a favorite among those who believe in the long-term value of established meme coins. However, unlike BTFD, Moo Deng doesn’t offer the same kind of early-stage multiplier opportunities that presales do. If you’re looking for potential moonshots, presales like BTFD offer a much better ROI window. Turbo (TURBO): The Hype Machine That Keeps Rolling Turbo has proven time and again that meme coins can thrive when backed by a passionate community. With its unique branding and a dedicated fan base, Turbo continues to attract investors looking for high-volatility trades. While it has seen impressive price movements, it doesn’t come with a built-in 100% bonus offer or presale discounts like BTFD. For traders who love the thrill of price swings, Turbo remains an exciting pick, but the real wealth-building opportunity is still in early-stage projects like BTFD. Why the BTFD Presale is the Top Opportunity Right Now The best new meme coins to invest in for short-term gains are the ones that let you get in before the hype wave kicks off. BTFD Coin is currently at Stage 14, priced at $0.00016, and once the presale ends, it’s set to launch at $0.0006. That’s a built-in ROI of 275%, and if you use the LAUNCH100 bonus code, it jumps to 550%. Here’s how you can claim your 100% bonus right now: Visit the BTFD Presale Click “Connect Wallet” (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) Enter the bonus code LAUNCH100 and apply it Enter the amount you want to invest and confirm your purchase This is your shot at turning a simple investment into life-changing gains. With the presale clock ticking, waiting could mean missing out on one of the best short-term crypto plays of 2025. Conclusion: The Best New Meme Coins to Invest in for Short Term—BTFD Coin Stands Out! Crypto markets reward those who move fast, and BTFD Coin’s presale has become the ultimate playground for short-term investors looking to maximize their gains. With its Bulls Squad, P2E game, 90% APY staking, and a 100% bonus offer, it’s giving early investors a rare chance to double their holdings before the market even catches on. Compared to Moo Deng and Turbo, both solid meme coins in their own right, BTFD Coin’s current presale stage offers the highest potential for explosive ROI. Time is running out, and Stage 14 won’t last forever. Don’t let this best new meme coin to invest in for short term be another missed opportunity.

33767162,[object Object],1740936632,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,On-Chain Clues: Is Bitcoin Gearing Up For A Major Reversal?,https://bitcoinist.com/on-chain-clues-is-bitcoin-gearing-up-for-a-major-reversal/,"The number of active addresses in Bitcoin has increased, with a peak of 912,300 on February 28. The most recent instance of this level was on December 16, 2024, when Bitcoin was trading at $105,000, Glassnode data shows. Traders are closely monitoring the outcome of this surge, which some analysts interpret as a precursor to a potential market shift. Market Prepares For Potential Capitulation Capitulation is a phrase that refers to the sharp price swings that occur when investors sell in distress. The latest drop in Bitcoin below $84,000 has raised concerns, as a retreat below this level might result in over $1 billion in leveraged long liquidations, CoinGlass data shows. Previously, similar events occurred in the marketplace. Panic selling often signals a bottom before a comeback when it reaches its peak. This could be a watershed moment for Bitcoin if it follows previous trends. Active Addresses Surge As Market Adjusts The rising count of active addresses suggests that more people are moving Bitcoin. This could mean traders are either reacting to market swings or rearranging their assets. Whether favorable or negative, this trend is evident before notable changes in the market. Important events in Bitcoin’s price behavior have aligned with years’ worth of network activity surges. Traders are keeping a tight eye to see if this rise in addresses causes a rally or more falls. Bitcoin Key Metric Signals Oversold Conditions The Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) Z-score of Bitcoin is among other important benchmarks. March 1 saw this metric at 2.01. A lower score would signal a possible bottom since it implies that the asset is now reaching oversold levels. When the MVRV Z-score crosses oversold area in the past, Bitcoin’s price has reversed. Though it is not a guarantee, speculators consider this data point while assessing the direction the market will travel. Support And Resistance Levels Are Crucial The ability of Bitcoin to keep a price over $80,500 will determine either its stabilization or continuation of slide. If prices drop below $84,000, there is likely much more reduction since liquidations could increase the pressure. Concurrently, the development of a recovery could follow from strong buying interest at these levels. Since they know a rebound might provide the market fresh momentum, many traders are closely tracking these pricing points. As Bitcoin negotiates this uncertain phase, technical indicators and investor mood will probably affect its next movements. Whether the alpha coin finds a bottom or suffers more drops will depend much on the next several days. It’s likely that both technical signs and how investors feel will affect Bitcoin’s next moves as it moves through this challenging phase. The next few days will be very important in figuring out whether it hits bottom or continues to fall.

The announcement came minutes after his initial post on Truth Social, where he only named Solana (SOL), Ripple’s XRP, and Cardano’s ADA. Trump said: “And, obviously, BTC and ETH, as other valuable cryptocurrencies, will be at the heart of the Reserve. I also love Bitcoin and Ethereum!” Source: Truth Social Crypto traders react as Trump’s statement triggers price surge The announcement came as crypto markets struggled with weeks of selling pressure, brought by macroeconomic factors and regulatory uncertainty. But after the announcement, Bitcoin rose 5.5% to over $90,000, while Solana surged 19% to $169.71. Cardano exploded 50% to cross $1, and XRP climbed nearly 28% to $2.70. Investors who had been waiting for regulatory clarity took Trump’s words as a bullish signal. Many traders had been growing impatient with the Trump administration’s slow progress on the crypto-friendly policies promised on the campaign trail. But his statement has now changed everything. “A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve. I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” said Trump in his first post. The crypto market had been dealing with a major liquidity crisis after the massive $1.5 billion hack on Bybit, carried out by North Korea’s Lazarus Group. Bitcoin had crashed from $97,000 to below $80,000 in a matter of two days, dragging the rest of the market with it. Adding to the instability, Trump’s trade war and escalating tensions with Ukraine had already put pressure on global markets. The Nasdaq 100 Index dropped 7%, and the U.S. Treasury market saw a surge in demand, and since Bitcoin often moves in the same direction as high-risk assets, the overall market downturn contributed to the slump. And February saw the largest single-month withdrawal of capital from spot Bitcoin ETFs, with $3.3 billion in outflows, according to data from Farside UK. According to Bitwise analysts, this was partly driven by the unwinding of a popular crypto arbitrage strategy known as the cash-and-carry trade, which is buying spot Bitcoin and shorting futures to capture price discrepancies. But as Bitcoin prices fell, traders rushed to close their positions. Bitcoin futures traders were also hesitant to take new positions. Annualized March futures premiums fell to 5.7%, according to a K33 Research report on February 25. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings?

The Solana price, too, has taken a beating and fallen below $150. Investor confidence is at a record low as Bitcoin drags the market down with it. The meme coin market PNUT, based on Peanut the Squirrel, is doing well for itself, and crypto whales are directing their funds toward PNUT. Other than PNUT, if the Solana price and the Bitcoin price have made you risk-averse, a savvy investment option is DTX Exchange . DTX is a hybrid trading platform that will bring centralized and decentralized trade together on one seamless platform. It is a cutting-edge DeFi project that will revolutionize the capital trading markets. Solana Price Could Fall as Low as $80 As the crypto market takes a hit, the leading cryptocurrency, SOL, also faces significant losses. The Solana price has lost almost 40% of its value in the last 30 days, and experts say this is just the beginning of an imminent crash. Currently, SOL is trading around $140, and after a 15% weekly drop, the downtrend shows no sign of stopping. The Solana price will find key support levels around $100, which could come under threat amid current market uncertainty and make the $80 Solana price more possible. The Solana (SOL) unlock will also drive the SOL price down further. The listing of the SOL futures ETFs by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) has created some respite for the SOL price. The SOL ETFs are eligible for clearing and settlement, but the listing does not mean they have been approved by the SEC. The SOL ETFs still await SEC approval, or regulatory uncertainty will remain a lingering risk. If regulatory clarity emerges and the broader market sentiment improves, the SOL ETFs could increase exposure to the SOL ledger and boost institutional participation, which will help stabilize the SOL price. PNUT Emerges as the Only Meme Coin to See Growth Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) is the only meme coin to have shown some growth in the last 7 days. PNUT has grown from $0.14 to $0.20 in the previous 7 days, while the rest of the meme coin market suffers a major setback. Technical indicators show lower volatility for PNUT, and there is a chance for strong momentum for the PNUT price to touch $0.5 soon. The squirrel-themed meme coin is one of the best-performing crypto tokens amid a bearish crypto market. While the resurgence of the meme coin sector has been questioned, the PNUT positive price growth could be the trigger. Analysts Project 5,000% Surge for DTX Exchange by Q3 The DTX Exchange is a cutting-edge cryptocurrency trading platform that promises to transform the trading landscape. The DTX Exchange leverages the strengths of blockchain technology and traditional asset classes.

This impacted short traders, as the value of the total liquidations is close to $500 million on a 4-hour scale, and XRP is responsible for a big share. XRPUSD. Source: TradingView The impact that the US president has on the crypto market cannot be understated . After his landslide win in the elections in November, all crypto asset shot up, many to fresh all-time high, following his numerous favorable promises. His questionable actions ever since he took office in regard to the Russia-Ukraine war and its trade war against several countries, brought excess pain for the crypto space, as the total market cap bled out over $800 billion within a week. Ripple’s token has felt the consequences each time, with massive price increases and subsequent crashes. The past few hours solidified this narrative. Trump confirmed on his social media the much-anticipated crypto reserve and said SOL, ADA , and XRP will be a part of it before adding BTC and ETH, which he ‘loves.’ The entire market turned green, but the initial trio stole the show with massive double-digit price pumps. XRP, for example, flew from $2.22 to just over $3 within minutes, thus rising by more than 35% in value. Moreover, it has reclaimed its third spot in terms of market cap and is up by 45% since the Friday low of $1.95, even though it has retraced to $2.9 as of now. Its explosive move north has left nearly $57 million in liquidations within a 4-hour window – only from short positions. At the same time, the total for the day stands at over $630 million, with shorts representing the lion’s share ($455 million). Liquidation Heat Map.

It is claimed that the whale trader could be an insider from Donald Trump's circle due to the huge long position he opened yesterday before today's incident.

Trump revealed that the reserve would include XRP, along with other major cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, SOL and ADA, as part of his vision to make the U.S. the global leader in the crypto industry. The surge in XRP’s price can be attributed to this unexpected catalyst. As per technical analysis, XRP’s price structure has shown a bullish trend. After a brief pullback, XRP seems to be gearing up for higher prices, with key support levels between $2.41 and $2.48. If the price holds above these levels, the next major resistance is at $3. A break above this level could set the stage for a push towards $3.40 and possibly even higher, with some analysts predicting the potential for prices to reach $5 to $6 in the long run. What Did Trump Announce? Taking to Truth Social, Trump wrote, “A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA.

These tokens have surged thousands of times in value — sometimes overnight. Why? Because Solana is a high-performance blockchain known for its lightning-fast transactions and extremely low fees which makes it an ideal platform for meme coins. What else makes meme coins on Solana so appealing? Why are traders flocking to them, and which ones are worth watching? Let’s take a closer look at several key factors: 1. Solana’s Low Fees and Fast Transactions Solana offers high-speed transactions (up to 65,000 TPS ) and ultra-low fees (often less than $0.01 per transaction). This makes trading meme coins much cheaper and more efficient compared to other blockchains with higher gas fees. 2. Increased Adoption of Solana Solana has grown significantly in popularity, especially after the increased institutional interest. With more developers and investors entering the ecosystem, meme coins on Solana naturally benefit from this expansion. 3. Strong Community and Hype-Driven Growth Meme coins thrive on hype and community engagement, and Solana’s ecosystem is filled with active traders and social media influencers who push trends. The success of Bonk and Dogwifhat has reinforced the idea that Solana meme coins can deliver massive returns. 4. Support from Major Crypto Platforms Many Solana meme coins have received early listings on major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken , boosting their visibility and liquidity. This institutional support has further fueled their adoption. 6. Influence of NFT and Cultural Trends Solana has a strong NFT and crypto culture , making it a perfect environment for meme coins. Many Solana meme coins integrate NFTs or community-driven initiatives, making them more attractive to retail investors. 7. Speculative Mania and Quick Gains Meme coins appeal to traders looking for high-risk, high-reward investments. Solana’s meme coins have delivered massive returns , with tokens like Bonk surging over 18,000% from its all-time low. This fuels the “fear of missing out” ( FOMO ) and attracts more traders. Here’s a comparative table of best-performing Solana-based meme coins: Meme Coin Price (as of Feb 2025) Price Change Since All-Time Low Description Notable Features Bonk (BONK) $0.0000379 +18,163% Shiba Inu-themed coin, aiming to be Solana’s community coin Over 350 community-built integrations, including BonkSwap and BonkVault Dogwifhat (WIF) $2.94 +2,840% Inspired by a Shiba Inu puppy wearing a pink knitted hat First Solana meme coin to reach $1; expanded ecosystem called MemeVerse Popcat (POPCAT) $0.29 +5,700% Based on the viral “Popcat” meme featuring a cat with a popping mouth expression Community takeover in early 2024 led to a 5,000% price surge Gigachad (GIGA) $0.039 +3,800% Inspired by the “Gigachad” internet meme Focuses on community engagement and meme culture Peanut the Squirrel (PNUT) $0.16 +7,900% Features a squirrel mascot; gained attention through a viral incident Rapid rise due to emotionally charged backstory and high-profile endorsements Catzilla (CATZILLA) $0.0009 +350% (Presale Growth) Giant anime-inspired mutant cat with Godzilla-like spikes Japanese kaiju narrative, GameFi elements, staking rewards, Meow Points airdrop system, and referral program Catzilla: The Next Big Meme Coin on Solana? While Solana-based meme coins like Bonk and Popcat have already made waves, Catzilla ($CATZILLA) is shaping up to be the next major contender. With a unique blend of different narratives, Catzilla has all the ingredients to become a viral success. Its presale is rapidly gaining momentum, now progressing through Stage 7 . Early investors are locking in their tokens at discounted prices ahead of the highly anticipated exchange listings. Historically, Solana meme coins have exploded in value post-listing , and with Catzilla’s growing community, referral incentives, and staking rewards, its launch could follow a similar trajectory. The community buzz is feasible, as those who buy $CATZILLA now hope it would reach the $1 mark and generate hefty profits for them. The high potential of this project has already been recognized by prominent crypto influencer CryptoDexWorld who called $CATZILLA the next big meme coin. Currently priced at $0.0009, $CATZILLA is set to reach $0.0016 by Stage 14, representing a 77.7% increase. Once listed on major centralized and decentralized exchanges, the price could climb even further, following the path of Popcat (POPCAT), another feline meme coin that soared over 32,000% since its 2023 launch, reaching a $1.2 billion market cap. Join Before FOMO kicks in—secure your $CATZILLA today Strong Community of Cat and Meme Coin Lovers Catzilla is already making waves across top-tier platforms like CoinMarketCap , where it has a rapidly growing fanbase.

However, while they may seem like the future of online gambling, they come with significant drawbacks – especially for UK players. Regulatory uncertainty, market volatility, and limited consumer protection make crypto casinos a risky choice, and with the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) enforcing strict rules on online gambling, they’re not always a practical option. Luckily, there are plenty of safe and reliable alternatives for players who want a seamless casino experience without the hassle of crypto. Whether you prefer the convenience of e-wallets, the security of bank transfers, or the speed of mobile payments, UK casinos offer a range of payment options to suit different playing styles. In this article, we’ll break down the best non-crypto alternatives and help you find the right one for your needs. Debit Card Casinos (Visa, Mastercard, Maestro) For UK players, debit cards remain the most straightforward and widely accepted way to fund an online casino account. Since the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC) banned credit cards for gambling in 2020, Visa, Mastercard, and Maestro have become the go-to options for secure transactions. Deposits with debit cards are instant, and withdrawals allow you to transfer winnings directly to your bank account without needing a third-party service. There are no extra fees at most casinos, and transactions are protected by strong encryption and fraud prevention measures. The main downside is that withdrawals can take between one and five business days, depending on the casino and your bank. Some banks may also block gambling-related transactions as part of responsible gaming measures. Unlike cryptocurrencies, debit card payments are fully traceable, meaning they don’t offer the same level of privacy. Despite these minor drawbacks, debit cards remain one of the safest and most reliable payment methods at UKGC-licensed casinos. They provide a simple, familiar way to play without the risks associated with crypto gambling. E-Wallet Casinos (PayPal, Skrill, Neteller) E-wallets have become one of the most popular alternatives to cryptocurrency casinos, offering fast, secure, and convenient transactions. For UK players, PayPal, Skrill, and Neteller are the biggest names in the game, with many UKGC-licensed casinos accepting them for both deposits and withdrawals. One of the biggest advantages of e-wallets is speed. Withdrawals are typically processed much faster than debit cards, often within hours rather than days. They also add an extra layer of security since you don’t have to share your bank details directly with the casino A key downside is that some UK casinos exclude e-wallet deposits from welcome bonuses, so always check the terms before signing up. Additionally, you’ll need to verify your e-wallet account before using it, which can involve submitting ID and proof of address. For players who value speed and security, e-wallets are one of the best alternatives to crypto casinos – just be aware of any potential restrictions on bonuses and transaction fees. You can find the best Skrill casinos here to start playing right away. Bank Transfer & Instant Banking Casinos (Trustly, Sofort, Open Banking) For UK players who prefer traditional banking methods with added security, bank transfers and instant banking services like Trustly, Sofort, and Open Banking provide a reliable alternative to cryptocurrency casinos. These methods allow direct transactions between your bank account and the casino, cutting out third-party intermediaries while maintaining strong regulatory protection. Standard bank transfers are known for their security and high deposit limits, making them ideal for players who prefer larger transactions. However, they can be slow, with withdrawals taking up to five business days. Instant banking solutions, on the other hand, speed up the process significantly. Trustly and Sofort facilitate near-instant deposits and faster withdrawals without requiring separate accounts – simply log in through your bank’s secure system. In conclusion, while cryptocurrency casinos may seem appealing for their speed and anonymity, they come with risks that UK players can’t ignore. Thankfully, there are plenty of secure and regulated alternatives that offer fast transactions, strong player protection, and ease of use. Whichever payment method you choose, always ensure you’re playing at a UKGC-licensed casino and gamble responsibly. With so many safe and convenient alternatives available, there’s no need to take unnecessary risks with unregulated crypto casinos.

On-chain indicators have remained positive, prompting Bitcoin analyst Ki Young Ju, to make a fresh bullish prediction. “I expect this to be the longest bull run in history, but I could be wrong” Ju writes in a post shared to X. Making a case for this bullish outlook, he remarks that only another bearish development can force the bulls to take a backseat. “We need at least another month of data to confirm whether we’re entering a bear market. If demand doesn’t recover, indicators may fully signal a downtrend.” He added . Per historical market patterns following the two year cycle, the current Bitcoin bull market is poised to last until April 2025. As such, the coming months remain crucial for BTC bulls to target $100,000. Short-term rebound in view as bulls dangle around the $90,000 price point While Bitcoin dangles at $94,725, the analyst caps the downtrend at the $77,000 price mark, stating that the chances of the asset dropping to that level appear to be low. However, a consolidation around $77,000 might be recorded before the market makes an upward correction. Per the Bitcoin fear and greed index, the market is showing extreme fear at this time. Meanwhile, as displayed in the 4-hour chart, a short term rebound is in view for the apex cryptocurrency as the asset builds support around the $90,000 price level.

However, as the sector matures, other cryptocurrency-based ETFs—including those incorporating a variety of digital assets—are expected to gain more traction.

As the most established crypto asset, it is widely seen as the safest choice, with a straightforward value proposition as digital gold, a well-defined regulatory status as a commodity, and strong institutional trust,” Fritz said in an interview with Crypto Intelligence News . “Naturally, investors—especially institutions—feel more comfortable allocating to BTC over other crypto assets. “While this trend may persist in the short term, we expect demand for non-Bitcoin products to grow over time. “As investors become more familiar with the broader crypto ecosystem, they will start exploring opportunities beyond Bitcoin, leading to increased traction and momentum for diversified offerings.” Institutional Demand for Bitcoin Extends Beyond the U.S. Roxanna Islam, Head of Sector and Industry Research at VettaFi, echoed this view, pointing out that Bitcoin’s dominance is not limited to the U.S. market but extends worldwide. “Bitcoin overall has significantly more demand than other cryptocurrencies–it holds approximately 60% of market share,” Islam told Crypto Intelligence News. “When packaged into spot ETFs, that dominance is even higher due to retail preference for Bitcoin. While I think there will be demand for other spot crypto ETFs, it will still remain relatively lower than Bitcoin. “This is similar to markets outside the U.S. where large suites of crypto ETPs are offered, yet Bitcoin ETPs are significantly more popular.” Despite Bitcoin’s overwhelming presence, Islam believes that multi-token crypto ETFs could play a crucial role in diversifying investors’ holdings. However, she maintained that Bitcoin would likely continue to lead the market, as many retail investors see it as the primary gateway into crypto. The Future of Crypto ETFs While Bitcoin-based ETFs are expected to remain the dominant players, Fritz suggested that exchange-traded funds composed of multiple cryptocurrencies could eventually gain more traction. He drew parallels between traditional financial markets, where diversified investment vehicles such as index funds have grown in popularity. “As long as it serves as the primary entry point for institutional investors, single-asset BTC products will likely maintain higher demand in the near term. “However, as the crypto market matures, investor preferences may shift toward diversified exposure to altcoins beyond Bitcoin—much like in traditional finance, where index funds and sector ETFs are often preferred over single-stock investments.” The expansion of the crypto ETF market is already visible in recent filings, which indicate a shift beyond spot products. Islam noted that new ETFs are increasingly aligning with trends seen in broader financial markets, incorporating features such as leverage and buffered protection. “Filings for new crypto ETFs have extended beyond spot products and are following broader ETF trends including leveraged and buffered ETFs. “It is likely that these trends will continue to align with the broader ETF market as the crypto ETF ecosystem grows more complex,” she concluded. While Bitcoin ETFs currently dominate institutional and retail demand, the landscape of crypto ETFs is gradually evolving. As investors grow more comfortable with digital assets, alternative ETFs—whether single-asset or diversified—are likely to gain momentum, shaping the future of cryptocurrency investment.

The recent Crypto Strategic Reserve announcement has fueled the broader cryptocurrency market, especially ADA, resulting in a 70% upside momentum. Cardano (ADA) Technical Analysis and Upcoming Levels This significant price rally has triggered a breakout of the bullish price action pattern that ADA has formed on the weekly timeframe. According to expert technical analysis, ADA has broken out of a bullish flag and pole price action pattern on the weekly timeframe. This pattern began forming in December 2024, with the price moving in a downtrend since then. However, today’s 70% upside rally has breached this bullish pattern, paving the way for a potential 90% upside move. Source: Trading View Based on recent price action and historical momentum, if ADA closes a weekly candle above the $1.05 level, there is a strong possibility that it could soar 90% to reach the $1.90 mark in the future. ADA’s Current Price Momentum Following this notable price surge, ADA has once again moved above the 200 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the daily timeframe, indicating that the asset is now shifting into an uptrend. ADA is currently trading near $1.05 and has surged over 70% in the past 24 hours. However, a significant portion of this rally occurred within the last 120 minutes. During the same period, the asset’s trading volume jumped by 800%, indicating heightened participation from traders and investors following ADA’s inclusion in the Crypto Strategic Reserve .",News|Crypto news|Price Analysis,EN,0,0,TRADING|ADA|MARKET|FIAT|BLOCKCHAIN,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-02 17:59:54

Market Is Still Skeptical,https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/03/02/market-still-skeptical-about-a-btc-reserve-in-100-days,"A weekend Truth Social post from President Donald Trump set in motion the first steps in creating a strategic U.S. bitcoin (BTC) reserve, but Polymarket traders are skeptical that it will happen within the first 100 days. As of press time, Polymarket bettors are giving a 23% chance that a strategic BTC reserve will be created within the first 100 days of the Trump presidency – or by April 30th, 2025. Rules of the contract say that the U.S. government will need to specifically hold bitcoin – and not from confiscation – by 11:59 PM ET on April 29 for this to resolve to yes. Announcements of the creation of a reserve do not count. Chances of a reserve coming true spiked from 11% to 23% in the moments after Trump's announcement. Another contract that asks if a reserve will be created by the end of 2025 currently has a 65% chance of resolving to yes. Initially, Trump's social media post announcing the creation of the reserve only named XRP and SOL as components of the reserve— which caused their value to spike —before clarifying that BTC and ETH would also be included in the reserve. One of the most profitable traders of the 100- day crypto reserve contract is Theo5 , which appears to be affiliated with a French trader who created a series of accounts , including Theo4 , to directionally bet on Trump's victory in the November 2024 election. Theo5 currently has posted a $40,000 profit on his no position. Meanwhile, a trader known as Polywog lost $73,000 on their yes position and also lost over $560,000 by incorrectly betting on the outcome of the 2025 election.",Markets,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|MARKET|BUSINESS|ETH,"{'name': 'CoinDesk', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coindesk.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coindesk,2025-03-02 18:09:12

Schlegel, president of SNB since October 2024, prefers assets like gold or bonds because they can bring stability to a volatile market. Bitcoin, conversely, can be highly volatile in a short period, adding volatility to markets. For this reason, Schlegel rejects Bitcoin, as an asset for the central bank, because he prefers assets that stabilise markets. Schlegel points out that a national bank does not necessarily have to offer cryptocurrencies. This is not to say that cryptocurrency should be restricted from other banks, but rather, it may not be appropriate for a central bank. He points out, further, that crypto still only has a small market share compared to other assets. For this reason, Schlegel describes Bitcoin as a “niche phenomenon”. According to Schlegel, cryptocurrencies do not meet the standards expected of traditional currencies. Schlegel argues that Bitcoin is free from regulatory structures traditionally used with currencies. A central bank manages a currency with regulatory structures. Therefore, Schlegel concludes that a central bank cannot manage Bitcoin because its decentralized design makes it difficult for a central bank to manage it. Schlegel mentioned two factors that convinced him that crypto was inappropriate for a central bank: 1) extreme volatility and 2) lack of liquidity. A central bank needs to access funds quickly in a crisis, and Bitcoin is still difficult to convert to fiat money. In December 2024, a committee urged the central bank to adopt Bitcoin. They wrote a document titled “For a financially strong, sovereign, and responsible Switzerland.” The committee then started a petition, collecting signatures throughout Switzerland. It took 18 months to collect over 100,000 signatures, to require the central bank to adopt Bitcoin. Schlegel responds that Bitcoin is impossible for a central bank, repeating concerns about volatility and lack of liquidity. He adds that it would be nearly impossible to liquidate Bitcoin reserves in large quantities in a crisis. Meanwhile, the initiative “For a financially strong, sovereign, and responsible Switzerland” continues to push for a reserve Bitcoin. It plans to amend Article 99, Paragraph 3 of the Swiss constitution to mandate the central bank to allocate Bitcoin reserves. Currently, the Swiss central bank has a mandate to hold gold reserves. The group published their demands in the Federal Bundesblatt, which allows them to collect 100,000 signatures until June 30, 2026.",Bitcoin|News|Bitcoin News|switzerland,EN,0,0,FIAT|BTC|REGULATION|MARKET,"{'name': 'ZyCrypto', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/zycrypto.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",zycrypto,2025-03-02 18:10:05
