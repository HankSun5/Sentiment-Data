The Bollinger Bands, a widely used technical analysis tool created by John Bollinger, indicate that the token entered oversold territory after a sharp decline over the past few days. XRP price fell 15.6% in just four days, dropping from $2.60 to $2.158 before touching the lower boundary of the Bollinger Bands on the daily chart. At one point, XRP even moved outside this range, a signal that suggests overselling. Historically, when an asset deviates from the lower band, price turnaround ensues. Signs of Strength and a Potential Trend Reversal XRP is reacting in line with this historical trend. After briefly falling outside the lower Bollinger Band, the cryptocurrency has since recovered and re-entered the range. Over the past 24 hours, XRP has gained 8%, reinforcing the possibility of a rebound. Traders closely watch this type of movement, as it typically indicates a change in market sentiment. Beyond technical indicators, broader market trends may further support a price recovery. Historical data suggests that the coming months could be favorable for the asset.

On average, XRP has delivered 20% gains in March, followed by 27% in April and May. This pattern has been consistent over the years, with the last instance of negative returns across all three months in 2016. While historical trends do not guarantee future outcomes, a potential technical rebound and a historically bullish period create a compelling case for the token’s recovery. If the current setup aligns with past patterns, XRP could be positioned for a significant upward movement in the coming weeks.

Tron price predictions indicate a recovery in progress, as it holds above the 200-day EMA and displays a bullish falling wedge formation. Meanwhile, Ethereum surged to $2,850 but has since lost momentum, raising doubts about continued growth. At the same time, BlockDAG (BDAG) Network’s presale is climbing fast, inching toward the $200 million milestone, fueled by the excitement surrounding its upcoming Keynote 3 event in March. The community is eagerly awaiting major announcements, pushing many to secure BDAG now before potential price spikes from the event’s revelations. Tron Price Prediction: Indications of a Market Rebound Tron’s price recently fell by over 45% from its peak, currently standing at $0.24. Despite this decline, Tron’s price prediction remains optimistic as it stays above the 200-day exponential moving average (EMA), showing strong buyer activity. Additionally, the asset is forming a falling wedge pattern, often considered a bullish sign. As the trendlines narrow, the likelihood of a price increase grows. Should this pattern play out, it aligns with forecasts predicting a climb back to $0.4485, an 86% potential rise. Ethereum (ETH) Price Surge: A Temporary Rise or a Stronger Trend? Ethereum’s price surge recently lifted ETH to $2,850, standing out as a strong performer despite the broader market’s struggles. However, it has since corrected, leaving many wondering whether this momentum can continue. This Ethereum price surge coincides with difficulties in Solana’s meme coin market, prompting increased interest in Ethereum. Even so, analysts such as Aran Hawker believe this surge is more of a “catch-up” rather than a breakout, with ETH adjusting to its fair value. A key support level sits at $2,425, where over 10 million wallets have accumulated ETH. Meanwhile, ETH is leaving exchanges at a rapid pace, reflecting confidence in its long-term worth. BlockDAG’s Keynote 3 Sparks Excitement— $600M Milestone in Sight! The upcoming Keynote 3 event, scheduled for March 2025, is poised to be one of the most anticipated crypto events. With a cinematic presentation style, it aims to capture the attention of crypto followers worldwide. Reports suggest that major updates, possibly including new blockchain features, will give holders a clearer understanding of BlockDAG’s direction. The project is witnessing remarkable progress, with its presale currently at $199.7 million and steadily climbing toward its $600 million objective. Analysts expect BDAG, priced at $0.0248 in batch 27, to reach $20 by 2027. Those purchasing now could see returns exceeding 800 times in just two years, cementing BlockDAG’s status as the best crypto of 2025. With the mainnet launch approaching, Keynote 3 is a crucial event for those looking to get ahead in the market. The announcements made during the event are expected to influence prices significantly, making it an important moment to watch. Many are already securing BDAG before Keynote 3, aiming for the highest possible gains, as any updates could lead to a surge in demand. As a result, batch 27 is nearly sold out, and once it ends, BDAG will no longer be available at its current $0.02348 price. Still, Confused About the Best Crypto in 2025? Despite its 45% drop, Tron price predictions remain strong, with technical signs pointing toward recovery. Meanwhile, ETH’s pullback after its recent Ethereum price surge suggests a stabilization, lowering expectations for an extended rally. For those searching for the best crypto of 2025 , BlockDAG stands out as the top contender. With Keynote 3 just around the corner, many are securing BDAG at its current batch 27 price of $0.0248, aiming for substantial future gains. As BDAG is predicted to reach $20 by 2027, demand is surging, pushing the presale closer to its $600 million target.

The analyst previously set the bottom target between $1.88 and $1.91, and XRP hit this range when it fell early in the week. Dark Defender referenced his analysis from February 22 and shared the chart outlining XRP’s price structure and projected movement, reinforcing his long-standing prediction. The chart illustrates a wave correction pattern, where XRP’s price has moved through significant Fibonacci retracement levels. Dark Defender compared this dip to a prior $0.3917 level, which previously led to a sharp reversal in price. Hi all. We set the bottom to $1.88 to $1.91 long ago and want to share the structure discussed last Tuesday, February 22nd. We hit our target correction level. The similar Fibonacci dip level was $0.3917, and then #XRP had a tremendous reversal. I see this level as identical to… pic.twitter.com/0NvfbLziLn — Dark Defender (@DefendDark) February 28, 2025 This crucial resistance level contributed to XRP’s massive surge in late 2024. Given this historical context, the analyst suggests that XRP could be positioned for a similar bullish move. Technical Structure and Fibonacci Levels The chart shared by Dark Defender shows a three-wave corrective structure labeled A-B-C. XRP completed Wave A after its price drop in the first few days of February when tariff threats from the Trump administration pushed the entire market downward. The digital asset is currently at the peak of Wave B, and before any positive price movements, Dark Defender expects a pullback. The chart shows Wave C bottoming at the $1.88–$1.91. Fibonacci retracement levels indicate wave B peaked near the 61.8% retracement at approximately $2.44 before price action moved lower. The 70.2% Fibonacci level at $2.34 also appears to play a role in this correction phase.

The asset has begun its recovery and could experience a significant bullish move soon. This multi-wave formation aligns with broader market trends and historical price movements. The reference to the $0.3917 correction and subsequent rally suggests similar technical dynamics may unfold. The implication is that XRP could be in a pre-reversal phase, contingent on whether support at the projected bottom holds. XRP’s Next Steps XRP is trading at $2.14, and Dark Defender’s analysis aligns with other recent perspectives on its market structure. The analyst recently noted that XRP is at a critical decision point , identifying $2.6052 and $2.77 as crucial levels that could contribute to the digital asset’s growth. His recent review of the weekly Heikin Ashi chart supports the notion of an impending price shift. This analysis suggests that XRP’s price structure is in a formation that could lead to significant movement, echoing broader bullish sentiment.

Will it survive and recover its price in the future, let’s find out. Table of Contents What is Tezos? Tezos crypto price prediction Tezos price prediction 2025 Tezos price prediction 2030 The native token of Tezos ( XTZ ) is currently trading at $0.765 which is about a 21.90% drop from its previous weekly high of $0.920. Its current market cap stands at $801.94 million with a 24-hour trading volume of $34.63 million. Tezos chart, March 01 2025 | Source: crypto.news In this article, we’ll discuss the Tezos price prediction by giving you its short and price forecasts, and explore whether this coin can continue its bullish run. What is Tezos? As per its official website , Tezos is defined as an open-source platform that tackles the main obstacles to blockchain adoption for assets and applications, supported by a global community of validators, academics, and developers. Tezos is claimed to be created with long-term upgradeability, open participation, teamwork, and smart contract security in mind. The native token of the Tezos blockchain is called Tez (XTZ). On the Tezos platform, it is utilized to communicate with dApps, pay fees, secure the network through staking, and offer a simple accounting unit.

Let’s dive into the Tezos price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Tezos coin price prediction: short-term outlook According to CoinCodex’s Tezos price expectation for the near future, the token is projected to rise by 9.37% and reach $0.857821 by March 28, 2025. As of Feb. 26, 2025, the overall sentiment of the XTZ price prediction remains bearish, with 21 technical analysis indicators showing bearish signals, 7 indicating bullish trends, and 7 indicators showing neutral forecasts. Now let’s discuss Tezos price prediction for 2025 and beyond. Tezos price prediction 2025 According to DigitalCoinPrice in 2025, the XTZ token’s price could fluctuate between $0.70 and $1.71, and may likely hold a yearly average of $1.65. CoinCodex projects that the XTZ token can trade in the price channel of $0.643043 and $1.342898 in 2025. According to Changelly’s analysis of Tezos’s recent price trends, the coin is projected to have a minimum price of $0.618 and a maximum price of $1.13 in 2025. While the general sentiment in the financial markets is that 2025 will be the year of the bull, it is important to understand that this prediction also has a chance of being wrong. BTC has already breached the $100k mark and there is a possibility that it may be at the top of this bull cycle. Hence it is advised to do your research before investing in XTZ or any other cryptocurrency with the hopes of gaining on your investment in 2025. Tezos price prediction 2030 As per CoinCodex’s Tezos coin price prediction for 2030, XTZ’s price could vary between $0.100438 and $0.701187. DigitalCoinPrice expects that XTZ’s price could climb to $3.69 or $4.22 by the end of 2030. Changelly predicts that by 2030, the XTZ’s token could range between $4.73 and $1.94. Before trusting any source that is trying to predict Tezos price prediction for 2030, you should understand that it is a cryptocurrency and like all other tokens, the XTZ token’s price can be highly volatile. This means that no one knows if this token can survive the next five years as there have been many instances where crypto tokens have lost their entire value while some are clear cases of rug pull. You should also note that crypto tokens experience higher volatility than other financial markets and this can cause big price fluctuations in its price.

Before investing in any cryptocurrency including XTZ, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrency in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community. Hence it is advisable to do your research on the token’s fundamentals which may very well decide the future of the Tezos token. Will Tezos go up or down? Cryptocurrencies in general experience rapid price swings that are directly driven by market sentiments, community engagement, events like token burns, and so on. While it is hard to determine how high the XTZ token will go, it is important to look out for potential buying factors that may include new partnerships, increased token holders, or viral campaigns in general. It is also vital that you rely on financial experts and consult them for Tezos crypto price prediction, but even after all that, you should remain cautious as no one can accurately predict how high or low XTZ can go. Should I invest in Tezos? Before investing in any cryptocurrency or trusting any Tezos price forecast, please identify and understand the inherent risks that can come due to market volatility. Also, it should be noted that cryptocurrencies in general are a highly speculative investment and their success not only relies on market volatility but also on the constant and sustainable growth of its community.

The feature, known as Duel Mode, allows players to engage in competitive battles with the assets and rewards at stake. Beyond enhancing user participation, this mode incorporates a structured burn mechanism that permanently removes tokens from circulation. How Duel Mode Works Duel Mode is a player-versus-player (PvP) feature where two participants compete in Shiba Eternity’s collectible card game (CCG). Each player must pay an entry fee of 50,000 SHIB, creating a total duel pool of 100,000 SHIB per match. Once a battle concludes, the winning player receives 80,000 SHIB, while 10,000 SHIB is burned, reducing the circulating supply. The remaining 10,000 SHIB is allocated to platform fees, ensuring continued game development and support. According to Lucie , the ecosystem’s marketing lead, Duel Mode is currently available only in the Web3 version of Shiba Eternity, which remains in its beta phase. The development team has not yet announced an official release date for the full version. Potential Impact on Token’s Supply The introduction of Duel Mode brings the potential for significant SHIB token burns . Lucie outlined an ambitious goal for the feature, emphasizing the importance of reaching millions of duels daily rather than just thousands. If at least one million duels occur daily, 10 billion SHIB could be burned every 24 hours. Assuming the current exchange rate ($0.00001390 per token), approximately $139,000 worth of SHIB would be removed from circulation daily. This translates to 70 billion SHIB ($1.03 million) burned in a week and 280 billion SHIB ($4.12 million) removed in a month. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 By reducing the overall supply, this burn mechanism has the potential to impact the token’s value positively over time. Current Burn Rate and Circulating Supply In addition to the anticipated burns from Duel Mode, the token’s burn rate has recently surged over 1,300%. Within 48 hours, 30.18 million tokens have been permanently removed from circulation. The token burn strategy has removed 410.74 trillion tokens from circulation, reducing the total supply to 589.25 trillion SHIB . As Shiba Eternity Duel Mode gains popularity, its deflationary mechanism may accelerate, reducing the asset’s supply while incentivizing players with rewards. The combination of competitive gameplay and a structured burn initiative presents a unique strategy to enhance the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.

Ver, a prominent advocate of Bitcoin Cash (BCH), has long been a critic of government control and taxation policies in the U.S. Buterin suggested that Ver was being unfairly targeted because of his vocal opposition to coercive government power and his advocacy of financial freedom. “It’s ridiculous to spend the rest of your life in prison for nonviolent tax crimes,” Buterin said. “The case against Roger seems very politically motivated; there have been many people and companies accused of much worse crimes, as with Ross Ulbricht, and sentenced to much lesser sentences than Roger is facing.” Related News: Elon Musk Talks About Dogecoin and Other Memecoins - Unexpected Statements Buterin also argued that selective prosecution of political opponents in the United States is a common tactic used by governments to suppress dissent. Buterin expressed concerns about the U.S. tax system, particularly the citizenship-based taxation model and high exit taxes, which he described as “excessive” and “harsh” compared to other countries. “The US citizenship tax and associated exit tax regime is extreme; the former is shared by almost no other country in the world and the latter is at the high end of what countries do,” Buterin said, citing the UK’s capital gains tax rule as a milder alternative. Buterin concluded his remarks by stating that tax-related offences should be dealt with through financial penalties and compensation rather than criminal prosecution. *This is not investment advice.

In an update shared on X, EF named two new co-executive Directors to drive the ecosystem’s core principles. New Leadership at Ethereum Foundation Notably, Ethereum Foundation has appointed Hsaio-Wei Wang, a researcher, and Tomasz Stanczak, Nethermind founder, as the new co-Directors. The duo will oversee the organization’s affairs and replace Aya Miyaguchi, the former EF Executive Director. According to the Ethereum Foundation, the new directors will pilot the affairs and promote the core values that birthed Ethereum’s existence. The foundation maintained that Ethereum is evolving into a robust, permissionless, and censorship-resistant network for global finance. In her reaction to the appointment, Wang, a researcher and community organizer, insisted the core principles of EF would not change. She, however, acknowledged that EF would continue to evolve alongside Ethereum for growth. On his part, Stanczak hinted he would step down from some of his official functions to assume the new role on March 17. He, however, assured that, pending the necessary paperwork, his work will continue uninterrupted. Miyaguchi’s Transition and Community Reactions The former Executive Director, Miyaguchi, had served in the capacity at EF for seven years before her elevation to the position of president. Miyaguchi’s elevation occurred despite criticism of her leadership style and seeming lack of competitiveness. Others also criticized her inability to deliver on Ethereum’s scaling solution. Many in the Ethereum community had rooted for Danny Ryan as the new lead director. Ryan had received 99% of voters’ support at an informal poll. Danny Ryan’s Etherealize Initiative Ryan, a researcher with EF, led the ecosystem’s switch to proof-of-stake . He now returns as co-founder of Etherealize.

Brett has seen a surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions, cementing its role in the Base blockchain ecosystem. Meanwhile, Floki Inu continues to dominate Web3, integrating DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse into its rapidly growing ecosystem. But the biggest star of the moment is BTFD Coin . With $6.23 million raised in presale, a 100% bonus code live, and a referral program offering major rewards, it’s no wonder investors are rushing in before the presale ends. With a $0.006 moon target and 3650% ROI potential, this is the meme coin everyone is watching. BTFD Coin’s Referral Program and $0.006 Moon Target Fuel Investor Frenzy Ever seen a meme coin reward investors like this? BTFD Coin is turning heads with its massive referral program , offering 10% of the total raise to top referrers each month. Investors who share their unique referral codes can earn extra rewards, and every new buyer using a code gets a 10% bonus on their purchase. And let’s talk about the crazy ROI potential. Analysts predict BTFD could hit $0.006 post-launch, making early-stage buyers the biggest winners. With $6.23 million already raised and over 70 billion BTFD tokens sold, investors aren’t waiting around. A $10,000 investment at $0.00016 per BTFD secures 62.5 million tokens. At the listing price of $0.0006, that would be $37,500. But if BTFD hits its $0.006 moon price, that’s an insane $375,000 potential return. With a 100% bonus on tokens available now, this is a rare shot at life-changing gains. Getting in before the final presale stage is easy. Investors need to set up a MetaMask or Trust Wallet, load it with BNB or ETH, connect to the presale page , and purchase BTFD using BNB, ETH, or USDT. Once the presale ends, tokens can be claimed and staked for rewards. Brett Expands DeFi Use on Base Blockchain Brett is more than just another meme coin—it’s powering DeFi transactions on the Base blockchain, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution known for its low-cost and lightning-fast transactions. Unlike traditional meme coins, Brett operates within decentralized exchanges (DEXs), enabling users to trade, swap, and interact with DeFi platforms seamlessly. Its rapid rise on Base proves that meme coins can be more than just hype—they can also drive real blockchain adoption. As interest in Ethereum Layer 2 solutions grows, Brett is positioning itself as a major player in the DeFi movement, making it one of the top new meme coins to invest in this weekend for those seeking both utility and meme culture. Floki Inu Fuels Metaverse and Web3 Adoption Floki Inu has evolved beyond its meme coin origins, becoming a full-fledged Web3 powerhouse. With integrations in DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and the Metaverse, Floki Inu is more than just a token—it’s an entire ecosystem. Originally inspired by Elon Musk’s pet dog, Floki Inu has gained traction through its strong community and real-world use cases. The project is now expanding into Metaverse applications, allowing users to buy digital assets, trade NFTs, and participate in Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming experiences.

Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, meme coins are no longer just internet jokes—they are shaping the next generation of blockchain applications. BTFD Coin’s explosive presale momentum, 3650% ROI potential, and referral rewards make it the biggest crypto opportunity right now. With Stage 14 in full swing and a $0.006 moon price target, this is the last chance for investors to grab BTFD at a low price before it takes off. Brett is bridging meme culture and DeFi, showing how meme coins can fuel real blockchain adoption on Base. Meanwhile, Floki Inu is redefining Web3, integrating DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse into one powerful ecosystem.

Back when Dogwifhat (WIF) launched, many ignored it as just another meme coin. Those who believed in its potential early on are now sitting on massive gains. But for those who missed out, another major opportunity is here: Arctic Pablo Coin (APC). With an innovative presale model and explosive growth potential, it’s quickly becoming one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. Dogwifhat: A Once-Overlooked Meme Coin That Took Off When Dogwifhat launched, few expected it to become a dominant player in the meme coin space. It started trading at just fractions of a cent, and many dismissed it as a passing trend. However, early adopters saw the vision and held onto their tokens. Fast forward, and Dogwifhat has skyrocketed in value, rewarding those early believers with enormous returns. Traders who hesitated now look back with regret, wondering how they missed such an obvious opportunity. But as one door closes, another opens. Arctic Pablo Coin is emerging as the next meme coin with game-changing potential, offering an early entry point that could lead to life-changing gains. Arctic Pablo Coin: The Best New Meme Coin to Invest in Now For those searching for the next big meme coin, Arctic Pablo meme coin’s presale is a rare chance to get in before prices surge. Unlike typical presales that move through predictable stages, Arctic Pablo Coin “travels” through different locations. Right now, it’s in Penguinopolis, with a price of just $0.000067 per token. With over $1.64 million raised, Arctic Pablo Coin is proving that investors are eager to be part of this journey. The expected launch price is $0.008, meaning those who enter now could see gains of over 11,844% when it goes live. Why Arctic Pablo Coin Stands Out While meme coins often rely on community hype, Arctic Pablo Coin is taking a unique approach: Innovative Presale – Instead of standard presale rounds, Arctic Pablo Coin progresses through different locations, keeping engagement high. Massive Growth Potential – With an entry price this low, investors have a chance at exponential gains by launch. Strong Community – Arctic Pablo Coin is attracting dedicated supporters who see the long-term potential of this new meme coin. With its creative model and significant momentum, Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly becoming one of the top new meme coins to invest in now. The Presale is Gaining Momentum – Don’t Miss Out Arctic Pablo Coin’s presale is generating serious excitement, and those who wait too long may find themselves regretting it—just like those who passed on Dogwifhat. As soon as the presale moves to the next location, the price will increase, making now the best time to secure tokens at the lowest possible price. With over $1.64 million already raised, this isn’t just another hype-driven project; it’s a fast-growing ecosystem with the potential to deliver massive gains. Conclusion The best time to buy a meme coin is before it takes off. Dogwifhat rewarded early believers with life-changing returns, and Arctic Pablo Coin could be following the same path. With a presale model designed to build long-term momentum and an entry price that’s still incredibly low, Arctic Pablo Coin is quickly becoming the best new meme coin to invest in now. As the presale moves through different locations, the price will keep rising. The opportunity is here today—don’t be the one looking back wishing you had taken action.

Earlier, the token recorded a 1.4% gain, suggesting short-term bullish momentum. However, over the past seven days, SHIB has declined by 13.22%, extending its losses over the last month to over 24%. At the time of writing, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00001363, reflecting ongoing volatility in the market. Analyst Highlights Potential for Significant Price Increase According to crypto analyst Javon Marks, SHIB is maintaining its l ong-term breakout pattern , which began in early 2023 when it surpassed a descending trendline. Following this breakout, a retest of the trendline confirmed a shift in market sentiment, as buyers gained control and selling pressure diminished. Marks also pointed out a hidden bullish divergence, a technical signal that often precedes upward price movements. Based on this pattern, he projects a price target of $0.000081, which represents a potential gain of over 450% from current levels. The analyst maintains that, despite the tomen’s recent volatility, the broader trend remains positive, supporting the possibility of sustained price appreciation into late 2025. Whale Accumulation Signals Institutional Confidence Shiba Inu’s ownership distribution data provides additional insight into market dynamics. Over the past month, large holders—commonly referred to as whales—have increased their SHIB holdings by 0.35%. This trend suggests that institutional and high-net-worth investors are accumulating the token, a sign of confidence in the asset’s long-term potential. Similarly, mid-sized holders have expanded their positions by 0.30%. This investor category, which typically consists of strategic buyers focusing on medium-to-long-term gains, appears to be strengthening its commitment to SHIB. Conversely, retail participation has declined by 0.67%, indicating that smaller investors may be exiting the market. Historically, a reduction in retail activity alongside increased whale accumulation suggests a shift in ownership toward more stable, long-term holders.

According to TradingView analyst Paul Endeo , several bearish factors, including a potential head and shoulders pattern, weak network growth, and declining institutional interest, have contributed to the token’s recent struggles. Additionally, lower profitability among existing holders has put further pressure on the token’s price. Endeo identified $0.0000147 as a critical support level for SHIB. He stated that if the token maintains this level, it could see a 20% rebound toward its monthly high of $0.00001718. However, if support fails, SHIB’s price could decline toward $0.00001261. His analysis appears to be playing out, as SHIB has struggled to hold above the $0.0000147 support level. The token currently trading at $0.00001381, signaling a potential breakdown toward the $0.00001261 target he predicted. This decline suggests that bearish pressure remains strong, and unless the token regains momentum, further downside could be imminent.

41026226,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/?p=684777,1740870000,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/43/41026226.jpeg,"Dogecoin Whales Move Millions of DOGE From Crypto Exchanges, What Are They Buying?",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/dogecoin-whales-move-millions-of-doge-from-crypto-exchanges-what-are-they-buying/,"The cryptocurrency market is rife with speculation because to the massive movements of Dogecoin (DOGE) by huge investors. Millions of DOGE were moved from exchanges to private wallets in a series of massive transactions during the past week, according to blockchain researchers. This pattern often indicates stockpiling or a deliberate reorganization of a portfolio. Although the reasons are unclear, new data shows that demand for presale products with larger short-term payments is increasing. Among them, investors have been paying particular attention to Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which reroutes money from meme coins into DeFi initiatives that have real-world applications. Mutuum Finance (MUTM), which is currently in its second presale phase, has raised $1.85 million since its launch and has more than 3,550 holders. Mutuum Finance Presale Momentum Builds Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is at the forefront of DeFi solutions that combine lending efficiency with passive sources of revenue. Its two-stage presale mechanism gradually raises token prices to incentivize early adopters with rapid returns. When phase three enters the scene at $0.02, investors at $0.015 are looking to gain 33.3%, and the eventual listing price of $0.06 ensures threefold returns. Such numbers, based on transparent tokenomics, shun speculative guessing of names in an attempt to create a stampede for digit security. The project’s historic $1.85 million presale monies raised within weeks are testimonies to the trust of institutional and individual investors. Phase one sold out sooner than anticipated, and demand is driven by shortage as phase two picks up speed. More than 3,550 holders now back the ecosystem, and figures rise each day as Dogecoin whales and institutional investors move reserves to MUTM’s presale. Lending Model Fuels Sustainable Demand The focal point of Mutuum Finance’s appeal is its overcollateralized lending protocol, where users are able to borrow assets against collateral that has been locked up and earn interest on deposits. Borrowers who use $5,000 worth of USDT, for instance, need to lock up $7,000 worth of Ethereum (ETH), reducing default risks and balancing liquidity pools. Lenders, on the other hand, are paid with mtTokens; dynamic assets that grow in value as interest is earned. These tokens, liquid on every DeFi platform, encourage long-term interaction with compounding benefits without the necessity of liquidating holdings. A peer-to-peer (P2P) lending option brings further diversification of utility with direct negotiation on non-traditional assets like Dogecoin. Such adaptability, unprovided by regular platforms, turns MUTM into a middle point between meme coin liquidity and structured DeFi markets. Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism Anchors Growth Mutuum Finance (MUTM) integrates a high-margin business model with platform revenue employed in automatically repurchasing the token. Purchased MUTM tokens are rewarded to mtToken stakers, inducing consistent buy pressure and avoiding sell-outs. Paired with a $100,000 ten-participant presale giveaway, holder incentive is optimized, rewarding short-term buys as loyal stakeholders. Token distribution also increases longevity: 35% to liquidity mining, 20% to partnerships, and 15% to stabilize post-launch trade. It is such an approach that bypasses volatility that has dogged meme coins and provides a logical solution for investors who do not want growth to be uneven. Exponential Returns Signal in Post-Launch Trajectory Whereas the $0.06 listing price promises a 400% return to early investors, Mutuum Finance’s roadmap has far greater potential. The introduction of an overcollateralized stablecoin, auditing by top blockchain security firms, and dynamic interest rates responding to market conditions can propel MUTM to over $10 by 2025. At that level, a presale investment of $1,000 increases to $66,600; a 6,500% increase eclipsing much of the performances of meme coins. Veteran cryptocurrency players know such presale periods are rare chances to join at grassroots prices. With phase two creeping towards its cap raise, the time to gain access to MUTM under $0.02 becomes increasingly diminished each day. As Dogecoin whales turn into projects that couple profitability with innovation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is among the best candidates for redirected funds. Its presale, already compelling thousands of buyers, combines mathematical return guarantees with a utility-focused ecosystem poised to overwhelm the long term.

After navigating a challenging period marked by regulatory hurdles and market volatility, XRP is now breaking through key resistance levels with undeniable momentum. The spotlight is firmly fixed on the $2.25 mark, a critical barrier that could unlock the next chapter of XRP’s bullish journey. With technical indicators flashing green, institutional interest on the rise, and a broader crypto market recovery underway, XRP’s journey to $2.25 and beyond could be one of the most exciting narratives in crypto this year. Breaking $2.25: A Gateway To New Highs? The $2.25 level holds immense technical and psychological importance for XRP. Historically, this zone has acted as a formidable resistance point, often dictating the direction of XRP’s price action. Breaking above it would validate the current bullish momentum and signal a potential shift in market sentiment toward stronger buying pressure, opening the door for further gains. Related Reading: XRP Price Wobbles at $2.00—Will Bulls Step In to Save The Week? A successful breakout above this zone would confirm strong bullish momentum, opening the door for growth toward $2.92 and even $3.4 in the near term. Historically, breaking key psychological and technical resistance levels has often triggered accelerated price action, as sidelined buyers step in and short sellers unwind their positions. As XRP builds momentum, technical indicators suggest that the rally could extend beyond $2.25, reinforcing a bullish outlook. One key indicator, the Relative Strength Index (RSI), is attempting to break above the 55 threshold. Once the altcoin moves above this level, it may spur demand for XRP, potentially fueling further upside momentum. Additionally, a rising RSI often aligns with strengthening price action, suggesting that buyers are gaining control. If the RSI continues to trend higher and crosses into the overbought territory (above 70), bullish momentum tends to build, increasing the likelihood of XRP challenging higher resistance levels. Bearish Possibilities While XRP’s recent rally has been impressive, the cryptocurrency is not immune to bearish pressures. As the market watches the asset challenge key resistance levels, attention is also turning to critical support zones that could determine whether the uptrend holds or gives way to a bearish breakdown. Related Reading: XRP Bears Resurface—Key Levels to Watch Now Weakening momentum, combined with failure to break above the $2.25 resistance level, points to renewed selling pressure, leading to a possible decline toward the $1.97 support zone. A rejection at this key resistance could signal exhaustion among buyers, allowing bears to regain control and push the price lower. In the event of a drop below $1.97, the next critical support levels to watch would be $1.85 and $1.75. Failure to hold these zones might reinforce a more extended bearish phase, exposing XRP to deeper corrections.

Web3Bay Presale Closes Soon & XRP ETF Draws Attention,https://thecoinrise.com/will-solana-hit-200-web3bay-presale-closes-soon-xrp-etf-draws-attention/,"Are we witnessing strength in Solana, or is XRP preparing for a surge? And what role does Web3Bay play? Recent activity shows that large Solana holders are buying during price dips, despite current challenges. At the same time, XRP is drawing attention as rumors about an ETF grow. If the ETF is approved, it could invite major institutional investors and push XRP to new levels. Even as Solana and XRP face market challenges, Web3Bay’s crypto presale moves into a crucial stage. In contrast to well-known coins, the price of Web3Bay is not yet affected by market volatility, as it climbs with each phase of the presale. With costs rising and a shrinking number of tokens available, now might be the last chance to invest before public trading drives up the value of 3BAY. Web3Bay Stage 5 Set to End Soon – Traders Act Quickly Web3Bay is approaching its launch date and its presale is nearly sold out. At the moment, 3BAY tokens are available for $0.00524, but this rate will not be around for much longer. As each stage of the presale is completed, the price increases and the final public launch is expected to be at $0.1959 per token. Early participants are already in a strong position if they buy at lower rates, and those who decide to invest now still have the chance to gain before the public sale. To date, over $1.5 million has been collected, and more than 390 million tokens have been sold. The appeal of Web3Bay lies in its plan to transform online shopping by offering a decentralized platform. This system removes the need for middlemen, lowers fees, and makes it possible to use both digital currency and traditional payments in the future. The presale model is set up so that increased buyer participation naturally pushes up the token price. This creates a sense of urgency for anyone wishing to invest before the next rise. The trend is similar to the buying activity seen in Solana, where large investors purchase tokens in anticipation of a future surge. For Web3Bay, the upcoming phase marks an important turning point as it shifts from presale to a market-ready asset. Once the platform launches, early token buyers will benefit as the market adjusts. With a limited supply remaining, this phase could be one of the last opportunities to secure 3BAY at a lower cost before its value climbs. Traders are acting quickly as the presale nears its conclusion, aware that each moment counts in building a strong position for the future. Solana Whale Buying Activity Points to Major Shifts Ahead Recent changes in Solana’s price have kept market participants alert. Despite the volatility, large holders continue to increase their SOL positions, showing belief in the long-term prospects of the network. However, an upcoming event — the FTX unlock of 11.2 million SOL scheduled for March 1 — may introduce selling pressure. Even so, there remains strong interest from institutional players. Coinbase has recently introduced Solana futures contracts, expanding options for market entry. Analysts remain divided on Solana’s future. Some predict that SOL could reach $200, while others warn it might fall below $150. Although short-term swings are expected, consistent large-scale purchases indicate that substantial progress may still be ahead for Solana. XRP ETF Discussion Intensifies as Price Forecasts Split XRP is gaining attention as the Bitwise application for an XRP ETF moves forward. If approved, the ETF could allow more institutional investment, similar to Bitcoin ETFs for BTC. Brazil has already approved the first spot XRP ETF, which may pave the way for approvals in other markets. A recent article about Ripple shared by Donald Trump has fueled debate over XRP’s role in global finance. Analysts remain divided: some expect XRP to rise to between $5 and $7, while others warn that without sustained interest, XRP could fall to $0.60. Unlike the steady buying seen with Solana, XRP’s near-term performance largely depends on regulatory decisions. Should these hurdles be overcome, XRP might experience a strong upward move. Essential Takeaways Market changes could spark new trends for Solana and XRP. Large Solana holders continue to build positions, even as the upcoming FTX unlock may affect prices. Meanwhile, the XRP ETF decision will play a key role in determining whether XRP climbs or drops. Web3Bay’s crypto presale follows its own course, with prices rising at every stage. With the final phase nearing, little time remains to buy tokens at a lower rate before public trading drives prices up. For those planning to invest, now is the time to act.

Cardano and Solana have been solid choices for years, but many investors are now exploring fresh alternatives with bigger upside potential and Propichain is at the forefront. This project is turning heads with its real-world use cases and early investment potential. With blockchain-powered real estate at its core, could this be the next big crypto? Why Cardano and Solana Traders Are Exploring New Options For years, Cardano and Solana have been go-to projects for blockchain enthusiasts. Cardano’s research-driven approach has made it one of the most methodical and scalable networks, while Solana’s lightning-fast transactions have attracted developers and traders alike. But even strong projects face challenges. Cardano’s roadmap has been slow to unfold, frustrating some investors looking for faster progress. Solana, on the other hand, has had its share of network outages, raising concerns about long-term stability. With the crypto market evolving, many traders are eyeing fresh opportunities that combine innovation, utility, and growth potential. This is where PropiChain comes in. Unlike traditional blockchain networks that focus primarily on DeFi and smart contracts, PropiChain is bridging the gap between crypto and real estate, offering investors something tangible and sustainable. PropiChain’s Real-World Use Cases Are Turning Heads What sets PropiChain apart is its ability to bring blockchain technology into real estate investing. While Cardano and Solana have revolutionized decentralized applications, PropiChain is doing the same for property ownership. One of its most exciting features is fractional ownership. In the traditional real estate market, high prices often lock out smaller investors. PropiChain changes that by allowing users to buy a fraction of a high-value property, making real estate investing more accessible. You can own part of a luxury apartment without needing millions of dollars. Then there’s AI-powered analytics, a game-changer for investors who want smarter decision-making. Instead of manually researching market trends, PropiChain’s AI scans real estate data, predicts trends, and highlights lucrative investment opportunities. For traders used to analyzing crypto charts, this adds a layer of intelligence to property investments. Another major draw is metaverse integration. As digital real estate grows in value, PropiChain lets you buy and trade virtual properties alongside physical ones. You can also get income from renting or leasing these virtual properties to digital companies. The tokenization feature is also shaking up the industry. Traditionally, property transfers involve banks, brokers, and weeks of paperwork. PropiChain speeds up the process by turning real estate ownership into blockchain-based tokens, making buying and selling property as easy as trading crypto. Smart contracts take things a step further by automating transactions, reducing the need for intermediaries. That means lower fees, faster processing times, and fewer hurdles for investors. And for those looking for financial flexibility, DeFi integration allows users to borrow against their real estate-backed assets, much like how crypto holders use their tokens as collateral for loans. This opens up new possibilities for leveraging investments without selling assets outright. Cardano and Solana Traders Trust PropiChain’s Secure Foundation Security is always a top concern in crypto, and PropiChain has made it a priority. The project has undergone a comprehensive security audit, giving investors confidence in its blockchain infrastructure. Its listing on CoinMarketCap further boosts its credibility, making it easier for traders to track its performance and evaluate its potential. These steps are reassuring for investors moving from Cardano and Solana, who are used to well-established projects. PropiChain’s Presale Could Be a Golden Opportunity Right now, PropiChain is in Stage 2 of its presale, with tokens selling at $0.011. Early investors have a unique chance to get in before the wider market catches on. To put things into perspective: A $2,000 investment today secures 181,818 tokens. If the token price hits $3, that investment would be worth over $545,000. A $10,000 investment could potentially grow to $2.7 million if PropiChain reaches that same price target. These numbers explain why traders from Cardano and Solana are shifting gears—they see the potential for massive returns. Is PropiChain the Next Big Crypto Opportunity? As traders from Cardano and Solana look beyond their usual investments, PropiChain is emerging as an exciting alternative. Its combination of tokenization, AI, and metaverse is reshaping the way people invest in real estate. The crypto market has always rewarded early adopters, and PropiChain’s presale offers a rare chance to get in at the ground floor. If the project continues on its current trajectory, it could become one of the biggest success stories of 2025. The question is; will you seize the opportunity, or will you watch from the sidelines?

Two names that keep coming up are XRP and WallitIQ (WLTQ) . Many investors want to know when these two will hit major price milestones, and GrokAI has stepped in with its predictions. Based on market trends, adoption rates, and investor sentiment, GrokAI suggests XRP could climb to $6, and WallitIQ (WLTQ), which is currently in presale, has a shot at reaching $1 much sooner. WallitIQ (WLTQ) On Track for $1 GrokAI made bullish speculations about WallitIQ (WLTQ) as its presale gained more traction in the crypto market. In this presale, it offers its token to everyone in the crypto community at a very low price of $0.0420 per coin. As investors from several regions hurry to buy the token, GrokAI predicted it would skyrocket in value to the $1 mark in the next few months. However, aside from the profit early investors will make when they buy the token now, all token holders will gain access to an AI-powered crypto wallet that changes how users interact with crypto wallets. WallitIQ (WLTQ) aims to transform the functionality of crypto wallets by incorporating AI-driven security, intelligent investment suggestions, and a user-friendly interface. Unlike traditional wallets, its AI-based features help users make better trading and staking decisions, protect against fraud, and upgrade overall security . The platform’s Escrow Connect technology offers an extra layer of security, allowing users to engage in transactions confidently, free from worries about smart contract vulnerabilities. Also, the use of its platform, like the Physical2Digital feature sets the token apart from many other presale projects that offer little more than theoretical whitepapers. Furthermore, the token has been listed on the asset tracking platform CoinMarketCap, and the beta version of its crypto wallet is now live, another factor driving it towards the $1 mark predicted by GrokAI. Additionally, recognizing the importance of security in a network, WallitIQ (WLTQ) has upgrade its platform by implementing regular audits of its smart contract for added protection. SolidProof, a highly regarded blockchain security firm, assessed the platform’s smart contract and confirmed it is free from vulnerabilities that could expose it to cyber attacks, enhancing its credibility as a secured network The Potential of XRP: A Pathway To $6 XRP has been around for years, making waves with its role in cross-border payments. It has seen strong rallies in the past, but regulatory challenges and market volatility have slowed its growth. After its legal battles with the SEC, it regained some momentum, but the price remains far from its previous all-time high. GrokAI predicts that it could see a new all-time high of $6 within the next 12 to 18 months, provided the broader market continues to recover and institutional interest grows. Factors influencing the XRP price movement include adoption by financial institutions, increased utility within cross-border payments, and overall bullish sentiment in the crypto market. If trading volume remains strong and it solidifies its position as a leader in blockchain payments, it could reach the $6 target sooner than expected. What This Means For WallitIQ (WLTQ) Investors GrokAI’s predictions highlight two very different investment opportunities. XRP is a well-established asset with a strong foundation, but its price movements are slower and more dependent on external factors. Investors who are willing to hold long-term could see it hit $6, but it may take a while. WallitIQ (WLTQ) , on the other hand, is a high-potential presale token with the chance for much faster gains. Since it’s still in the early stages, investors who get in now are positioning themselves for a potential breakout before it hits major exchanges. The crypto market moves fast, and opportunities don’t last forever. WallitIQ’s (WLTQ) presale is still open at $0.0420 , but as demand increases, the price won’t stay this low for long. Investors looking to take advantage of its growth potential might not want to wait too long before making a move.

According to sources, Chinese authorities worry that their AI experts may inadvertently reveal sensitive information on the country’s economic progress while abroad. Additionally, Chinese authorities are concerned that their experts may be detained when they travel overseas or even used in negotiations between the US and China. During Trump’s first term, some of Huawei’s executives were detained in Canada at the US request, and China does not want a repeat of the same with its AI experts. China requires AI experts travelling abroad to detail their leaving and returning plans AI executives and even those from the robotics industry have been told not to travel to the US unless absolutely necessary. Then again, any AI executive wanting to travel abroad must report to authorities on their plans to leave and return, including details on what they did and who they met overseas. Source: ryanswansonlaw Key AI executives have already started changing their travel plans. Liang Weifang, the founder of DeepSeek, declined an invitation to an AI summit in Paris in February. Meanwhile, another major AI startup founder abruptly cancelled a planned US trip last year after receiving direct instructions from Beijing. However, China’s travel restrictions for its AI experts have cultivated uncertainty over future international collaborations , as the country now seems less interested in the global sharing of AI knowledge. The Chinese travel industry is worried other countries may impose visa and travel limitations on their nationals The Chinese travel sector has expressed concerns about the impact of the government’s travel restrictions. Some have cited that they could lead to fewer cross-border innovation and networking opportunities. At the same time, some suggested that other Western nations could impose travel restrictions on Chinese business entrepreneurs. The travel industry also worries that the government may continue interfering with international travel freedom for months. Some travellers believe the US could even impose visa limitations on Chinese AI experts or introduce strict export controls on AI-related technologies. With growing tensions between the two nations, any retaliatory measure could worsen their divide. In February, China implemented tariffs against the US, including a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas products and a 10% tariff on crude oil, agricultural machinery, and large-engine car imports. This, however, was a response to Donald Trump’s introduction of a 10% levy on all Chinese goods entering the US. Meanwhile, analysts fear Trump could raise tariffs to 60% as he had promised during his campaign trail, or at least threaten to implement them to gain a diplomatic advantage over Xi. However, a tariff rise could escalate tensions between the two nations and even lead to a full-blown trade war. For now, the country’s leading AI experts are treading carefully — skipping major international summits and facing tight travel reporting requirements. But this caution begs a broader question: Does restricting global engagement enhance China’s AI dreams, or will nationalism, by isolating its top talents, weigh down advancements?

While some projects fade into obscurity, others rise through the ranks, attracting both institutional and retail interest. The question on everyone’s mind is simple: where’s the next big win? If you’re searching for the top cryptos to join now, you need to pay attention to Qubetics, XRP, and Algorand. Each of these projects brings something unique to the table, with game-changing technology, strategic partnerships, and serious potential for long-term growth. Qubetics, in particular, has been making serious waves in the crypto space. With its presale already raising over $14.3 million, investors are rushing in to secure their tokens before the price jumps again. Unlike many projects that promise the moon but deliver little, Qubetics is already laying the groundwork for a financial revolution. Meanwhile, XRP continues to battle regulatory challenges while proving its use case in cross-border payments, and Algorand is solidifying its role as one of the most advanced blockchain ecosystems in existence. Let’s break down why these three cryptos should be on your radar right now. Qubetics: The Future of Web3 Finance and Cross-Chain Trading Qubetics is not just another cryptocurrency project—it’s a full-fledged ecosystem that aims to revolutionize how people interact with decentralized finance. As the world’s first Web3 aggregator, Qubetics connects multiple blockchain networks, ensuring seamless and secure transactions across different chains. For businesses and individuals alike, this technology opens up new possibilities that were once unthinkable. Imagine being able to move assets across chains without the usual headaches of liquidity fragmentation, slow transactions, or high fees. Qubetics is making this vision a reality. For instance, consider a startup launching its token on multiple blockchains. Traditionally, this would require complex integrations and liquidity pools that can be costly and inefficient. With Qubetics , developers and businesses can access an all-in-one solution, where assets move effortlessly between networks. This innovation is powered by its non-custodial multi-chain wallet, which ensures users retain full control over their funds while benefiting from Qubetics’ ultra-fast transaction speeds. The platform has already secured strategic partnerships with SWFT Blockchain and 1inch, further enhancing its capabilities. Security is another major concern in the crypto space, and Qubetics is tackling it head-on. By leveraging SWFT Blockchain’s encryption technology, Qubetics ensures that all transactions are executed with the highest level of security. This is a game-changer for businesses handling large amounts of crypto, as it drastically reduces the risk of hacks and exploits. At the same time, Qubetics’ partnership with 1inch enhances decentralized trading by providing access to the best liquidity pools and lowest possible fees across multiple DEXs. Whether you’re a trader, an investor, or a business owner, the Qubetics ecosystem offers unparalleled benefits. Qubetics Wallet and Blockchain Audit A standout feature of the Qubetics ecosystem is its multi-chain wallet. Designed with user convenience in mind, the Qubetics Wallet allows users to manage assets across various blockchains from a single interface. No more juggling multiple wallets or dealing with cumbersome transfers; everything is streamlined for efficiency. To further bolster trust, Qubetics has partnered with CertiK for a thorough audit of its blockchain and wallet infrastructure. CertiK, established in 2018, has a stellar reputation for enhancing the security of blockchain ecosystems. Their rigorous assessment of Qubetics not only identifies potential vulnerabilities but also reinforces the project’s commitment to providing a secure environment for its users. The impact of this audit is already evident. News of CertiK’s involvement has sparked increased interest, leading to a surge in token holders and presale participation. As Qubetics approaches its mainnet launch in Q2 2025, this foundation of security and interoperability positions it as a frontrunner in the crypto space. Qubetics Presale: Your Chance to Lock in Early Gains The crypto presale is taking off, with Stage 23 already in motion and an impressive $14.3 million raised so far. With 21,700+ token holders and a staggering 492 million $TICS tokens sold, demand is soaring. Currently priced at $0.0888, Qubetics follows a strict 7-day presale stage structure, where prices increase by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM. This means those who jump in now are locking in the best possible entry point before $TICS hits the open market. Crypto analysts have high expectations, predicting $TICS will reach $0.25 at the presale’s end, giving holders a 181.52% ROI. After the presale, projections suggest $1 per TICS (1,026.09% return), $5 per TICS (5,530.44% gain), and an eye-watering $15 target (16,791.32% ROI) after mainnet launch. A $1,000 investment today at $0.0888 could balloon into $168,000 at the $15 mark. With such massive potential, Qubetics is quickly emerging as the most lucrative crypto presale of 2025! XRP: A Veteran Crypto with Massive Utility While Qubetics is making headlines with its presale success, XRP remains one of the most well-known cryptocurrencies in the world. Created by Ripple, XRP has positioned itself as the go-to digital asset for cross-border payments. Unlike traditional banking systems that take days to settle international transactions, XRP enables near-instant settlements at a fraction of the cost. This has made it a favorite among financial institutions and payment processors. Despite facing regulatory challenges, XRP continues to prove its resilience. Ripple’s legal battle with the SEC has cast uncertainty over the project, but recent developments suggest a positive outcome may be on the horizon. If Ripple secures a favorable ruling, XRP could see a massive price surge as institutional investors pile in. Additionally, Ripple’s ongoing partnerships with major banks and fintech firms further solidify XRP’s position as a leading crypto asset. With its strong fundamentals and growing adoption, XRP remains a solid choice for long-term investors looking to capitalize on the future of digital payments. Algorand: The Green Blockchain Powering DeFi Algorand is another top contender in the crypto space, particularly for those who value sustainability and efficiency. Unlike energy-intensive blockchains like Bitcoin, Algorand operates on a pure proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which drastically reduces its carbon footprint. This makes it one of the most eco-friendly blockchains available today. But sustainability isn’t its only strength—Algorand is also incredibly fast, processing thousands of transactions per second with minimal fees. One of Algorand’s biggest selling points is its ability to support decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. Its technology is already being used in various sectors, including finance, gaming, and supply chain management. For instance, Algorand is the backbone of several DeFi projects, enabling users to lend, borrow, and trade assets with ease. As institutional adoption of blockchain technology grows, Algorand is well-positioned to become a key player in the next wave of crypto innovation. Conclusion: The Time to Act is Now With the crypto market gearing up for another major rally, now is the perfect time to position yourself for future gains. Qubetics is leading the charge with its explosive presale, providing investors with a rare opportunity to get in before the price surges. XRP continues to prove its value in the cross-border payment space, and Algorand’s eco-friendly technology is attracting major interest from the DeFi sector. If you’re looking for the top cryptos to join now , these three should be at the top of your list. Don’t wait too long—opportunities like this don’t come around often, and the next big breakout could be just around the corner.

The crypto market is fast-paced, and BlockDAG’s progress is impressively swift. During its fifth AMA in February 2025, the project disclosed several updates that highlight its drive and strategic market entry. With nearly $199.7 million collected through its presale, 18.6 billion BDAG coins distributed, and a 2,380% ROI since its first release, BlockDAG is transitioning from initial excitement to tangible achievements. The AMA revealed that mining hardware is almost complete, a worldwide beta testing initiative is active, and the project’s dedication to decentralization and environmental sustainability is stronger than ever. BlockDAG Sets the Stage with Bitmain for Exclusive Mining Revolution The standout announcement involved BlockDAG’s potential collaboration with Bitmain, a leader in the crypto mining industry, and another top manufacturer. They aim to develop unique mining rigs tailored for the BlockDAG network. These rigs will be exclusive to BlockDAG, unlike typical mining equipment which can be adapted for various blockchains. Why this exclusivity? For enhanced security and decentralization. By limiting the network to specific rigs, BlockDAG aims to counteract the centralization issues that have affected other proof-of-work networks. This strategic decision helps maintain a dispersed and secure mining environment. This concept is already proving its worth. Over 16,000 miners have been sold, bringing in $6.5 million—a clear indicator of the community’s strong engagement and commitment. Global Beta Testing Initiative Launches with 100 Participants While hardware innovation is crucial, it’s the real-world application that truly tests its mettle. Recognizing this, BlockDAG has initiated a beta testing program, handpicking 100 miners globally to put their equipment through rigorous real-life conditions before commencing mass production. The selected testers—mostly seasoned node operators and mining experts—will evaluate: Performance: Do the rigs meet their expected hash rates and efficiency levels? Energy Efficiency: How well do they manage power consumption against profitability? Decentralization: Is the mining activity evenly spread out across various regions? Durability: Are the devices resilient during continuous operation? BlockDAG’s approach of integrating its community in the testing process not only serves to refine their hardware but also strengthens trust and transparency within its user base. This method contrasts sharply with projects that prematurely launch their hardware, often having to retreat and revise when real-world performance doesn’t meet the hype. The takeaway from the AMA is clear: BlockDAG is not just progressing quickly—it’s progressing wisely. Presale Momentum Climbs Beyond $199.7M, Sparking Market Excitement The presale figures alone are turning heads. BlockDAG has successfully gathered almost $199.7 million, steadily advancing towards the ambitious $600 million goal. With 18.6 billion BDAG already sold and the price now at $0.0248—a significant jump from the initial price—the enthusiasm is palpable. What’s driving this surge? A notable factor is the anticipated listings on ten centralized exchanges (CEXs), set to potentially boost liquidity and market visibility. Previous early adopters in Layer 1 projects like Solana and Avalanche have experienced dramatic price surges post-listing, and BlockDAG is positioned to follow a similar path. The Strategic Timing of BDAG Mining Before Mainnet Activation The recent AMA highlighted a crucial insight: now is the prime time to start mining BDAG, with the mainnet slated for release later this year. Early miners stand to gain much higher rewards as they get in before the network’s difficulty increases. The development of the hardware, prioritizing energy efficiency, goes beyond mere profitability—it champions sustainability. This emphasis on environmentally friendly mining practices is increasingly vital in a world where the ecological footprint of blockchain is a growing concern. Miners engaging now are not only bolstering the network but are also securing early advantages that could bring significant long-term benefits. BlockDAG’s distinction lies not just in its ability to raise funds or secure hardware partnerships but in its methodical plan for sustained growth. Instead of pursuing fleeting advantages, BlockDAG’s strategy involves a robust integration of technology, community engagement, and economic benefits. Aligning with first-rate manufacturers like Bitmain demonstrates a dedication to quality and durability. Additionally, the beta testing initiative ensures that, by the time the mainnet is operational, both the miners and the network at large are optimized for the demands of real-world application. This approach, focused on solid execution rather than mere hype, sets BlockDAG apart in a sector where genuine substance is often overshadowed by speculation. Upcoming Milestones: Mainnet Launch and Exchange Debut The recent AMA concluded with key updates on the roadmap: Results from beta testing will be announced soon. Final details on hardware specs are expected to follow. The mainnet is scheduled to go live in 2025. Up to ten centralized exchange listings are anticipated before the end of the year. For those still deciding, the chance to purchase BDAG for under $0.0248 is dwindling quickly. With the upcoming listings, prices are poised to surge, potentially leaving those hesitating to face higher costs in the near future. Wrapping Up: Seize the Moment or Miss Out? BlockDAG’s 5th AMA was more than a routine update—it marked a pivotal declaration of progress. With nearly $199.7 million about to be secured, established hardware collaborations, and active real-world tests, this Layer 1 initiative is moving from theoretical potential to practical implementation. Those choosing to back BlockDAG now are not merely gambling but are trusting a project that stands true to its commitments and is setting itself up for enduring significance in the market. As the mainnet launch and exchange listings approach, the focus will shift from whether BDAG will surpass $1 to just how rapidly and extensively it will grow.

Top Presale Cryptos to Invest in 2025 – Big Opportunities Knock!,https://thecoinrise.com/dive-into-future-crypto-market-leaders-top-presale-cryptos-to-invest-in-2025-big-opportunities-knock/,"As the cryptocurrency sector draws investors seeking high-growth avenues, engaging in presales has proven to be an effective strategy. These stages often present a chance for considerable gains prior to a broader exchange launch. If you are on the lookout for the top presale cryptos to back in 2025, these four initiatives are notable for their innovative applications, market prospects, and appeal to investors. 1. Web3Bay – Revolutionizing E-Commerce with Enhanced Blockchain Security Online sellers face ongoing challenges with chargeback fraud, especially on major platforms like PayPal and Amazon, where transactions can be contested, leading to unjustified refunds. Web3Bay addresses this issue using blockchain technology and smart contract-based escrow to secure and finalize transactions, eliminating disputes. Web3Bay’s use of smart contracts ensures that payments are withheld until buyers confirm the delivery of their purchase. Should a dispute occur, the blockchain’s immutable ledger records provide indisputable evidence of the transaction, curtailing fraudulent claims. Unlike traditional platforms which often side with buyers, Web3Bay ensures impartial resolutions through verifiable data. The project has attracted investor attention, securing $1.5 million in its ongoing Stage 5 presale with over 390 million tokens distributed at $0.00524 each. As conventional e-commerce struggles with fraud, Web3Bay’s blockchain solution stands out among top presale cryptos, promising significant returns for early backers with an anticipated listing price of $0.1959. 2. Dawgz AI – Enhancing Crypto Trading with AI Technology Dawgz AI is set to revolutionize automated trading by blending artificial intelligence with real-time market insights. Users of this platform gain access to AI-powered trading bots that deploy tactics rooted in historical analysis and forward-looking predictions. A standout feature of Dawgz AI is its staking program, which lets investors earn passive income while their tokens appreciate in value. The initiative has successfully raised over $1.5 million during its presale, drawing attention from both retail and institutional investors. As AI-driven trading emerges as a key development in the crypto sector, Dawgz AI provides tools that improve investment decisions. Those interested in sophisticated trading solutions with solid economic foundations might view this presale as a prime choice among top presale cryptos. 3. iDEGEN – Revolutionizing Social Media with Web3 and Token Rewards iDEGEN ushers in a novel approach to social interaction by rewarding users with cryptocurrency for their online activities. This contrasts with conventional social platforms, which profit from user content without offering financial rewards, as iDEGEN compensates users directly for their engagement and contributions. The system employs a token-based rewards mechanism that financially benefits both content creators and community participants with iDEGEN tokens. This move towards a decentralized social media format is attracting users eager to manage their digital earnings. The enthusiasm for iDEGEN’s presale indicates a strong market entry, with its tokens anticipated to launch at a higher value due to robust demand. As Web3 social platforms gain traction, iDEGEN is poised to become a prominent player. 4. Mind of Pepe – A Meme Coin with a Twist of AI Mind of Pepe combines the viral nature of meme coins with innovative artificial intelligence, adding a unique element to a popular trend. Unlike typical meme coins, which rely primarily on community enthusiasm, Mind of Pepe incorporates AI-driven content and interactive elements to maintain interest over time. The initiative has developed an AI chatbot that enhances its ecosystem by providing fun and engagement for its token holders. Those who have benefited from prior meme coin trends see potential in Mind of Pepe for its added AI features. With strong backing in its presale, especially from retail investors keen on dynamic, community-focused projects, Mind of Pepe is carving out a niche. As meme coins continue to captivate the market, this project introduces an innovative variant. Wrapping Up Investing in top presale cryptos for 2025 could yield substantial gains for early participants. Leading the charge, Web3Bay innovates with blockchain solutions for e-commerce, Dawgz AI leverages AI in trading, iDEGEN integrates token rewards in social media, and Mind of Pepe blends meme appeal with AI functionality.

According to CoinMarketCap, the Dogecoin price at $0.2532 has faced downward pressure as investors offload holdings, anticipating further declines. While Dogecoin has maintained relevance due to its strong community and high-profile endorsements, its lack of significant technological advancements has raised concerns about its long-term viability in a rapidly evolving market.

Market analysts predict the altcoin will shortly approach $5,000. Ethereum price prediction for 2025 is being driven by its increasing acceptance in Latin America, forthcoming Pectra upgrade, and debates on a staking-enabled ETF. Concurrently, the new cross-border payment system, Remittix (RTX), has drawn attention in the market. Investors seem to be mostly drawn to the Remittix early 2025 presale since more individuals find the next outstanding company with enormous potential. Ethereum Price Prediction: Ethereum Set To Reach $5K Ethereum is on its track to reach the $5,000 mark now priced over $2,226 with its increasing practical use. Many are tracking these developments to see whether Ethereum price prediction might cross this significant mark. ETH has found stability for forty million individuals in Latin America, where inflation and financial uncertainties abound. While stablecoins help locals to hedge against depreciation of currencies, DeFi finance businesses such as EthicHub fairly credit small-scale farmers. Additionally growing its infrastructure as use rises is Ethereum. Additionally in development by 21Shares is a spot Ethereum ETF with staking so that ETH owners could be rewarded. Should approval be granted, this ETF may liberate institutional money and raise Ethereum price prediction. In a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) disclosure, 21Shares declared their plan to stake parts of the Ether ownership via certified staking providers. The fund management noted that this approach would increase investor returns while maintaining proper Ether performance monitoring. Ethereum price prediction keeps an eye on real-world usage, network improvements, and institutional interest growing because it might hit the $5,000 barrier. How Remittix Is Revolutionizing PayFi While exact numbers are not known, early Remittix (RTX) investors talk about 300% Remittix returns. Still, PayFi possibilities are generating buzz. Unlike some altcoins, RTX aims to solve a big problem: too expensive wiring costs. Analysts believe that strong alliances created by cryptocurrencies could replace coins driven by enthusiasm. Some analysts argue that coins with practical value—like Remittix (RTX)—have a more consistent increase than meme-based or totally tech-driven tokens. Should remittances from abroad remain a primary source, RTX might keep a constant user base instead of riding the rollercoaster of brief excitement cycles. Though no currency is expected to soar overnight, PayFi tokens can pass more speculative competitors with a mix of pragmatic application and strong advocates. Both crypto-exclusive systems like Coinbase Wallet and Remittix ensure accessibility and inclusiveness for companies and consumers; Remittix is the better option to conventional payment providers like Stripe and Wise. Notable also is the platform's open flat-fee strategy, which provides savings and openness over absurd rates of exchange of traditional banks. Why Now is the Best Time to Buy $RTX Remittix is groundbreaking in the payments sector since it ensures that the entire amount paid reaches the recipient, therefore tackling unethical behavior all too often. The RTX coin offers high investment worth with a pre-sale of $0.0694. Forecasts show a fascinating boom; demand for creative cross-border payment solutions is generating a 25x multiplier in the presale phase and over 1,500% growth following launch.

One new project, Remittix, has become somewhat well-known with its innovative approach to cross-border payments while ADA and SHIB fight against bearish trends and declining on-chain statistics. Looking at the most recent advancements in Cardano, Shiba Inu, and Remittix will help us to understand why both significant institutional and worldwide retail investors are experiencing increasing FOMO anxiety. Cardano: On the Edge of Further Declines ADA/USDT daily chart Cardano (ADA) has extended its weekly decline by 7%, having already tumbled 23% in recent sessions. This drop aligns with Santiment data revealing a downturn in daily active addresses, a sign of waning network demand. Bearish momentum surfaced when ADA broke below a key support level at $0.74, continuing its descent. Technical analysts anticipate a potential 16% plunge toward the February low of $0.50 if downward pressure persists. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index stands at an oversold 28, signaling caution as the token’s correction deepens. Starting early February, Santiment's Daily Active Addresses statistic dropped from 49, 585 to 24,609, implying declining on-chain activity. This lack of user involvement aggravates ADA's pricing problems and can open the path for continuous selling pressure and more losses. Shiba Inu: Bracing for a Potential Crash Under increasing selling pressure, Shiba Inus (SHIB) are under closer examination. Two important support zones at $0.000012 and $0.00000094 where buyers could intervene to stop or reverse the fall are highlighted by certain analysts. More general market downturn, meanwhile, adds to the ambiguity. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that 58% of SHIB holders are underwater, increasing the likelihood of capitulation if losses worsen. Additionally, 74% of SHIB tokens are held by large investors, heightening volatility and the risk of significant price swings. Given the declining correlation between SHIB and Bitcoin, it might not gain from any more general market recovery. A little decline in Telegram membership suggests even more disappearing community involvement. Shiba Inu owners should be alert for now since there is no assurance of a quick return. Remittix: A Rising Star in DeFi While Cardano and Shiba Inu struggle, Remittix continues to flourish, positioning itself as one of the DeFi market’s most promising newcomers. Its ongoing presale has already notched record-breaking figures, selling over 510 million tokens and raising more than $13.2 million. Early participants have enjoyed gains exceeding 1000%, despite adverse crypto conditions. Remittix's popularity stems mostly from its cross-border payment system, which lets customers turn over more than 40 cryptocurrencies into FIAT and transmit them all around free from hidden costs. Often finishing transfers far faster than conventional banking systems, this solution uses local payment networks and blockchain technology to simplify transactions. The Remittix Pay API, which lets companies accept crypto payments and settle them in fiat, is another great advantage. The open ledger of the platform lets everyone see every transaction, therefore lowering fraud possibilities. With major gains already on the board, analysts predict that Remittix could see further 200% increase in the coming month. What Lies Ahead Amid volatility in the crypto space, communities behind major tokens like Cardano and Shiba Inu are on the lookout for new gems. Remittix’s swift rise and practical use cases have sparked optimism that it could mirror XRP’s meteoric success. As the DeFi sector evolves, projects offering real-world applications are poised to thrive. Remittix’s surge during a bearish period suggests that its momentum may continue, fueled by a strong community, practical payment solutions, and an unwavering commitment to transparent financial transactions. If it manages to maintain this trajectory, the stage is set for Remittix to become a standout performer well into 2025 and beyond.

These coins are gaining attention and could soon experience significant growth. Key insights and factors driving this potential surge are explored, offering valuable information for those looking to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the cryptocurrency world. Aptos Price Dynamics: Key Levels and Recent Trends Over the past month, Aptos faced a decline of about 14%, while the six-month change shows a modest gain near 4%. A 7% rally in the past week, combined with these longer trends, highlights the volatility in the market. The balance between short-term drops and longer gains suggests an adjustment period, with traders reacting to broader cryptocurrency movements. Currently, Aptos trades between approximately $4.77 and $8.01, with immediate resistance at $9.55 and key support around $3.07. The signals are mixed, indicating slight upward momentum, while oscillators do not show strong extremes. This reflects a balance between bulls and bears. Traders may consider range-bound strategies, watching for breakouts above resistance or pullbacks to support. Sui Moves: 6-Month Rally vs Recent Decline, Key Levels to Watch The coin lost about 13% in one week and dropped nearly 23.5% in one month while registering a strong 271.65% gain over the past six months. Price swings reflect a volatile journey with substantial long-term gains contrasted by short-term pressure. Recent performance underlines the struggle traders face as the strong rally shifts to a more concerning trend. Current trading sees prices bouncing between $2.12 and $3.84 with nearby support at $1.40 and resistance at $4.84. Negative signals on momentum and moving averages indicate a bearish slant without a clear trend. Trading ideas include looking for bounces off support while approaching resistance cautiously for potential profit-taking. Conclusion APT and SUI show promising signs of gaining bullish momentum. Analysts observe that both coins have strong development teams and innovative technology. The market trends appear favorable for their potential growth. Keeping an eye on these coins might be beneficial for those interested in emerging cryptocurrencies. As APT and SUI continue to evolve, they could attract more attention from investors. Conclusively, these assets have the ingredients needed to make significant gains in the near future. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

Ethereum has been one of the hardest-hit assets, experiencing a massive decline of over 27% in less than five days. Investors are growing cautious as ETH struggles to hold key support levels, fueling uncertainty about its short-term direction. Related Reading: Is Solana In A Macro Trend Move? Charts Show Potential Shift Despite the widespread panic, large investors appear to be taking advantage of the dip. Data from Santiment reveals that whales have accumulated significant amounts of ETH in the last 24 hours, suggesting that institutional players and high-net-worth individuals are positioning for a potential recovery. Historically, such accumulation phases by big players have preceded strong reversals, indicating that smart money might be betting on an eventual rebound. While selling pressure remains high, this whale activity could provide a foundation for ETH to stabilize and regain lost ground. However, for a bullish recovery to take shape, Ethereum needs to reclaim crucial levels above $2,500. The next few days will be critical in determining whether ETH can bounce back or if the market will continue to slide further down. Ethereum Accumulation Signals Trust Ethereum is trading slightly above the most critical support level since December 2023, a price zone that could determine its short-term direction. Bulls must hold this level to prevent further declines and initiate a recovery phase, but selling pressure remains strong. Analysts are divided, with some expecting a prolonged bear market while others see potential for a rebound. Crypto expert Ali Martinez shared Santiment data on X, revealing that whales bought another 190,000 ETH in the last 24 hours. This adds to the broader trend of accumulation that has been ongoing for the past month. Historically, such whale activity signals confidence from large investors, who often accumulate at discounted prices before an uptrend resumes. If this trend continues, Ethereum could be setting up for a strong recovery rally. Related Reading: Dogecoin Open Interest Declines 67% In Three Months – Can Meme Coins Recover? However, bullish momentum remains uncertain. ETH needs to reclaim key levels above $2,500 to confirm a reversal, and failing to do so could lead to further corrections. The market is currently driven by fear and uncertainty, but the continuous whale accumulation suggests that smart money is positioning for future gains. The coming days will be crucial in determining whether Ethereum can bounce back or if the bearish trend will persist. ETH Testing Crucial Long-Term Demand Ethereum is trading at $2,220 after reaching its lowest level since late November 2023. The recent sell-off has pushed ETH below critical support zones, and bulls are struggling to regain control. The price is now below the 200-week exponential moving average (EMA) at around $2,290 and the 200-week moving average (MA) at around $2,480, signaling a bearish outlook unless a strong recovery takes place soon. For Ethereum to regain momentum, bulls must reclaim the $2,500 level in the coming days. A breakout above this level would signal renewed strength, potentially leading to a massive recovery rally as traders regain confidence. However, ETH remains under pressure, and failing to reclaim the $2,300 mark could confirm further declines. If this scenario unfolds, Ethereum could face a deeper correction toward the $2,000 psychological support, or even lower, depending on market sentiment. Related Reading: Ethereum Retraces To Critical Monthly Demand Level – Can ETH Hold Selling Pressure? With the market still dominated by fear and uncertainty, traders are watching key technical levels closely. If ETH can stabilize above $2,200 and push higher, a relief rally could be on the horizon. Otherwise, Ethereum could remain trapped in a prolonged downtrend, testing investor patience and market resilience. The next few days will be critical for ETH’s price action.

For them, Solana and XRP do not promise the level of growth this new PayFi sensation promises. Hence, the latter is what their money is on to deliver the goodies to early adopters in 2025. This article examines the motivations behind their perspective, considering the Solana priceprediction, XRP's latest news, and Remittix's robust market fundamentals. Solana Price Might Replicate 2022 Bear Market Since the last time in 2024, Solana has once again seen its value fall below $135 briefly before rebounding above $140 . The sharp drop follows the crypto asset's failure to hit a new all-time high. Rather, the SOL crypto plunged by 43% in February. Considering historical patterns, the Solana price performance demonstrates that a severe downtrend could be imminent. According to the experts, the altcoin’s technical indicators display similarities to what preceded the 2022 bear market run. In that cycle, the Solana price crossed $260 in November 2021 and plummeted below $10. This run also witnessed the 26-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) crossing over the 12 EMA, which confirmed the lengthy bearish cycle. Should history repeat itself, continuous crossover and negative MACD readings might stifle the SOL price potential. XRP Price Analysis XRP price performance has taken over the latest crypto news after the crypto lost the bullish momentum it exhibited in the fourth quarter. The Ripple crypto is now facing a deeper risk of continuous meltdown . The constant drop is primarily attributed to macroeconomic tension in the United States as President Trump set new hefty tariffs . As a result, there's been stagflation, and the Federal Reserve was compelled to cut interest rates before the supposed time. Still, technical indicators show that the chances of a solid bearish breakout in the coming days remain high despite the XRP coin trading within a danger zone. Meanwhile, the token could still crash below the $2.00 level if the performance turns bearish . Considering this reality, the altcoin might slump further towards $1.6230, where it may witness a rebound. Remittix (RTX): Next Crypto Heavyweight While Solana and Ripple's price performances are heavily influenced by their robust brand appeal and market share, Remittix is rapidly stealing the spotlight thanks to its game-changing PayFi platform, which combines cryptocurrencies with day-to-day finance. Remittix enables users to convert crypto into FIAT currencies and deposit funds directly to any bank account globally. This project solves the biggest drawbacks of a multi-trillion-dollar PayFi market, a sector burdened by overhead costs, exclusion of the unbanked, and lengthy transfer processing. Now, users can convert over 40+ crypto pairs into 30+ fiat currencies and make cross-border payments effortlessly. Thanks to this real-world utility, Remittix distinguishes itself from speculative tokens currently facing bearish market momentum and turbulence. Thanks to its tangible benefits and banking offer to millions of unbanked individuals, Remittix is well-positioned for massive real-world adoption. This potential is evident in its presale as the massive appeal confirms the project’s growth potential. The presale has amassed over $13.2 million in presale funding as investors’ confidence remains high. Moreover, as early $RTX adopters, you will already have enjoyed over 362% value growth following the token’s price increase in the presale to $0.0694 from its starting price of $0.015. Indeed, there's no investment without risk. Still, market insiders are super confident that Remittix is poised to be the next crypto heavyweight, potentially outperforming Rippleand Solana in terms of ROI. By combining utility and potential for a meteoric rise, the RTX token is where profit-driven investors put their money in 2025.

While XRP grabs headlines with its legal breakthroughs and fresh partnerships, Dogecoin finds itself in a slump after its earlier success. In the meantime, Remittix is turning heads by focusing on actual, real-life uses for crypto payments. Many investors see this as a positive sign, given that meme tokens, AI coins, and Real World Asset (RWA) cryptos have lost billions of dollars since January. XRP Latest News: Big Shifts in the Legal Arena In a legal dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), XRP has been at the centre. Now, rumors say the SEC might ease up on its appeal against Ripple , which could reshape how digital assets are handled by regulators. John Reed Stark has observed that the SEC is no longer pushing as hard to label tokens as securities, hinting at a possible new plan for regulating crypto. Meanwhile, Ripple has teamed with BDACS in South Korea to offer safe, institutional-level custody for XRP and RLUSD. Through Ripple Custody’s bank-like services, BDACS hopes to welcome more large-scale investors to the table. At the same time, the XRP Ledger (XRPL) is getting an upgrade, adding programmability that won’t slow down the network. According to Jack Claver , this could let developers make customized solutions for large companies, boosting XRP’s standing among global businesses. Over the last day, XRP rose to $2.14, with trading volume at $8.53 billion . Dogecoin Price Prediction: Tough Times for Meme Coins Dogecoin, one of the original meme coins, isn’t looking so stable these days. The SEC recently said that meme tokens like Dogecoin aren’t securities . Still, Dogecoin slid by 12.4% last Friday , falling below $0.19 for the first time since November 2024. Some data shows small retail holders may be panic-selling, causing prices to drop even more. A “death cross” has now formed on Dogecoin’s daily chart, where the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. This is often seen as a sign of more downside. Some link this fall to the negative mood in the market and political news tied to former President Trump. Source: tradingview If DOGE wants to recover, it must get back above $0.20 , but many think the real test is around $0.29. If Dogecoin can’t hold $0.20, it may head down to $0.15, and even a high trading volume may not be enough to revive it unless there’s a strong reason for investors to jump back in. Remittix Steals the Spotlight: An ICO Raising $13.2M in Weeks As XRP adapts to possible changes from the SEC and Dogecoin fights to recover, Remittix has popped up as the real success story. Many people call it the next big thing in the payment sector. Rather than banking on internet buzz, Remittix takes a “PayFi-first” path, solving real problems in day-to-day money use. As meme coins, AI cryptos, and RWA tokens bleed out billions in total value, Remittix has attracted those who want more than hype. The numbers are clear: $13.2 million raised in only a few weeks proves there’s a big demand for coins that truly handle payment challenges. Remittix’s system allows smooth crypto-to-fiat conversions and is built for easy merchant adoption. It also emphasizes following rules and regulations, giving big investors more peace of mind. This is something many meme or AI coins never really managed to do. Why Remittix Could Be the Top Crypto Pick As the market gets weary of meme coins and projects stuck in legal chaos, payment-focused tokens like Remittix are on the rise. XRP might do well if it clears its legal issues, and Dogecoinstill has fans despite its recent price troubles. Yet the swift growth and practical use cases of Remittix show that investors crave real-world value. Raising $13.2 million so quickly shows there is strong interest in bridging crypto with everyday finance.

Many believe that the best crypto to buy now should have the potential to change the way we handle money. Reports show that Solana, Pi Network, Remittix, PEPE, and AVAX are some of the tokens picked to be the best options in 2025. Investors see these tokens as promising picks with potential for strong gains. Remittix, in particular, stands out with a real-world solution that cuts through many financial hurdles. Solana: The Prospects of One of The Fastest Networks In Crypto Recent Solana news shows that the network continues to work hard towards improvement. Many users enjoy the speed of Solana when they send crypto or use dApps. This is one of the reasons why SOL is reportedly one of the first altcoins to show signs of recovery following the recent market downturn. SOL is up 12% from the last 24 hours and is primed for more in the coming days. Despite the strong start, Solana’s recovery is expected to unfold gradually with a surge by 2.10% to $147.39 by March 6. Investors watch the Solana price as a sign of strong technology and growing adoption. Solana remains a solid choice for those who want a token with a clear function and steady improvements. Pi Network: The New Altcoin On The Block Pi Network appears to be immune to the recent market downturn. It was reported to have surged nearly 80% within 24 hours and has reached a new all-time high of $2.99. This surge coincides with a huge increase in 24-hour trading volume, which has now surpassed $3.2 billion. Pi network is a project that brings crypto to everyday life. It aims to give people a chance to join a digital network with low barriers. Investors see Pi Network as a potential growth story and keep an eye on its progress. If Pi Network continues in its current trajectory, it could rise by 231.79% and reach $ 7.68 by March 31. PEPE: The Potential For Recovery PEPE has become well known in the market for its wild early gains. Over time, its value has seen dramatic ups and downs. Recently, it has been noted as one of the major drivers behind the market recovery following the market-wide downturn. While PEPE has faced its fair share of setbacks, it still holds a spot in many portfolios. It currently trades at $0.000007867, which is up over 7% from 24 hours ago. Pepe price predictions are quite optimistic with expectations that it could rise by 228.25% and reach $0.00002607 by March 31. AVAX: Prospects For Recovery AVAX, the native token of Avalanche, is known for supporting a range of decentralized apps and finance tools. AVAX offers fast and secure transactions with a design that supports a growing number of dApps. Investors watch AVAX price trends closely, as the token has shown strong growth over time. AVAX plays an important role in a broad ecosystem and remains a favorite for those who want steady, long-term gains. Its use in various finance projects gives AVAX a solid base, and many see it as an attractive option in a diverse portfolio. AVAX's recovery is said to unfold gradually. Avalanche is predicted to rise by 6.94% and reach $ 23.96 by March 31. Remittix: The Revolutionary Payment Solution Remittix is a new DeFi project that tackles a big problem in global finance. Many people around the world do not have access to a bank. They often use services like Western Union to get cash. Remittix fixes this by making crypto-to-FIAT transfers simple and fast. The system, called PayFi, cuts out extra steps and removes the risk of reversal. This means funds go where they need to be without delay or extra cost. Remittix gives users full control over their assets while keeping their identity private. It ties modern crypto into traditional finance so that people keep their anonymity and asset control. The project has already sold over 510 million tokens in its ICO. This strong start has drawn attention from both retail and institutional investors. Its current DeFi coin price sits at around $0.0694, a low entry point that many see as a good chance to invest. Remittix is not only about moving money quickly; it also makes cross-border payments easier by cutting out extra fees and delays common in the traditional system. With these benefits, Remittixhas the potential to boost crypto adoption as a payment method and may even drive widespread change in global finance.

41029892,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/here-are-3-cryptos-cheaper-to-buy-than-dogecoin-doge-that-will-hit-1-first,1740876837,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/75/41029892.jpeg,Here Are 3 Cryptos Cheaper To Buy Than Dogecoin (DOGE) That Will Hit $1 First,https://cryptodaily.co.uk/2025/03/here-are-3-cryptos-cheaper-to-buy-than-dogecoin-doge-that-will-hit-1-first,"With its price declining 12.4% on Friday, below $0.19, Dogecoin (DOGE) has suffered losses, lowest since November 2024. While DOGE struggles, three undervalued cryptocurrencies—Kaspa (KAS), Brett (BRETT), and Remittix (RTX)—are cheaper than DOGE and poised to hit $1 first, offering strong potential for growth amidst Dogecoin’s challenges. Let’s explore why these tokens could outperform DOGE. Kaspa (KAS) – Speed Meets Scalability At $0.07944 , Kaspa (KAS) is attracting interest for addressing one of blockchain's main problems: scalability. Kaspa handles thousands of transactions per second using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) technology, providing great speed free from the bottlenecks encountered in conventional blockchains. With a $2.2 billion market capitalization, currently ranked 54th on CoinGecko, it is notable for cheap transaction costs and effective network. Kaspa's capacity to manage massive transaction volumes with almost instantaneous finality sets it to satisfy the growing need for scalable blockchain solutions. With the market poised for a possible bull run, Kaspa might explode and be a fierce competitor to reach $1 before Dogecoin, especially as businesses progressively embrace blockchain technology and analysts are positive about its future. Brett (BRETT) – Meme Coin with Staying Power Brett (BRETT) is a meme coin that’s gaining traction due to its vibrant community and growing interest in meme coins. Priced at $0.03858, it’s cheaper than Dogecoin and has seen impressive market activity with over $34 million in daily trading volume. Despite a recent 23.8% drop, Brett’s strong social media presence and loyal community help it weather market turbulence. Unlike other meme coins that fade, Brett’s ability to sustain momentum suggests long-term growth potential. If it can overcome the current downturn, Brett could hit $1 faster than expected, making it an attractive option for investors seeking value in the meme coin market. Why Dogecoin is Falling Behind Dogecoin’s recent price decline to below $0.19 is a stark reminder of the volatility that meme coins can face. Despite initial success driven by Elon Musk's high-profile support and a post-election surge, Dogecoin's price has now suffered a 46% drop in February alone. Factors such as the controversial government role taken by Musk and President Trump's recent tariff policies on Mexico and Canada have added downward pressure. The ongoing retail panic selling, as evidenced by the surge in active Dogecoin addresses, indicates a lack of confidence among smaller traders. Furthermore, the ""death cross"" technical pattern on DOGE’s charts and its low RSI (Relative Strength Index) signal that the downward momentum may continue, leading analysts to predict further losses for Dogecoin. With Dogecoin’s price struggling to reclaim key support levels, it may take longer for it to hit the $1 mark than other cryptocurrencies like Kaspa, Brett, or Remittix. Remittix (RTX) – A Game-Changer in Global Payments While Dogecoin struggles, Remittix (RTX) is gaining attention for its potential to revolutionize the remittance sector. This altcoin offers a fast, cost-effective solution for cross-border payments, having raised $13.2 million in presale funding. With 510 million RTX tokens sold, Remittix is currently valued at $0.0694 per token. Positioned below its future value, Remittix addresses the global remittance market, worth trillions, by providing cheap and quick payments. With traditional services charging high fees, Remittix fills a critical gap, offering scalability and efficiency. As more underbanked regions adopt its solution, the demand for Remittix tokens will likely increase, potentially pushing it to $1 faster than even Dogecoin. The Race to $1 While Dogecoin remains a popular meme coin with a passionate community, it is facing significant hurdles in its path to $1. In contrast, Kaspa, Brett, and Remittix represent undervalued cryptocurrencies with solid use cases, strong communities, and growing interest from investors. Whether you’re looking for speed and scalability with Kaspa, meme coin potential with Brett, or the game-changing financial solutions of Remittix, these three tokens are cheaper to buy than Dogecoin and may very well hit $1 first. For investors looking to position themselves in the next big crypto trend, it’s time to take a closer look at these three contenders before Dogecoin’s downward slide extends further.

The trading value of PEPE coin settled at $0.0000085 on February 27, 2025 while the industry experienced general market instability. Experts speculate what PEPE's potential price drop could yield as Bitcoin price approaches $65,000 after sinking to $85,000. Despite these bearish forecasts, a new Defi project with its $13 million presale and 4x surge is offering a smarter play. Pepe’s Recent Struggles and Market Sentiment The frog-themed PEPE token has endured a rough patch lately. It’s down over 10% in the past week , slipping to $0.0000084 after a high of $0.0000147 in December. A massive 175 billion PEPE token dump by an institutional player has added pressure, per on-chain data. Trading volume spiked to $871 million recently, signaling heightened activity. Yet, this surge hasn’t stemmed the tide of losses. The PEPE market cap hovers around $3.55 billion, ranking it 37th among top meme coins. Analysts note a bearish pattern forming on PEPE’s chart. If support at $0.000007 cracks, a steeper decline looms. Investors eye Bitcoin’s next move closely. A drop in the leading crypto could drag PEPE down further, as BTC’s trajectory often dictates the fate of smaller tokens. Bitcoin’s Slide Toward $65,000 Bitcoin, the market bellwether, stands at $85,201 as of February 26, 2025. It’s shed nearly 8% in a week, per recent reports, hitting a three-week low. Global jitters and a $1.5 billion Bybithack fueled this retreat. If Bitcoin falls to $65,000, a 23% drop from its current level, altcoins could suffer. Historically, meme coins like PEPE amplify such moves. A 30-40% decline wouldn’t be surprising, pushing PEPE toward $0.000006-$0.000007, based on past correlations. Market watchers point to upcoming U.S. tariffs as a risk factor. These could further sour sentiment, driving Bitcoin lower. For PEPE holders, this spells a potential storm.. The $80.3 billion meme coin sector shows resilience but cracks are evident. PEPE’s path remains tied to Bitcoin’s fortunes. Remittix , however, carves its own lane. Its practical approach could outlast fleeting meme coin trends. Remittix: Revolutionizing Cross-Border Payments While Bitcoin and PEPE suffer constraints, Remittix is quietly emerging as a contender. Priced below $0.0671, this altcoin tackles the $700 billion remittance market with flair. Its top Defi project enables instant crypto-to-fiat swaps, slashing costs and delays. Remittix offers real-world value that’s hard to ignore, the project’s presale has raked in $13 million, signaling robust investor trust. Analysts project a 100x surge after launch, fueled by its practical focus. Unlike many speculative coins, Remittix’s utility in streamlining global payments makes it a sleeper hit. Security is a cornerstone for Remittix. Its institutional-grade protections inspire confidence in a hack-prone industry. With a capped supply, demand could skyrocket. This stability draws eyes as Bitcoin and PEPE falter under market strain. Remittix’s appeal lies in its problem-solving prowess. By simplifying remittances, it bridges crypto and everyday needs seamlessly. A capped supply and top-tier security add to its allure. While Bitcoin and PEPE face volatility, Remittix charts a steadier ascent. If Bitcoin hits $65,000, PEPE’s drop could be stark. A 35% decline from $0.00001026 lands it near $0.0000067. Past downturns suggest even steeper falls are possible. The meme coin’s fate hinges on Bitcoin’s next steps. Investors eyeing alternatives might favor Remittix’s consistency. With a clear vision and tangible benefits, Remittix could outpace many peers in 2025.

However, a new trend is quietly emerging. The Shiba Inu and Dogecoin whales are now rotating their profits into a low cap crypto that’s making waves: RCO Finance (RCOF) . As Dogecoin aims for stability and Shiba Inu battles criticism over its utility, RCO Finance is capturing attention for its innovative DeFi platform and explosive growth potential. Whale Activity: Shiba Inu and Dogecoin Investors Position for the Next Move As Dogecoin’s price struggles to stabilize after a 6% drop, large investors, commonly called whales, are making moves that could signal the next phase of price action. Historically, Dogecoin whales have played a crucial role in price swings, often accumulating at key support levels before triggering major rallies. On-chain data suggests a slowdown in network activity, with new DOGE addresses dropping from 1.29 million in November to just over 30,000. However, some analysts see this as a potential accumulation phase, setting the stage for a bullish reversal. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu whales are taking a different approach. On-chain data shows a surge in large SHIB transactions, with over 101 transfers exceeding $100,000 in the past 24 hours, more than doubling from just a week ago. This increased activity aligns with predictions of a 450% price surge by 2025, as analysts highlight key support levels and ongoing token burns reducing SHIB’s circulating supply. The renewed whale interest suggests that while Dogecoin struggles with short-term volatility, Shiba Inu attracts more institutional-sized bets, potentially positioning itself as the stronger contender among meme coins in the months ahead. RCO Finance: The Low Cap Crypto Aiming to Surpass Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Identified as the next big thing by Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales, RCO Finance (RCOF) is carving out its path as a game-changing low cap altcoin that offers more than just speculative opportunities. Unlike other low cap cryptos, RCOF leverages AI to revolutionize decentralized finance, providing investors with a sophisticated, data-driven approach to navigating the volatile crypto landscape. At the heart of RCO Finance is its AI-powered Robo Advisor, a unique system designed to customize investment strategies based on live market insights, personal risk preferences, and long-term financial goals. Unlike traditional algorithmic trading models, this technology processes massive datasets from reputable sources like Reuters, eliminating emotional decision-making that often leads to poor trading outcomes. Continuously analyzing market conditions, the Robo Advisor identifies lucrative opportunities, similar to the rapid rise of Pi (PI) before its recent surge by over 150%, ensuring investors can capitalize on high-momentum assets. One of RCO Finance’s standout features is its dynamic risk management framework. During market turbulence, the Robo Advisor swiftly adjusts portfolios, reallocating assets into more promising opportunities to shield investors from potential losses. But it doesn’t stop at risk mitigation; it proactively scans the crypto ecosystem for high-growth projects, executing trades autonomously through RCOF’s automated market-making system. This ensures optimal transactions with maximum profitability, positioning RCO Finance as a next-generation DeFi platform. What truly sets RCOF apart is its vision of bridging the gap between decentralized and traditional finance. The platform grants users access to an extensive suite of over 120,000 financial instruments, spanning cryptos, stocks, bonds, and tokenized real-world assets such as real estate and commodities. Unlike many DeFi projects that require intrusive verification processes, RCOF offers a KYC-free ecosystem, allowing investors to maintain anonymity while engaging with the platform. To reinforce trust, SolidProof rigorously audits its smart contracts, ensuring robust protection for users and their assets. The momentum behind RCO Finance is already building, with its beta platform attracting over 10,000 active users. As anticipation grows for its alpha launch and upcoming feature expansions, early investors are positioning themselves to capitalize on the platform’s advanced market-monitoring capabilities. The RCO Finance (RCOF) Targets $6 Post Token Presale RCO Finance’s presale has reached its fifth stage, with RCOF tokens currently priced at $0.10. This stage presents a strategic opportunity for investors to acquire tokens before the price jumps to $0.13 in the next round. To encourage early participation, buyers who use the WELCOME40 code will receive an exclusive 40% bonus, significantly increasing their holdings before RCOF enters the open market. Market analysts project that once RCOF officially launches, its price could surge to $0.60, translating to an impressive 600% return on investment for early adopters. Even more bullish predictions suggest that by mid-2025, RCOF could experience a staggering $6 price appreciation, making it one of the most explosive opportunities in the low cap crypto market. Beyond its financial upside, RCOF holders can access numerous benefits, including reduced transaction fees, governance voting rights, and eligibility for quarterly dividends. Investors who stake their tokens can earn APYs of up to 86%, creating a sustainable source of passive income. With increasing support from Dogecoin and Shiba Inu whales, RCO Finance is emerging as a rare, high-potential investment opportunity.

Although Bitcoin and Ethereum still lead, emerging projects are transforming sectors with significant prospects. Here are the best cryptos to invest in long-term, featuring Web3Bay prominently. 1. Web3Bay (3BAY): Dominating E-Commerce Domain As online selling costs climb with platforms like eBay and Amazon upping fees, sellers lose much of their profit to listing fees, final value fees, and payment processing charges. Web3Bay uses blockchain to facilitate direct seller-to-buyer interactions without middlemen. UWeb3Bay, in contrast to conventional platforms that can charge up to 15% per transaction plus extra for processing, cuts out these charges. Its use of smart contracts helps secure transactions, lessening chargeback and dispute risks. This model appeals to sellers looking for more economical ways to operate. The market has shown enthusiasm. In its Stage 5 presale, Web3Bay has garnered $1.5 million, selling over 390 million 3BAY tokens at $0.00524 each. Early adopters believe in the platform’s capability to disrupt centralized markets and enhance sellers’ control over their profits. With rising adoption, Web3Bay is marked as one of the best cryptos to invest in long-term. 2. Binance Coin (BNB) BNB stands out as a solid investment choice tied closely to the functionality of the Binance ecosystem, the world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange by volume. This token is essential for reduced trading fees, payments, and various DeFi applications on Binance. The Binance network is ever-expanding, incorporating BNB in decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens, and blockchain gaming. Binance’s strategy of periodic token burns also contributes to a potentially reduced supply and an increase in value over time. Due to Binance’s significant role in the cryptocurrency arena, BNB is marked as one of the best cryptos to invest in long-term. 3. Cardano (ADA) Cardano stands out through its research-oriented approach to blockchain technology, prioritizing scalability, security, and decentralization. Cardano is distinctive for its development process, which is rigorously peer-reviewed, aiming for high stability and dependability. The platform is increasingly utilized for smart contracts, DeFi initiatives, and corporate collaborations. With continuous improvements, such as the Hydra scaling solution, Cardano is geared to handle large-scale transactions efficiently and cost-effectively. For investors focused on sustained growth, ADA is considered a strong candidate for long-term investment. 4. Solana (SOL) Known for its exceptionally fast and cost-efficient transaction capabilities, Solana supports thousands of transactions per second, making it attractive for developers of decentralized apps, DeFi, and NFT marketplaces. Despite previous issues with network congestion, ongoing enhancements to improve Solana’s infrastructure are underway, boosting its reliability and scalability. With growing institutional support and expanded applications, Solana is increasingly seen as a top choice for long-term investment. Leading Cryptos for Sustained Investment For those exploring the best cryptos to invest in long-term, Web3Bay emerges as a standout with its practical use in e-commerce. It addresses core seller issues by cutting out excessive fees, offering a strong alternative to traditional online market platforms. BNB, Cardano, and Solana also show great promise, supported by robust ecosystems and increasing adoption. Investors are encouraged to thoroughly research and assess the long-term viability of these options before investing. The post Considering Best Cryptos to Invest in Long-Term?

Both have felt recent market pressures Cardano struggles to regain critical resistance while XRP remains on edge, awaiting potential SEC developments. As these popular assets face uncertainty, some of their holders are turning to a new altcoin that promises to shake up the industry this year. Crypto enthusiasts are calling this token a direct challenger to big names, thanks to its growing utility and swift adoption. While ADA and XRP may still bounce back, investors who crave fresh opportunities are shifting attention elsewhere. Get on board before Remittix’s presale ends! Cardano: Searching for Bullish Momentum Cardano’s price has fought a losing battle against downward pressure, trading in a descending wedge and hovering near critical support around $0.60. A recent report highlights how ADA’s daily chart remains bearish with multiple failed attempts at breaking above $0.72 - $0.75. Unless ADA reclaims these levels, the token risks further drops if sellers push below $0.60. On shorter time frames, the 4-hour chart shows lower highs and lower lows, confirming a persistent sell trend. Cardano’s major moving averages also loom overhead, reinforcing a negative outlook until the coin secures a firmer grip above $0.75 - $0.80. Even the RSI, drifting into oversold territory, has only sparked minimal bounces. Unless Cardano can reverse this pattern, some ADA holders might look for alternatives that offer a better risk-to-reward ratio. ADA/USDT Source: Coinmarketcap XRP in the Spotlight as SEC Mulls Its Next Move XRP’s community is buzzing ahead of a closed-door SEC meeting scheduled for February 27. Rumors swirl that the agency could drop its appeal related to Ripple’s legal battle, potentially giving XRP a clear runway to reclaim higher prices above $2.1970. Yet the coin remains sensitive to external factors, including shifts in U.S. economic policy and broader market sentiment. Recent dips in the crypto market fueled by concerns over interest rates and tariffs knocked XRP down over 5% in just one session. While many expect a rally if the SEC changes course, there’s no guarantee. If legal uncertainty lingers, XRP might stay capped below its all-time high of $3.5505. Eager for steadier prospects, some holders have begun exploring a new altcoin that boasts immediate real-world use. XRP/USDT Source: Coinmarketcap Remittix: A Rising Star in the World of Payments While Cardano and XRP wrestle with market headwinds, an emerging token named Remittix has gained traction among investors. Priced at $0.0694, it has raised nearly $13 million in its presale, with over half a billion tokens sold so far. Unlike many speculative projects, Remittix tackles a straightforward issue: making crypto payments easy, quick, and cheap. Picture a consulting firm in Eastern Europe with clients in North America. Handling multiple currencies often involves slow bank transfers and unwieldy fees. With Remittix, clients can pay in various cryptos, and the firm instantly converts that crypto into local money. This system slashes transaction costs and eliminates currency guesswork, letting the business focus on its core services. Moreover, Remittix’s traction isn’t limited to small businesses. Enterprises dealing with cross-border supply chains can integrate the PayFi solution to settle invoices faster. Travel agencies, e-commerce sites, and digital marketplaces can reduce overhead linked to international payments, benefiting both customers and providers. Could This New Altcoin Truly Rival the Giants? Though calling any token a rival to top-tier cryptos might seem bold, Remittix’s rise has caught the eye of Cardano and XRP holders who feel stuck in the current slump. If it continues expanding partnerships and demonstrating the value of PayFi, the project could carve out a sizable niche. Still, no coin is immune to the crypto market’s ups and downs, so delivering on promises will be essential for lasting success. ADA hopes to break out of its bearish channel, while XRP awaits possible relief if the SEC abandons its appeal. Yet as they wrestle with uncertainties, Remittix provides a compelling alternative one built on everyday usefulness rather than speculation. If it can maintain its momentum, this altcoin might indeed push its way into the top ranks before the year is out. Remittix could be the next XRP!

Attention centers on Near Protocol , Render , and Sei , with investors keen to see how these coins will perform. This piece uncovers if these digital assets are poised for significant growth in the coming months. Discover insights into potential market leaders this season. NEAR Protocol: Recent Trends and Key Price Boundaries Price movements over the last month and six months show a steady pullback with a sharp decline of nearly 30% over the past month and about a 20% drop in the half-year view. Volatility is evident, with trading occurring between $2.31 and $4.25, indicating a market that has struggled to find a steady upward move even as weekly changes hovered near -6.58%. Price stagnation and significant declines highlight ongoing uncertainty over the medium term. Current price action sees resistance at $5.44 and strong support around $1.55. The market appears to be under selling pressure without a clear upward trend, as technical indicators remain weak. Traders might consider short-term moves between these levels, watching for a potential bounce near $1.55 or a decisive break towards $5.44. Crypto Altcoin: Past Trends and Current Levels Analysis Over the past month, the coin experienced a steep decline with a drop of 30.62%. The six-month change shows a 20.95% loss, reflecting sustained weakness. A one-week decrease of 8.14% highlights the recent sell-off and downward pressure. These numbers indicate prolonged bearish behavior, stressing the coin’s vulnerability despite occasional minor rebounds. At the current price range of $2.72 to $5.48, immediate support sits at $1.61 while resistance is marked at $7.13. Technical indicators such as the RSI at 35.15 signal clear bear control without a defined upward trend. Traders might consider buying opportunities near support and cautious exits near resistance, awaiting a potential shift in market sentiment. Sei Coin Faces Decline Amid Bearish Pressure Sei experienced a month drop of nearly 18% and a six-month decline of around 6%. A weekly decrease of close to 0.9% highlights the downward trend across various periods. This pattern indicates growing caution, as investors react to the recent negative momentum and overall soft performance indicators. Currently, Sei trades between $0.18 and $0.33, with resistance at $0.40 and strong support around $0.11. A secondary resistance level is found at $0.55. The indicators show an RSI of about 45 and minimal oscillator signals, revealing a market where bears are dominant and no clear trend is present. Traders should exercise caution while positioning near these support and resistance levels. Conclusion NEAR, RENDER, and SEI are set to show interesting movements this spring. NEAR may benefit from new updates and partnerships. RENDER could see growth driven by increasing adoption in creative industries. SEI might experience a boost from new integrations and ecosystem expansions. Each of these coins has unique strengths that may contribute to their rise. Investors will likely watch these developments closely as the season progresses. Disclaimer: This is a sponsored press release and is for informational purposes only.

The impressive rally came amid a broader market downturn, making BERA one of the best-performing assets of the week. Here are three key market indicators that drove Berachain’s price surge and what to expect in March 2025. Berachain (BERA) Emerges Standout Performer amid Crypto Market Crash Despite major sell-offs in global financial markets last week, Berachain’s price action stood out. On February 28, as Bitcoin plunged below $80,000 for the first time in four months, BERA surged 35% to weekly timeframe peak $9, in stark contrast to major assets like Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Solana (SOL), which all hit new 2025 lows last week. Macroeconomic fears, particularly new tariffs announced by Trump’s administration, spooked investors and triggered over $879 million in leveraged position liquidations on February 28 alone. Most altcoins followed Bitcoin’s lead, suffering double-digit declines, yet BERA defied this trend by gaining 35%, rising from $6 on February 25 to $9 by February 28. Why Is Berachain (BERA) Price Going Up? Several factors contributed to Berachain’s resilience and impressive price performance last week. TVL Surge from Yield-Seeking Investors Berachain’s ecosystem showed notable strength through its Total Value Locked (TVL), which remained above $3 billion, peaking at $3.32 billion, according to on-chain data. This stability was driven by its Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) mechanism, where users stake BERA to earn governance tokens (BGT) and provide liquidity, securing high annual rewards of up to 18%. Berachain TVL, March 1, 2025 | Source: DeFiLlama Unlike traditional staking models, PoL incentivizes active capital deployment, creating a flywheel effect that kept liquidity flowing even as other projects suffered capital outflows. Data from DeFiLlama indicated an additional $150 million in deposits within 24 hours, pushing TVL to $3.3 billion by March 1. Historically, a rising TVL correlates with upward price action, suggesting more potential upside for BERA. Recovery from Airdrop Backlash Berachain’s price trajectory post-launch also supports its bullish outlook. After its February 6, 2025, mainnet debut, BERA soared to $14.99 before crashing to $5.57 by February 11, as users reacted negatively to airdrop distribution. However, by February 19, it had rebounded to $6.60—a 31% recovery—driven by growing TVL and broader ecosystem traction. The network has since attracted 5.18 million active wallets and holds a stablecoin market cap of $930 million. This positive momentum likely carried into late February, positioning BERA as an outlier amid the market crash. X users noted Berachain’s “uncorrelated” nature, suggesting it acted as a safe-haven asset while Bitcoin and Ethereum collapsed. Strong Community Influence Berachain’s meme-driven, tight-knit community, originating from the Bong Bears NFT project, played a key role in its stability. Unlike other projects that rely heavily on institutional backing, Berachain’s grassroots movement has built an investor base that is less influenced by broader market panic. On social media, X users praised BERA’s resilience, calling it an asset that “copes extraordinarily well” during Bitcoin downturns. This unique identity, combined with strong fundamentals and DeFi integrations such as Infrared Finance, helped sustain investor confidence when fear gripped the wider crypto market. Can Berachain Extend Its Gains in March? In summary, BERA price rally last week was driven by its PoL-driven ecosystem maintaining TVL stability, a price rebound from a prior bottom, and strong community backing insulating it from panic selling. Additionally, its fundamentals shone amid market chaos, positioning it as a refuge for capital exiting riskier assets. With tariffs on Canada and Mexico set to begin on Monday, BERA could receive further capital inflows if the market starts the week on a bearish note. If macroeconomic conditions worsen and Bitcoin struggles to regain momentum, Berachain may continue attracting liquidity from investors seeking a more resilient crypto asset. Berachain Price Forecast: $12 breakout ahead if $8 support holds Berachain price forecast suggests a potential move toward $12 if the $8 support level holds firm, as the Bollinger Bands (BB) and Bull-Bear Power (BBP) signal continued strength. The price is currently testing the mid-BB level at $8.16, aligning with short-term support. If buyers maintain control above this zone, upside momentum could accelerate toward the upper BB at $8.93 before challenging $10 and, ultimately, the psychological $12 mark. Berachain Price Forecast Volume analysis reveals declining bearish pressure following a 9.31% retracement, while BBP remains positive at 0.869, reflecting lingering bullish control. A decisive move above $9 with strong volume confirmation could trigger a fresh rally, mirroring the prior 34.91% surge in just three days. The risk, however, lies in a breakdown below $8, which could expose Berachain to the 50-day moving average near $7.57. For now, Berachain’s bullish structure remains intact, with consolidation at key levels suggesting accumulation rather than weakness. A confirmed breakout above resistance could see momentum traders driving the next leg toward $12, provided market sentiment remains favorable.

Investors are keen to see if Bitcoin will regain its strength or if Ethereum will take the lead. Insights and trends in this article will reveal which cryptocurrencies are set for potential growth. Dive in to discover the frontrunners and what could drive their performance this month. Bitcoin Price Recap: Long-Term Recovery Amid Short-Term Weakness Bitcoin dropped nearly 18% in the past month, reflecting a short-term downturn amid caution. Over the last six months, the coin rebounded with a rise of almost 50%, indicating a strong long-term recovery despite recent pressure. The current price is between $74,054 and $98,804, with immediate support at $63,742 and resistance near $113,241. Bearish indicators are present, including a low RSI around 27.6 and negative momentum signals, making the trend uncertain. Traders might consider movements within these levels for strategic entries and exits, while anticipating clearer signs of reversal or sustained downward momentum. Ethereum Behavior: 28.56% Drop Over the Last Month, Bearish Trends Persist Ethereum price tumbled by about 28.56% over the last month while showing an 8.41% drop in the half-year span. The data reflects a period marked by bearish sentiment, with technical oscillators indicating ongoing decline and volatility. These past moves highlight the market's sensitivity to downside pressure and investor caution as the coin attempted to stabilize amid fluctuating momentum. Currently, Ethereum trades within a range of $1766 to $3021, with nearby support at $1294.59 and resistance at $3803.80. Bears dominate as clear downward pressure persists without a strong trend emerging. Traders might focus on short-term opportunities by monitoring price movements around these levels and positioning for potential breakouts or reversals. Conclusion March opens on a positive note for both BTC and ETH. There is potential for significant growth. BTC has shown resilience and could continue its upward trend. However, ETH also presents strong prospects, especially with upcoming technological updates. Both cryptocurrencies hold promise, making it hard to predict a clear frontrunner. Investors will need to watch market trends closely. The month could see strong performance from either or both coins.

BTFD Coin’s P2E Game Sends Bulls Charging Toward a 3650% ROI Potential Ever played a game that pays you in crypto? BTFD Coin is turning that into a reality. With its full P2E game launched on January 1, 2025, players can now earn $BTFD tokens just by playing. The game rewards users for competing, staking, and growing their in-game assets, making BTFD one of the few meme coins to integrate a functional gaming ecosystem. While most meme coins rely purely on hype, BTFD’s real utility is driving demand. Investors aren’t just jumping in for the laughs—they’re chasing real, long-term earning potential. At a current presale price of $0.00016, BTFD is projected to hit a listing price of $0.0006, with a moon target of $0.006—a massive 3650% potential ROI.

A $15,000 investment at $0.00016 bags 93.75 million tokens—worth $562,500 at the $0.006 moon price. The real question is: are you in, or are you missing the ride? Neiro Rides the Dogecoin Hype as a Next-Gen Meme Sensation If there’s one thing crypto has shown, the Doge brand is unbeatable. Enter Neiro, a fresh dog-themed meme coin gaining traction as a spiritual successor to Dogecoin. Its adoption by Kabosu’s owner—the real-life Shiba Inu behind Doge—has given Neiro instant credibility. Unlike Dogecoin, Neiro is taking a more community-driven approach, tapping into social media movements and viral content to attract investors. The project has no fixed roadmap, keeping it fluid and adaptable to trends. With memecoin mania rising again, Neiro is positioning itself as a serious player in the space. Neiro’s focus on meme culture and viral marketing means its price action is driven by its growing fanbase. While it hasn’t announced staking or gaming utilities yet, its organic adoption and connection to Doge history give it the kind of momentum that only meme coins with strong communities can maintain. Floki Inu’s Metaverse Expansion Strengthens Its Market Position Floki Inu has evolved from a meme coin into a full-blown Web3 powerhouse. Originally inspired by Elon Musk’s dog, Floki has transformed into a multi-chain utility token spanning DeFi, NFTs, and the Metaverse. Its biggest strength? Real-world utility. Unlike many meme projects, Floki Inu integrates seamlessly with decentralized applications (dApps) and has partnerships focused on education, gaming, and blockchain adoption. Recent expansions in the Metaverse and NFT gaming sector have positioned Floki Inu as a serious contender beyond just meme culture. With Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain compatibility, its accessibility is driving more investors toward its ecosystem. While Floki’s price action remains highly volatile, its long-term value proposition is undeniable. As Metaverse adoption increases, Floki Inu could see another wave of investor interest, making it a strong meme coin for those eyeing long-term potential. Conclusion Based on our research and market trends, the best new meme coins to buy this month are delivering high-stakes investment opportunities, and BTFD Coin is leading the charge. Its P2E game, staking rewards, and referral program create a perfect storm for rapid adoption and serious gains. Neiro is proving that Doge-inspired coins still have massive appeal, while Floki Inu continues to build its Metaverse and Web3 empire. With BTFD’s presale offering a 100% bonus, a projected $0.006 moon price, and a 3650% ROI potential, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

Bitcoin and Ethereum are not far behind, dropping 14.1% and 18.2% respectively. The declining sentiment as investors switch to alternatives is attributed by experts. One of the alternatives that investors are currently going for is Mutuum Finance (MUTM), a DeFi lending protocol selling below $0.02 presale. With $1.85 million and 3,550 holders stuck, project’s basic tokenomics and buy pressure structures are fueling hype for a 400% splash on launch; and potential rise to $7 in two months. XRP’s Drop As Market Jitters Grow XRP’s recent fall to $2.14 simply reflects broader jitters in crypto. Despite showing a buy signal on its TD Sequential indicator, the token is still near crucial support levels, as per analyst Ali Martinez. Crypto Bitlord, a popular trader, issues a warning that a breakdown of $2 will have it plunge to $0.20. CrediBULL Crypto has closed hedges and waits for potential long entries at $1.60. These uncertainties have been sharply contrasted with the momentum being generated around Mutuum Finance (MUTM) presale, in which investors are taking advantage of presale discounts before exchange listings. Mutuum Finance Presale Gains Momentum Mutuum Finance (MUTM) has gone live with its second presale, selling tokens at $0.015. Investors purchasing now can enjoy a 33.3% return when the price rises to $0.02 in the next phase. The project’s tokenomics ensure a 400% return on its $0.06 listing on an exchange, turning an overnight $1,000 investment into $4,000. Apart from this, according to expert estimates, it is expected to reach $7 as of mid-2025 on the strength of its buy-and-distribute model. The model funnels platform revenue towards MUTM token repurchase, which are rewarded back to stakers; sustaining demand while discouraging sell-offs. Tokenomics Fueling Hope The universe of Mutuum Finance is built around mtTokens, income-generating deposits made by users. Supplying ETH can accrete mtETH, value accumulation over time. Tokens enable liquidity and can be exchanged between DeFi networks. Loans are then used by borrowers through overcollateralizing assets, balancing out the system. A $7,000 ETH deposit could make someone eligible for a $5,000 USDT loan, with minimal risk of defaults. These systems put MUTM at a working level compared to value-varying memecoins. ROI Projections Grab Heads Long-term projections envision MUTM to be worth up to $7, returning an awe-inspiring 46,566% profit over its existing presale worth. The $500 investment from initial $0.015-phase buyers would come in at $233,333 in the event this target is hit. Minimal returns of some $1.50 are sure enough to produce life-altering dividends. FOMO created when the presale went as quickly as it did; Phase 1 moved in a snap; has seen only 20% of tokens go in Phase 2. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is redefining DeFi interaction through the merging of lending power with intentional token burning. As XRP investors protect themselves against further losses, MUTM presale offers a prudent entry into a project for long-term success. Time is short: the next price hike is on its way, and with it, the last chance to lock tokens below sub-$0.02 prices.

Despite market ups and downs, its resilience and utility keep investor interest alive, securing its place as a staple in crypto portfolios. 4. Shiba Inu (SHIB) Shiba Inu has made significant strides from its origins as a meme coin to a cryptocurrency with a burgeoning ecosystem. Initiatives like Shibarium are enhancing its functionality, with features such as staking, DeFi applications, and NFT integrations contributing to its long-term appeal. Community-driven initiatives such as token burning and supply reduction strategies are poised to boost its valuation over time. As it broadens its functionality, Shiba Inu offers a compelling choice for investors looking to broaden their crypto holdings.

The token’s value climbed 9%, reaching roughly $137. A large numbers of moneyed people, “whales” they are called, is gobbling up huge amounts of the Solana crypto. Technical signals suggest a strong momentum and growing open interest, keeping traders upbeat and glued on their celphone or PC screens.

The Relative Strength Index is approaching the overbought zone, as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence flashes a strong signal. There are technical signs that support the upward trend. After going up to 68, the RSI is now close to the zone where prices are too high. Some traders may think it will go down if it breaks above the 70 mark. The MACD indicates that the buying momentum remains robust. Traders frequently employ this to determine whether an asset has potential for further growth or if a reversal is imminent. Historical Whale Accumulations And SOL Price Increases Whale activity has historically been a significant factor in the price movement of Solana. SOL reached an all-time peak of $262 in November 2024 as a result of a $35 million purchase of the token by whales in a mere two days. Since late October 2024, a single whale has amassed over 257k SOL, to the tune of almost $54 million. This contributed to Solana’s market capitalization surpassing $100 billion, making it as one of the most prominent altcoins in the market. Related Reading: Dogecoin Sees 95% Drop In Network Activity—Trouble Ahead? The Road Ahead For SOL Solana’s short-term outlook is favorable, as whales continue to increase their holdings and open interest is increasing. Traders should keep a watchful eye out on indications of a potential correction as the RSI approaches overbought territory. Currently, the bullish momentum is unabated, and as past trends indicate, whale accumulation could be pointing to more upside movement. Solana’s ability to sustain this trend is contingent upon the duration of the purchasing pressure and the influx of new investors.

More on TRX Rally & Shiba Inu Future Outlook,https://thecoinrise.com/blockdag-hackerearth-take-web3-to-the-next-level-with-200-dapps-more-on-trx-rally-shiba-inu-future-outlook/,"Meme coins, established projects, and emerging blockchain networks are all in a heated battle for market attention. The Shiba Inu future outlook remains fragile as the coin fails to sustain momentum after hitting a key resistance. Meanwhile, the TRON (TRX) breakout potential keeps traders alert as TRX inches toward the $0.25 mark, with a possibility of reaching $0.30 if buying pressure remains steady. For those searching what is the next big crypto in Web3, BlockDAG (BDAG) is making strong moves. The network has raised over $199 million and secured a groundbreaking collaboration with HackerEarth, paving the way for over 200 new dApps through a pool of 10,000 developers. Shiba Inu Future Outlook: Can SHIB Regain Strength? Shiba Inu’s future outlook remains uncertain after its repeated failures to break past the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA). Historically, struggling at this level has often signaled a lack of confidence in a potential price recovery. Some market watchers suggest that unless SHIB clears the 26 EMA, it could risk sliding toward the $0.00001500 mark. While short-term signals present mixed indications, surpassing this critical level may allow Shiba Inu to aim for the 50 EMA resistance, a key threshold for bullish momentum. Tron’s Breakout Potential: Is TRX Gearing Up for a Rally? The TRON (TRX) breakout potential continues to capture attention as the coin trades near $0.2470. Analysts believe a solid move past $0.25 could pave the way for a rise to $0.30, provided bullish activity persists. The ability of TRX to hold above $0.22 remains a critical factor, as this level is considered essential for maintaining upward momentum. Additionally, a surge in stablecoin transactions on the Tron network signals improved liquidity, strengthening its breakout potential. If TRX decisively clears $0.2470, a sustained rally may follow, but some remain cautious while others bank on its ecosystem’s steady expansion to drive long-term gains. BlockDAG Set to Expand Web3 with HackerEarth Collaboration! BlockDAG is not just accumulating millions in presale—it is strategically positioning itself to dominate Web3. The latest partnership with HackerEarth is bringing together 10,000 skilled developers to roll out over 200 decentralized applications, aiming to solidify its presence as a premier Layer 1 blockchain with strong Web3 integrations. Currently priced at $0.0248 in presale batch 27, BlockDAG’s total presale revenue has already surpassed $199 million, with 18.6 billion BDAG coins sold since batch 1. Early participants have witnessed a remarkable 2,380% return, sparking discussions about BDAG’s long-term potential to deliver a 30,000x return. With a dedicated community of 170,000 holders continuously backing the project and expanding their holdings, BlockDAG’s influence continues to grow. A focus on scalability remains central to BlockDAG’s mission, ensuring lightning-fast transactions, seamless functionality, and a robust developer ecosystem. With over 200 new dApps set to launch on its network, BlockDAG is reinforcing its position as a top contender in Web3. When the question arises—what is the next big crypto?—BlockDAG presents a compelling answer. The saying goes, two heads are better than one, and with 10,000 developers on board, BDAG’s presale success could evolve into something far greater. The collaboration with HackerEarth and a strong community drive cement BlockDAG’s ambitions to stand out as a dominant Layer 1 blockchain in Web3. Next Big Crypto in Web3– Final Say! Shiba Inu’s future outlook remains in question as its price movement stays restricted below the 26 EMA, leaving many uncertain about its next move. At the same time, TRX’s breakout potential remains a topic of interest as traders monitor whether it can solidify gains past $0.25 and edge closer to $0.30. Meanwhile, BlockDAG continues making strides to become the next big crypto in Web3 . The HackerEarth partnership is a game-changer, bringing in 10,000 developers to launch 200+ new dApps. With over $199 million already raised, BlockDAG shows no signs of slowing down. Those looking for substantial returns with lower risk might find BDAG an attractive choice—especially with the presale still ongoing.

The ETH coin was trading at the extreme oversold level of the Murrey Mathe Lines at $2,220, down by almost 50% from its highest level in December last year. So, is it safe to buy the ETH dip? Ethereum price technical analysis The daily chart shows that the ETH coin price has crashed in the past two months. After peaking a $4,088 in November last year, the coin has moved to $2,220. It has crashed slightly below the key support at $2,182, the lowest swing on February 13. ETH price has crashed below the 50-day moving average, a sign that bears remain in control for now. It has also moved below the Ichimoku cloud indicator. There are signs that the coin has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, a popular bearish continuation sign. Oscillators have continued to move downwards. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped and moved to the oversold level, while the percentage price oscillator (PPO) has moved below the zero line. Therefore, the outlook for the Ethereum coin is bearish. Measuring the distance between the November highest point in November and the current level shows that it is about 50%. The same distance from the current level gives the next Ethereum price target at $1,125. This bearish Ethereum price target will become invalid if the coin rises above the strong, pivot, reverse level at $2,812. A move above that level will point to more gains, with the next point to watch being at $3,500. Ethereum price chart Why ETH price is crashing There are a few reasons why the ETH coin is crashing. First, there are signs that it is seeing weak demand from retail and instititutional demand. A good example of this is looking at the spot Ethereum ETF inflows and outflows data . It has had outflows in the past seven consecutive days, moving its total inflows since inception at $2.28 and the total Ethereum ETF assets at about $8 billion. Looking at Ethereum ETF inflows and outflows data is a good indicator of demand from the US. The same is happening in the staking market, where Ethereum ETF outflows have risen in the past few months. Ethereum has a staking market cap if $74 billion, down by almost 20% in the last seven days. Further data shows that Ethereum balances on exchanges have risen in the past few days. They rose to 15.38 million, up from 14.9 million last month. Rising balances is a sign that investors are selling their coins by moving them to exchanges. ETH balances on exchanges | Source: Coinglass Ethereum futures open interest has also plunged in the past few months. It slumped to $19 billion on Sunday, down from over $30 billion last year. Therefore, this performance is a sign that demand is waning. There are other reasons why the ETH price has crashed. For example, the drop is in sync with other cryptocurrencies have plunged in the past few months, with Bitcoin’s price falling from $109,200 to $85,000 today. Further, the ongoing Ethereum price plunge happened as the blockchain came under strong competition from the likes of Solana and BNB. Most notably, it is seeing strong competition from top layer-2 networks like Base, Arbitrum, and Optimism.

But things went off the rails when mid-discussion, Elon told Rogan to ask Grok—his AI chatbot—whether there was any gold left in Fort Knox. “Are you a f—— conspiracy theorist?” Grok shot back. Rogan laughed, Elon smirked, and the internet exploded with hilarious memes. The “Is the gold still there?” question has been floating around for a few weeks now, and Elon has even shown his openness to replacing the gold with Bitcoin, as Cryptopolitan reported last month. That was just one of the many bizarre, headline-grabbing moments from the interview, which covered everything from Elon’s role in Trump’s administration to unverified claims of rampant fraud in federal agencies. Elon, as usual, came armed with big statements, vague details, and no shortage of controversy. Elon dodges specifics on DOGE’s government cuts Elon’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been slashing its way through federal agencies, but exactly how it operates remains a mystery. Rogan pushed Elon for details, but he dodged specifics. “These are cuts that DOGE recommends to the department,” Elon said. “Usually these recommendations are followed, but these are recommendations that are then confirmed by the department.” The exact number of DOGE employees? Unclear. Elon said the team started with 40 to 100 people but didn’t specify how large it has grown. Some reports suggest the workforce has expanded significantly. Congress and federal officials have raised serious concerns about DOGE’s hiring process, which has brought in staff as young as 19. DOGE’s access to federal data has also triggered nearly a dozen lawsuits. Elon defended the agency’s vetting process, insisting that “anyone from DOGE has to go through the same vetting process that those federal employees went through.” He added , “If for example there’s a security clearance needed, the DOGE person has to have that same security clearance, so there’s no reduction in security.” Fraud claims, missing gold theories, and social security chaos Elon doubled down on claims that fraud is running rampant in Social Security. He told Rogan that DOGE found “20 million dead people marked as alive” in the system. Rogan asked if those people were actually receiving benefits. Elon’s response? “Yes.” But when pressed for specifics—like what percentage of those 20 million were actually getting money—Elon didn’t have an answer. Social Security’s acting commissioner, Lee Dudek, later pushed back on Elon’s claims. “The reported data are people in our records with a Social Security number who do not have a date of death associated with their record. These individuals are not necessarily receiving benefits,” Dudek said . Elon then pivoted to FEMA, claiming the agency spent $59 million on migrant housing. A few days earlier, Elon had posted the same claim on X, crediting DOGE with uncovering the spending. But the funding had already been made public and approved by Congress. Despite this, four FEMA officials were fired the day after Elon’s post. The officials were reportedly tied to hotel funding for migrants in New York City. Then came the Fort Knox moment. Elon talks Trump, secret tech, and the Nazi controversy Though the administration has said that Elon is a White House advisor, President Donald Trump has said that Elon is leading the way with DOGE’s efforts to slash the federal government. At Trump’s first Cabinet meeting Wednesday, Elon had an outsized role, with Trump giving him the floor for a large chunk of it. “This is a revolutionary Cabinet and maybe the most revolutionary Cabinet since the first revolution,” Elon said. The conversation then shifted to secret technology. Elon, who has long pushed for transparency in space tech, was asked whether private contractors were hiding advanced propulsion technology. “I don’t think they’re hiding it from me,” Elon said, implying he’d know if they were. He didn’t expand on the subject, leaving plenty of room for speculation. One of the more heated moments came when Rogan brought up a recent controversy. During Trump’s inauguration celebration, Elon made a gesture that some compared to a Nazi salute. The legacy media latched onto the moment, especially after Elon followed it up by posting Nazi-related puns on X. Elon denied any wrongdoing. “It was obviously meant in the most positive spirit possible,” Elon told Rogan. “Now I can never point at things diagonally.” He went further, accusing the media of deliberately twisting the story. “It’s deliberate propaganda,” Elon said. “They know it was obviously not meant in a negative way. I’d literally said, ‘my heart goes out to you.’ It was very positive. My entire speech was very positive.” Despite the backlash, Elon refused to back down. The controversy has only added to the growing political storm surrounding his government role. Cryptopolitan Academy: Tired of market swings? Learn how DeFi can help you build steady passive income.

As investors and enthusiasts navigate this unpredictable landscape, all eyes are on the upcoming US job data release. The community remains anxious as a weaker job data could result in increased volatility. Notably, initial jobless claims surged to their highest level of the year last week, potentially signaling a slowdown in the labor market. With President Donald Trump reducing the government workforce, a weaker jobs report is expected. Let’s uncover how the upcoming jobs report could influence the crypto market. Is a Weaker US Jobs Data Ahead? According to a Labor Department report on Thursday, new jobless claims jumped to 242,000 for the week ending February 22, surpassing expectations and reaching the highest level of 2023. The latest data hints at a slowdown in the labor market, potentially leading to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cuts. Notably, jobless claims for the week ended February 22 jumped by 22,000 to 242,000, exceeding analysts’ forecasts of 225,000. Washington, D.C. saw a significant surge in new unemployment claims, totaling 2,047, which marks a 26% increase from the previous week. Unemployment filings in Massachusetts jumped by 3,731 to 9,179, while Rhode Island saw claims skyrocket by more than 200% to 2,964. All these inputs suggest that the upcoming US jobs data will report a weaker employment data, potentially leading to a significant Fed decision and a crypto market volatility. How Will the US Jobs Data Impact Federal Reserve’s Interest Rate Decision? Interestingly, the US employment data is a critical factor that significantly influences the Federal Reserve’s decision on interest rates. If the upcoming US jobs data reveals an increased unemployment rate, there is a higher possibility for the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates. On the other hand, a strong job market can fuel inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve to take action to curb it, which may delay interest rate cuts. Additionally, the significant decline in the US consumer confidence in February has sparked anticipations of Fed’s interest rate cuts in June and September. The Conference Board survey revealed that the consumer confidence drop marked the sharpest in 3.5 years largely driven by growing concerns over President Donald Trump’s economic policies. Further fueling speculations, Raphael Bostic, the President of the Atlanta Federal Reserve, shared his insights on the Fed’s possible moves. He stated that the Fed will reduce interest rates twice this year while some factors could affect the decision. He posited, “While that’s my baseline expectation, there’s a lot that is going to happen that could influence that really in both directions.” Will the Crypto Market See Another Turmoil? Over the past few weeks, the crypto market has been experiencing vast changes, with prices of top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum fluctuating rapidly . With anticipations of slower US jobs data, the market is expected to have a resurgence despite volatility. As President Donald Trump is reducing the government workforce through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, there is a higher chance for an increased unemployment rate. This could push the Fed to further reduce interest rates, paving the way for a stronger crypto market.

During his first term, he made sure everyone knew when the S&P 500 hit new highs. But things have changed. Since returning to the White House in January, the president has been unusually quiet about Wall Street, even when the market briefly hit a record on February 19. Now? The S&P 500 has fallen almost every day, sinking below the level it was at when he took office in January. Other indexes tied to the real economy are sliding, and Bitcoin, which once rode the Trump wave, has dropped 20% in a month. Markets react as investor confidence tumbles Stocks are moving differently than they did in Trump’s first term. In 2017, the economy was still recovering from an energy crisis, and interest rates were four percentage points lower than they are now. The Federal Reserve was trying to pump life into the markets, and when Trump unleashed tax cuts, stocks took off. The S&P 500 saw two consecutive years of more than 20% growth in 2023 and 2024—the first time that had happened since 1996. But markets can’t keep climbing forever. Now, valuations are sky-high, and the stocks that fueled the last rally aren’t pulling their weight. The Magnificent Seven, the elite group of AI-driven tech stocks that have dominated markets, make up about a third of the S&P 500’s total value. But they’re no longer pushing things upward. Nvidia, the AI chip powerhouse, has dropped nearly 10% since Trump’s inauguration. Only two out of 11 sectors in the S&P 500 are in the red this year, and tech is one of them. Trump’s new tariffs shake global markets Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities, summed up the mood among traders. “The tariff rhetoric has become daily and extreme, sentiment is awful and trading is on edge.” On Thursday, Trump reignited trade war fears by announcing a new 10% tariff on Chinese imports, set to take effect on March 4, and also confirmed plans for tariffs on Canada and Mexico, keeping investors on edge about future trade disputes. The Nasdaq, which is heavy with tech stocks, has already lost 4% this month. European markets felt the pressure too. Germany’s DAX and the Stoxx Europe 600 opened lower on the news, while Japan’s Nikkei 225 dropped 2.9%, South Korea’s Kospi fell 3.4%, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slid 3.3%. Even China’s CSI 300 benchmark lost 2%. Almost 90 percent of survey respondents said that stocks are overvalued. The CBOE Skew Index, which measures how much investors are girding for a sell-off by tracking trades in options markets that would buffer against a sudden plunge in the value of the S&P 500, reached its highest level ever on February 18, the day before that index hit its record high. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta revised its first-quarter GDP forecast, now expecting the U.S. economy to shrink by 1.5%. That’s a sharp turnaround from its previous forecast of 2.3% growth just two weeks ago. Trump’s economic policies are already having a measurable impact, and traders are scrambling to adjust. Late rally gives temporary relief, but concerns are still there Friday brought some relief to the markets. The S&P 500 closed 1.6% higher, cutting its February decline to 1.4%. The Nasdaq also rose 1.6%. Nvidia rebounded 4% after an 8.4% drop on Thursday, though its recent losses have raised questions about the strength of the AI boom. European markets recovered as well. Germany’s DAX and the Stoxx Europe 600 ended the day flat, regaining earlier losses. Then on Friday, during a tense Oval meeting, Trump accused Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of “gambling with World War Three,” then chastised him and kicked him out of the White House, canceling their economic partnership and the joint press conference they had planned later in the day. Later on Truth Social, Trump said , “We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today. Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation under such fire and pressure. It’s amazing what comes out through emotion, and I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved, because he feels our involvement gives him a big advantage in negotiations. I don’t want advantage, I want PEACE. He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. He can come back when he is ready for Peace.” Despite everything, Trump told supporters in Miami on February 19, “I think the stock market’s going to be great.” But he also exaggerated the numbers, claiming the Dow had jumped 10% since his election when the actual increase was less than 7%. The S&P 500 surged by 6.25% between election night (November 5) and February 19, but now it’s up by only 3% since November 5.

According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, GDP is on track to contract by 1.5% in the first quarter, a drop from the 2.3% growth estimate made just five weeks ago. The GDPNow tracker , which updates in real-time based on incoming data, used to point to 3.9% growth, but new numbers from the Commerce Department sent it plunging. An economic report released on Friday morning showed that personal spending fell 0.2% in January, missing the Dow Jones estimate of a 0.1% increase. After adjusting for inflation, it was even worse—a 0.5% drop, enough to wipe an entire percentage point off GDP expectations. The US economy relies heavily on consumer spending, as it makes up for more than two-thirds of GDP. A 0.2% decline might seem small, but it’s the largest monthly drop in four years. The hit came from weaker-than-expected retail sales, as Americans pulled back on spending due to high inflation, policy uncertainty, and market volatility. “This is sobering notwithstanding the inherent volatility of the very high frequency ‘nowcast’ maintained by the Atlanta Fed,” Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz and president of Queens’ College Cambridge, said in a post on social media site X. At the same time, exports took a major hit, dragging down GDP even further. The Commerce Department reported that net exports’ contribution to GDP collapsed from -0.41 percentage points to -3.7. The reason? A record $153.3 billion trade deficit in January. Economists say this could be the result of businesses stockpiling imports ahead of Trump’s potential tariffs, making the trade gap even worse. Markets react as bond yields invert and stocks swing Wall Street isn’t ignoring the warning signs. The bond market is flashing its most reliable recession indicator: an inverted yield curve. The 3-month Treasury yield has climbed above the 10-year note, a pattern that has historically signaled an economic downturn within 12 to 18 months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has been on a rollercoaster. The index is still up 2% for the year, but it’s been wildly volatile, reacting to every new piece of economic data. The S&P 500, which surged by 6% between Election Day and February 19, has tumbled by 3.1% as of press time, according to data from Google Finance. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is coming under pressure as traders in the fed funds futures market are now pricing in an 80% chance of a rate cut in June, with expectations of three total cuts by the end of 2025. If Fed Chair Jerome Powell moves too fast with rate cuts, inflation could flare up again. If he waits too long, the slowdown could spiral into a full-blown recession. Economists at Piper Sandler had previously expected 2% growth, but now they’re predicting a 2% contraction. Some economists aren’t convinced the slowdown will last. As recently as early January, a Wall Street Journal survey of economists projected 2.2% GDP growth in the first quarter. Many of those forecasts haven’t changed despite the Atlanta Fed’s gloomy outlook. Trump’s policies add uncertainty to the economic outlook The economic slowdown isn’t happening in a vacuum. Trump’s return to the White House has shaken up policy expectations, and businesses aren’t sure what’s coming next. His tariff threats have already pushed inflation expectations higher, something that could complicate the Fed’s response. “With inflation just recently at a 40-year high, now is not the time to let down our guard,” said Jeff Schmid, president of the Kansas City Fed. The central bank has spent the last two years fighting inflation, and if expectations start rising again, it could force Powell to hold off on rate cuts even as the economy weakens. The uncertainty is showing up in business sentiment data. The Conference Board found that CEO confidence hit a three-year high in early February. But not everyone is so optimistic—S&P Global’s February survey of purchasing managers showed a sharp drop in optimism for the coming year. Meanwhile, the labor market is showing early signs of trouble. Initial unemployment claims just hit their highest level since early October. The unemployment rate, which dropped to 4% in January, is still historically low, but layoffs are starting to tick up.

Investors are eager to know which of these digital assets might see their value multiply fourfold first. The article explores the potential of each one, analyzing their strengths and current momentum to uncover which might lead the next big surge. XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The buzz around XYZVerse is real. As the first-ever all-sports meme token, it’s attracting both sports fans and crypto enthusiasts, creating a unique crossover that’s gaining serious traction. With a strong presale and an engaged community, some investors are already eyeing major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike most meme coins that ride trends without much substance, XYZVerse is setting a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with the viral nature of meme culture. And it’s working. The presale is moving fast, with early buyers locking in tokens at a fraction of what some believe could be its future value. Right now, XYZVerse is still in its presale phase, but demand is high. The price has already climbed from $0.0001 in Stage 1 to $0.002 by Stage 10, with over 90% of the $7.5 million milestone already raised. Investors who got in early have secured a steep discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those numbers have people paying attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap where the community has shown a strongly bullish mood on this coin, with 95% voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. XYZ was further noticed by reputable crypto influencers. DanjoCapitalMaster , who has close to 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” Of course, in crypto, nothing is guaranteed, but the excitement is undeniable. Beyond just hype, XYZVerse has a structured tokenomics model aimed at long-term sustainability. A share of 15% is allocated to liquidity to create a solid market foundation.To reward its community via airdrops and bonuses, the team has put aside 10% of the total supply. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is designated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One thing setting XYZVerse apart is how it engages its community. The team recently launched the Ambassador Program, giving users the chance to earn free tokens by supporting the project. And that’s just the start—there are already talks with major sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the ingredients of a project with serious potential. While the crypto market is always unpredictable, many investors see this as an opportunity to get in early on something big. The presale won’t last forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Cardano’s ADA: A Sustainable Frontier in Cryptocurrency Cardano’s ADA is turning heads in the cryptocurrency world. As a flexible and scalable blockchain platform designed for smart contracts, Cardano enables the creation of decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, rivals Ethereum’s ETH, allowing users to store value, make payments, and participate in staking on the network. What sets Cardano apart is its environmentally friendly approach. It uses the Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, which is energy-efficient compared to the energy-intensive proof-of-work models used by some other blockchains. The blockchain’s innovative design divides it into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This structure enhances its ability to process transactions, potentially reaching up to a million per second. Since the introduction of native tokens in March 2021, Cardano has offered secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts, setting new standards for efficiency and scalability. In the current market cycle, ADA’s combination of advanced technology and sustainability makes it an intriguing option. As market trends lean towards eco-friendly and scalable solutions, Cardano’s unique features position it as a strong contender in the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. XRP: Unlocking Borderless Payments in the Digital Age XRP is a digital currency designed to make money transfers fast and easy. Supported by the XRP Ledger, it aims to be quick, low-cost, and accessible to everyone. Operating without a central authority, XRP ensures transactions are secure and can’t be reversed or tampered with. You don’t even need a bank account to use it. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP launched with 100 billion units, gifting 80 billion to Ripple to boost network development. Ripple uses XRP to enhance liquidity and support the ecosystem, releasing the currency in a controlled way through escrow. So, what makes XRP stand out in today’s market? Its technology focuses on seamless payment transfers across different currencies, which is a big plus in our global economy. Compared to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which can be slow and expensive to transfer, XRP offers speed and low fees. Ripple’s efforts to manage the supply might also help stabilize its value. As the cryptocurrency market evolves, coins with real-world applications like XRP are gaining attention. While the market can be unpredictable, XRP’s potential to revolutionize global payments makes it an interesting option to watch. Conclusion Though ADA and XRP are strong, XYZVerse’s unique sports-meme blend and ambitious growth goals make it a standout for significant gains.

For consumers, Web3Bay offers the chance to earn crypto on daily transactions. Sellers avoid high fees and accrue tokens with potential value appreciation. As blockchain technology becomes more widespread, Web3Bay’s earn-while-you-shop model could become a viable alternative to traditional online marketplaces. Investors looking for the upcoming crypto projects with 1000x potential might want to consider getting into Web3Bay’s presale early before broader market adoption escalates prices. 2. Dawgz AI (DAGZ): Redefining Meme Coins with AI Dawgz AI steps up as a meme coin that integrates artificial intelligence to facilitate automated trading strategies and rewarding staking systems.

It is not simply that speculation exists. In essence, it is that very same speculation that is the market itself. The entire structure of the financial ecosystem, from early-stage presales to all-time highs and eventual retractions, operates within a probability field of perceived inevitability. The difference between success and failure is often just how well a project understands its own narrative. FloppyPepe (FPPE): A Dip-Resistant Meme Coin? The vast majority of meme coins are fragile constructs. They exist in states of boom and bust, reliant on external hype cycles rather than intrinsic momentum. At their best rise rapidly, and at their worst they collapse even faster. It’s only the rarest projects that emerge from the chaos with actual staying power. FloppyPepe (FPPE) may be different. Unlike standard meme coins, which require external participants to generate engagement, FloppyPepe operates under an entirely different model: AI-driven content perpetuation. It does not wait for the market to decide whether it is relevant; it is built to create its own relevance. Case in point: the Meme-o-Matic AI tool. This makes sure that FloppyPepe’s memetic presence is constant, self-sustaining, and built for virality. If traditional meme coins depend on market irrationality, FloppyPepe exploits it. It does not merely exist within speculative cycles; it feeds them, to its benefit. Where the Market Stands: A Game of Asymmetry The broader meme coin market has entered a paradoxical state; simultaneously saturated yet desperate for the next thing. The liquidity influx into AI-powered assets has already begun, yet the most asymmetric bets remain untouched. PEPE → Still has life in it, but fully priced in. DOGE → Institutionalized, no longer a speculative trade. BONK → A case study in volatility, but without structural longevity and reliant on SOL. FloppyPepe → AI-powered, self-generating, and only just beginning its cycle. The presence of burn mechanics and redistribution models in FloppyPepe’s tokenomics is not merely a structural advantage. It is most importantly a hedge against collapse. Whereas DOGE relied on its cultural inertia to make its way to its $35 billion market cap, and PEPE depended on pre-existing meme capital, FloppyPepe exists as a self-contained system. It is antifragile, and it thrives in volatility. $900K Raised and The Asymmetry of Early-Stage Entry It is not simply that FloppyPepe’s presale has raised over $900,000. Though this is an impressive achievement in its own right. it is more that it has done so in a market where most speculative assets are failing to capture sustained capital inflows. This is indicated by the simple fact that all of the top 6 meme coins in the market have been in the red over the past 7 days. For those considering entry, the asymmetry of the FPPE trade is even clearer: Early-stage entry price → Lower risk, exponential upside. AI-powered content generation → Sustained engagement, non-reliant on external trends. Burn mechanism → Engineered scarcity increasing long-term valuation potential. Welcome40 code bonus → A 40% additional token allocation for those entering now. What Happens Next? Understanding the Meme Coin Volatility Model The expected trajectory of FloppyPepe follows a model that is not entirely different from past meme coin explosions. That is, except for one key factor: AI. Phase One : Presale Asymmetry → Early entrants accumulate tokens before liquidity influxes distort price efficiency. Phase Two : Market Awareness → Meme-o-Matic floods social feeds with auto-generated, virality-ready content. Phase Three : Liquidity Migration → As market participants recognize the AI factor, capital moves from static meme coins to AI-powered alternatives. Phase Four : Exponential Growth or Consolidation → FloppyPepe’s core advantage is its ability to sustain engagement beyond speculative waves. Do Meme Coins Even Need a Use Case? The market has already proven that utility is not necessarily a requirement for exponential growth—but narrative control is. FloppyPepe does not merely offer a stronger narrative than its competitors. It manufactures its own story in real time. It is not a meme coin in the traditional sense, it is a financial abstraction of virality itself. In an industry where value is determined by speculative consensus, the only rationalization that remains is: if AI can create an endless feedback loop of attention, is there any limit to what FloppyPepe can achieve?

THE NEXT 1000X CRYPTO – CLICK HERE TO JOIN NOW! OFFICIALMAGACOIN: A New Entrant with Explosive Potential Launched recently, OFFICIALMAGACOIN has made a remarkable entrance by raising over $3.8 million within minutes during its presale phase. This rapid capital influx underscores strong investor confidence and suggests a robust demand for the token. The project’s exclusivity, being available solely through its official platform, enhances its scarcity and appeal among early adopters. XRP: Established Yet Facing Challenges XRP has long been a staple in the crypto market, primarily due to its focus on facilitating cross-border payments. However, ongoing legal challenges and regulatory uncertainties have somewhat dampened its growth prospects. While XRP maintains a solid user base, its potential for a 1000x increase appears constrained under current conditions. Solana (SOL): Technological Strengths with Reliability Concerns Solana is celebrated for its high-speed transactions and scalability, attracting numerous developers and projects to its ecosystem. Despite these technological advantages, Solana has experienced network outages, raising concerns about its reliability. While it holds promise, these issues may impact its ability to sustain the momentum required for a 1000x surge.

This projection, originating from a cryptocurrency research group, raises questions about its feasibility and the assumptions underpinning such a valuation. The Basis of the $18,000 Prediction A research paper published by a crypto-focused investment firm outlined multiple valuation models for XRP, with one scenario suggesting a price of $18,036 per token. This valuation was based on a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model, assuming that Ripple’s technology would be integrated into a significant portion of global transactions over the next decade. Key assumptions in the model included: Global Transaction Volume : Estimated at $104 trillion Economic Growth Rate (2023-2032) : Projected at 2% Applied Discount Rate : Set at 10% Total Transaction Present Value : Calculated at $915 trillion XRP Circulating Supply : Approximately 50.7 billion tokens Projected Price per XRP : $18,036 This optimistic scenario relies on Ripple’s technology being widely adopted across financial systems, effectively replacing traditional payment networks. Adoption and Institutional Interest Despite these projections, major financial institutions have yet to confirm widespread adoption of XRP for cross-border transactions. While RippleNet has been associated with several banking institutions, full-scale integration remains limited. Some banks have expressed interest in exploring blockchain-based payment solutions, but no large-scale implementation of XRP for settlements has been officially documented. Market Sentiment and Community Reaction The forecast of XRP reaching five-figure valuations has been met with mixed reactions. Some members of the XRP community remain highly optimistic about its future, while skeptics argue that such projections are unrealistic given current adoption levels and regulatory challenges. Conclusion The possibility of XRP reaching $18,000 per token depends on several optimistic assumptions, including widespread global adoption and a major shift in financial infrastructure. While XRP continues to be a key player in blockchain-based payments, its future valuation remains speculative, and investors should consider multiple factors before making investment decisions.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,XRP|RESEARCH|MARKET|TECHNOLOGY|TRADING,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-02 03:26:41

The phishing text appeared within Binance’s official message thread, making it nearly indistinguishable from legitimate communications. User Reports Binance Phishing Incident One user, Joe Zhou, shared his experience in a LinkedIn post, stating, “I want to report a recent scam related to the Bybit incident and Binance.” Zhou described receiving an SMS from the same Binance number where he typically received verification codes. The message claimed that his account was being accessed from North Korea. Already dealing with the aftermath of the recent Bybit incident, he panicked and called the number provided. The call was answered by someone who instructed him to set up a SafePal wallet, saying it was a Binance partner and referencing an article to support the claim. The individual repeatedly asked about the assets in his account and insisted that he transfer all of them for an investigation. Following the instructions, Zhou set up the wallet and began withdrawing funds from Binance. However, he soon became suspicious and contacted an acquaintance from the exchange, who confirmed it was a scam. The user then attempted to recover his funds by transferring them out of the wallet, but the scammer began competing with him to move the assets. Eventually, Zhou ran out of gas fees. As he attempted to swap ETH for fees, his balance was cleared. The attack occurred just days after Bybit suffered an exploit that resulted in the loss of nearly $1.5 billion worth of ETH from its cold wallet. Blockchain analysts and the FBI have identified the North Korean hacking syndicate Lazarus Group as the likely perpetrator. Sophisticated Spoofing Attack SlowMist’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) analyzed the breach, stating that it involved a sophisticated method. He disclosed that his friend had also received identical phishing text and shared a screenshot that showed the precise forgery used. According to him, one possibility was that fraudsters faked official text sources through spoofing, using technical methods to manipulate the sender’s number and embed text messages into official conversations. Alternatively, they may have exploited SMS gateway vulnerabilities or conducted supply chain attacks by breaching the gateway, targeting operators or third-party providers, or collaborating with SMS providers to fake official replies, making detection difficult. Phishing remains a major threat to crypto users. Blockchain security firm Scam Sniffer reported that such scams drained $10.25 million from 9,220 victims in January. Although this marked a 56% decline from December’s $23.58 million losses, the report noted that scammers are evolving and implementing more intricate methods.

XRP and ADA are being watched closely as top contenders, along with a fresh altcoin with explosive potential.

XYZVerse Sets a New Trend, Could This be the Next 50X Meme Coin? The excitement for XYZVerse is palpable. Being the first meme token dedicated to all sports, it has both sports and crypto fans on board, and the crossover is becoming a force to be reckoned with. Already, with strong presale momentum and an active community, many investors are looking at major potential gains. More Than Just a Meme Coin Unlike the majority of meme coins, which surf trends without support, XYZVerse is creating a new trend. It is blending the high-energy world of sports with meme culture, and it’s working. The presale is rapidly advancing as early investors secure tokens for a fraction of their potential future value.

Early investors have now locked in a considerable discount, and with a final presale target price of $0.1, those figures have been attracting attention. Still Time to Get in Before the Presale Ends Bullish Mood on $XYZ XYZVerse is already featured on CoinMarketCap , where users have expressed a significantly bullish stance regarding this coin, with 95% of voters anticipating $XYZ to grow. Reputable crypto influencers have also taken notice of XYZ. DanjoCapitalMaster , with nearly 800,000 followers, recently expressed his support for the project, calling XYZVerse a “moonshot opportunity.” While nothing is guaranteed in crypto, the excitement is certainly real. But while there is a lot of hype, XYZVerse has a clear and structured tokenomics model that guarantees long-term sustainability. 15% of its total supply is reserved for liquidity to establish strong, market-based support. The team holds 10% of the total supply aside for community rewards such as airdrops and bonuses. Moreover, a big chunk of 17.13% is allocated for deflationary burns, which could reduce supply and drive demand for $XYZ over time. A Community-Driven Project With Big Plans One aspect that makes XYZVerse stand out is its approach to community involvement. Recently, the team also launched the Ambassador Program, where users can earn free tokens just by supporting the project. And that’s merely the beginning—negotiations are already underway with notable sports celebrities to help boost visibility. By bringing together traditional sports fans and the fast-moving crypto space, XYZVerse is building something different—something with entertainment value and real engagement. Could XYZVerse Be the Next Big Meme Coin? With a fast-growing presale, a strong community, and an ambitious roadmap, XYZVerse has the makings of a project with legitimate potential. Although the crypto market is never consistent, for many investors, this is an opportunity to jump on something big early on. The presale is not forever—so if you’re interested, now might be the time to take a closer look. Join XYZVerse, the Next Moonshot Opportunity Cardano’s ADA: A Sustainable Frontier in Cryptocurrency Cardano’s ADA is causing a stir in the cryptocurrency space. Cardano is a flexible and scalable blockchain platform, which is designed for smart contracts, allowing for decentralized finance apps, crypto tokens, and games. Its native token, ADA, performs similar functions to the ETH token on Ethereum, allowing holders to store value, make payments, and stake on the network. What differentiates Cardano from others is its eco-friendly method. It runs on the energy-efficient Ouroboros proof-of-stake mechanism, unlike energy-intensive proof-of-work models deployed by some other blockchains. Cardano’s novel architecture separates the blockchain into two layers: the Cardano Settlement Layer for transactions and the Cardano Computing Layer for smart contracts. This allows it to handle transactions with a potential throughput of over a million per second. Since native tokens were introduced in March 2021, Cardano has maintained pristine, secure, low-fee interactions with smart contracts—thus setting a new bar for performance and scalability. As the market continues in its current cycle, ADA’s blend of innovation and sustainability presents an enticing possibility. XRP: Unlocking Borderless Payments in the Digital Age XRP is a digital currency built for quick, affordable money transfers. Powered by the XRP Ledger, it runs without a central authority, providing secure and tamper-proof transactions. You can use it without a bank account. Created by Jed McCaleb, Arthur Britto, and David Schwartz, XRP launched with 100 billion units, with 80 billion given to Ripple to grow the network. Ripple releases XRP gradually through escrow to support liquidity and the ecosystem. What sets XRP apart is its focus on seamless currency transfers, making it ideal for global payments. Unlike Bitcoin, which can be slow and costly, XRP is fast and low-cost. Ripple’s controlled supply strategy may help stabilize its value. As the crypto market grows, practical solutions like XRP are getting noticed. Despite market volatility, XRP’s potential to transform global payments makes it worth watching. Conclusion While ADA and XRP have strong potential, XYZ’s sports-themed memecoin aims for huge returns by uniting sports fans and offering early adopters the chance to see significant profits.

Among these, blockchain technology has emerged as one of the most disruptive forces in the industry. From DeFi (decentralized finance) to digital currencies like Bitcoin , blockchain is reshaping how we perceive and interact with money, investments and financial systems. Understanding blockchain – A technological marvel At its core, blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers in a secure and transparent manner. Unlike traditional systems, where intermediaries like banks play a key role in processing and verifying transactions, blockchain allows peer-to-peer exchanges, ensuring that transactions are faster, more secure, and less costly. The technology offers multiple benefits, including greater transparency, reduced fraud and enhanced security. Its decentralized nature means that it is not controlled by any single authority, giving individuals more control over their financial activities. As a result, blockchain is increasingly seen as a viable alternative to traditional banking systems and financial institutions. Blockchain and the rise of DeFi DeFi refers to a new financial ecosystem that operates without the need for traditional intermediaries like banks, brokers and payment processors. DeFi platforms leverage blockchain technology to create financial products and services such as lending, borrowing and trading, all while ensuring users maintain control over their assets. DeFi is making it possible for anyone with an internet connection to access financial services – even in regions where traditional banking systems are either inadequate or inaccessible. With the rise of DeFi, the financial sector is becoming more inclusive, offering opportunities to individuals who have been historically excluded from the global financial system. Blockchain in traditional finance – A perfect partnership Despite the rapid rise of blockchain and DeFi, traditional financial institutions are not ignoring these advancements. In fact, many banks and financial organizations are embracing blockchain technology to enhance their own operations. For example, blockchain can be used to streamline the process of cross-border payments, reducing transaction times and costs. By removing intermediaries, blockchain enables instant and secure international money transfers, making global trade more efficient. Furthermore, blockchain’s ability to provide an immutable record of transactions ensures that financial institutions can reduce fraud and improve regulatory compliance. Another area where blockchain is making strides is in the field of securities trading. By tokenizing traditional assets like stocks, bonds and real estate, blockchain allows for more efficient and transparent trading. Tokenized assets can be traded on blockchain-based platforms, allowing for fractional ownership, faster settlement times and greater liquidity. The future of blockchain in finance As blockchain technology continues to evolve, it is expected to play an even more prominent role in shaping the future of finance. From enabling faster and more secure payments to creating new investment opportunities, the potential applications of blockchain are vast. For example, CBDCs (central bank digital currencies) – which are digital versions of traditional fiat currencies – are gaining traction. Countries like China and the European Union are already exploring the development of CBDCs, which could revolutionize how we think about money and payments. Blockchain could provide the underlying infrastructure for CBDCs, allowing for secure and transparent transactions on a global scale. Moreover, blockchain has the potential to enhance financial inclusion by offering affordable financial services to underserved populations. With blockchain-based solutions, individuals in developing countries could gain access to banking services, insurance and credit, helping to lift millions out of poverty. Conclusion Blockchain technology is undoubtedly changing the face of finance, making it more decentralized, transparent and secure. As we continue to witness the growth of DeFi, CBDCs and blockchain-based financial services, it’s clear that the technology is here to stay. Whether you’re an investor, a financial professional or just someone looking to learn more about the future of money, it’s important to understand how blockchain will shape the financial world in the coming years. As the industry continues to evolve, staying informed and adapting to new technologies like blockchain will be key to thriving in the future financial landscape. The transformation is just beginning, and its potential is limitless.

Despite the SEC’s recent activity, which saw cases dropped against major players like Coinbase, Gemini and Robinhood, the Ripple case remains unresolved—and it’s far from simple. The Ripple-XRP case has reached a crucial point where a judge has already issued a split decision. On one hand, the SEC won a portion of the case, while Ripple claimed victory on another. The biggest takeaway? XRP was not classified as a security—a significant win for Ripple and its community. However, there are still unresolved issues, such as the finding of securities law violations and the potential penalties Ripple could face. Legal expert James Murphy aka Metalawman has a theory on the unexpected delay. He suggests that Ripple could be in active negotiations with the SEC to have some of Judge Torres’s decision vacated. Ripple could be looking for a better deal, particularly if they’re eyeing future securities offerings or an IPO. If both sides were to dismiss their appeals, Ripple could potentially settle with a $125 million penalty—but could they push for more? https://twitter.com/MetaLawMan/status/1895899204134060538 However, Murphy also wrote, “It is far from a sure thing that a federal judge would agree to vacate a prior ruling as part of a settlement. This was fairly commonplace several years ago when I started in the law business, but judges started balking at this in more recent times.” Although this remains speculation, Murphy’s theory has gained support from figures like attorney John Deaton. And while the settlement process could drag on, Ripple may be strategically waiting for market conditions to improve. As XRP continues its downward trend, the timing for any positive announcement may need to align with a broader market recovery—especially when it comes to boosting the price of XRP.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news|Ripple (XRP),EN,0,0,REGULATION|XRP|ALTCOIN|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-02 04:40:58

This price bounce comes after a rather bearish week marked by significant losses across the general crypto market. Interestingly, as these digital assets show some minor recovery, renowned market analyst Ali Martinez has postulated that XLM may be preparing for a major bullish swing. Related Reading: Solana Jumps 9% As Whales Quietly Accumulate Millions—Details XLM’s Bullish Flag Could Propel Prices To $1.20 – Analyst In an X post on March 1, Martinez shared an interesting technical analysis of the XLM market. According to the market expert, there is a bullish flag formation on the XLM/USDT 3-day trading chart signaling an incoming price surge. For context, the bullish flag pattern occurs when an asset experiences a steep rise in price representing the flagpole followed by a consolidation period with a declining price movement representing the flag. On the XLM/USDT chart, the bullish flag is formed following a price rally in November 2024 which is trailed by a price correction phase to date. However, while the bullish flag might signal a potential upward momentum ready to explode, Stellar must break beyond the upper boundary of the flag currently at $0.41 to confirm any price surge. Looking beyond this level, the altcoin will also face significant resistance to its upward movement at $1.00, $1.21, and $1.41 price levels respectively. However, in the presence of sufficient buying pressure, XLM could surge by at least 330% upon confirmation of bullish intent suggesting a minimum price of around $1.20. This projected rise of Stellar stems from historical data from which a bullish flag is expected to produce market gains similar to the length of its flagpole. Interestingly, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) on the XLM/USDT daily chart also supports the bullish potential of the altcoin. According to data from Tradingview, this RSI is currently at 4.59 headed in the upward direction, signaling more room for XLM price gains following its recent recovery.

XLM Price Overview At the time of writing, XLM trades at $0.3141 after its 10% price increase in the last 24 hours as earlier stated. Meanwhile, there is a slight reduction in market engagement as indicated by a 1.12% decline in daily trading volume. It is worth noting that XLM still remains in the red zone on its weekly and monthly timeframes with losses of 5.94% and 27.28%, respectively suggesting larger bearish market control in recent times. For a bullish flag breakout to materialize, XLM traders must increase the current buying pressure and induce a higher trading volume.

41039001,https://invezz.com/?p=2595741,1740891958,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,XRP price prediction: Is Ripple a good buy in March?,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/02/xrp-price-prediction-is-ripple-a-good-buy-in-march/,"The XRP price has moved from being one of the fourth quarter’s best-performing cryptocurrencies into a top laggard in 2025. Ripple has dropped from $3.42 in January this year to $2.2 as most cryptocurrencies dropped. This article explores whether the XRP price will recover after hitting the crucial support at $1.96 last week. XRP crashes despite crucial good news The ongoing XRP crash happened even though Ripple experienced some important good news. First, the XRP price plunge happened as the odds of a spot Ripple ETF jumped. Several companies like 21Shares, Canary, and Grayscale have all applied for a spot XRP ETF after seeing its popularity soar in the past few months. There is a likelihood that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the fund, a few months after it allowed the listings of a spot Ethereum fund. An XRP ETF approval will be a positive thing, albeit in the short term, as it will lead to more inflows. Second, XRP price has crashed as the XRP Ledger network sees some growth. It has started to witness more developer interest in the past few months. Some of the top tokens on the XRP Ledger network are Ripple USD (RLUSD), Sologenic, Crypto Trading Fund, Coreum, and XRP Army. The Crypto Trading Fund or CTF token price has soared by almost 20% in the last 7 days, while the RLUSD market cap jumped to $132 million. Its daily trading volume is usually more than $100 million, a sign that it has more demand. Third, there are rising odds that the SEC will end the litigation against Ripple Labs soon. It filed an appeal last year after Ripple secured a partial victory. This case stems in a 2020 lawsuit in which the SEC accused Ripple of selling unregistered securities. The overseeing judge said that XRP was not a security, but the company’s practice of selling the tokens to institutions was not right. She ordered Ripple to pay a $250 million fine, much lower than the $2 billion that the SEC wanted. The rising odds that the SEC will drop the Ripple charges are because of its recent decision to drop charges against other companies in the crypto industry like Gemini, Uniswap , and Coinbase. Read more: Coinbase says SEC set to drop enforcement case against the crypto exchange Why Ripple price crashed Therefore, there are three main reasons why the XRP price has crashed despite the good news in its ecosystem. First, XRP has plunged because of the ongoing softness in the crypto industry. Bitcoin and most altcoins have plunged this year, with the market cap of all coins falling to $2.7 trillion. Second, Ripple has crashed because of the ongoing state of fear in the crypto industry. The fear and greed index has moved to the extreme fear zone of 18. Crypto investors often remain in the sidelines when there is a sense of fear in the market. XRP price technical analysis XRP price chart by TradingView The XRP price has also plunged for technical reasons. For example, the coin has moved from the markup phase of the Wyckoff Theory into the distribution phase. This phase is characterized by investor pull and push and a lack of clear direction. Additionally, XRP has formed a head and shoulders chart pattern, a popular bearish sign in the market. This pattern comprises of a head, two shoulders, and a neckline. It has moved below the 50-day moving average. Therefore, the XRP price will likely continue falling as sellers target the 61.8% retracement level at $1.6215.

According to analyst EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto), the cryptocurrency is currently testing critical support levels while facing strong resistance, suggesting an impending breakout or breakdown. #XRP – Concept of Exhaustion in Bulls & Bears : #XRP Is Showing Strong Resilience! The price has dipped into the Blue Zone support 4-5 times, and each time, bulls have stepped in to defend it. This is a bullish signal, indicating that buy orders are stacked in this… pic.twitter.com/LeX0MkjRdF — EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) February 28, 2025 The ongoing struggle between buyers and sellers shows some market exhaustion, where repeated support and resistance levels testings indicate potential trend shifts. XRP’s Resilience at Key Support Levels Since its rise in December 2024, the price of XRP has repeatedly tested a critical support zone highlighted by the analyst in blue. The asset has tested this zone four to five times, and each time, buyers have stepped in to defend this level, preventing further declines. This repeated defense is a bullish indicator, suggesting strong buy orders are present in this area. However, prolonged pressure on a support level can lead to exhaustion among buyers, making it increasingly vulnerable to a breakdown. EGRAG CRYPTO notes that the rule of repeated knocks applies to both support and resistance levels. The more frequently a level is tested, the greater the likelihood of an eventual breakout or breakdown. While XRP has demonstrated resilience , market participants’ continued attacks on the Blue Zone could weaken its ability to hold. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Strategic Attacks and Market Noise The analyst noted that market makers and large traders often employ a systematic approach to breaking strong support levels. By repeatedly testing these zones, they aim to exhaust bullish momentum, eventually forcing a move downward. The same strategy is applied at resistance levels, where persistent attempts to manipulate prices can wear down sellers. This dynamic is evident in XRP’s price movements, as bears apply pressure at lower price levels. From a broader perspective, the analyst considers the price range between $2.00 and $3.40 as market noise . This means that movements within this range do not necessarily indicate a strong directional trend. Instead, traders operate within this zone, executing short-term strategies while awaiting a decisive breakout or breakdown. Despite the fluctuations, key resistance levels remain intact, particularly at $3.40, which continues to cap bullish advances. EGRAG CRYPTO suggests that a successful break above this level would mark a significant shift in momentum for XRP. A potential bearish crossover of the 21-day EMA and 100-day MA could signal increased selling pressure. If XRP loses support, it may drop to $1.67. The asset is trading at $2.18, and for a bullish breakout, key resistance levels are $2.20, $2.30, $2.60, $2.83, and $3.10, with $3.40 being the most critical for a sustained rally.

The meme coin market never sleeps, and lately, Brett ($BRETT) and Floki Inu ($FLOKI) have been making waves in their respective ecosystems. Brett, the mascot of Base Chain, has gained an ever-growing community, while Floki Inu is expanding its DeFi offerings and NFT ecosystem. Both coins are rallying investor interest, but there’s another player stealing the show—BTFD Coin. Meme coins have evolved far beyond viral jokes. They now serve as serious investment vehicles, blending hype, community, and utility. That’s exactly what BTFD Coin ($BTFD) is doing with its presale, which has already surpassed $6.23 million. With 90% APY staking rewards, a strong Bulls community, and a projected moon price of $0.006 (a staggering 3,650% ROI potential), BTFD is proving itself as one of the top meme coins to invest in . Let’s dive into why this coin is turning heads. BTFD Coin’s 90% APY Staking Turns Meme Coin Investing Into Passive Wealth Picture this—you invest $5,000 in BTFD Coin during Stage 14 at $0.00016 per token. Once it hits the listing price of $0.0006, your investment skyrockets to $18,750—and that’s before staking rewards even come into play! Now, stack that with 90% APY, and suddenly, your passive earnings turn into an unstoppable wealth-building machine. By staking your tokens, you could earn an extra $4,500 in a year, making it one of the top meme coins to invest in for both price appreciation and passive income. The BTFD Coin presale is in full throttle, having skipped straight to Stage 14 after burning all unsold tokens from Stage 13. That means a tighter supply and higher demand, creating the perfect setup for a potential explosive price surge. With over 11,100 Bulls on board and 70 billion tokens already sold, this project is proving that it’s not just hype—it’s an investment with real momentum. How to Buy BTFD Coins? Buying BTFD is simple: Set up your MetaMask or Trust Wallet. Load it with BNB or ETH. Connect your wallet to the presale page . Enter the amount and apply the LAUNCH100 bonus code for double tokens. Confirm the purchase and watch your investment grow. The 100% BONUS CODE (LAUNCH100) is an absolute game-changer—every BTFD purchase during Stage 14 gets DOUBLED. That means if you buy $5,000 worth of BTFD, you actually receive $10,000 worth of tokens. But this insane offer won’t last forever. With its Play-to-Earn (P2E) game, staking rewards, and a thriving Bulls community, BTFD Coin is setting a new standard among the top meme coins to invest in. The moon price of $0.006 is calling—will you answer, or will you be left chasing the next big opportunity? Brett Coin ($BRETT) Rallies as Base Chain’s Favorite Mascot Brett isn’t just a meme—it’s a cultural phenomenon. As the official mascot of Base Chain, $BRETT has become a community-driven powerhouse with a fixed 10 billion token supply. Recently, its market cap surged, fueled by increased activity on Base. The secret sauce? Brett’s meme status combined with strong network adoption. The Base Chain ecosystem is thriving, and $BRETT holders are seeing the benefits. Meme coin enthusiasts are flocking to Brett, seeing it as a Base-native alternative to Dogecoin and Pepe Coin. Brett’s limited supply and tight community engagement make it an attractive pick for those eyeing quick gains in the meme coin space. With transaction volumes spiking and Base Chain’s continued growth, Brett has positioned itself as a serious contender in the meme economy. Floki Inu ($FLOKI) Expands Its Utility With DeFi and NFT Growth Floki Inu started as just another Dogecoin-inspired meme, but it’s evolved into a full-fledged ecosystem. Between its Valhalla metaverse game, FlokiFi DeFi products, and Floki University educational platform, $FLOKI is now more than just a dog token. Recently, Floki Inu announced expanded staking options and liquidity pool integrations, strengthening its position in the DeFi sector. Investors have taken notice, and its trading volume has surged. Plus, with major adoption across exchanges and increased NFT game interest, Floki Inu is proving that meme coins don’t have to be just hype—they can have real utility. The Floki team’s strategic partnerships and innovative approach continue to drive its market expansion. As more investors look for meme coins with substance, Floki Inu is shaping up to be a long-term player in the space. Final Thoughts Based on our research and market trends, BTFD Coin stands out as a major opportunity among the top meme coins to invest in. With 90% APY staking, a presale that has already raised over $6.23 million, and a projected moon price of $0.006, this coin is making serious moves. The 100% LAUNCH100 bonus code is the cherry on top—offering double the tokens for every presale purchase. While Brett thrives as Base Chain’s mascot and Floki Inu builds a wider ecosystem, BTFD Coin is the only one offering high staking rewards and a 3650% ROI potential. The Bulls are charging ahead—but those who wait might miss the perfect dip to invest. The clock is ticking, and this price won’t last long. Secure your BTFD Coins before the presale ends and stake your way to massive gains. FAQs How does BTFD Coin’s staking work? BTFD Coin offers a 90% APY staking reward, meaning you earn extra tokens just for holding. Staking rewards are automatically distributed based on the number of BTFD tokens you stake. What is Brett Coin’s connection to Base Chain? Brett Coin ($BRETT) is the official mascot of Base Chain, with strong community support and a fixed supply of 10 billion tokens. It’s quickly gaining traction as Base Chain adoption increases. How is Floki Inu different from other meme coins? Floki Inu ($FLOKI) isn’t just a meme—it has a metaverse game (Valhalla), DeFi products (FlokiFi), and an education platform (Floki University), making it a well-rounded project in the meme coin space.

Bitcoin (BTC) price hit a $78K low before regaining back the $85K level, whereas altcoins mimicked the same volatile trend. Notably, the broader market volatility occurred due to macroeconomic heat and liquidity setbacks, urging a panic-selling sentiment among market participants. Mentioned below are some of this week’s top crypto market updates reported by CoinGape over the past week. Crypto Market Updates: Bitcoin & Altcoin Prices Ride Rollercoaster BTC price closes the week near the $85K level after touching a $78K low in the past seven days, as mentioned above. Further, Ethereum touched a $2100 level low this week. Solana saw a trading session at the $130 level. XRP price slipped to even lose $2 in the past seven days. Notably, the waning action comes against the backdrop of macro developments causing trade war tensions. U.S. President Donald Trump is set to forge ahead with new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and the EU. As a result, global markets took a hit, with even the crypto sector mirroring a slump. Moreover, CoinGape reported that the recent crypto market crash is also attributable to massive liquidations . The market saw over $1 billion in liquidations in just a day, with billions liquidated this week. Traders and investors further reflected a panic-selling sentiment amid massive liquidations. Nevertheless, BTC and altcoins showcased signs of recovery, with the flagship coin nearing $85K and ETH price closing the week near $2,200. Heightened Whale Activity Sparks Speculations Simultaneously, crypto whale activity rose substantially amid the recent market volatility, sparking market speculations. CoinGape reported that Dogecoin whales embarked on a massive buying spree amid DOGE price dip, signaling gains imminent. On the other hand, Solana whales also bought the recent dip, indicating price gains for the crypto looms. SOL whales’ also unstaked massive amounts amid the current volatility, adding a layer of intrigue among market participants. Also, Ethereum whales have taken on a buying spree, accumulating heavily amid the recent dip. Altogether, the massive accumulations signal renewed market interest in cryptocurrencies after the recent market turmoil. Traders and investors continue monitoring prices for further shifts.

As investors look more and more for quality opportunities in DeFi, this lending project is differentiated by its real-world utility and potential for long-term growth. With the current price still at $0.015 per token, early buyers are securing their positions before it reaches higher presale levels. Analysts further forecast Mutuum Finance could be among the spotlight projects for 2025 and thus is a possible market leader. What is Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is a decentralized lending protocol that seeks to allow users to have complete ownership of their assets while exposing them to ways of earning passive income. Unlike traditional finance mechanisms that utilize intermediaries or banks, Mutuum Finance allows for lending crypto assets to sources of liquidity, the accrual of interest, and borrowing against an asset without having to sell. One of the most notable aspects of Mutuum Finance is its dual lending model consisting of peer-to-contract (P2C) and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending. Using the P2C model, users are permitted to contribute assets to liquidity pools in exchange for competitive interest rates against market demand. At the same time, the P2P model facilitates direct lending agreements between lenders and borrowers to open borrowing possibilities to assets previously beyond ordinary liquidity pools, such as such novelty assets as meme coins such as Dogecoin (DOGE) or Pepe (PEPE). Since over 150 million tokens have been sold, the presale for Mutuum Finance is full-steam ahead, having demonstrable demand from investors who are confident in its future outlook. The current price of $0.015 per MUTM offers early buyers the chance to secure their positions before the token advances to later presale phases. A total of 11 phases are planned, with the price gradually increasing to $0.06 at launch, ensuring that early investors benefit from lower entry costs and higher potential returns. The price of Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will further appreciate upon its launch, driven by increasing demand and significant developments as outlined in its roadmap. According to the team, a beta version of the platform will also be launched simultaneously with the launch of the token’s exchange, which will allow users to experiment with its decentralized lending and borrowing feature in real-time. This rollout is expected to attract more participants, boosting token utility and driving market demand. As more users engage with the platform, interest in MUTM’s lending pools, passive income features, and borrowing options will naturally increase, pushing its value higher in the post-launch phase. Experts believe that Mutuum Finance could be one of the biggest DeFi projects in 2025, as its structured lending system, passive income generation, and sustainable token model create consistent demand and price growth. With the team also developing an overcollateralized stablecoin, which will be pegged to the US dollar and launched on the Ethereum network, the project is further strengthening its ecosystem and increasing utility for its token holders. Mutuum Finance is quickly becoming one of the most talked-about projects in the DeFi space, attracting both retail and institutional investors looking for long-term growth rather than short-term speculation. Its real-world financial applications, structured financial model, and passive income opportunities make it a compelling investment before the presale phases end. As the crypto market shifts toward utility-driven projects, many investors are positioning themselves early, recognizing the potential of a token designed to thrive in both bull and bear markets. With strong fundamentals, an active community, and a fast-selling presale, Mutuum Finance is shaping up to be a major player in 2025.

Currently priced at $0.015, early supporters view it as a strategic entry point before an anticipated price surge once it launches on exchanges. Why Consider Holding Mutuum Finance (MUTM)? Mutuum Finance stands out in the DeFi sector by focusing on more than speculative gains. Its presale—already surpassing $1.8 million—prices each token at $0.015 in its second phase. Over 11 planned presale phases, the token will climb to $0.06 at launch, giving early buyers a chance to secure tokens at lower costs before listings on major exchanges. Initial presale performance was strong, selling 110 million tokens in under two weeks. Now in Phase 2, the project has sold over 40% of that allocation, stoking fear of missing out (FOMO) among investors. Each additional stage includes a price bump, so many see early participation as a path to maximize potential gains. Beyond near-term profits, experts believe MUTM offers a long-term option that could reap substantial rewards. Some forecasts suggest an initial 1,500% jump post-listing, with a price target of $4–$5 by mid-2025. These projections stem from Mutuum Finance’s core financial use cases, its demand-driven tokenomics, and robust passive income features, painting a picture of a token better suited to long-term holding than quick flips. A Practical and Transparent Lending Model Mutuum Finance enables users to deposit digital assets into liquidity pools to earn interest according to market demand. Lenders get mtTokens, representing their stake, which appreciate over time. Borrowers, meanwhile, can gain access to liquidity while keeping their crypto holdings. This offers a balanced ecosystem where both lenders and borrowers benefit. Two primary lending options are available: Peer-to-Contract (P2C) : Lenders contribute assets to pooled liquidity, earning interest based on usage. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) : Users can discuss and set loan terms directly, thereby expanding loan possibilities to more speculative tokens (like DOGE, PEPE, or SHIB) often absent from mainstream lending platforms. With these choices, holders can effortlessly earn passive yields by supplying their crypto holdings. This adaptability may appeal to a range of investor profiles, from large institutions to individual traders. Buy-and-Distribute Mechanism for Sustained Demand One element that sets Mutuum Finance apart is its buy-and-distribute approach. A portion of the platform’s revenue is allocated to repurchasing MUTM tokens, which are then shared with mtToken holders. This model consistently drives buy pressure, potentially lifting token demand while mitigating sell pressure—helping to ensure meaningful, enduring price support for MUTM. As the presale continues and the project nears its official launch, more investors are identifying MUTM’s potential. Observers anticipate a quick price spike once the token lists on exchanges. Additionally, a beta version of the platform set to launch concurrently with the token should stoke further demand. Given its steady financial model, built-in yield features, and a surging holder base, Mutuum Finance stands out as a noteworthy DeFi project in 2025. For those seeking a long-term crypto investment, holding MUTM might prove to be a highly worthwhile decision.

Bitcoin price has moved from last week’s low of $75,000 to over $85,000. The total market cap of all cryptocurrencies has moved to $2.8 trillion, while crypto fear and greed index has dropped to the extreme fear zone. This article explores the top forecast of coins like Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR), Grass token (GRASS), and Binance Coin (BNB). Hedera Hashgraph price analysis HBAR price chart by TradingView The HBAR price dropped and bottomed at $0.1816 last week as demand for the token surged and other altcoins fell. This was a crucial level since it was the lowest swing on February 3rd, and the highest swing in April last year. HBAR price has formed a small double-bottom pattern at $0.1816. It has moved above the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). It has formed a break and retest pattern at $0.1816, a positive sign in the market. The Relative Strength Index (RSI), MACD, and the Stochastic Oscillator have all pointed upwards. Therefore, the Hedera Hashgraph price will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance point at $0.30. Hedera’s recent surge is mostly because the network partnered with Swift, an association of global banks that handles trillions of dollars a year. Swift will use Hedera as its main blockchain network for its payments.

BNB price has now plunged to low of $608, down by about 25% from the highest level in 2024. The coin remains above the ascending trendline that connects the lowest swing since January last year. The Binance coin has remained slightly below the 50-day Exponential Moving Average. It has moved to the bottom if trading range of the Murrey Math Lines at $593. The Average Directional Index (ADX) has risen slightly upwards to 22. The BNB coin price has formed a double-bottom pattern at $562, and the neckline at $735. A double-bottom is one of the most bullish patterns in the market. Therefore, the coin will likely have a strong bullish breakout in the coming months. Such a move will point to more upside, with the next price to watch being at $735, up by about 20% from the current level. A drop below the key support at $560 will invalidate the bullish view.

The GRASS token price has jumped from a low of $0.9060 in February this year, as the daily data scrapped moved to over 1 billion. Grass price has moved above the key resistance level at $2.2717, its highest swing on February 22nd. It has moved above the 50-period moving average, while the Average Directional Index (ADX) has moved to 36, the highest swing on February 15. The coin has invalidated the double-top pattern. Grass price has moved to the 61.8% Fibonacci Retracement level. Therefore, the Grass price will likely continue rising as bulls target the key resistance at $2.8615, the 78.6% Fibonacci Retracement point.

In a recent post on X, SMQKE emphasized that the necessary systems, licenses, and legal structures are already in place, allowing major banks to integrate XRP into their operations. Ripple is currently allowed to LEGALLY OFFER cross-border payment services using XRP and its RLUSD stablecoin through its over 50 licenses, including those in strict regulatory environments like New York and Texas. These licenses enable banks such as Bank of America and… https://t.co/IhqxQqUdS3 pic.twitter.com/tSR0b6gT7s — SMQKE (@SMQKEDQG) February 26, 2025 Regulatory Milestones Strengthen XRP’s Position SMQKE noted that Ripple has secured over 50 Money Transmitter Licenses (MTLs) across the U.S., including approvals in highly regulated states such as New York and Texas. These licenses give Ripple the legal authority to facilitate payment services using XRP and RLUSD, its newly launched stablecoin . This regulatory framework is crucial for financial institutions looking to integrate XRP into their payment networks. Ripple has eliminated many legal uncertainties that previously hindered institutional adoption by securing compliance with U.S. financial laws. This progress significantly strengthens XRP’s position as a viable asset for cross-border transactions. Institutional Adoption Gaining Traction SMQKE’s analysis suggests that with these regulatory approvals in place, major banks, including Bank of America and Santander, are now in a position to utilize XRP for international payments. The infrastructure required for institutional use is already established, making it easier for financial entities to adopt XRP without legal complications. Public discussion around XRP’s institutional use has intensified following comments from David Stryzewski of Sound Planning Group. During a televised segment, Stryzewski claimed that Bank of America runs 100% of its internal transactions using XRP . While this claim remains unverified, it has fueled speculation about the extent of XRP’s adoption by major financial players.

The company now holds 55 global licenses spanning 33 states, reinforcing its ability to operate within regulatory frameworks. Ripple’s growth is also reflected in its transaction volumes. In Q4 of 2024, the company processed $70 billion in payments. It is also actively increasing its U.S. workforce and expanding the issuance of RLUSD on the XRP Ledger. XRP Struggles Amid Institutional Growth Despite these regulatory and institutional advancements, some investors remain concerned about XRP’s performance. One user questioned why XRP’s price has not seen significant gains, despite institutional interest. XRP is trading at $2.19, after multiple significant drops during the week, and SMQKE addressed these concerns by pointing to XRP’s historical performance. He noted that XRP has surged tenfold from $0.30 to $3.30. Moreover, despite recent declines, XRP has posted a one-year gain of 247%, outperforming Bitcoin and Ethereum.

This price movement is largely driven by an increase in spot buying and leveraged long positions. Despite the bullish momentum, some analysts warn that further downside risks still exist, and the market may not have found its true bottom yet. Spot and Margin Longs Drive Price Recovery One of the key factors behind Bitcoin’s price recovery has been the surge in spot market demand. Large bids have been placed on major exchanges, signaling strong buying interest at these levels. Additionally, traders using margin and leveraged positions have contributed to the upward movement. This dynamic has resulted in a temporary shift in momentum, giving Bitcoin the support it needed to bounce back from its previous losses. Caution as Market Conditions Remain Uncertain Despite the recent gains, some market participants remain cautious. Many traders believe this recovery could be an oversold bounce rather than the beginning of a sustained rally. If buyers fail to maintain control and selling pressure returns, Bitcoin could revisit lower support levels. Furthermore, macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments continue to influence investor sentiment. Any negative news could trigger another wave of selling, leading to further price corrections. Technical Indicators and Market Structure Bitcoin’s technical indicators present a mixed picture. While the recent rebound has pushed prices higher, the overall trend remains uncertain. The market has yet to establish a clear higher high on the daily timeframe, which would be necessary to confirm a bullish reversal. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has climbed from oversold levels, suggesting that selling pressure has eased for now. However, if Bitcoin fails to hold above key support zones, another downward move could be on the horizon. What’s Next for Bitcoin? While Bitcoin’s price action has improved in the short term, the broader market trend remains uncertain. If buying pressure continues, the cryptocurrency could attempt to consolidate above key levels, paving the way for further gains. On the other hand, if Bitcoin struggles to maintain its momentum, traders should prepare for potential retests of lower support zones. The coming weeks will be critical in determining whether this recovery is the beginning of a new uptrend or just a temporary relief rally in a broader correction phase.",Bitcoin|Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,BTC|TRADING|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-02 06:34:40

There’s growing speculation that prices are about to move, and many experts believe that Pi Coin is on the verge of a major price surge. However, Pi has seen a dramatic drop after a huge price surge. Currently priced at $1.79, it’s down 40% from its peak of $2.90 and has crashed more than 22% in the last 24 hours. Despite the sharp decline, there’s speculation around future developments such as the upcoming mainnet launch, KYC unlocks, and potential exchange listings like Binance or Coinbase. If Pi can reclaim $2.20 , there’s potential for a bounce to $2.80+, but a drop below $1.50 could lead to further declines. Whale Accumulation: A Strong Indicator Whale accumulation is a key factor that suggests Pi Coin’s price may be on the verge of a breakout. Recent on-chain data shows that large holders (whales) are quietly accumulating Pi Coin in significant amounts. When whales buy up an asset, it often signals their confidence in the future price. Historically, this kind of accumulation precedes a price surge, as these investors are preparing to sell at higher prices in the future. Whale activity also helps boost market sentiment. When large investors show confidence in Pi Coin, it can create a sense of FOMO (fear of missing out) among retail investors, which drives prices even higher. Bitcoin’s Influence on the Market Bitcoin’s price movements often set the tone for the entire cryptocurrency market. If Bitcoin shows strength, it can pull altcoins like Pi Coin upward as well. With Bitcoin currently showing positive momentum, there’s a strong possibility that Pi Coin will follow suit. The combination of Bitcoin’s strength and Pi’s growing ecosystem creates the perfect conditions for a price surge.",News|Altcoins|Crypto news,EN,0,0,TRADING|MARKET|BTC|ALTCOIN|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'coinpedia', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/coinpedia.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",coinpedia,2025-03-02 06:40:36

Large holders, those with between 1 million to 10 million XRP and 10 million to 100 million XRP, collectively acquired approximately 440 million XRP, valued at nearly $1 billion. This surge in accumulation suggests strategic positioning, possibly in anticipation of future price movements. Xaif shared a chart showing the whale activity, and pointed out that “whales have been buying the dip heavily since the market crashed.” This trend is not unusual in cryptocurrency markets, where large investors often accumulate assets following price corrections. BREAKING Whales bought $1 Billion #XRP XRP whales have been buying the dip heavily since the market crashed.

Historically, similar whale activity has preceded upward price movements. A comparable accumulation event occurred in early February after another market dip, reinforcing the pattern of large investors increasing their holdings during lower prices. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Reports at the time revealed that 53 wallets holding over 1 million XRP were added overnight. Such an increase in large holders suggests a growing confidence among institutional or high-net-worth investors in the digital asset’s long-term potential, and the recent accumulation suggests something big is coming. Recent Whale Movements and Ecosystem Activity Beyond accumulation, there is evidence that whales actively move XRP within the ecosystem. A recent report highlighted a single whale transaction involving 65 million XRP . Such large transfers can indicate several possibilities, including strategic positioning for future liquidity events, institutional investments, or preparations for major market developments. While whale accumulation alone does not guarantee an immediate price increase, it often signals confidence from those with the most skin in the game. This pattern suggests that these significant market players are positioning themselves ahead of a potential shift in the digital asset’s market trajectory. What’s Next for XRP? The sustained accumulation of XRP by whales suggests that these investors anticipate favorable market conditions. Whether this translates into a price surge remains uncertain, but historical trends indicate that large-scale accumulation often precedes bullish movements. XRP is trading at $2.15, showing a slight 0.79% increase over the past 24 hours, and investors will be watching closely to see if these whales were right to accumulate tokens.

The analyst has issued a warning about the upcoming Tether (USDT) delisting, which will affect some cryptocurrency exchanges within the European Union. As it is known, cryptocurrency exchange Kraken will delist USDT, EURT, PYUSD, UST and TUSD stablecoins in the European Economic Area in accordance with MiCA rules, and users in this region will no longer be able to buy or sell these assets on the exchange. Starting from February 27, trading for these stablecoins on the exchange has switched to sell-only mode, and from March 31, all other stablecoins will be automatically converted to USDC. According to il Capo, although this situation is limited to Europe for now, the pressure on stablecoins could increase globally in 2025. According to the analyst, in such a scenario, USDT could face even more difficulties.

The 14th stage of BTFD’s presale is over 98% complete, and if you wait too long, you’ll watch its current $0.00016 price vanish before your eyes. BTFD isn’t just a meme coin—it’s a staking beast, boasting a 90% APY that turns passive holders into wealth-builders. Early buyers are staring at a 275% ROI when the presale ends at $0.0006, but that’s just the beginning. Analysts predict BTFD’s moonshot could hit $0.006, delivering a 3650% ROI. Miss this? You’ll be watching the best coin presale from the sidelines—again. BTFD Coin (BTFD): The Best Coin Presale to Buy Before the Bull Run Begins Crypto isn’t just about hype—it’s about getting in at the right time. BTFD embodies the ultimate trading mantra: Buy The Dip . Unlike the pump-and-dump meme coins that fade into irrelevance, BTFD is a utility-driven powerhouse with a thriving ecosystem. Right now, the BTFD presale is the best entry point, offering ground-floor access before it explodes onto exchanges. It launched at $0.000004 per coin and now sits at $0.00016, yet presale investors will still lock in a 275% profit at launch. But why settle for that when the $0.006 moon price could turn a mere $8,500 investment into $318,750? Beyond just price speculation, BTFD’s Play-to-Earn (P2E) game went live on January 1, 2025, allowing users to earn while they play. And then there’s staking—crypto’s golden goose. While most projects offer meager returns, BTFD cranks it up with a massive 90% APY, turning passive holdings into exponential gains. If that wasn’t enough, BTFD is a community-first project, with its Bulls Squad leading the charge. It’s built on Ethereum, ensuring security, liquidity, and long-term growth. The tokenomics are designed to reward early investors, with liquidity locked and staking incentives fueling sustained price appreciation. Earn More with BTFD’s Referral Program BTFD isn’t just about investing—it’s about bringing your circle into the profit zone with its lucrative referral program. Simply connect your wallet on the BTFD presale site to get a unique referral code, share it with friends, and start earning. When someone spends at least $50, they get 10% extra BTFD, while you earn 10% of their purchase. If you rank among the top 20 referrers, expect even bigger bonuses. This is the best coin presale to buy if you want to multiply your holdings before BTFD hits exchanges! Pepe Coin (PEPE): The Millionaire Maker You Missed Rewind to April 2023, when PEPE launched at an absurdly low price. Investors who threw in a couple of hundred bucks watched their portfolios balloon into six and seven figures within months. PEPE was brushed off as “just another meme coin,” but those who recognized its potential are now laughing all the way to the bank. PEPE’s meteoric rise wasn’t just hype—it was strategic timing. It launched in a meme-driven bull market, fueled by community excitement and viral traction. Back then, early believers snagged millions of PEPE tokens for mere pennies. Fast forward, and PEPE surged to an all-time high of $0.00000431, making many overnight millionaires. But if you think you can ride PEPE to similar gains again, think twice. Its days of 10,000% gains are in the past, and its massive market cap makes another explosive pump unlikely. While PEPE remains relevant, it’s not the next millionaire-maker. That’s why BTFD Coin is a real opportunity. It’s sitting at the same early stage PEPE once was but with far more lucrative staking rewards, an active ecosystem, and an engaged community. The biggest gains are always at the presale level—and this time, you’re here before the explosion. The Clock is Ticking—BTFD’s 3650% ROI Won’t Wait! Opportunities like this don’t knock twice. BTFD is the best coin presale to buy right now , and Stage 14 is nearly sold out. With over $6.21 million raised and more than 11,100 investors already in, the time to act is now. At $0.00016 per coin, it’s still dirt cheap—but when it launches at $0.0006, you’ll wish you grabbed more. And when it hits the predicted $0.006 moon price, you’ll either be counting your gains or watching from the sidelines—again. Don’t miss your second chance at a millionaire-making meme coin.

His recent post on X, accompanied by a technical chart, suggests that XLM may be positioned for a 330% breakout if the pattern plays out as expected. At the time of his analysis, XLM was trading at $0.30267. Based on this, a breakout of 330% would bring the price to approximately $1.3, pushing it above its all-time high of $0.9381. The chart illustrates a downward-sloping channel following a strong rally, a structure that fits the definition of a bullish flag—a continuation pattern often signaling further upward movement after consolidation. #Stellar $XLM is forming a bullish flag, which could trigger a 330% breakout! pic.twitter.com/hWuQSTkUj0 — Ali (@ali_charts) March 1, 2025 Technical Factors Supporting the Pattern The chart shared by Martinez highlights several technical indicators that reinforce this outlook. Fibonacci retracement levels suggest that XLM has been respecting key price zones, with the 0.618 retracement level around $0.30 acting as strong support. This level has historically been an accumulation zone for assets preparing for another move upward. If XLM maintains support here, it could build momentum for a breakout above the flag’s upper boundary near $0.42. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Martinez recently drew attention to a TD Sequential Indicator buy signal for XLM , arguing that the asset may be gearing up for a strong move. The report discusses how this indicator has historically preceded price increases, adding weight to the current technical setup. If the bullish flag plays out, the projected breakout target is calculated by applying the flagpole’s length to the breakout point. While Martinez predicts a 330% increase, the chart shows that this rally can extend as far as $1.8, almost doubling its all-time high. However, confirmation will be needed in increased volume and a decisive close above resistance levels. The Bullish Outlook for XLM The outlook for XLM is not solely reliant on technical patterns. A popular XRP proponent recently explained why the crypto world should not write off XLM . With historical ties with Ripple and potential involvement with Elon Musk’s SpaceX, XLM could become an even more notable player in the crypto space. Martinez’s analysis of XLM presents a compelling case for a potential breakout, with price targets reaching as high as $1.8. The bullish flag pattern with strong support at key Fibonacci levels, points toward a continuation of the previous uptrend.

The content and materials featured on this page are for educational purposes only. As Dogecoin struggles, Yeti Ouro emerges as a robust GameFi contender, capturing investors’ attention. Table of Contents Dogecoin price analysis YETIO: The GameFi contender The crypto market is bleeding after a series of adverse macroeconomic factors struck. Dogecoin (DOGE) and other meme coins have been the worst affected, but coins like Yeti Ouro (YETIO) could be the only silver lining. Yeti Ouro is a Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming meme coin still in its presale, creating waves in the crypto scene. Dogecoin price analysis Dogecoin has lost 36.81% of its value over the past month, currently trading at $0.21. December 2024 was a blast for the meme coin. However, all through 2025, Dogecoin has struggled to maintain its value. The Dogecoin price has hit its lowest in three months and continues to face resistance. Dogecoin reflects the larger market sentiment and often mimics Bitcoin’s price movements. A near-term respite seems unlikely, with Doge testing 50-week EMA as the critical support level. The sharp decline is obvious as Doge and most other meme coins drive their prices from hype and market momentum rather than any utility-driven price jumps. Metric-wise, overall transaction volume has dropped, while transactions exceeding $1 million have also seen a decline in February. Doge’s open interest also fell to $2.21 billion from $5.42 billion last month. You might also like: ETH volatility creates entry points for investors; Yeti Ouro gains whale attraction YETIO: The GameFi contender There’s so much to know about Yeti Ouro beyond the Yeti meme it is inspired by. Here’s why Yeti Ouro is the new GameFi idol. The power-packed Yeti Go game Yeti Ouro is redefining the Play-to-Earn gaming sector with Yeti Go, a high-octane game driven by multi-player performances, high-quality graphics, and audio from Grammy-award-winning musicians. Yeti Ouro is a racing game developed for high-octane gamers. It will give an adrenaline rush while rewarding wallets with the gold rush from in-game rewards. 15% of the total YETIO token supply is reserved strictly for game rewards. The game is built on the Unreal 5 Engine and being developed by industry-leading creators behind hit titles such as Spiderman, Call of Duty, The Witcher, and Dead Space, featuring AAA-quality graphics. Its audio is expertly produced by top sound engineers who have collaborated with Grammy-winning artists like Major Lazer, Kabaka Pyramid, and Vybz Kartel. Robust ergonomics and economics Yeti Ouro is based on Ethereum and shares its resilience and robustness. Its smart contract code is audited by SOLIDProof. This audit refurbishes asset protection and data security on the platform. The token supply is limited to 1 billion, and 50% of this supply goes to the immediate community as a part of the presale. YETIO’s 5% supply will undergo a burn with every transaction to keep inflationary pressures at ease. A presale that has doubled investments before listing Yeti Ouro’s presale has been highly successful so far. It has entered its third stage, with investors having bought over 201 million YETIO tokens and approximately $3 million in funds raised so far. Owing to the investors’ high demand and confidence, the YETIO token’s price rose to $0.024, with further price increases expected. Purchases are currently receiving a 10% bonus with an additional 5% for purchases over $500. The early investors have earned 100% ROI even before YETIO’s listing, reiterating the fact that it remains highly undervalued with great upside potential. Some experts suggest that YETIO could see a 600x growth in the coming months. For more information on Yeti Ouro, visit the website , X , Telegram , or Discord .

The focus of this investigation is if financial institutions were forced to avoid digital assets which could be hindering innovation and restricting people’s and businesses’ access to banking services. The FDIC’s new acting chairman, Travis Hill, has expressed worries that the agency under President Biden took an antagonistic view of banks trying to offer cryptocurrency services. A possible reason for this is reports of some businesses and individuals allegedly being debanked on account of their alleged involvement in crypto—which raised alarms over perceived overreach on the part of regulators. Comer has requested unredacted FDIC documents pertaining to its communication with banks Earlier in February, the FDIC released redacted versions of documents on their interactions with banks. 64 of those documents revealed the agency‘s correspondence with the 24 banks that received pause letters, and 111 documents showed FDIC correspondence and records on crypto-related activities of other regulated institutions. However, Chairman James Comer of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has insisted that full document disclosure is necessary to better understand the situation. He has already requested access to the FDIC’s uncensored records, hoping to see why the FDIC told banks to hold off on their crypto projects. He’s also reached out to some tech leaders in the crypto space, asking them to divulge their debanking stories and experience with the FDIC. First Lady Melania Trump are also alleged to have been unlawfully debanked for their crypto ties, and the Oversight Committee is also investigating her case as well. As for now, Chairman Comer has claimed that they have to know if the federal regulators threatened the banks to drop their crypto activities, and therefore, their investigations are important. He noted that the Committee is concerned about government regulators overreaching and arbitrarily suppressing industries they deem unfavorable. This has impacted business operations by restricting access to cash for payroll and driving technological and financial innovation overseas. Caitlin Long claims Trump’s administration has not addressed the debanking issues While Trump’s administration has maintained a pro-crypto stance from the start, Custodia Bank’s CEO Caitlin long feels that the administration has not done anything to address the debanking complications. She said that the problem is that banks are still afraid that crypto is a dangerous place to invest, and the president has not tried to make them change their minds. Caitlin Long speaking at ETHDenver in Denver, Colorado on Feb. 28. Source ETHDenver. She has, however, called for Trump’s administration to appoint another FDIC lead. Long said that the FDIC has only dragged down the banking system by refusing to accept technological alterations for over a decade under Martin Gruenberg’s leadership. She, however, appreciated the government’s efforts to make the Securities and Exchanges Commission more crypto-friendly and hopes the same can be done to banking regulations. She also wants the county to approve the stablecoin legislation, which will institute more consumer protection measures, including requiring banks to maintain their cash reserves to strengthen stablecoin liquidity. The FDIC inquiry may be a pacesetter for the future of US crypto regulation. The oversight committee could make some serious changes if they find substantiated evidence that banks were pressured down a wrong road, including repealing clauses preventing financial institutions from banking with crypto firms. On the other hand, if the investigation concludes that the FDIC acted within its mandate, it could further entrench skepticism toward crypto in the banking sector.",OP-ED|ETH|FDIC|USD,EN,0,0,REGULATION|ETH|BUSINESS|FIAT,"{'name': 'Cryptopolitan', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/cryptopolitan.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptopolitan,2025-03-02 07:45:29

Ethereum Price Analysis,https://cryptopotato.com/will-eth-stabilize-after-a-20-weekly-crash-ethereum-price-analysis/,"Ethereum has been experiencing a wild crash over the last few days, breaking below several significant support levels. Investors are now wondering when this downtrend will end. Technical Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) The Daily Chart On the daily chart, the asset has been dropping rapidly since breaking below the 200-day moving average, located around the $2,900 mark. The $2,700 and $2,350 levels are also broken to the downside, as the price is currently testing the $2,100 support zone. If this level also gets broken to the downside, a deeper decline toward the $1,750 level could be expected in the coming months. The 4-Hour Chart Looking at the 4-hour chart, things are not looking good at all for ETH, as the asset has been making lower highs and lows consistently over the last couple of months. Currently, the $2,100 support level is holding the price. A temporary recovery could be probable if ETH breaks above the $2,400 level. However, if the $2,100 area is also lost, a much worse drop would be likely for Ethereum. Sentiment Analysis By Edris Derakhshi (TradingRage) Open Interest Many analysts and investors are blaming the futures market for Ethereum’s massive crash over the recent weeks. However, analyzing the open interest metric indicates this might not be the case this time. This chart demonstrates the open interest metric, which measures the number of open futures contracts. As the chart suggests, while the price has experienced a significant drop, the open interest is not declining as it should be and is still lagging. This indicates that the recent price action is not totally due to long liquidation cascades, and most of the selling pressure comes from the spot market. Also, it warns investors that things could get much worse in case a much bigger liquidation event occurs. The post Will ETH Stabilize After a 20% Weekly Crash?

According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, RUNE is likely far from a market recovery following a bearish flag pattern on its trading chart. Related Reading: Altcoin Transaction King? TRON Hits 42% Share As USDT, DeFi Explode RUNE Chart Hints At Major Sell-Off Ahead – Details In technical analysis, a bearish flag is a continuation pattern formed after a significant downtrend, followed by a period of consolidation, before another leg downward. This pattern is characterized by parallel or slightly supporting ascending levels thereby giving the shape of a flag. Based on an analysis by Martinez, a bearish flag has now appeared on the RUNE/USDT 12-hour trading chart following its recent consolidation pattern which came after the asset’s decline from mid-January to early February. Interestingly, RUNE has now broken below the lower boundary of the bearish flag at $1.27 reducing any immediate odds of a bullish price reversal. Unless investors can force a price reclaim of this lower boundary, Martinez’s prediction states RUNE could be headed for a price target of $0.38 representing a potential 69% decline on the asset’s current price. Lately, the RUNE market has seen a significant amount of unwanted developments. Aside from its obvious market woes, recent events in the THORChain community have cast more concerns over the asset. In the past week, one of THORChain’s developers nicknamed Pluto(9r) resigned from the decentralized exchange after a controversial decision involving transactions from North Korea. Notably, a vote by Pluto(9r) and two other validators to halt the Ethereum Network from running on THORChain to prevent transactions by North Korean hackers was quickly overturned by other network validators resulting in the resignation of the former. This development comes following the $1.5 billion hack of the Bybit exchange which has so far been linked to popular North Korean Lazarus Group. According to blockchain tracker, Lookonchain, the Bybit hacker laundered $605 million (54%) of the loot using the THORChain network.

As earlier stated, bearish forces are largely dominant in this asset market as evidenced by the 46.67% overall decline in the past 30 days. Interestingly, the crypto prediction site Coincodex presents an optimistic stance on the RUNE market. Their latest forecasts show a price recovery to $1.40 in 30 days and $1.66 in the next six months.

While Cardano (ADA) and Solana (SOL) grapple with market volatility, BitLemons ($BLEM) emerges as the ultimate disruptor, bringing unprecedented excitement to the $450 billion gaming casino market. With institutional investors quietly positioning themselves, the question isn’t just about survival but who will dominate the next crypto revolution. Can BitLemons Rewrite the Crypto Playbook While Others Falter? BitLemons is more than just another crypto project—it’s a fully operational crypto casino platform generating revenue 24/7. Backed by a groundbreaking $1 million seed round and fortified with dual security audits from SpyWolf and SolidProof, this platform offers a unique value proposition that sets it apart from traditional cryptocurrencies. The platform boasts an impressive arsenal of over 8,000 games from industry giants like Evolution and Pragmatic, implementing a game-changing 30% Gross Gaming Revenue (GGR) allocation model. With 15% dedicated to token buyback and burn and another 15% allocated to staking rewards, BitLemons creates a sustainable ecosystem that benefits investors directly. Its presale performance tells a compelling story of rapid growth. Stage 1 sold out in just 16 days, with current Stage 2 tokens priced at a mere $0.02—and rumors circulating of a potential listing price between 17-18 cents. This isn’t just an investment opportunity; it’s an invitation to be part of a blockchain gaming revolution generating revenue. Solana’s Rollercoaster: CME Futures Launch Amidst Price Volatility Solana finds itself at a critical juncture, now trading at $149.30, recovering from a recent downturn with a 7-day decline of 12.64%. With a current market cap of $75.71B (up 16.12%) and a 24-hour trading volume of $7.35B (surging 81.82%), SOL is experiencing significant volatility but showing signs of recovery. In a major development, CME Group announced on Friday that it will introduce Solana futures on March 17, pending regulatory approval. U.S. traders will soon be able to access both micro-sized contracts of 25 SOL and larger-sized contracts of 500 SOL, potentially bringing more institutional interest to the asset. Despite this positive news, the blockchain’s recent performance challenges have some investors questioning its long-term stability, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty that smart money is using as an opportunity to explore more innovative platforms. Cardano’s Uphill Battle: Will ADA Find Its Footing? Cardano continues its uphill battle, currently priced at $0.6437, representing a significant 16.44% drop over the past week. With a market cap of $22.66B (up 4.45% in 24 hours) and a 24-hour trading volume of $1B (up 35.09%), ADA faces substantial market pressure. The total supply stands at 44.99B ADA out of a maximum 45B ADA, with 35.21B currently in circulation. While the recent Grayscale ETF filing offers hope, investors are looking for more than just potential—they’re seeking guaranteed value and stability in their investments. The Ultimate Crypto Opportunity: Are You Ready? While traditional cryptocurrencies struggle with market volatility, BitLemons shines as a beacon of innovation and potential. The platform isn’t just promising future returns—it’s delivering actual value right now. With a fully operational platform generating 24/7 revenue and a strategic approach to tokenomics, BitLemons is building an empire where others are merely weathering market storms. As the crypto landscape continues to evolve, one critical question remains: Can you afford to miss the most promising investment opportunity of 2025? BitLemons isn’t just changing the game—it’s creating a new playing field. This is your moment to be part of a true crypto revolution.

Pseudonymous analyst DonAlt tells his 657,500 followers on the social media platform X that it is within the realm of possibility for BTC to repeat its 2021 mid-bull cycle collapse when it lost over 50% of its value in just three months. While Bitcoin eventually recovered all losses by November 2021, BTC failed to mount rallies above $69,000 before abruptly ending its bull market. If Bitcoin follows in the footsteps of its 2021 bull cycle, it would suggest that BTC will recover after a 50% drawdown and put in a new all-time high at slightly above $110,000 before giving up most of its gains as it enters bear territory. “To me, worst case [is] we’re here in the cycle. Excited to see how it plays out.” Source: DonAlt/X Alternatively, DonAlt says the best-case scenario for Bitcoin is that it moves away from its halving-based four-year cycle. Bitcoin’s halving is an event that slashes BTC miner reward in half, triggering an imbalance between supply and demand that has previously coincided with rallies. Without a four-year cycle, DonAlt appears to suggest that BTC will witness a steady uptrend without the need to time market tops and avoid brutal bear winters. “This cycle is so chill. Just take it easy. If the market is up? Great you make money. If the market is down? It is what it is, maybe it will go up again. Prior cycles were a constant struggle having to sell tops and bottoms, for this one, I’ve just chosen blissful complacency.” Looking at Bitcoin’s current state, the analyst says it is possible for Bitcoin to recover support at $90,000 before this week expires as BTC continues to bounce after briefly trading below $80,000. “No way they can push it back above $90,000 before the weekly close, right?” Source: DonAlt/X At time of writing, Bitcoin is trading for $86,351, up over 2% on the day.

Many altcoins have produced impressive gains over the past few days, and XLM stands in a league of its own with a surge past $0.3. BTC Calms at $86K A lot can and has been said about the events that transpired in the cryptocurrency market in the past week. Recall that BTC stood close to $100,000 on February 21, which was rejected and pushed down to $96,000 the previous weekend. However, the actual pain started on Tuesday morning with a drop to $86,000. After a minor recovery to $89,000, the cryptocurrency dumped once again to $82,000. The scenario repeated once again on Thursday, with a bounce-off to $86,000, and on Friday morning, with a massive price crash to $78,000. This became bitcoin’s lowest price tag in over three months. While many, including Arthur Hayes, predicted an even more painful performance during the weekend, BTC’s price actually reacted well to the latest massacre and now sits about eight grand higher. Its market capitalization has managed to defend the $1.7 trillion level, while its dominance over the alts stands tall at 58% on CG. BTCUSD. Source: TradingView XLM on a Roll The altcoins were hit the hardest during the days-long correction, but most have recovered some ground since Friday. XRP continues with its gradual ascent and now stands close to $2.3 after another 5% increase since yesterday. ADA has defended the $0.6 support and now trades above $0.65. SOL, BNB, DOGE, LINK, and SIU are also with minor gains, while XLM has soared by 7.5% in the past day and almost 30% since Friday’s low to over $0.32, In contrast, ETH, LTC, and TRX have charted insignificant losses over the past 24 hours. Nevertheless, the total crypto market cap is more than $250 billion higher than the low on Friday. However, it’s still under the $3 trillion mark on CG. Cryptocurrency Market Overview.

Analyzing 2 Altcoins To Buy In This Red Market,https://www.cryptopolitan.com/crypto-rebound-or-new-bull-run-analyzing-2-altcoins-to-buy-in-this-red-market/,"In the past seven days Ethereum (ETH) fell more than 15% in value and dropped below $2,500 because users panicked after Bybit experienced a $1.5 billion security vulnerability. The Wyckoff Accumulation Pattern can potentially create an ETH price recovery to $8,000 if investors are able to maintain ETH above $2,000 according to technical charts. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) continues to ignore market pessimism by securing $2 million in presales from 3,800 investors who bought tokens at $0.015 before awaiting its upcoming price increase. MUTM offers investors protection against market uncertainties through its defined token structure and successful presale operation which leads to an initial 400% value rise at launch and expected growth of up to 66,500% after the listing. Ethereum’s Precarious Position The Ethereum market faces its most substantial price drop of recent times as it sinks below $2,290 because of bearish market conditions. The Bybit exploit caused market fragmentation that rid investors of their confidence while negative MACD signals signaled the prolonged bearish market trend. ETH must pass or fail a vital assessment at the $2,000 support area as this region represents a turning point between recovery and a descent to $1,750. The Wyckoff pattern presents a potential opportunity because historical price accumulation patterns underwent rallies to $8,000 when Ethereum rose above $2,000 support level. Stochastic RSI indicators display the same bearish conditions that preceded previous market rebounds which suggest a forthcoming price recovery. The price targets at $2,500 and $4,250 present formidable obstacles which traders must overcome to confirm their positive market predictions. ETH’s potential revenue stream continues as a transformative risk for investors who must weigh analytical potential against risk factors from security weaknesses and macroeconomic challenges. Mutuum Finance’s Presale Surge Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is leveraging the Ethereum uncertainty to speed up through its second presale phase before the upcoming 33.3% price boost. Earliest purchasers of MUTM fulfillment at $0.015 will enjoy immediate gains when stage two begins at $0.02 before the final listing at $0.06 delivers 300% rewards. The project attracted $2 million from investors through its innovative token buyback system combined with the special lending model which raises long-term market demand. Phase one reached full capacity quickly which triggered a sense of urgency since available tokens numbers are decreasing rapidly. ETH’s volatile nature drives investors to subscribe to MUTM’s presale because of its fixed price allocations and resistant to market speculations. The roadmap for this project includes decentralized lending pools and peer-to-peer loan negotiations that give practical functionality not found in meme-based competitors. Engineered Scarcity and Demand The Mutuum Finance ecosystem enables a buy pressure system which operates independently. Platform fee transactions automatically support MUTM token purchases on open markets which distribute the purchased tokens to both stakers and liquidity providers. The loop executes supply reduction while simultaneously giving rewards that enhance user participation into a cycle which may support price appreciation during the launch phase. The mtTokens protocol establishes additional value through a process allowing users to exchange assets including ETH to generate mtETH that grows in value during duration and can circulate on multiple DeFi platforms. MUTM merges two functional benefits by generating returns and providing ongoing liquidity thus linking the passive investment world to active market trading. Timing the Entry Buyers can enter the market at its lowest price of $0.015 throughout the presale phase and before exchange listings take place. Following its launch the project plans to reach a price of $10 in 2025 which will deliver a remarkable 66,500% return for investors. In order to reach $8,000 after this bull market Ethereum would need to increase by a staggering 350% but MUTM requires only an 8,000% surge starting from its current $0.015 price. Mutuum Finance secures overcollateralized loans and conducts a $100,000 giveaway promotion that protects investors who wish to enter with caution while seeking stability. Phase two will approach maximum capacity soon which means the chance to purchase tokens at their initial starting price will soon end. While Ethereum’s technical signals hint at recovery, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) offers a concrete growth blueprint immune to market sentiment. Its presale structure guarantees early backers a minimum 400% profit, while post-launch mechanisms aim for exponential returns.

Immutable X and Quant have established themselves in NFT gaming and enterprise blockchain solutions, but Qubetics is shaking up the space with its high-speed, interoperable ecosystem. The Qubetics presale is closing in on its next stage, triggering a 10% price jump, making it a top crypto to join for 2025. But how does it compare to the competition? Let’s dig in. Qubetics: The Future of Web3 Interoperability The blockchain world is fragmented. Most networks operate in isolation, limiting the seamless transfer of assets, data, and applications. Qubetics changes the game by introducing a powerful Layer 1 blockchain that unites top ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot under one roof. Think of it as the universal translator of blockchain technology. Instead of struggling with bridges and cross-chain swaps, Qubetics users enjoy instant transactions across networks. Now, imagine a freelancer working for multiple companies that pay in different cryptocurrencies. With Qubetics, they won’t need multiple wallets or complex swaps—funds move across chains in real-time, ensuring they always get paid in the token they prefer. Businesses can also use Qubetics to settle payments internationally without relying on traditional banking rails. This level of efficiency is why analysts are calling it the “Swiss Army knife” of blockchain transactions. Qubetics also leverages a tokenized marketplace, allowing users to trade assets, stake tokens, and engage in DeFi applications without the usual friction. The upcoming mainnet launch in Q2 2025 is set to unlock even more utilities, making Qubetics one of the top cryptos to join for 2025 . Qubetics Wallet & Certik Audit: Unmatched Security Security has always been a major concern in crypto, and Qubetics is proactively addressing it. The Qubetics Wallet offers a secure, multi-chain asset management experience, giving users full control over their crypto without relying on centralized exchanges. To further reinforce trust and credibility, Qubetics is undergoing a comprehensive security audit by CertiK, the leading blockchain security firm that has audited top projects like Binance, Polygon, Terra, Aave, and PancakeSwap. CertiK’s audit is expected to strengthen Qubetics’ security architecture, ensuring safe transactions, smart contract integrity, and robust asset protection. With billions of dollars in digital assets already safeguarded by CertiK’s technology, this audit puts Qubetics in an elite category of secure blockchain projects—a huge confidence boost for its growing community of over 21,700 token holders. With its wallet security and CertiK-backed credibility, Qubetics is easily one of the top cryptos to join for 2025 before its mainnet launch. Qubetics Presale: Why Investors Are Rushing In The Qubetics presale is on fire, with Stage 23 already in full swing and over $14.3 million raised so far. With more than 21,700 token holders and a whopping 492 million $TICS tokens sold, the momentum is building fast. The current presale price stands at $0.0888, but here’s the catch—each presale stage lasts only 7 days, and prices increase by 10% every Sunday at 12 AM. This means those who get in early secure the best possible entry point before the token skyrockets post-listing. Analysts have crunched the numbers, and the potential gains are staggering. At the end of the presale, $TICS is expected to hit $0.25, translating to a 181.52% ROI. But the real fireworks start after the mainnet launch, where projections show $TICS hitting $1 for a 1,026.09% return, $5 for a 5,530.44% gain, and a jaw-dropping 16,791.32% ROI if it reaches $15. A $1,000 investment today at $0.0888 could turn into $168,000 if the price hits $15 post-mainnet. With such explosive potential, it’s no wonder that Qubetics is quickly becoming the most sought-after crypto presale of 2025! Immutable X: The Powerhouse of NFT Gaming While Qubetics focuses on interoperability, Immutable X is revolutionizing NFT gaming. The Ethereum Layer 2 solution eliminates gas fees while maintaining full security and decentralization. It’s a game-changer (literally) for developers who want to create high-performance blockchain games without frustrating costs for players. Titles like Gods Unchained, Illuvium, and Guild of Guardians have already adopted Immutable X, proving that the platform is a top choice for Web3 gaming. With mainstream gaming companies showing more interest in NFTs, Immutable X is positioned for long-term growth. However, its focus is limited to gaming, whereas Qubetics offers a broader application across industries. Quant: The Institutional Blockchain Solution Quant takes a different approach to blockchain by targeting enterprise adoption. Its Overledger technology allows businesses and governments to integrate blockchain without replacing existing infrastructure. This makes it appealing for financial institutions, supply chains, and even central banks experimenting with CBDCs. One of the biggest advantages of Quant is its partnerships. The project has secured collaborations with major institutions, proving that traditional finance sees blockchain as the future. However, Quant’s enterprise-focused model means it’s less accessible for everyday investors looking to engage in DeFi or Web3 applications. Final Verdict: Which Crypto Offers the Best Upside? Immutable X is dominating NFT gaming, and Quant is bringing blockchain to enterprises, but Qubetics is bridging the entire crypto world with its high-speed interoperability, decentralized payments, and tokenized marketplace, making it the best crypto presale to invest in now. With the Qubetics presale nearing its next stage and a 10% price jump on the horizon, it’s shaping up to be one of the top cryptos to join for 2025. If you’re looking to maximize gains, join the Qubetics presale now before the next price hike kicks in. With analysts predicting massive ROI potential, early investors could be in for a wild (and profitable) ride.

Its presale structure, with scheduled price increases every week, has fueled investor demand, making it one of the most promising crypto projects for 2025. 2. How does Qubetics compare to Immutable X and Quant? While Immutable X excels in NFT scaling and Quant enables seamless cross-chain transactions, Qubetics takes a broader approach by aggregating entire blockchain networks for enhanced interoperability, privacy, and real-world adoption.

According to his post on the social media website Bluesky, Cuban offered words of support and hinted that he could be open to helping them. His message, which has since become a talking point among users on and outside the platform, urged the displaced tech engineers and designers to turn their situation around. He also offered to help or invest in any venture that they may have in the future. “If you worked for 18F and got fired, Group together to start a consulting company,” wrote Cuban. “It’s just a matter of time before DOGE needs you to fix the mess they inevitably created. They will have to hire your company as a contractor to fix it. But on your terms. I’m happy to invest and/or help,” Cuban said. Mark Cuban wants to help affected federal tech workers Mark Cuban’s offer to help is coming from the decision of the federal government’s General Services Administration (GSA) to abruptly cut its 18F technology unit. Until the layoffs yesterday, the technology unit was responsible for building, buying, and sharing technology products for other government agencies. If you worked for 18F and got fired, Group together to start a consulting company. It’s just a matter of time before DOGE needs you to fix the mess they inevitably create. They will have to hire your company as a contractor to fix it. But on your terms. I’m happy to invest and/or help — Mark Cuban ( @mcuban.bsky.social ) March 2, 2025 at 3:34 AM According to a Politico report, the layoffs affected about 70 employees, who received the news around 1 AM Eastern time on Saturday. The report noted that it was part of the moves of the Trump administration to cut the federal workforce, reducing government spending. Laying off federal workers is in line with the directive that United States President Donald Trump has given to the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E). A GSA manager who spoke anonymously highlighted that the employees affected included user interface engineers, researchers, content and service engineers, and procurement specialists. The 18F department was involved in the creation of key government services like Login.gov, a central login system that houses programs like Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. According to the report, the cut will touch several agencies, noting that a ripple effect should be expected across the government. Cuban’s proposal and the community reaction This is the second time since the beginning of 2025 that the 18F has suffered cuts, with about 24 employees laid off in February when the GSA let probationary staff go, according to Politico. The workers impacted in this round of cut-offs also received the “What did you do last week? Part II” text from the D.O.G.E department. Politico highlighted that the emails, which required users to list their accomplishments for the week, were widely sent out to several agencies. However, the new opportunity being offered to the laid-off workers by Cuban presents a great chance for them to reshape the future of civic tech on their terms. While the D.O.G.E team has been swiftly working across the board, Elon Musk has noted the fallout tied to the speed with which his team has been moving. For example, with USAID, one of the things we accidentally canceled — very briefly — was Ebola prevention,” Musk said. The big question now is if a small or big percentage of the displaced workers can band together to build a startup that may one day be required to help the government. If this happens, it could be a huge blow to the Trump administration as the efforts to continually shrink the federal workforce remain ongoing. With Cuban already promising to help, it is only a matter of time before the potential company becomes a much-needed firm that the government may need in the future. Meanwhile, users on Bluesky have waded into Cuban’s offer, with most of them discussing the pros and cons of the offer. For instance, a user mentioned that he could fund a startup for them and name it 18FU, after the department that they were fired from. A user called the choice to “sell back services to the government” stupid, while another highlighted that anything they would do would be on their terms and not on Cuban’s terms.

If Trump really wants the entire crypto market to go back up then he should tell the SEC to immediately withdraw the $XRP case — XRPcryptowolf (@XRPcryptowolf) February 28, 2025 The crypto market has struggled recently , and the bearish trend pushed Bitcoin below $80,000 for the first time in 2025. on the other hand, the SEC has recently dismissed multiple lawsuits and investigations against cryptocurrency companies, signaling a shift in its approach to regulation. However, these have not helped the market recover. XRPcryptowolf suggests that dismissing the Ripple lawsuit, arguably the most high-profile case in the crypto space, could kickstart that recovery, and he is calling on Trump, the first-ever pro-crypto president to make the call. His comments reflect a broader sentiment within the cryptocurrency community that regulatory clarity and supportive policies are pivotal for market growth. The Shift in the SEC’s Enforcement Strategy The SEC has recently shifted its enforcement approach under the new administration. Notably, the agency concluded its investigation into Uniswap Labs without pursuing enforcement action, signaling a potential change in its stance toward decentralized finance platforms. Similarly, the SEC dropped its investigation into Gemini , further indicating a possible softening of its regulatory posture. These developments have ignited optimism among XRP supporters regarding the potential dismissal of the SEC’s case against Ripple. Former SEC official John Reed Stark highlighted the lawsuit dismissals as signs that the agency might withdraw its appeal in the Ripple lawsuit, suggesting a broader reevaluation of its crypto enforcement strategy. We are on twitter, follow us to connect with us :- @TimesTabloid1 — TimesTabloid (@TimesTabloid1) July 15, 2023 Such a move could have profound implications for XRP and the wider cryptocurrency market, potentially paving the way for increased adoption and investment. Will Trump Influence the Lawsuit? Trump’s return to the presidency cemented the SEC’s shift toward a pro-crypto stance. Trump has already appointed pro-crypto officials to the SEC, and he could cement his legacy as the most influential president in the crypto space by calling for the dismissal of the Ripple lawsuit. Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse has met with Trump multiple times since his election victory in November, and his actions to bolster the crypto market suggest that he understands the advantages of digital assets and the major role cryptocurrencies like XRP can play in global finance. While Trump has not publicly called for the SEC to drop the Ripple lawsuit, his pro-crypto stance and ties with Ripple and its executives have given many community members hope that the president can save Ripple from the war on crypto.

This rise follows a period of market downturn, with renewed optimism surrounding Ripple’s ongoing legal battle and large investors accumulating substantial amounts of the cryptocurrency. Legal Developments Fueling Optimism The long-standing legal dispute between Ripple and regulators has been a key factor in XRP’s price movements. Since the case was filed, uncertainty surrounding XRP’s status as a security has led to fluctuations in its value. However, recent regulatory shifts have led to speculation that the case could either be dismissed or settled under favorable terms. With regulators easing enforcement actions against several high-profile firms in the industry, sentiment is shifting towards a potential resolution. This shift has played a significant role in driving XRP’s price higher, as traders anticipate a clearer regulatory framework that could benefit the token’s long-term adoption. Whale Accumulation Signals Confidence Large investors, commonly referred to as “whales,” have been actively accumulating XRP during recent price dips. On-chain data suggests that wallets holding between 1 million and 100 million XRP have added hundreds of millions of tokens to their holdings in a short period. Whale accumulation is often seen as a bullish signal, as these investors typically have a long-term perspective and access to information that may not yet be widely reflected in the market. Their increased holdings suggest they expect a strong recovery and potentially further gains in XRP’s price. Technical Indicators Suggest Further Upside From a technical standpoint, XRP is showing signs of a recovery pattern. The price is approaching a critical resistance zone, where multiple moving averages are converging. If the token can break above this level, it could trigger further upward momentum, potentially retesting recent highs. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has also rebounded from oversold conditions, indicating growing buying pressure. A continuation of this trend could lead to an extended rally, with price targets set higher if key resistance levels are surpassed. What’s Next for XRP? XRP’s recent surge highlights the impact of both regulatory developments and market sentiment on its price. If the legal uncertainty surrounding Ripple is resolved positively, the token could see sustained growth. However, traders should remain cautious, as broader market conditions and external factors could still influence price movements. While technical indicators support a potential continuation of the uptrend, volatility remains a key factor to watch in the coming weeks.",Crypto News Today|Crypto Intelligence,EN,0,0,TRADING|XRP|REGULATION|MARKET|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'CryptoIntelligence', 'img': 'https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/95/default.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",cryptointelligence,2025-03-02 09:21:00

Since the premier cryptocurrency lost its hold above $90,000, investors have wondered whether the ongoing correction is a “buy the dip” opportunity or the market top is in. While there is no surefire way to put these doubts away, on-chain data can provide relevant insights into what is to come. The latest on-chain data suggests the highlighted level below is the one to watch before investors return to the market. Level To Watch Before ‘Buying The Dip’ In a recent post on the X platform, crypto analyst Maartunn shared that it might not be technically secure to reenter the Bitcoin market at the current price. This analysis is based on the movement of the Bitcoin price relative to the current value of the short-term holders’ (STH) average cost basis. Related Reading: Litecoin Price Shows Resilience In Uncertain Market Conditions — What’s Next For LTC? The STH average cost basis metric estimates the average price at which short-term holders (investors who have owned Bitcoin for less than 155 days) acquired their coins. It represents a psychological level for BTC investors and could act as a reference point for price analysis, especially during bull cycles. Bitcoin usually trades above the short-term holders’ average cost basis during bull markets, signaling substantial buying pressure and optimistic sentiment from short-term investors. On the flip side, when the price of BTC falls beneath this cost basis — as seen in the ongoing correction, it implies that short-term investors are at a loss, which could lead to a sell-off and precipitate significant bearish pressure. According to data from CryptoQuant, the Bitcoin price is currently 6% below the short-term holders’ average cost basis at $90,950. With the flagship cryptocurrency beneath the realized price of short-term holders, the odds are that BTC price could face further selling pressure as the investor cohort looks to minimize their loss. Using this logic, Maartunn noted that investors might want to wait till the price of Bitcoin climbs above the STH average cost price before reentering the market. Interestingly, the short-term investors appear to still be loading their bags. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez revealed in a post on X that short-term holders have purchased more than 35,000 BTC in the past 4 days. Bitcoin Price At A Glance As of this writing, the price of BTC sits just below the $86,000 mark, reflecting an over 2% jump in the past 24 hours.

But which ones truly stand out? While Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is making waves with its presale and deflationary token burns, ANDY and Apu Apustaja have also captured attention with their latest developments. With Arctic Pablo now in its 12th presale phase at Penguinopolis, the excitement is at an all-time high. Meanwhile, ANDY and Apu Apustaja continue to make moves in the meme coin space. This article will cover the latest updates and opportunities surrounding these three coins. Arctic Pablo Coin’s Deflationary Model: Token Burns & Rising Demand One of the most thrilling aspects of Arctic Pablo Coin ($APC) is its deflationary model. By burning unsold tokens weekly during the presale, Arctic Pablo ensures that scarcity increases, driving value for early investors. Additionally, all remaining tokens after the presale will be burned, making this a rare opportunity to grab APC before supply tightens even further. Built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Arctic Pablo’s transparent burn mechanism is fully recorded on the blockchain, providing security and confidence for investors. With a current presale price of just $0.000067 and an anticipated launch price of $0.008, the potential return on investment (ROI) exceeds a staggering 11,844.78%. Early adopters could see exponential gains once Arctic Pablo hits the market. Penguinopolis Presale: Arctic Pablo’s 12th Phase Brings Unmatched Potential Arctic Pablo’s meme coin presale journey has been nothing short of legendary. Having completed expeditions through nine locations in under a month, it has now reached Penguinopolis—the 12th presale phase. This means the current price of $0.000067 won’t last long. With over $1.64 million already raised, Arctic Pablo is rapidly approaching its next milestone. Unlike traditional presales with stages, Arctic Pablo takes a unique approach by dividing its sale into locations, mirroring the character’s adventurous travels. As new locations are unlocked, the price rises. That means investors who enter now at Penguinopolis are securing APC at its lowest possible price before the final presale phase ends. With the launch price set at $0.008, those who jump in today stand to gain significantly. As the project progresses and new locations unlock, the entry price will only get higher. Now is the time to claim your share of Arctic Pablo before the next price increase. ANDY’s Latest Move: What Investors Need to Know ANDY has been making waves in the meme coin market, attracting traders with its unexpected surge in price and growing adoption. Recently, ANDY experienced a major listing on a top-tier exchange, increasing its accessibility and liquidity. This new development has fueled investor interest, with many speculating on further price gains as trading volume grows. With meme coins often seeing explosive rallies, ANDY is one to watch. Apu Apustaja Rides the Meme Wave: Community Growth & More Apu Apustaja continues to build a strong presence in the meme coin space, drawing in a vibrant community. The coin recently launched new staking features, allowing holders to earn passive rewards while supporting the ecosystem. This move has led to increased engagement, with more investors jumping in to stake their holdings.

According to QuantEdgeB, Bitcoin’s Sentival indicator hit a value of -4 standard deviations (SD) on Feb. 25, indicating oversold conditions. Although Bitcoin’s price has continued to fall in recent days, Sentival has begun to rise. This divergence suggests that downward momentum may be weakening and a potential reversal may be underway. Bitcoin has rallied towards the $85,000 level and Sentival is currently approaching -1SD. Analysts at QuantEdgeB suggest that if Sentival reaches its fair value, a sharper upward move could ensue, potentially accelerating Bitcoin’s recovery. Related News: Vitalik Buterin Announces Support for Surprise Altcoin Proponent While recent data suggests that the worst of Bitcoin’s recent downtrend may be over, analysts warn that confirmation is still needed. Market participants should closely monitor the $85,000 level and Sentival’s movement for further confirmation of the bullish trend, the firm said.

Speaking at ETHDenver on February 28, Long emphasized that while some perceive a regulatory shift, federal banking agencies have not rescinded their anti-crypto stance. Regulatory Stagnation in Crypto Banking “It is still presumed unsafe and unsound for a bank to touch a digital asset even in a de minimis amount,” Long remarked, asserting that the regulatory framework remains restrictive despite changing political leadership. She believes that this resistance will eventually fade but noted that the Trump administration has not yet introduced any concrete reforms to address these concerns. A key part of Long’s critique focused on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which she argued has resisted technological progress under the leadership of former Chair Martin Gruenberg. Gruenberg, who was replaced by Acting Chair Travis Hill on January 20, has been linked to “Operation Chokepoint 2.0,” a rumored initiative that sought to cut off banking access for crypto firms. Long stressed the need for a new, reform-oriented FDIC chair to ensure that U.S. banking regulations evolve with technological advancements. SEC’s Shift in Stance and Stablecoin Concerns While Long expressed frustration with the slow-moving banking regulations, she acknowledged that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has significantly shifted its stance on crypto policy. A day after President Trump’s inauguration on January 20, the SEC established a Crypto Task Force led by Commissioner Hester Peirce, signaling a more open approach to digital assets. One of the most notable regulatory reversals was the SEC’s cancellation of Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121)—a controversial rule that required financial firms to record crypto holdings as liabilities on their balance sheets. The rule had been widely criticized for discouraging institutional adoption of digital assets, and its removal marks a significant shift in policy. Beyond banking and regulatory concerns, Long also highlighted the need for stablecoin legislation that enforces stronger consumer protections. She pointed out that many U.S. banks hold as little as 8 cents in cash for every dollar of demand deposits, making them vulnerable to bank runs. The collapse of Silvergate Bank , a crypto-friendly financial institution, serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with poor liquidity management. To safeguard consumers, Long argues that stablecoin issuers must hold full cash reserves to back their liabilities, preventing systemic risks in the financial system.

41049201,https://invezz.com/?p=2595408,1740909600,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/69/default.png,Mutuum Finance (MUTM) token predicted to break the $1 barrier with impressive momentum,https://invezz.com/news/2025/03/02/mutuum-finance-mutm-token-predicted-to-break-the-1-barrier-with-impressive-momentum/,"Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is making significant strides in its presale, fueled by growing investor enthusiasm for its dual ending model and demand-centric tokenomics. Currently at $0.015 during the second presale phase, the project has already amassed $1.8 million from over 3,400 holders. The price per token is set for a 33.3% increase to $0.02 in phase 3, meaning investors have a rapidly closing window to buy at the current price. With plans to list at $0.06 and long-term price forecasts reaching up to $8.50, early adopters are positioning themselves for potential returns exceeding 300%, both at launch and as the ecosystem scales. Mutuum presale momentum Investors are rapidly embracing the momentum behind Mutuum Finance as its structured presale format drives significant demand. Now in its second phase, the initiative is fostering a sense of urgency among participants aiming to secure tokens at a competitive, introductory price point. The first phase concluded with overwhelming support, attracting participants eager to leverage the project’s blend of decentralized lending solutions and tokenomics engineered to sustain buy-side pressure. Each presale stage introduces incremental price increases, intensifying the rush to participate before the next adjustment. At $0.015, this phase presents a fleeting opportunity for investors to optimize pre-launch returns, with the upcoming move to $0.02 signaling a sharp 33.3% value uptick for those acting quickly. The $100,000 giveaway from Mutuum Finance serves as a powerful catalyst that boosts momentum while encouraging initial contributions. A group of ten participants each stands to receive $10,000 which serves to further energize their involvement. Through its revenue redistribution model, which directs fees to purchase MUTM tokens, the platform maintains demand while simultaneously deterring sell-offs. Within decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, such mechanics remain rare because speculative tokens typically do not possess real-world applications. Each transaction strengthens the token’s scarcity which connects platform activity directly to its market value. Tokenomics frame a clear path to profitability Mutuum Finance (MUTM) sets itself apart from conventional presale ventures with a thoughtfully designed token distribution strategy. The allocation of the total supply gives precedence to liquidity mining, staking rewards, and fostering strategic partnerships. With a listing price of $0.06, phase two investors stand to gain a 4x return, though projections for the secondary market indicate significantly higher potential. Analysts forecast a rise to $8.50 by 2025, fueled by the platform’s growing user base and the adoption of mtTokens. Lending model catalyzes long-term demand Mutuum Finance’s expansion approach hinges on its P2P lending system which facilitates direct asset negotiations for items outside conventional pools including meme coins such as Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. The adaptability of the system increases user interest and transaction variety. The buy-and-distribute mechanism directs platform fees into scheduled MUTM purchases which then reallocates tokens to mtToken stakers. Demand escalates through this cycle while stakeholder incentives synchronize with platform success factors. The ripple effect is undeniable. The frequency of buybacks increases alongside adoption rates, which generates price pressures that operate independently from market volatility factors. Initial presale discounts merge with staking rewards to give early investors double benefits while the token’s governance and fee utility increases its essential role within the ecosystem. Mutuum Finance tackles typical DeFi project risks through reputable firm security audits and its upcoming overcollateralized stablecoin. Mutuum Finance (MUTM) transforms decentralized finance by integrating practical lending mechanisms with autonomous token economic systems. The presale price point currently stands at $0.15 presents a unique investment opportunity before its upward trajectory begins, phase two progresses quickly and postponements threaten access to the most lucrative profit phases. The opportunity to achieve 400% pre-launch profits diminishes as exchange listings approach and forecasts become definite. Investors seeking utility-based assets over speculative ones find MUTM to be an unparalleled opportunity. Immediate action is required; any delay might result in losing a strategic opportunity within DeFi’s upcoming foundational element.

33767162,[object Object],1740909601,https://resources.cryptocompare.com/news/13/33767162.jpeg,"Bitcoin’s Strongest Support Now At $83,440 – Will It Hold?",https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-strongest-support-now-at-83440-willit-hold/,"Following a price crash to below $80,000 last week, Bitcoin has experienced some market recovery over the past 48 hours, rising by over 7.5% to trade above $86,000. Amid this market rebound, crypto market expert Ali Martinez has spotted the most critical support level for the premier cryptocurrency at the moment. Bitcoin Faces ‘Air Gap’ Below $83K – A Breakdown Could Be Brutal In an X post on Saturday, Martinez shared a puzzling insight on the Bitcoin market. Using the UTXO Realized Price Distribution (URPD) metric partitioned at all-time highs, the analyst has identified $83,440 as the most vital Bitcoin support zone. Generally, the URPD is an on-chain metric that shows the price levels at which unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) last moved, thereby measuring how much Bitcoin was transacted at different price levels. Each bar on the URPD chart represents a price range, and the height of the bar indicates the number of BTC transacted at that level. Therefore, the URPD can be used to identify potential support and resistance levels as it would show if a significant amount of BTC was acquired or sold at a specific price level. According to Martinez’s analysis, URPD data from Glassnode shows that investors acquired 171,693 BTC (0.87% of total supply) at $83,440.72, converting this price level into a strong support zone. This is because bitcoin bulls are likely to step in and acquire more BTC at this level in any case of a retest. However, there is a notable air gap between $72,000 – $82,000 with low levels of UTXO recorded in this price range. Thus, a decisive fall below $83,440 will result in a further price decline due to the lack of demand in the immediate lower price ranges. Bitcoin RSI Backs Rebound Quest – More Gains Ahead? In another analysis post on the BTC market, Martinez has hinted at the potential for further price gains amidst the ongoing price recovery. According to the crypto expert, Bitcoin has historically recorded a price rebound after its Relative Strength Index( RSI) went below 30. The RSI measures the momentum of price movements and determines if an asset is overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30). Martinez states that Bitcoin’s RSI has recently touched 24 in the oversold zone suggesting a rebound to reclaim previous high price levels may occur according to historical data. At press time, Bitcoin trades at $86,383 after rising by 2.32% in the past 24 hours. Following the price correction in the past week, BTC remains at 21.02% off from its all-time at $109,114.",Bitcoin|Ali Martinez|Bitcoin Rebound|Bitcoin RSI|Bitcoin support|Bitcoin UTXO|btcusd|BTCUSDT,EN,0,0,INJ|ETH|ASIA|ALTCOIN|HNT|MARKET|SHIB|BNB|EXCHANGE|BTC|REGULATION|TRADING|OTHER|DOGE|SOL|BLOCKCHAIN|XRP|TON|BUSINESS|FIAT|BONK|PYUSD|COMMODITY|ADA|ZRX|MINING|FTT|DOT|USDT|RESEARCH|FORKS|IMX|ICP|TRX|TECHNOLOGY|ARB|WLD|SPONSORED|RAY|SUI|PEPE|WALLET|UNI|XMR|LINK|NEAR|SEI|MATIC|ARKM|USDC|LTC|LUNA|AIRDROP|BTG|MX|TOKEN SALE|BSV|FLOKI|TOKEN LISTING AND DELISTING|BITTENSOR|HBAR|CRO|WIF|ZEC|MEME|MOG|APE|JUP|AAVE|ONDO|XTZ|BGB|LUNC|XLM|APT|ZK|MANA|AR|AGX|FET|AXS|ADMINISTRATIVE EVENTS|XDC|BCH|MNT|FIL|AVAX|LDO|SSV|ETHFI|ETC|RUNE|FDUSD,"{'name': 'Bitcoinist', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/bitcoinist.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",bitcoinist,2025-03-02 10:00:01

These rumors started doing the rounds on social media almost immediately after the Bybit hack. Speculations suggested that large crypto firms, including Binance, caused the recent market sell-off by aggressively selling and reducing the size of their holdings. They are misunderstanding what Binance does as an exchange, which is we simply help users match trades – Binance Binance’s clarification could be one of the reasons we’ve seen the market recover over the weekend. There are still reasons to worry about potential liquidation, though, especially given the upcoming influx of Solana tokens from the FTX hack. Over 15M $SOL worth $2.5B are about to flood the market. Still, expert analysis suggests that the coming week could see more buying pressure, as $BTC takes support on the 200 EMA. Combined with the long-term perspective being bullish, it could be worth investing in promising new presales that are showing a lot of investor interest. 1. Solaxy ($SOLX) – Solana Altcoin Capable of Boosting the Network’s Appeal Solana has undoubtedly been one of the most talked-about blockchains in the last year thanks to its memecoin-friendly infrastructure. It’s both fast and cheap, which has led to an increase in the number of meme coins on the network. Notable ones include $TRUMP, $BONK, and $MELANIA. However, Solana’s rise to fame has birthed operational difficulties. The network stands overwhelmed by the sheer amount of transaction requests. This flooding of new investors on Solana has led to congestion and scalability issues, and transactions are failing to go through. This is where Solaxy ($SOLX) comes in. Designed to be the first-ever Layer 2 solution on Solana, Solaxy will process transactions away from the network’s mainnet, reducing the burden on Solana. Additionally, since $SOLX will carry out multiple transactions simultaneously, i.e., bulk processing, it will result in a reduction of the costs investors have to pay to go through with their transactions. All in all, $SOLX isn’t just all fun and games. It’s a token with real utility, which is why it’s being considered the next 100x crypto . You can join Solana’s Solaxy-fueled growth by investing in the $SOLX presale. It has already raised over $24.5M, and each token is currently available for just $0.00165. Here’s how to buy it . 2. BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) – Support Bitcoin’s Growth and Become a Crypto Millionaire Yourself Similar to how Solaxy could benefit from Solana’s growth, BTC Bull Token ($BTCBULL) is also designed in a way that it will bask in the success of a top cryptocurrency – Bitcoin. That said, BTC Bull Token has enough tricks up its sleeves that differentiate it from just about every other meme coin on the market. For starters, it’s the only one that will distribute free $BTC among token holders. $BTC airdrops will take place every time Bitcoin reaches a new milestone figure, such as $150K, $200K, and $250K. Even better, the airdrops will be automatic, meaning you won’t have to manually request them, as is the case with other projects. Just make sure you keep your $BTCBULL tokens in Best Wallet. Additionally, the project has reserved a staggering 40% of the total token supply for marketing the token after its launch. This will draw more eyeballs to it, which, combined with its deflationary model, could skyrocket the token’s price. Early investors, including those who get in now, stand to make the most of BTC Bull Token ’s success. Join now for just $0.00239 per token. 3. Best Wallet Token ($BEST) – Native Crypto of the Best Crypto Wallet With crypto adoption on the rise, the need for better security while storing and sending/receiving crypto has never been higher. Enter Best Wallet . As one of the best crypto wallets , Best Wallet is not only highly secure but also super easy to use. For instance, by providing seamless access to over 60 chains, Best Wallet makes it possible to manage your entire portfolio from one place. Speaking of its security, Best Wallet gives you complete control over your secret passkey. This means none other than you will be able to access your stored crypto. It also comes with advanced cryptographic techniques and 2FA/MFA, as well as third-party crypto insurance. All in all, Best Wallet is destined for greatness. It has already amassed over 500K users and is well on its way to capturing over 40% of the non-custodial wallet market by 2026. Like how you buy a company’s stock to invest in its growth, you can invest in $BEST to rally behind the wallet’s growth. $BEST is Best Wallet’s native cryptocurrency, after all. Additionally, $BEST token holders will benefit from exclusive perks within the Best Wallet ecosystem. These include higher staking rewards, lower transaction fees, and the earliest access to the best new cryptos . You can get 1 $BEST for just $0.024175 if you get in now. Overall, the $BEST presale has so far raised over $10.6M. 4. Rexas Finance ($RXS) – Unique Crypto Project Set to Increase Crypto’s Popularity Rexas Finance is another crypto presale right in the sweet spot to benefit from increasing crypto popularity. With more and more investors looking at crypto as the next big thing, the demand for real asset tokenization is only going to soar higher. And that’s exactly what $RXS is meant for. From gold and art to commodities and even real estate, Rexas Finance will provide holders with the ability to tokenize tangible assets. This one-of-a-kind crypto project will, therefore, leverage the power of blockchain tech to make investing more transparent, inclusive, and efficient. The $RXS presale has sold over 454M tokens at the time of writing, garnering around $47M. Note that it’s nearing its end, so interested investors should hurry up and grab it while it’s available for a low price of $0.20. Conclusion Having pointed you towards the most promising new cryptos, we’d also like to mention that although the larger crypto market is expected to soar higher sooner or later, the ever-present volatility could mean you see some short-term red in your portfolio. So, make sure you’re mentally prepared to stick with your investments for several months. Additionally, it’d be wise to only invest an amount you’re comfortable losing. Last but not least, the above article isn’t a substitute for financial advice from a certified professional, so please do your own research before becoming a crypto investor.",Cryptocurrency Market News,EN,0,0,SOL|EXCHANGE|BTC|BNB|BUSINESS,"{'name': 'NewsBTC', 'img': 'https://images.cryptocompare.com/news/default/newsbtc.png', 'lang': 'EN'}",newsbtc,2025-03-02 10:09:23
